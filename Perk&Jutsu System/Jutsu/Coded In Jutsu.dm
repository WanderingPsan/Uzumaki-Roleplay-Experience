While in control of the body, the user is able to communicate with the target. Since the user is in another body, they are also able to use that body's chakra. It is also possible for the user to switch bodies with the target. This has great strategic value when used on a team-mate as neither body is left incapacitated and they may also make use of the user's abilities as well as their own while doing this. To remain inconspicuous when spying, the user can perform this technique on an animal, such as a hawk, which they can use to do aerial reconnaissance. It is generally used on immobilised targets. Conversely however, the user's original body is left defenceless while this technique is active, leaving it susceptible to attack until they return. The mind transfer moves slowly in a straight direction and takes some time to return to the user's body if it misses. Similarly, if the opponent's will is strong enough, they can force the user from their body. Also, if the user's chakra level is low, the technique will be harder to maintain. Furthermore, should any physical injury befall the victim's body while the mind link is active, it would cause the user's body to also receive those same injuries.

Consequently, the user will gain full control of the opponent's body, while the victim's mind remains trapped within the immobile puppet.

Due to the properties of this technique, the expelled blasts are capable of piercing into and potentially through an opponent's flesh when they collide, in a similar manner to how bullets function."

				description = "This technique is a pinpoint slashing strike, where the user emits chakra from their fingertips and materialises it into an near invisible weapon that assaults the enemy in a gust of wind. If the Sickle Weasel Technique can be regarded as a swarm of wind kunai, then this technique is akin to an unavoidable longsword which can leave the target's body mutilated. The wind blades can be created and thrown, like projectiles, in rapid succession."

The power of this technique can be dramatically enhanced when utilised in conjunction with the effects of extreme suction, such as that generated by Baku, where the augmented attack proved effective enough to even slice through the Defenses of a complete Susanoo."

				description = "The user takes a deep breath and spins while exhaling, compressing the released air into a solitary blade of wind that covers a substantial area around the user, due to their circular motion. The resulting sharpened blast is large enough to slice through multiple targets located a significant distance from the user, causing grievous injuries to those hit."

Because it is a shadow clone, it is able to perform techniques and interact with the environment due to it having physical substance; and also evenly distributes the user's chakra to each clone. If the clone is injured, it will revert to its natural wind-state, at the same time pushing whatever it is touching. This clone is at half power for all stats of its creator, except when using water ninjutsu which allows them to be at full Control stat.<br><br>(Max Clones Permitted: Control Stat)<br>(Must use the jutsu the jutsu for as many clones created. I.e. 4 clones = 4 uses)<br>(All jutsu used by the clones drains the user as well)"
