<b>Summons Rulings:</b><br><br>

Giving Process:<br>
Must be C- rank.<br>
Need C-Rank mastered before B-Rank summoning can be attained.<br>
Need 2 B-Ranks mastered before A-Rank can be attained.<br>
Need 2 A-Ranks mastered before Sage Mode can be trained for.<br>
Then roll for imperfect / perfect sage mode.<br>
1-3 = Imperfect<br>
4-6 = Perfect<br><br>

1) C-Rank summons generally range between 3-5 in terms of statistics. They are usually untrained animals and are unable to utilize chakra or jutsu. <br>
B-Rank Summons generally range between 7-16 in terms of statistics. Larger ones will near 16, but will cost more chakra. B-Rank Summons are ultimately the most costly. Those with 16 in stats are usually in strength and durability, referencing their size and their mass.<br>
A-Rank Summons are more talented summons that are skilled in their jutsus. <br><br>

2) If provided icons, admin will put it into the game for you to summon for visual reference.<br><br>

3) In personal summons, we take into consideration their jutsu as well as the general strength of the Kuchiyose in question. Personal Summons are highly customizable and therefore they may vary in terms of their strength and their statistics. <br><br>

4) Kuchiyose does not have a default value of 250 mainly because of differences in Kuchiyose. While C-Rank does constitute mainly reconnaissance animals, animals such as elephants, rhinos, tigers, or larger-scale predators are not easily used as reconnaissance animals because they lack inconspicuity. Therefore, they cost a bit more as they are able to fight. <br><br>

<b>Lycanthropes:</b><br>
This is a substitute for Sage Mode. Once you select lycanthropy, you cannot go for Sage Mode.(If you choose lycanthropic on set up as a 'summoner spec' you receive lycanthropic for free with a buff as a C rank lycan)<br>
This is basically a Sage Mode that starts off weak but has the same potential as Sage Mode.<br>
However, Sage Mode will ultimately be stronger. Lyncathropes are forced to take on the quality of their animals.<br><br>

EX: If a snake summoner went the lycanthropic route over the Sage Mode route, they would have to select a specific snake to imitate. Their body will resemble a snake far more than if using Sage Mode. This is similar to Sage Transformation in a way. Unlike Sage Mode, lycanthropic buffs will drain chakra at first. Once mastered though, it operates akin to Sage Transformation.<br><br>

<b>Gates:</b><br>
(100 x # of Gate) <br>
1/4 Amount with Stamina T1<br>
1/3 Amount with Stamina T2<br>
1/2 Amount with Stamina T3<br><br>

<b>Custom Doujutsu:</b><br>
If you have a KG you are not allowed to have a custom doujutsu, if you roll custom doujutsu and would like to choose it over your KG you are able to but will be stripped of the KG you currently hold. [Not allowed this wipe]<br><br>

<b>Restrictions on Clan Jutsu:</b><br> 
All clans who have more than one member you will need to establish a clan head ICly so that you begin a hierarchy of how jutsu is learned. From now on if your superior knows a jutsu before you, you must learn it from them not by creating it yourself since it is already created.<br><br></font>
