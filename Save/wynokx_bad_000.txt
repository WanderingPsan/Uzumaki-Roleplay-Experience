		profile2 = "goes back to the training area. The reasoning for doing so this time was to practice his jutsu. He goes over to the punching dummies as most of his attacks are punches and as such require a dummy to be practiced upon. He stands in front of the first dummy which he comes to and prepares his mind and body for the use of these techniques.<53>\n\nGeo begins with his trianing of his Shoryuken technique. He walks towards the dummy before dropping his body low. \"Shoooryuuken!!\" He exclaims as he leaps upwards into the air. In doing so, Geo releases a might punch directly for the inanimate objects 'head' area. The punch only barely connects which causes it to rock furiously despite not taking actual damage.<54>\n\n\"Alright..Next one.\" He states as he drops back in front of the dummy. Each time he does this, he can feel his muscles tightening up in preperation. The young man's body shoots straight into the air quickly. The punch is aimed at knocking the thing off kilter. \"Hmm..Nope.\" He states as he strikes it but to no avail. \"I need to get better.\" He remarks simply.<55>\n\nThe young man quickly goes back to his ready stance. \"I know what I should change.\" He states as he runs straight towards the dummy. As he gets to the dummy, Geo simply drops his shoulder a small amount this time. \"ShyoooooRyuuuukeeennn!\" He exclaims as he shoots his body up into the air. This time, his punch connects well with the dummy, causing it to rock and slam against the wall behind it. <56>\n\nGeo chuckles as he drops down and slides backwards. \"I can do it now...I've mastered the technique..I can feel it.\" He states as he takes off at full speed. \"The trick was to drop your shoulder and not bend your knees so much.\" He remarks as he quickly slides up under the dummy. \"Shoryuken!!\" He exclaims as he knocks the dummy high into the air. The object falls back down and slams against the ground, shattering.<57>\n\nfigures that the next jutsu which he should train should be his Pressure Fist technique. He knew that when he reached a certain level, he'd be able to use the technique in a way which he could currently not comprehend. \"One day...I'll achieve greatness..\" He thinks as he steps in front of the large stone edifice in the training area. \"I'll have to use this..I've broken enough of the dummies.\" He says as he suddenlly opens the first gate. \"Only way I can use this.\" He thinks as he suddenlly drops his body back slightly.<58>\n\nThe young man suddenlly pushes his fist forwards as he begins to focus his energy outwards, causing it to funnel towards his fist with a great deal of strain. \"Pressure...\" He states as he begins his forwards punch. \"Fist!\" He exclaims as he suddenlly releases the punch causing a pressurized blast of wind to slam into the face of the rock wall causing very little damage.<59>\n\n\"I need to try again and I need to do it harder!\" He exclaims as he suddenlly drops back into the preparatory position for the technique. The young man quickly begins to focus his energy and his strength upon his right hand as he aims his nose towards the wall where he intended on hitting it. \"So far, I've avoided hititng it with my hand...That'll deal too much damage.\" He remarks to himself before suddenlly drawing his fist forth. \"Pressure Fist!\" He exclaims as he lets loose a blast of pressurized air to impact the wall.<60>\n\nGeo watches on as the pressure vacuum slams against the wall and quickly disperses. Geo shakes his head. \"No I have to work harder and get closer to my goal of mastering this technieu!\" He states as he suddenlly drops down into the ready stance of the technique. \"I can do this!\" He exclaims as he focuses all of his energy into his fist. \"Pressure Fist!\" He exclaims before rapidly extending his arm to its full length, aimed directly at the rock wall.<61>\n\nThe punch creates a massive burst of pressurized wind this time. The burst of wind slams into the rock face with a burst of sound and the throwing of small bits of rock and gravel. Geo fist pumps as he knew he was getting that much closer. \"I can feel it.\" He states as he drops down into the ready stance once more, his energy beginning the dwindle, sweat running down his face. \"I have to push myself past my limits..That is the Philosophy of the Eight Gates!\" He exclaims before suddenlly extending his fist once more.<62>\n\nGeo's extended arm causes a minute burst of wind initially. Someone watching would possibly even think that the attack hadn't worked at all. But it was because of this lack of a reaction that Geo smiles. In a sudden explosion of energy, the wind explodes upon contact with the wall. It makes a very large sound as a relatively large crack appears in the surface of the rocky tower. \"I can do it now..I know I can!\" He exclaims before suddenlly dropping down into the ready stance once more.<63>\n\nThis time, instead of simply extending his arm, Geo runs. The young man suddenlly takes off at top speed towards the wall. His arm is held down and back as he was preparing a punch. \"I will punch through the darknes....Into the LIGHT!\" He exclaims as he begins to slide into place. \"This is the power of my resolve!\" The young man exclaims as he suddenlly punches the wall with all of his might. <64>\n\nGeo's fist connects with the wall, causing it to begin to crack even more, endangering the structural integrity of the whole thing. \"Hahaaah...\" He states as he leaps backwards a few feet. Upon landing on his feet he remarks simply, closing the gate. \"Boom...\" As he does so the wind which had been compressed at that point suddenlly explodes outwards. It rips through the rock and tears through the surface of the mountainous edifice. A large crater is created there at the point of impact.<65>\n\n<1>Geo resolves that he should begin increasing his skills as a taijutsu specialist. It is for this reason that he finds himself standing in front of one of the dummies which those that want to train their ability to kick utilize. He chuckles as his feet were bandaged up and he wasn't wearing shoes like normal. \"I'll begin here, and from here I will reach infinity.\" He states as he suddenlly rotates his body. Geo's bodily rotation results in a powerful kick impacting the side of the dummy.<66>\n\n<2>The kick delivered from Geo was powerful to say the least, but it wasn't anywhere near as powerful as it could be. It was for this reason that he knew that he would grow into an extremely powerful fighter. Geo begins to perform series of left and right kicks towards the body and head of the dummy. Each attack was slightly faster, slightly less sloppy, and slightly more dangerous than the last.<67>\n\n<3>Geo found himself getting into the groove of his training as he continues to perform relatively quick kick combos against the dummy. He knew that the best way to train his kicks would be to train against an opponent, but he was short of those at the moment. Geo's focus right now was to increase his speed and power with his kicks. He figured that if his ability to kick outgrew his ability to punch then he'd successfully become a much more powerful individual.<68>\n\n<4>The weights on Geo's legs were holding down his feet and arms. Because of this, his form was slightly sloppy. \"I need to work on getting better at this...\" He states as he begins to shift his body left and right with each of the kicks he delivered towards the dummy. As he does this, he begins to bob left and right as if he were performing his signature boxing movement. \"This could become a dangerous combination for my opponents.\" He thinks to himself with a chuckle.<69>\n\n<5>Geo's kicks towards the midsection of the dummy begin to exponentially increase in speed. He figured that with such an increase in speed he'd be near to his goal soon enough. It was for this reason that after the next fifteen kicks he suddenlly stops. The young man runs out into the sparring chamber of the training area. He finds the first individual whom he knew to be a kickboxer and immediately challenges him. \"You there.. want to spar you..I want to test my kicks against yours.\" He states pointing at his target.<70>\n\n<6>The individual chuckles as he realizes that it was Geo that wanted to spar him at kickboxing. \"So the little boxer wants to spar me eh? Let's go.\" The man says as he suddenlly pulls up his left leg, standing similarly to a flamingo. The man suddenlly shoots directly at Geo off of his stationary leg. As he does, he gets in close to Geo and aims a rapid-fire series of kicks towards Geo's body.<71>\n\n<7>Geo is taken aback that the man had so readily taken his challenge and then attacked him. Geo's body was in no sort of stance for a kickboxer. He was essentially standing in a modified boxing stance. As the Kickboxer comes in close and aims massive kick towards Geo's midsection, he's caught off-guard. The kick is delivered directly to Geo's midsection causing him to exhale sharply. \"Urgh...\" He groans as the initial kick is followed up by a vicious series.<72>\n\n<8>Geo's only option upon taking the massive flurry of kicks is the drop back a bit. He figures there was no way he was going to be able to go on the offensive at this point so he decides he'd stay on the defence. Because of the nature of their spar, Geo couldn't use his hands for much more than a light parry here or there. He stares down his opponent, waiting for the man's next attack.<73>\n\n<9>The Kickboxer suddenlly leaps through the air towards Geo. His left leg being used as if it were a spring. He lands with a massive downwards kick towards Geo's left shoulder. This kick had enough force behind it to potentially not only knock Geo to the ground, but to cause him some serious damage to his collarbone.<74>\n\n<10>Geo takes notice of how dangerous the attack coming towards him was. Because of this he rolls out of the way of the man. As the man hits the ground, his massive kick delivered to open air, Geo goes on the offensive. He quickly rushes the man from behind before aiming several kicks to either side of the man's body. Each of these kicks held very little power compared to the man's kicks, but Geo hoped he'd be able to do at least a -little- damage.<75>\n\n<11>The Kickboxer chuckles at Geo's puny attempts at attacks. He essentially just tanks the kicks as he turns his body away from each kick, using his arms as a shield by crouching down slightly. The man's crouching position held within it, not only a near impenetrable defence, but also a dangerous weapon. In a sudden twist of fate, the man flips his body upwards and out. As he does this, his foot is extended, and aims to catch Geo directly up under the chin to knock him down and out.<76>\n\n<12>There was no way in the world that Geo could have possibly known that kick was coming anymoe than he could have avoided it even if he did. As soon as the Kickboxer's foot comes into contact with Geo's chin, he knocks the young man slam out. Geo falls flat upon his back, panting heavily. \"Ah shit...Did I kill him?\" The Kickboxer asks as he kneels over Geo checking his vitals. \"Ah good...I just knocked the kid out.\" He remarks chuckling. \"Can't go back to jail.\" He states as he walks off.<77>\n\n<13>After a few hours, Geo gets up from his position on the ground and shakes his head. \"Ow...That sucked...I need to get better.\" He states as he rushes off to the training dummies. During that spar, Geo had taken note of the various things which he had done wrong. He stands in front of the dummy and begins to kick it as he begins to enumerate them. \"First off! I don't have a stance!\" He states, punctuating everything he's saying with a vicious kick.<78>\n\n<14>\"Secondly! I need to focus less on my arms! And more on my feet! I can kick! But I need to be able to kick! Harder! Faster! Stronger!\" He exclaims with each kick. The young man's Resolve was beginning to burn brightly. \"I. Will. Succeed!\" He exclaims as his kicks begin to rapidly increase in speed. He still wasn't kicking any harder and he didn't understand why. After about fifteen more kicks the young man suddenlly has an epiphany. \"My stance!\" He exclaims before suddenlly dropping his leg.<79>\n\n<15>\"I haven't gotten a stance for kicking so my kicks are weakened by my boxing stance.\" He states as he places a hand to his chin and begins to think about what the man had done with his legs. He brings his left leg up to match his opponents and begins to chuckle. \"This is ridiculous...\" He thinks to himself as he performs a swift kick with his raised leg. As the leg impacts with the dummy he realizes just how much better off he was using this stance.<80>\n\n<16>\"I need to learn more about this stance from him.\" He states as he suddenlly rushes off to find the man whom he had sparred. After about thirty minutes or so. Geo is able to find the man who was hanging out in the locker rooms for whatever reason. \"Hey..I need you to teach me more about your stance...\" Geo requests from the man who simply chuckles in response. Geo is confused as to why he would chuckle and as such took a mock version of the stance, sending out several quick kicks, his weights decreasing his overall speed a bit but increasing gains.<81>\n\n<17>The man gives a look of being slightly impressed. \"Hmm..Alright, I'll teach you.\" The man says before leading Geo away from the locker rooms. The two of them make their way to the general training area and begin to speak to one another. The Kickboxer tells Geo that his fighting style was called Muay Thai and that in order to utilize it he would have to do lots of training. Upon saying this the man makes the Muay Thai stance, pulling his left leg up, balanced on his right one. He suddenlly shoots towards Geo instructing him as he does so.<82>\n\n<18>The training given to Geo eventually began to wind down. His ability to kick and be kicked was steadily increasing. He took this as a good sign and returns to the training dummies. He quickly kicks the dummy multiple times before coming to a stop after training. \"Alright that's enough until I return to Kinami Sensei.\" He states to himself as he quickly goes off to find Gravel so that he could go to Sunagakure.<83>\n\n<19>Geo chuckles as he brings his right leg up, preparing his body. He is standing in what one can only call a Muay Thai stance. He is practicing to become a kickboxer and as such his ability is rather low compared to what it will become later on. \"Alrighty Kinami Sensei...Come at me!\" He exclaims as he suddenlly shoots towards her, aiming to kick her several times in the shoulder, arm, and midsection.<84>\n\n<20>parries her attacks towards his head utilizing his small amount of reflex and his higher attack speed as a sort of shield against. He then leaps upwards, aiming to parry her kick with his own. He is off by a few moments and catches the kick in his midsection. He is knocked to the ground and bounces back up from the force of the attack. <85>\n\n<21>\"What a kick!\" He cries out as he shoots towards Kinami once more. He quickly gets in close aiming to grasp her by the head. In doing so, he'd attempt to then pull her head down while at the same time bringing his knee up. \"Kai Loi!\" He exclaims as he attempts to reenact a technique which his Muay Thai instructor had showed him...The Hard way.<86>\n\n<22>chuckles as his leg is kicked off-balance. He falls over to the side and sighs. \"H-\" He thinks to himself as he's suddenlly kicked high into the air. \"Hmm?\" He thinks to himself as he shifts his weight. \"He finds himself floated in the air slightly. \"HM!?\" He exclaims.<87>\n\n<23>Immediately begins to struggle against the bindings as they wrap around his body. \"Gate of Opening...Open!\" He exclaims as he releases the energy within his body as he attempts to overpower her bindings. Geo's body begins to move slightly within the girl's trappings. \"This technique....What is it? What will it end with?\" He thinks to himself as he continues to focus his energy at getting out.<88>\n\n<24>As Kinami's bindings cover him completely tightening up, he figures that was nothing he would be able to do against her for the time being. \"This is going to be painful...I can tell.\" He thinks to himself as he begins to struggle with his legs ever so slightly, attempting to get free and slip out of the bottom of the bindings. The young man realizes the futility of his struggle and relaxes so that he won't be hurt as bad depending upon the attack.<89>\n\n<25>Is slammed painfully into the ground. The young man suddenlly falls flat. \"She's got to teach me that one...\" He thinks to himself as he gets up and stares at Kinami. \"That was a powerful technique..You have to show me...If you do I'll show you this...\" He states as he suddenlly shoots towards her. He draws his right fist down and backwards as he gets in close.<90>\n\n<26>\"This is...My signature punch.\" He exclaims as he drops his shoulder slightly to get under her defences. \"Shooooryuken!\" He exclaims as he suddenlly shoots straight upwards like a spring. As he does so, his entire essence is released into the attack. The move was aimed at knocking Kinami not only away but flat upon her back, the elment of surprise hopefully manifesting.<91>\n\n<27>Hadn't dropped his Muay Thai stance and hadn't been prepared to give Kinami a moment to breathe. The moment that she was back on his feet he'd have his right fist prepared. \"Or I can show you this one...\" He states out loud. \"At half power...\" He thinks to himself as he drops his fist. \"Remember this one Hiroshi?\" He thinks as he suddenlly releases a punch. \"Pressure Fist...\" He remarks quietly. As he does so, a very small breeze blows past the space between the two of them as the air begins to compress.<92>\n\n<28>Geo chuckles in his Muay Thai stance. \"Boom.\" He states simply as the compressed air comes into contact with the space directly in front of Kinami before exploding in a massive burst of sound and energy. The young girl would feel her body being blasted back as well as about half of the typical damage which Geo could do being dealt to her midsection.<93>\n\n<29><1>listens to Kinami's instruction before taking it to mind. \"Alrighty I can do this.\" He thinks to himself as he suddenlly goes over to one of the cacti in the area. He does the same thing which Kinami does to remove the needles from ut ilizing his Muay Thai stance before successively pulling it form the ground. \"Oh wait..No.\" He states as he pulls a scroll out. He places it down on the ground and places his right hand on the surface of the scroll. It releases a singular dummy and he stares at it. \"Hi Dummy.\" He states chuckling.<93>\n\n<30><2>Geo quickly focuses on the dummy. He takes a note of the dummy before quickly kicking it in the midsection. He lifts it up off of the ground with his kick. The young man quickly leaps up into the air and floats up under the thing. He quickly extends his arms. The bandages on his arms don't move at all. \"Wait...Maybe I should unwrap them first.\" He thinks as he grabs the thing and throws it back towards the ground.<94>\n\n<31><3>The young man stands before the dummy yet again. His bandages were released a bit. He quickly aims to kick the dummy high into the air again. As he does so he focuses his mind. He knew that he had the timing down, or at least he felt like he did. He looks up and watches the dummy fly through the air attempting to get a read upon its arc hoping to act upon it hitting the apex of its ascent.<95>\n\n<32><4>Geo quickly leaps upwards into the air. As he gets into the air up under the dummy, he extends his focus to the entirety of the dummy. He and the inanimate object begin to float along through the air. They progressively make their way through the air, floating ever so much to the east. The young man's focus upon the inanimate being's existence was solid.<96>\n\n<33><5>Geo quickly extends his right arm. As he extends his arm, the bandages on his body begin to sort of snake outwards. They quickly move to entrap the dummy in the air. The bandages take their sweet time in extending around the dummy. They quickly wrap around the body of the dummy as their owner wills them to do. The wrappings take hold of the stuffed beast as Geo continues to float up under it, still holding on tight.<97>\n\n<34><6>The speed at which the dummy and Geo were moving suddenlly increases. Geo shifts his weight down towards the ground. As he does so, the buddy and he would begin to spin rapidly. The two of them plummet towards the ground with a great deal of speed. Anyone watching would take notice of a large spiralling of air beginning to form at the base of the two 'individuals'.<98>\n\n<35><7>Geo and the dummy are rapidly hurtling towards the ground as they continue to spin rapidly. The dummy and Geo come to the ground at about the same time. The dummy is slammed into the ground at full power. The head explodes open as it contacts with the earth. Geo lets go of the dummy and flips out of the impact crater. He chuckles at his handy work.<99>\n\n<8>Geo stares at the dummy in the ground. He begins to focus his energy as he stretches out. \"Let's go one more time.\" He states as he suddenlly rushes at the thing once more. As he does so, he kicks the dummy up from the ground, causing it to float in front of him. \"Hyah!\" He exclaims as he kicks it upward into the sky utilizing a backflip based kick.<100>\n\n<9>Geo instantly leaps upwards into the sky. The dummy at this point was moving rather rapidly as Geo's Kicks increased in power and lethality. As he had leapt at the same time that he had kicked the dummy, he reaches the apex of the dummy's trajectory at the same time as it. He quickly extends his arms as he begins to float directly up under the dummy. The bandages from his arms quickly wrap around its body.<101>\n\n<10>Geo rapidly slams the dummy into the ground as they come out of the fall. The two of them hit the ground and Geo leaps away. The dummy at this point was completely destroyed. He smiles at it before yawning. \"Alrighty I got it down!\" He exclaims as he fist pumps before staring at Kinami. \"You up for another spar? Or d'ya want to trade Shoryuken for that intense kick you hit me with?\" He asks with a wink and a smile.<102>\n\n<11>Geo Dude looks at Kinami with a look of slight anger before suddenlly taking off. Because of the young woman's words, Geo decided he'd beat the shit out of Hiroshi. He quickly drops his weights, running across the sand as his energy explodes outwards. He comes in close to Hiroshi at a rate which he had actually never approached him because he typically held back. \"Gate of Opening Open..\" He states as he immediately drops his shoulders slightly, aiming to get below Hiroshi, before he'd have a chance to get low and sending a massive kick towards his chin aiming to float him in the air.<103>*)\n\n's leg is struck, but that doesn't do what it was inteded to at all. The young man's durability added to his attack speed and strength allowed for him to power through the strike. He continues through with his kick but still misses as result of the dodge. He quickly moves backwards, and stares at Hiroshi. The attack which he sent forth was very familiar to him. He kneels low and blocks with his shin and elbow. The attack would effectively stop the combination of kicks.<104>\n\nThe young man'd then quickly perform a sudden high-arching uppercut, aiming to knock Hiroshi high into the air, the strength behind this punch was such that it'd easily break through Hiroshi's defences. \"Shooryuken!\" He exclaims as he leaps high into the air, his attack aimed at the young man's chest and chin area, a high-floating and buoyant float occuring afterwards.<105>\n\ndoesn't have time for parlor tricks and camradrie. He quickly clears the space between Hiroshi and himself. Since shunshin stuns its user, the young man capitalizes on this fact. He gets in close and utlizes yet another massive flying uppercut. \"Shoooryuuken!\" He exclaims once again, this time, the punch comes at full attack speed, aiming to connect without fail. Should it, Geo crouches low to prepare himself for the upcoming technique.<106>\n\nshakes his head. \"And you talk too much.\" He states simply, whilst drawing his fist back. \"Entirely too much..\" He states as he suddenlly shoots his fist forwards, aiming to connect with Hiroshi's solarplexus. He'd then releases his pent up energy. \"Pressure Fist..\" He states as he aims to not only smash his fist into the off-kilter shinobi, but he aims to knock the young man a nice distance with the powerful taijutsu technique which he had perfected at this point.<107>\n\nchuckles. Since Hiroshi dodged before he even got the attack off, he'd simply turn his body. \"Booyah..\" He thinks to himself as he releases the punch before Hiroshi could get his handseals off. \"Bang..\" He thinks to himself as the compressed air would quickly move towards the sliding Hiroshi, at the moment that he stops sliding. The air would, indeed, kickup but Geo had a great deal of defence against such attacks. He crosses his arms as the compressed attack which he performed would be, at this point had nothing out of the way happened, slamming into Hiroshi's body, knocking him across the sand towards Kinami.<108>\n\ndoesn't say anything. The young man simply goes down in the sand and begins to perform pushups. He focuses all of his attention upon the work at hand. \"If I were mad because I had a woman like yours...Everyone would think I was a glutton for punishment.\" He states, his words genuinely possibly an insult but who knows, it could simply be that he believes that women as a group are a hindrance to a shinobi such as himself.<109>\n\n\"One..\" He states as he completes the first set of ten pushups which he was doing. He quickly begins to bring himself up and down completing pushup after pushup. \"Honestly, she's so rude to you and lately she's been really rude to me..I don't see what you see in her sometimes..But then I see that lovely smile and her cheery aura about her..Then I remember, she's not so bad.\" He states as he performs the ninth of his second set of ten.<110>\n\n\"Two..\" He groans as he gets to his 21st pushup. \"Honestly, I don't think she's terrible or anything. It's just that, sometimes she can be a handful..But you manage.\" I guess he states whilst performing the last few pushups of his third rep. \"I mean, I can honestly say...I'm -happy- I don't have a woman like her but I'm glad that you have her, she's made just for you.\" The young man states as he finishes up his 30th pushup and turns around before looking to Mitsunara. \"Oh that's great..Can I have a few?\" He asks simply.<111>\n\nwas aware that the girl which he was battling was preparing to battle the moment that she stepped in front of him. He throws his weights off and shoots directly at her at top speed, opening the first gate. He quickly aims to kick her in the midsection, sending her flying away across the sand, his focus was quite tight as he focuses upon his target. Geo had a bit of frustration which he needed to work out in reference to this woman, and as such, he doesn't hold back even a little bit.<112>\n\nsimply shrugs. \"Whatever..Use your blade.\" He states as he dashes forward, the spar continuing. \"I'm fine.\" He states calmly, comparatively as he quickly begins a series of kicks. His first kick was a rather high one, it was intended on causing the girl to react to it. Shortly afterwards though, he performs a low kick, aiming to knock her off balance and possibly off her feet. He'd then end this combo with a powerful upwards kick aiming to knock her flying a few feet away.<113>\n\nnotices that the girl was actually swinging the blade at him. He continues through with his kick. He actually focuses his kick into the blade. The power and speed of the kick combined with its forward momentum would cause the two to meet, his durable body mixed with his intense power would no doubt cause the weapon to shatter upon impact. Geo's anger was complete as he stands solid looking at her. \"WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!?\" He roars.<114>\n\nsees the incoming shuriken and sighs. Yet again she threw shuriken at him. \"But why though?\" He wonders as he utilizes a single pressure fist. The shuriken would be -easily- launched straight back towards their sender, the weapons would fly straight towards her as if he had thrown then at her. \"I give. You win Kinami. Too strong for me.\" He states simply with a shake of his head.<115>\n\nsimply watches gravel perform his jumping jacks. As his younger brother completes his exercies he suddenlly comes at Geo with a high jump kick. \"Dynamic entry eh?\" Jack questions to himself as he suddenlly brings his left arm up. The arm is used in a such a way that the kick is essentially stopped in mid-air, his durability and strength allowing for such a manouver to take place. \"Alpha Counter..\" He states as he suddenlly, and without pause from the parry, performs a counter which would result in a massive uppercut being performed at the flying young man who would no doubt have a hard time responding.<116>"

Geo Dude was a member of a group of Taijutsu enthusiast who push themselves to and beyond their physical limits and work hard to unlock what are called the Eight Gates. Geo was a new member of this organization of Taijutsu users and as such had not yet opened any of the gates. He felt a great deal of sorrow in this fact and thus begins to work hard to achieve his goal.(1)\n\n\"I will become the best the world has ever seen!\" He exclaims as he attaches two heavy weights to his ankles. The young man begins to slowly attempt to move his legs, one at a time against the immense weight of the lead applications attached to him. He finds that it is much too difficult to begin moving in this situation. \"Because it is too dificult I will make it harder!\" He exclaims as he then places weights upon his arms.(2)\n\nGeo then quickly drops to the ground and falls into pushup position. As the taijutsu user begins to perform the initial pushup he feels a bead of sweat beginning to well up on his forehead. Geo had only began training a few minutes prior to this and as such this amount of sweat made him feel weak. \"I will push beyond this sweat and my boundaries!\" He exclaims as he lowers his body down toward the ground slowly.(3)\n\nGeo's midsection dips below his arms as he lays parrallel to the cold, stone floor of the training area. The single bead of sweat upon his brow quickly rolls along the back of his head, past his ear and upon the cold floor, splashing. He pushes his body back up into the neutral position and counts out loud. \"1..\" He states, his muscles slowly beginning to wake up and be fully prepared for this upcoming series of training rituals.(4)\n\nHe slowly begins to lower his body once more. As Geo's lithe frame lowers towards the ground, he remembers the words of his trainer. \"In order to succeed as a Taijutsu user, one must not only activate the gates, but one must activate their heart.\" Geo never really understood this saying but he felt that it had something to do with passion. \"I have the passion! The passion to succeed.\" He thinks to himself as he comes down to the ground. \"Two...\" He counts out, his nose close to the ground for a moment before being pulled up. (5)\n\nGeo's pushups were rather slow and methodical as he could not help but have a thought everytime he goes down. This time though, he does not initially. As Geo pulls himself down into the pushup he stops for a moment before immediately pushing back up. \"Three...\" He calls out before suddenlly realizing that not a thought passed through his mind. \"What a strange event..\" He thinks before realizing he was now thinking. (6)\n\nThe young man then smiles at the ideas forming within his head. \"These pushups are like a gate. If I cannot succeed in performing all one hundred of them, then there is no hope for me to open the actual 8 gates of life and death.\" He thinks as he lowers his body towards the ground yet another time. Geo's corporeal form is them lifted back up as he comes into a neutral position. \"Seven...\" He claims for himself. (7)\n\nThe initial ideation which a Gates user must come to is that of acceptance of limitation. In order to successfully open the gates and break through their boundaries, the user must first understand those boundaries. It is for this reason that Geo had spent the previous months training not only his body but his mind. He had practiced several forms of martial arts just to get his life on track for this moment. He lowers his body down as he performs the first half of another push-up. \"Eight...\" He says as he pushes straight back up.(8)\n\nAt this point, the weights upon his arms and legs begin to feel slightly heavier than before. \"Eh, it's nothing..\" Geo thinks to himself as he had not even yet done ten push-ups. \"I will not let a little weight intimidate me! My name is Geo and I can do this!\" He cries out as he drops low and gets his push-up on. He quickly resumes as he pushes straight back up into the neutral position. \"Nine..\" He states as he completes his ninth push-up. (9)\n\nGeo was a very intelligent individual for being one who prided himself on his physical prowess. He was taught by his master that one cannot achieve true physical enlightenment without first achieving some level of mental enlightenment. For this, Geo spent three years studying hard and long to open his mind and accept things which, prior to that training, he would not have been okay with. \"Ten..\" Geo states as he considers some of these things. (10)\n\nBefore his training, Geo had been a very prudish individual. He didn't like the idea of the word sex. He didn't really understand the concept of dirty jokes. And he sure as all get out didn't like the fact that so many women seemed to date other women. \"But through my training, I have learned to accept all of these individuals!\" He mentally cries out as he lowers his body towards the ground. Geo then pushes his body straight up. \"Eleven...\" He states completing yet another push-up.(11)\n\nThe prude, that was Geo, before his training even would have had a hard time actually -doing- push-ups as a form of training. He was so averse to any sort of sexuality, this movement in and of itself would have turned him off of this training method. \"I cannot believe I ever thought there was an issue with doing push-ups!\" He states with a chuckle before lowering his body into the first half of his twelfth push-up. \"Twelve...\" He states as he pushes himself back up into neutral. (12)\n\nGeo's series of push-ups was only at 15 out of 100 and because of this he figured he should speed up the process. \"I am going much too slow, but it makes sense I guess, I -am- working with very heavy weights.\" He thinks, considering the 100 kgs on each of his appendages. \"If I were going extremely fast, that would mean I was very strong already and wouldn't even need this.\" He remarks as he lowers himself into his 13th Push-up. \"Thirteen.\" He says simply as he comes back up (13)\n\nGeo's next Push-up comes quickly after the thirteenth. He actually didn't have time to have a thought this time. He simply moves along with the motions of his pushing up and laying down. \"14.\" He says as he lowers his body flat to the ground before returning to his neutral position. \"I am a great taijutsu user and I will break through my limitation and open the gates!\" He thinks to himself as he continues on with his training. (14)\n\nThe young man known as Geo's training continues forth as he pushes himself through to his fifteenth push-up. He tries his hardest to visualize his goal as the weights combined with gravity begin to take their toll upon his body. \"F-fifteen..\" He states as he lowers himself down towards the ground laying parrallel. \"I cannot believe that fifteen push-ups have reduced me to this much fatigue. I won't accept it.\" He thinks, his stamina kicking in as he continues his pushups. \"I will never back down.\" (15)\n\nThe next few moments are followed in rapid succession by a nice series of three pushups. The first of the push-ups finds Geo Dude quickly bringing his body to the ground, his speed, strength, and stamina kicking in as he works hard for his training and keeps working harder for himself and those around him. \"Sixteen..\" He states as he completes that push-up and moves on to completing the next in the series. ( 16)\n\nThe second of the rapid-succession push-ups finds Geo's mind flaring as if on fire. It wasn't the pain, or stress, or aggravation that was causing this flaring, but a sense of success. Geo knew that several individuals before him had attempted this very same level of training and none of them had succeeded. He knew that if he continued to work hard and push himself he'd be the first to succeed in doing what he is doing. \"Seventeen..\" He states as he performs his next rapid succession push-up.(17)\n\nThe third in the series of rapid-fire movements was the last in this grouping. Geo drops down extremely low. At this low point, his nose is just barely off the ground. A bead of sweat which had gathered there meets the ground and connects him to mother earth. Geo, in that moment, feels at peace and smiles widely. He pushes himself up and counts out, \"Eighteen.\" Completing his 18th push-up. (18)\n\n\"To have completed nearly 20 pushups in such a short period of time is nothing less than amazing.\" He thinks to himself as he lowers his body into the 19th of his pushups. \"I cannot say I am not proud of myself because I am, and I will be forever proud of myself with each iteration of my genius coming out.\" He thinks whilst pushing himself back up to complete his nineteenth push-up. \"Nineteen..\" He remarks as he smiles, knowing that twenty was coming up. (19)\n\nGeo was quickly completing his push-ups. He knew that 20 out of 100 wasn't anywhere near completion but it was a big step. He was almost a quarter of the way through and considering the fact that he was an individual who at one point could barely lift a twenty kg weight, let alone four 100 kg weights, he was happy. \"I remember back when I was weak...When I was without ambition..Then the Mizukage helped me on my way.\" He thinks to himself as he drops down into a flat state before pushing up. \"Twenty.\"(20)\n\nThe young man was previously a very scrawny individual because there was no need for him to train. His village had been at peace and as such he knew not of being a shinobi. He was just a lowly courier who shipped things to and fro at the behest of others. It wasn't until a series of unfortunate events befell his village that he was forced to take up the mantel of strength and begin working towards powerful goals. \"Twenty-One.\" He states as he performs his next push-up.(21)\n\nGeo's pushing forward through his training regimine was an example of the might of Kirigakure. Despite his village taking a great deal of damage, and despite it suffering a great loss, it still moved on. In this same way, Geo Dude -was- the Hidden Mist Village. \"I am of this village. This village is of me. I am it and it is me.\" He remarks chuckling before shaking his head. \"No I mustn't think of the past.\" He thinks as he drops down and goes back up.\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Gate 3: 23 - 24 - Fri Dec  4 03:50:24 2015</b><font><hr><br>(*Geo Dude chuckles. He had already seen this young man's use of this technique. It was something that he had also seen in Kirigakure a few times. \"Whatevs.\" He thinks to himself as he suddenlly leaps upwards into the air, directly above where he initiated the ascension into the air. In the next moment, Hiroshi's hand would stick up.<23>\n\n\n\nUpon Hiroshi's hand not finding his ankle, he'd no doubt come back up. The young man then comes down from directly above him, a massive dropkick aimed at the top of his head, aiming to knock him backward and flat upon his back with a ringing in his head.<24>*)<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Gate 3: 25 - Fri Dec  4 05:02:04 2015</b><font><hr><br>(*Geo Dude turns around into Kinami's kick and takes it to the face. \"Fuck!\" He exclaims as he realizes what she said. \"Shit yeah!\" He exclaims as he suddenlly kicks off of the ground directly in front of Momura before aiming a swift spin kick towards Hiroshi as he was being kicked by his girlfriend.<25>*)<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Gate 3: 26 - 34 - Fri Dec  4 10:28:54 2015</b><font><hr><br>chuckles as he hits the wall. He leans back a bit. \"GREAT!\" He exclaims as he kicks off of the wall. Geo wasn't aware of Momura's ability so he leaves the gates closed for the time being. He quickly aims to perform a series of rapid fire punches towards her midsection. The gatling-gun punches were followed by a sudden swift kick aiming to knock Momura high into the air.<26>\n\nshrugs as he pulls his weights off. The young man throws them off to the side. \"Give it my all...\" He thinks to himself as he focuses his mind. \"I guess I can start off with at least the first gate.\" He thinks to himself as he focuses his energy throughout his body. Geo drops into a stance as if he was about to start a race. \"Let's go...\" He remarks as the energy explodes through his body. <27>\n\nThe young man kicks off of the ground, leaving a rather large crater in the earth directly under where he started. His muscle strength was at maximum at this pont. As he gets in close to the clone, he quickly aims a massive knee towards the clone's midsection. In the next moment, he'd follow up by grabbing the clone by it's neck and attempting to flip it over his head and slam it into the ground with a great deal of force.<28>\n\nis suddenlly unpleasently surprised as he misses his attack. \"What?!\" He exclaims as in the next moment another unpleasent surprise occurs. A great deal of wind sweeps over him and quickly moves to keep him at bay. His overall defensive abilities allowed him to at the very least hold himself still as he anchors himself to the ground.<29>\n\n\"Tch..This is annoying..\" Geo thinks to himself as he reconsiders his choice to simply use the first gate. \"I don't know why I expected otherwise...\" He thinks to himself as he focuses his energy. \"I have to keep pushing though!\" He thinks to himself as he begins to power forward. The young man thinks for a moment before letting go.<30>\n\nThe air which was flowing towards him rapidly overtakes him and blows him away a few yards. Geo simply allows it to do as such and lands on the ground, sliding across it a few yards. He stares at the clone for a while. The young man begins to slowly move around the clone as he watches it, wondering what it would do. \"I don't want to pull it out right now, but I'll do so if it comes down to it. \"He thinks to himself as he begins to increase his speed a bit.<31>\n\nThe young man quickly begins to move towards the clone once more. This time he was preparing a combination attack. He quickly dashes with all of his speed and closes up the last bit of distance between the two of them. He quickly throws himself forward, intending on aiming a flying dropkick towards the clone. As he does it, he doesn't aim towards the clone's face or midsection, he aims directly for the copy's knees, aiming to take it out.<32>\n\n's energy explodes through his body as he flies. His energy is revitalized and he finds newfound power. as the energy released from him bursts outwards, and his physical power increases, he flies through the wind which was breaking apart on his powerful body as a result of the Kazekage not working. He has rather high durability as well as high Ninjutsu defence.<33>\n\nHe successfully powers through and breaks the clone's legs, destroying it in the process. Geo stands up and and looks at the Kazekage. \"Huh? Oh..Well you're a Ninjutsu user...Right?\" Geo asks with a smile upon his face. The gates close up as he stands there, relatively fully revitalized.<34><br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>null - Sat Dec  5 01:19:47 2015</b><font><hr><br>null<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Gate 3: 35 - 52 - Sun Dec  6 07:11:47 2015</b><font><hr><br>has returned to his village, and this back to his training regimine. \"I've got to open the third gate as soon as possible.\" He thinks to himself. Geo finds himself returning to the training area beneath the academy. This place was one where a great deal of his memories of the village lay hidden and buried.<35>\n\nGeo quickly returns to the workout equipment and begins to work out there. He picks up one of the heaviest barbells there. He quickly begins to deadlift it straight up. Geo lifts the heavy weight from the ground bringing it up to his chest before letting it go back down. He doesn't count any as he was simply going to keep going until he opened gate 3. <36>\n\nGeo continues to lift the gate up to his chest and brings it back down. With each of these lifts he grunts slightly. \"Oh yeah this is feeling great...\" He thinks to himself. He groans with ecstacy as the feeling of adrenaline pumps through his body as he continues to grunt and exert.<37>\n\nThe young man's next series of lifts bringsh im to a point in his training that he liked to call the focus threshold. Sometimes he just had a really hard time focusing in on his training. It was during these times that he began to work harder and faster. If he was capable of increasing the speed and intensity of his trianing then he'd have no problem breaking through the threshold.<38>\n\ntakes note of Kyubishu. This individual  was one whom he had sparred several times before. But each time that Geo sparred him, the man attempted to hurt him by throwing sharp implements which could cause death or other serious injury. It was for this that Geo was rather unsure as to how he should approach this situation. \"Hmmm...\" He thinks to himself before suddenlly shooting off at his current top speed which wasn't that far to be honest.<39>\n\nAs he gets in close, he begins to spin his body. Geo quickly aims a sweeping kick towards Kyubishu's feet. As he does so, he aims to flip him off of his feet so that he was laying parallel to the earth for a short period. In that moment, he then spins his body around rapidly. As he comes out of the spin, his right leg is fully extended. He extends his foot with the intention of kicking Kyubishu a nice distance away.<40>\n\nis slammed against the ground in no time. He hits the ground and slides a few feet away. the young man stares at the Mizukage. His eyes bulge as he stares forward. \"I-I have never seen anything like this...Wh-what is she!?\" He roars as he backs up a bit. \"No..This is..No..\" He states as he begins to calm himself. \"It is still the Mizukage...She was just hurt....Now she's walking...I have to stop her.\"<41>\n\nAs the young man says this, he stares on intensely. His energy beginning to flow throughout his body as he stares at the Mizukage. \"I will defeat you..For your benefit and for the village...This is my Resolve! This is my Nindo! THE POWER OF RESOLVE!\" He exclaims as his energy suddenlly explodes throughout his body. The young man opens both the first and second gate simultaneously as he takes a hold of the situation.<42>\n\nThe young man suddenlly explodes forth from his position. He quickly shoots at the Mizukage. As he does so his energy begins to flow through himself even harder, focusing around his arm. \"I know...I must defeat you for the MIST!\" He exclaims as he aims a -massive- punch towards the Mizukage's face. As he releases this punch, he aims to hit her in the face. If she dodges the physical attack though, she'd feel a sudden blast of air which was compressed around the fist released into her body, causing a deal of damage including knockback.<43>\n\n(*Geo Dude nods his head as he steps ahead of Kyubishu. He nods his head as he begins to focus his energy throughout his body. The young man for a moment was tempted to open up the first gate, but he shakes his head head. \"No need to go all in initially.\" He thinks as he dashes across the ground directly towards Kyubishu. The young man starts off with a leaping spinning heel kick.<44>\n\n\n\nAs Geo flies through the air, performing the kick, he'd have a slight increase in speed which causes his kick to be empowered by virtue of the same momentum to strength transfer as Dynamic Entry. The young man's kick is aimed to impact Kyubishu across the chest which would knock the wind out of him for a moment as well as knock him back a few steps.*)<45>\n\n's open defences gets him uppercut cleanly in the chin. He goes flipping backwards away from Kyubishu. \"Heh...Guess I shouldn't underestimate you eh?\" Geo thinks to himself as he wipes a bit of blood from his mouth where he had bitten down into his lip drawing the red substance. \"I guess I'll have to fight smarter with you now!\" Geo says as he suddenlly kicks off of the ground towards Kyubishu again.<46>\n\nAs Geo gets in close, his full speed kicks in as he suddenlly dashes off to the side. As he does so, he aims a quick attack towards Kyubishu's midsection. He follows this punch up with a quick knee aiming to catch him from the front and the side simultaneously. This pincer attack was done extremely quickly and aimed to catch Kyubishu off-guard.<47>\n\nactually is willing to listen to Kyubishu as hea kicks off the ground and leaps backwards away from him. He slides across the ground and stares at Kyubishu now that those white implements were sticking out of his body once again. \"What is that?\" Geo thinks to himself as he begins to move around Kyubishu. He keeps his focus upon the young man's body, moving swiftly.<48>\n\n\"I know that I can break whatever those things are, I've done it before, so I'm not too worried about them.\" He thinks as he rushes directly at Kyubishu once more. He decides that it wouldn't hurt to activate the first gate considering the current situation he finds himself in. As he does so, Geo's muscles tighten and his power and speed increases. <49>\n\nAs he runs towards Kyubishu, Geo's speed suddenly explodes, which would no doubt catch Kyu off-guard as a result of the fact that he wasn't moving as slow as before. He quickly gets in close and drops his body before aiming to uppercut Kyubishu in the midsection, his drop in elevation aimed at getting up under Kyubishu's defences.<50>\n\nis assaulted by the series of kicks before being knocked back to the earth. He bounces off of the ground and chuckles. \"Kyu you're rather good..And that series of Kicks...I'm tired of being hit by it.\" He states with a chuckle. \"My sensei uses it all the time.\" He states before suddenlly shooting forward at Kyubishu once more. Considering the fact that Kyubishu had been letting him hit him every time, he knew he'd be able to land this attack.<51>\n\nAs Geo gets in close, he suddenlly lets off a rather quick attack directly for Kyubishu's body once more. As he does so he chuckles. \"Pressure Fist..\" He thinks as his punch suddenlly releases a pressurized burst of air. This blast would do damage equal to half of the damage of a normal punch by Geo. But as a result of its compressed nature. Assuming Geo's hit lands, Kyu would find himself knocked flying several yards away, possibly landing on the porch of the mansion.<52><br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Misclick - Tue Dec  8 00:07:40 2015</b><font><hr><br>Ignore<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Kickboxer 1 - 18; Gate 3: 53 - 83 - Tue Dec  8 00:19:37 2015</b><font><hr><br>goes back to the training area.

He walks towards the dummy before dropping his body low. \"Shoooryuuken!!\" He exclaims as he leaps upwards into the air. In doing so, Geo releases a might punch directly for the inanimate objects 'head' area. The punch only barely connects which causes it to rock furiously despite not taking actual damage.<54>\n\n\"Alright..Next one.\" He states as he drops back in front of the dummy. Each time he does this, he can feel his muscles tightening up in preperation. The young man's body shoots straight into the air quickly. The punch is aimed at knocking the thing off kilter. \"Hmm..Nope.\" He states as he strikes it but to no avail. \"I need to get better.\" He remarks simply.<55>\n\nThe young man quickly goes back to his ready stance. \"I know what I should change.\" He states as he runs straight towards the dummy. As he gets to the dummy, Geo simply drops his shoulder a small amount this time. \"ShyoooooRyuuuukeeennn!\" He exclaims as he shoots his body up into the air. This time, his punch connects well with the dummy, causing it to rock and slam against the wall behind it. <56>\n\nGeo chuckles as he drops down and slides backwards. \"I can do it now...I've mastered the technique..I can feel it.\" He states as he takes off at full speed. \"The trick was to drop your shoulder and not bend your knees so much.\" He remarks as he quickly slides up under the dummy. \"Shoryuken!!\" He exclaims as he knocks the dummy high into the air. The object falls back down and slams against the ground, shattering.<57>\n\nfigures that the next jutsu which he should train should be his Pressure Fist technique. He knew that when he reached a certain level, he'd be able to use the technique in a way which he could currently not comprehend. \"One day...I'll achieve greatness..\" He thinks as he steps in front of the large stone edifice in the training area. \"I'll have to use this..I've broken enough of the dummies.\" He says as he suddenlly opens the first gate. \"Only way I can use this.\" He thinks as he suddenlly drops his body back slightly.<58>\n\nThe young man suddenlly pushes his fist forwards as he begins to focus his energy outwards, causing it to funnel towards his fist with a great deal of strain. \"Pressure...\" He states as he begins his forwards punch. \"Fist!\" He exclaims as he suddenlly releases the punch causing a pressurized blast of wind to slam into the face of the rock wall causing very little damage.<59>\n\n\"I need to try again and I need to do it harder!\" He exclaims as he suddenlly drops back into the preparatory position for the technique. The young man quickly begins to focus his energy and his strength upon his right hand as he aims his nose towards the wall where he intended on hitting it. \"So far, I've avoided hititng it with my hand...That'll deal too much damage.\" He remarks to himself before suddenlly drawing his fist forth. \"Pressure Fist!\" He exclaims as he lets loose a blast of pressurized air to impact the wall.<60>\n\nGeo watches on as the pressure vacuum slams against the wall and quickly disperses. Geo shakes his head. \"No I have to work harder and get closer to my goal of mastering this technieu!\" He states as he suddenlly drops down into the ready stance of the technique. \"I can do this!\" He exclaims as he focuses all of his energy into his fist. \"Pressure Fist!\" He exclaims before rapidly extending his arm to its full length, aimed directly at the rock wall.<61>\n\nThe punch creates a massive burst of pressurized wind this time. The burst of wind slams into the rock face with a burst of sound and the throwing of small bits of rock and gravel. Geo fist pumps as he knew he was getting that much closer. \"I can feel it.\" He states as he drops down into the ready stance once more, his energy beginning the dwindle, sweat running down his face. \"I have to push myself past my limits..That is the Philosophy of the Eight Gates!\" He exclaims before suddenlly extending his fist once more.<62>\n\nGeo's extended arm causes a minute burst of wind initially. Someone watching would possibly even think that the attack hadn't worked at all. But it was because of this lack of a reaction that Geo smiles. In a sudden explosion of energy, the wind explodes upon contact with the wall. It makes a very large sound as a relatively large crack appears in the surface of the rocky tower. \"I can do it now..I know I can!\" He exclaims before suddenlly dropping down into the ready stance once more.<63>\n\nThis time, instead of simply extending his arm, Geo runs. The young man suddenlly takes off at top speed towards the wall. His arm is held down and back as he was preparing a punch. \"I will punch through the darknes....Into the LIGHT!\" He exclaims as he begins to slide into place. \"This is the power of my resolve!\" The young man exclaims as he suddenlly punches the wall with all of his might. <64>\n\nGeo's fist connects with the wall, causing it to begin to crack even more, endangering the structural integrity of the whole thing. \"Hahaaah...\" He states as he leaps backwards a few feet. Upon landing on his feet he remarks simply, closing the gate. \"Boom...\" As he does so the wind which had been compressed at that point suddenlly explodes outwards. It rips through the rock and tears through the surface of the mountainous edifice. A large crater is created there at the point of impact.<65>\n\n<1>Geo resolves that he should begin increasing his skills as a taijutsu specialist. It is for this reason that he finds himself standing in front of one of the dummies which those that want to train their ability to kick utilize. He chuckles as his feet were bandaged up and he wasn't wearing shoes like normal. \"I'll begin here, and from here I will reach infinity.\" He states as he suddenlly rotates his body. Geo's bodily rotation results in a powerful kick impacting the side of the dummy.<66>\n\n<2>The kick delivered from Geo was powerful to say the least, but it wasn't anywhere near as powerful as it could be. It was for this reason that he knew that he would grow into an extremely powerful fighter. Geo begins to perform series of left and right kicks towards the body and head of the dummy. Each attack was slightly faster, slightly less sloppy, and slightly more dangerous than the last.<67>\n\n<3>Geo found himself getting into the groove of his training as he continues to perform relatively quick kick combos against the dummy. He knew that the best way to train his kicks would be to train against an opponent, but he was short of those at the moment. Geo's focus right now was to increase his speed and power with his kicks. He figured that if his ability to kick outgrew his ability to punch then he'd successfully become a much more powerful individual.<68>\n\n<4>The weights on Geo's legs were holding down his feet and arms. Because of this, his form was slightly sloppy. \"I need to work on getting better at this...\" He states as he begins to shift his body left and right with each of the kicks he delivered towards the dummy. As he does this, he begins to bob left and right as if he were performing his signature boxing movement. \"This could become a dangerous combination for my opponents.\" He thinks to himself with a chuckle.<69>\n\n<5>Geo's kicks towards the midsection of the dummy begin to exponentially increase in speed. He figured that with such an increase in speed he'd be near to his goal soon enough. It was for this reason that after the next fifteen kicks he suddenlly stops. The young man runs out into the sparring chamber of the training area. He finds the first individual whom he knew to be a kickboxer and immediately challenges him. \"You there.. want to spar you..I want to test my kicks against yours.\" He states pointing at his target.<70>\n\n<6>The individual chuckles as he realizes that it was Geo that wanted to spar him at kickboxing. \"So the little boxer wants to spar me eh? Let's go.\" The man says as he suddenlly pulls up his left leg, standing similarly to a flamingo. The man suddenlly shoots directly at Geo off of his stationary leg. As he does, he gets in close to Geo and aims a rapid-fire series of kicks towards Geo's body.<71>\n\n<7>Geo is taken aback that the man had so readily taken his challenge and then attacked him. Geo's body was in no sort of stance for a kickboxer. He was essentially standing in a modified boxing stance. As the Kickboxer comes in close and aims massive kick towards Geo's midsection, he's caught off-guard. The kick is delivered directly to Geo's midsection causing him to exhale sharply. \"Urgh...\" He groans as the initial kick is followed up by a vicious series.<72>\n\n<8>Geo's only option upon taking the massive flurry of kicks is the drop back a bit. He figures there was no way he was going to be able to go on the offensive at this point so he decides he'd stay on the defence. Because of the nature of their spar, Geo couldn't use his hands for much more than a light parry here or there. He stares down his opponent, waiting for the man's next attack.<73>\n\n<9>The Kickboxer suddenlly leaps through the air towards Geo. His left leg being used as if it were a spring. He lands with a massive downwards kick towards Geo's left shoulder. This kick had enough force behind it to potentially not only knock Geo to the ground, but to cause him some serious damage to his collarbone.<74>\n\n<10>Geo takes notice of how dangerous the attack coming towards him was. Because of this he rolls out of the way of the man. As the man hits the ground, his massive kick delivered to open air, Geo goes on the offensive. He quickly rushes the man from behind before aiming several kicks to either side of the man's body. Each of these kicks held very little power compared to the man's kicks, but Geo hoped he'd be able to do at least a -little- damage.<75>\n\n<11>The Kickboxer chuckles at Geo's puny attempts at attacks. He essentially just tanks the kicks as he turns his body away from each kick, using his arms as a shield by crouching down slightly. The man's crouching position held within it, not only a near impenetrable defence, but also a dangerous weapon. In a sudden twist of fate, the man flips his body upwards and out. As he does this, his foot is extended, and aims to catch Geo directly up under the chin to knock him down and out.<76>\n\n<12>There was no way in the world that Geo could have possibly known that kick was coming anymoe than he could have avoided it even if he did. As soon as the Kickboxer's foot comes into contact with Geo's chin, he knocks the young man slam out. Geo falls flat upon his back, panting heavily. \"Ah shit...Did I kill him?\" The Kickboxer asks as he kneels over Geo checking his vitals. \"Ah good...I just knocked the kid out.\" He remarks chuckling. \"Can't go back to jail.\" He states as he walks off.<77>\n\n<13>After a few hours, Geo gets up from his position on the ground and shakes his head. \"Ow...That sucked...I need to get better.\" He states as he rushes off to the training dummies. During that spar, Geo had taken note of the various things which he had done wrong. He stands in front of the dummy and begins to kick it as he begins to enumerate them. \"First off! I don't have a stance!\" He states, punctuating everything he's saying with a vicious kick.<78>\n\n<14>\"Secondly! I need to focus less on my arms! And more on my feet! I can kick! But I need to be able to kick! Harder! Faster! Stronger!\" He exclaims with each kick. The young man's Resolve was beginning to burn brightly. \"I. Will. Succeed!\" He exclaims as his kicks begin to rapidly increase in speed. He still wasn't kicking any harder and he didn't understand why. After about fifteen more kicks the young man suddenlly has an epiphany. \"My stance!\" He exclaims before suddenlly dropping his leg.<79>\n\n<15>\"I haven't gotten a stance for kicking so my kicks are weakened by my boxing stance.\" He states as he places a hand to his chin and begins to think about what the man had done with his legs. He brings his left leg up to match his opponents and begins to chuckle. \"This is ridiculous...\" He thinks to himself as he performs a swift kick with his raised leg. As the leg impacts with the dummy he realizes just how much better off he was using this stance.<80>\n\n<16>\"I need to learn more about this stance from him.\" He states as he suddenlly rushes off to find the man whom he had sparred. After about thirty minutes or so. Geo is able to find the man who was hanging out in the locker rooms for whatever reason. \"Hey..I need you to teach me more about your stance...\" Geo requests from the man who simply chuckles in response. Geo is confused as to why he would chuckle and as such took a mock version of the stance, sending out several quick kicks, his weights decreasing his overall speed a bit but increasing gains.<81>\n\n<17>The man gives a look of being slightly impressed. \"Hmm..Alright, I'll teach you.\" The man says before leading Geo away from the locker rooms. The two of them make their way to the general training area and begin to speak to one another. The Kickboxer tells Geo that his fighting style was called Muay Thai and that in order to utilize it he would have to do lots of training. Upon saying this the man makes the Muay Thai stance, pulling his left leg up, balanced on his right one. He suddenlly shoots towards Geo instructing him as he does so.<82>\n\n<18>The training given to Geo eventually began to wind down. His ability to kick and be kicked was steadily increasing. He took this as a good sign and returns to the training dummies. He quickly kicks the dummy multiple times before coming to a stop after training. \"Alright that's enough until I return to Kinami Sensei.\" He states to himself as he quickly goes off to find Gravel so that he could go to Sunagakure.<83><br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Gate 3: 53 - 102; Kickboxer: 1 - 35; Front Lotus Training - Tue Dec  8 05:55:50 2015</b><font><hr><br>goes back to the training area.

He is standing in what one can only call a Muay Thai stance. He is practicing to become a kickboxer and as such his ability is rather low compared to what it will become later on. \"Alrighty Kinami Sensei...Come at me!\" He exclaims as he suddenlly shoots towards her, aiming to kick her several times in the shoulder, arm, and midsection.<84>\n\n<20>parries her attacks towards his head utilizing his small amount of reflex and his higher attack speed as a sort of shield against. He then leaps upwards, aiming to parry her kick with his own. He is off by a few moments and catches the kick in his midsection. He is knocked to the ground and bounces back up from the force of the attack. <85>\n\n<21>\"What a kick!\" He cries out as he shoots towards Kinami once more. He quickly gets in close aiming to grasp her by the head. In doing so, he'd attempt to then pull her head down while at the same time bringing his knee up. \"Kai Loi!\" He exclaims as he attempts to reenact a technique which his Muay Thai instructor had showed him...The Hard way.<86>\n\n<22>chuckles as his leg is kicked off-balance. He falls over to the side and sighs. \"H-\" He thinks to himself as he's suddenlly kicked high into the air. \"Hmm?\" He thinks to himself as he shifts his weight. \"He finds himself floated in the air slightly. \"HM!?\" He exclaims.<87>\n\n<23>Immediately begins to struggle against the bindings as they wrap around his body. \"Gate of Opening...Open!\" He exclaims as he releases the energy within his body as he attempts to overpower her bindings. Geo's body begins to move slightly within the girl's trappings. \"This technique....What is it? What will it end with?\" He thinks to himself as he continues to focus his energy at getting out.<88>\n\n<24>As Kinami's bindings cover him completely tightening up, he figures that was nothing he would be able to do against her for the time being. \"This is going to be painful...I can tell.\" He thinks to himself as he begins to struggle with his legs ever so slightly, attempting to get free and slip out of the bottom of the bindings. The young man realizes the futility of his struggle and relaxes so that he won't be hurt as bad depending upon the attack.<89>\n\n<25>Is slammed painfully into the ground. The young man suddenlly falls flat. \"She's got to teach me that one...\" He thinks to himself as he gets up and stares at Kinami. \"That was a powerful technique..You have to show me...If you do I'll show you this...\" He states as he suddenlly shoots towards her. He draws his right fist down and backwards as he gets in close.<90>\n\n<26>\"This is...My signature punch.\" He exclaims as he drops his shoulder slightly to get under her defences. \"Shooooryuken!\" He exclaims as he suddenlly shoots straight upwards like a spring. As he does so, his entire essence is released into the attack. The move was aimed at knocking Kinami not only away but flat upon her back, the elment of surprise hopefully manifesting.<91>\n\n<27>Hadn't dropped his Muay Thai stance and hadn't been prepared to give Kinami a moment to breathe. The moment that she was back on his feet he'd have his right fist prepared. \"Or I can show you this one...\" He states out loud. \"At half power...\" He thinks to himself as he drops his fist. \"Remember this one Hiroshi?\" He thinks as he suddenlly releases a punch. \"Pressure Fist...\" He remarks quietly. As he does so, a very small breeze blows past the space between the two of them as the air begins to compress.<92>\n\n<28>Geo chuckles in his Muay Thai stance. \"Boom.\" He states simply as the compressed air comes into contact with the space directly in front of Kinami before exploding in a massive burst of sound and energy. The young girl would feel her body being blasted back as well as about half of the typical damage which Geo could do being dealt to her midsection.<93>\n\n<29><1>listens to Kinami's instruction before taking it to mind. \"Alrighty I can do this.\" He thinks to himself as he suddenlly goes over to one of the cacti in the area. He does the same thing which Kinami does to remove the needles from ut ilizing his Muay Thai stance before successively pulling it form the ground. \"Oh wait..No.\" He states as he pulls a scroll out. He places it down on the ground and places his right hand on the surface of the scroll. It releases a singular dummy and he stares at it. \"Hi Dummy.\" He states chuckling.<93>\n\n<30><2>Geo quickly focuses on the dummy. He takes a note of the dummy before quickly kicking it in the midsection. He lifts it up off of the ground with his kick. The young man quickly leaps up into the air and floats up under the thing. He quickly extends his arms. The bandages on his arms don't move at all. \"Wait...Maybe I should unwrap them first.\" He thinks as he grabs the thing and throws it back towards the ground.<94>\n\n<31><3>The young man stands before the dummy yet again. His bandages were released a bit. He quickly aims to kick the dummy high into the air again. As he does so he focuses his mind. He knew that he had the timing down, or at least he felt like he did. He looks up and watches the dummy fly through the air attempting to get a read upon its arc hoping to act upon it hitting the apex of its ascent.<95>\n\n<32><4>Geo quickly leaps upwards into the air. As he gets into the air up under the dummy, he extends his focus to the entirety of the dummy. He and the inanimate object begin to float along through the air. They progressively make their way through the air, floating ever so much to the east. The young man's focus upon the inanimate being's existence was solid.<96>\n\n<33><5>Geo quickly extends his right arm. As he extends his arm, the bandages on his body begin to sort of snake outwards. They quickly move to entrap the dummy in the air. The bandages take their sweet time in extending around the dummy. They quickly wrap around the body of the dummy as their owner wills them to do. The wrappings take hold of the stuffed beast as Geo continues to float up under it, still holding on tight.<97>\n\n<34><6>The speed at which the dummy and Geo were moving suddenlly increases. Geo shifts his weight down towards the ground. As he does so, the buddy and he would begin to spin rapidly. The two of them plummet towards the ground with a great deal of speed. Anyone watching would take notice of a large spiralling of air beginning to form at the base of the two 'individuals'.<98>\n\n<35><7>Geo and the dummy are rapidly hurtling towards the ground as they continue to spin rapidly. The dummy and Geo come to the ground at about the same time. The dummy is slammed into the ground at full power. The head explodes open as it contacts with the earth. Geo lets go of the dummy and flips out of the impact crater. He chuckles at his handy work.<99>\n\n<8>Geo stares at the dummy in the ground. He begins to focus his energy as he stretches out. \"Let's go one more time.\" He states as he suddenlly rushes at the thing once more. As he does so, he kicks the dummy up from the ground, causing it to float in front of him. \"Hyah!\" He exclaims as he kicks it upward into the sky utilizing a backflip based kick.<100>\n\n<9>Geo instantly leaps upwards into the sky. The dummy at this point was moving rather rapidly as Geo's Kicks increased in power and lethality. As he had leapt at the same time that he had kicked the dummy, he reaches the apex of the dummy's trajectory at the same time as it. He quickly extends his arms as he begins to float directly up under the dummy. The bandages from his arms quickly wrap around its body.<101>\n\n<10>Geo rapidly slams the dummy into the ground as they come out of the fall. The two of them hit the ground and Geo leaps away. The dummy at this point was completely destroyed. He smiles at it before yawning. \"Alrighty I got it down!\" He exclaims as he fist pumps before staring at Kinami. \"You up for another spar? Or d'ya want to trade Shoryuken for that intense kick you hit me with?\" He asks with a wink and a smile.<102><br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b> - Thu Dec 10 09:32:35 2015</b><font><hr><br><br>"

Upon releasing a strike, they release a concentrated, pressurized blast of air. The more skilled they are with this technique, they further away they can strike an enemy. This is nowhere near as powerful as Hirudora but requires at least Gate 1 to be opened and as such causes a great deal of strain on the individual.	<hr><br><html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2><align left)<b>Jutsu Name:</b>Pressure Fist ( Stance )<br><b>Jutsu Rank:</b>C~ B+</align><b>Jutsu Type:</b><br><hr><br>Taijutsu<br><br><b>Jutsu Element:</b>None<br><br><b>Jutsu Drain:</b>Close to 450 stamina Drain a turn<br><br>Jutsu Description: In this combat stance, the user's strikes all become a great deal slower as they are all focused upon being concentrated as much as possible. Each strike made whilst in this stance releases a non-visible, pressurized, burst of air comparable to the Pressure Fist technique. At higher levels of combat prowess, a master user of this combat stance is capable of chaining together strike combos which don't release their built up 'pressure' until the combo is completed.<hr><br><html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2><align left)<b>Jutsu Name:</b>Adrenal Overflow<br><b>Jutsu Rank:</b>Idk that's why I applied</align><b>Jutsu Type:</b><br><hr><br>*dabs* Buff<br><br><b>Jutsu Element:</b>Long Dick Style<br><br><b>Jutsu Drain:</b>???

As they punch, this energy is funnelled through their attack and is released in the form of a -massive- shockwave. This attack is capable of killing even the most durable individuals in, as the name states, one punch.<hr><br><html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2><align left)<b>Jutsu Name:</b>Alpha Counter<br><b>Jutsu Rank:</b>???</align><b>Jutsu Type:</b><br><hr><br>Taijutsu<br><br><b>Jutsu Element:</b>None<br><br><b>Jutsu Drain:</b>????<br><br>Jutsu Description: The user brings up their fist to block an incoming physical attack.
