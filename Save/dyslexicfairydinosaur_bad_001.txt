Ironically, for Sanoke's sight; even her clone had chakra on par with a Bijuu. That chakra began focusing in the clones hands, with the Doton element in the left and the Fuuton element in the right. For a moment, the clone prepared itself for the task ahead; knowing it was likely about to destroy itself.\n<p>\nThen, it would begin in ernest; channeling a third elemental chakra to hover before its hands. To Sanoke's eyes, these chakra's would then slowly begin to mix together; creating something entire new and incredibly powerful. To normal sight, a tiny golden speck would manifest infront of the Clones hands; steadily growing into a small sphere.\n<p>\nAs the sphere grew, so would the chakra supplying it; it was near blinding in its sheer power. A deep throated hum would start to resonate towards them, centering from the sphere; while it did, the concentration of her clone reached its peak. Lera herself could only hold this new element at a certain level before it lost stability; the clone being weaker than her, was even more limited by this fact.\n<p>\nAll at once, the sphere's circumference would grow exponentially; effectively removing both of the clones hands and rising its deep hum to ear shaking levels. As soon as she saw this, Lera clapped her hands and filled the gap between the walls; summoning several more layers of it for good measure. Then the explosion happened. A Bright golden light could be seen from behind the wall, the chakra expanding rapidly and effectively erasing everything in its path.\n<p>\nFortunately for Lera and Sanoke, they were both far enough away to escape damage; though the first layer of walls showed damage, parts of it simply missing. With a sigh, she lowered her walls and revealed the scene ahead; a crater had formed in place of her clone, sand was quickly filling it up. However, it seemed as if the sand from the crater was just...gone; completely destroyed on a sub-atanomical level.\n<p>\n\"So...what did you see?\"<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Please Refer to the logs of \"For Lera's LC, Key bugged\" - Fri Nov 20 21:37:55 2015</b><font><hr><br>Since my key got bugged I had to remake Lera on a different key.<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Dust (day 7) - Sat Nov 21 19:49:07 2015</b><font><hr><br>Lera formed a single handseal and created a clone, the clone would wander a short distance away towards the centre of the crater. At the same time, Lera would construct several layers of walls; with a gap in between the two so Momura and herself could see everything the clone did. With everything set, she nodded towards the clone and watched what it did with a ever so slight look of worry on herself. She'd already shown this to Sanoke, who could protect himself. Momura however, likely couldn't if it all went wrong.\n<p>\nThe clone would hold its arms outwards, facing its palms to open air. It would start concentrating humungous amounts of chakra into those palms, getting the amount right before it added the elemental composition. With a deep breath, it began in ernest; changing its left hand to Doton, its right to Fuuton and focusing a point of Katon chakra directly infront of its palms. Focusing on three elements was especially difficult, it was only due to expert control that she could do it at all.\n<p>\nAs the three chakras started to mix together, a tiny golden speck would appear in place of the katon chakra. Steadily growing until it was the size of a glowing golden golf ball of energy. Once it reached this point, a deep hum would suffuse through the air; betraying the little ball for something immensely powerful. It was only at this point her clones could keep control, being weaker than the original. After removing the skin from her palms though, Lera was reluctant to practice it without knowing she could definitely do it.\n<p>\nBreaking her from her thoughts, the clone let out a quiet grunt telling Lera that it could no longer keep control. Forming a final handseal, Lera closed up the gap in the walls; adding a few more layers before she grabbed Momura and rushed a little further backwards \"Brace yourself!\". The clone hidden behind the wolf would suddenly lose control of the sphere; having it expand rapidly with greater power than Lera had yet to achieve so far.\n<p>\nMomura and Lera were lucky to have moved backwards, the energy covered her walls; completely removing them from existence. A few more feet on the technique and the pair would have likely been killed. After a few more moments, the energy receded and the pair were able to view the devastation. Not only was the crater now twice the size it was previously. But everything touched by the explosion was completely gone, as if it had never existed.\n<p>\n\"Oh damn...sorry Momura, that was more powerful that last time.\"<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Training Kiyoko. - Sun Nov 22 15:14:46 2015</b><font><hr><br>Lera put her hands together in a clap, channeling chakra to her palm before thrusting it forwards. It released a blast of wind, a little more powerful than Divine wind but not powerful enough to cause serious damage.\n<p>\n\"This one is Gale Palm. Its stronger than Divine wind, but not as strong as Great Breakthrough. Its perfect for the next step up. In this one, the palm sort of acts as a booster; you 'push' the wind forwards and release it at the peak of your thrust. Let me show you~\"\n<p>\nAt this, Lera would attempt to go up behind Kiyoko and grip her gently by the wrist; pulling her arm back and then slowly pushing it forwards in a thrust.

The shuriken stayed straight until it was about the hit the rock. It was then that Kiyoko would be able to see her finger twitching, sending vibrations and movements down the wire. The Shuriken changed its course into a curve, making several circles around the rock and wrapping it in wire.\n<p>\n\"The key here is the wire. You have to be able to alter the shurikens direction with the most minimal of movements.

She then placed her fingers on Kiyoko's forhead and momentarily halted the womans chakra flow, before suddenly surging it. Kiyoko would notice he sudden break of Lera's genjutsu as well as the feeling of chakra surging through her body.\n<p>\n\"Another one that having great chakra control is usefu\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Teaching - Fri Dec  4 08:22:36 2015</b><font><hr><br>Hassan, Lera put her hands together in a simple handseal, channeling chakra into her legs and feet.

She studied it thoroughly, memorising every nuiance and hidden little nooks. With Lera's uncanny ability to memorise things photographically, it was easy to commit it to her memory. Once she'd learned all she could, she tucked the scroll back into her jacket and started walking. She sort of wanted to take this a little slower than her usual pace, knowing that training with Sanoke could be in store after the mission was done.\n<p>\nIt would have been easy just to summon thirty clones and have them search along with her; but that would leave her exhausted and unfit for any follow up training. That being said, she did make ten of them; sending them each off in different directions. At the same time, she would bite into her thumb and summon a wolf; a wolfs nose could be a useful thing when looking for something like a mine.\n<p>\nWhile her clones sank into the ground, she would continue walking; keeping her eyes peeled for any sign of a cave or mines system. She was also aware that the desert wasn't exactly the safest place in the world, what with all the wild predators and even the ocasional group of bandits. Her wolf barked out a warning however, when one such danger attempted to creep up on her.\n<p>\nShe spun around, facing what looked like a scorpion; extra large with a ridged carapice to protect the soft innards. It was about the size of a small puppy and it seemed to be targeting her wolf, rather than her. Big or not, it was still just a scorpion however. She reached behind her back and pulled Samehada out, holding it loosely in one hand. The scorpion barely had time to react when she slammed the weapon down upon it, cracking through its hard shell and crushing the soft innards.\n<p>\nWith a slight yawn, she turned away from the quickly cooling corpse and set back to walking; it was fortunate she was well trained, most of the dangers in this desert meant nothing to her. Looking around, she really could see no signs of any mines; but she wasn't really keen on the idea of reporting a failed mission, having not failed a single mission to date. Sighing to herself, she grabbed the wolf around its waist and lifted off\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Teaching - Wed Dec  9 13:24:16 2015</b><font><hr><br>Hassan, Lera formed her hands into a single seal, drawing in her breath and then releasing it in a twisting stream of wind. When she cut the wind off, she took a step back and started to explain.\n<p>\n\"This is called Divine Wind, probably the best jutsu to learn when your working with wind for the first time. Let me tell you how to access the element. Wind is like...a fine blade, finer than any physical blade. So thats what you should equate it too. I also find that ascociating elements with a colour, for me that makes tapping into them much easier. For example...\"\n<p>\nHolding up her thumb, she manifested a single flame \"Katon is Red.\" then on her index finger a droplet of water \"Suiton is dark blue\" on her middle finger a tiny spark \"Raiton is white blue\" on her third finger a small stone \"Doton is dark brown\" then finally on her little finger, a tiny shard of wind \"And Fuuton is green. I also coloured my own element, which is gold. Anyways, try accessing your Fuuton chakra.\"<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Transitionist (Day 10) - Thu Dec 10 13:35:47 2015</b><font><hr><br>Hassan, Lera split the wave of water sweeping towards her, swinging samehada down upon it. The training was starting to get repetitive, but she continued out of necessity more than anything. The improvement had been significant at least, not only with her ability to destroy oncoming Ninjutsu using Samehada; but also with her ability to transition between different elements and ninjutsu in general.\n<p>\nWith a smile, she placed samehada on her back and cracked her knuckles. Her clones, standing watching her a short distance away; returned her smile with smiled of their own. This was easily her favourite part of the training, trying to outspeed her two clones in ninjutsu. Obviously, her clones were not quite as strong as she was; but with the fact that their was two of them and only one of her, winning in speed had proven to be annoyingly difficult.\n<p>\nShe gave them no quarter though, immediately forming a single handseal to release a gargantuan wave straight for her two clones. The wave was abruptly stopped by a wall of mud, to which Lera replied by stringing another five handseals together and driving her hands towards the wave. There was still a stutter between jutsu, a slight hesitation that would get her killed in battle; but compared to the complete failures at the start of her training this was a huge improvement.\n<p>\nThe Lightning flowed through her hands and into the wave, energising it to the point where the entire wave flashed blue with it. However, her clones still had the upper hand in casting speed and they knew exactly what move she would take. One of them had already formed handseals perched on top of the wall, drawing in a breath even as she was releasing her Lightning. Then, a great gust of wind was abruptly released; smashing into her wave and tearing through the Raiton chakra like paper.\n<p>\nThe second clone followed up, also jumping to the top of the wall in order to release a simple flamethrower in her direction. It was all she could do to counter it, signing a single seal and spitting out her own stream of water. She still needed more speed, she had to mould the chakra faster...form the seals faster; she had to be unbeatable. The clones started moving, splitting up faster than she could catch them both with a jutsu. As it was, she formed yet more seals and released a hail on wind shards; only able to watch as the barrage travelled in between her two clones uselessly.\n<p>\nIn a few more moments, the clones were on either side of her, each forming their own seals in order to release a ball of flame and a small wave of water. Lera still wasn't quick enough, not to block both of the jutsu at once. Instead, she formed a single handseal and created a wall of mud to stop the flames. The wave however, slammed into her back; pusing her against the wall, if not for Samehada on her back consuming the wave...she might have actually suffered an injury.\n<p>\nWhat bruises she did recieve were instantly healed by the blades unique abilities. She gave a slight huff and slammed her hands together in more seals, deciding to just get rid of both the clones at once. When she exhaled, she began moving her head erratically, firing off clouds of powerful wind shards in all directions. The wind tore through both her mud wall and the two clones, dispersing them and leaving her with their exhaustion. She momentarily slumped before Samehada restored her stamina with the chakra it had eaten; she found it odd, how even now she was still learning new things about the blade. It seemed, the long they were together; the greater their bond became.<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Teaching. - Thu Dec 10 20:40:44 2015</b><font><hr><br>Hassan, Lera nodded her head and held up her other hand, between herself and Rias.\n<p>\n\"Raiton as an element is known for its ability to pierce, unlike wind which is known to cut. Highly concentrated Raiton can tear through earth like paper, which is why its quite a good counter for that jutsu you were talking about. When you imagine Raiton, imagine taking your chakra and rubbing it together; make it fast...fast enough to produce friction and sparks. I find that assigning a colour to each element makes things easier...for example.\"\n<p>\nWith her free hand, she began to manifest the elements on her thumbs and fingers. A red flame appeared on her thumb \"Katon is red.\" A deep blue droplet of water appeared on her index finger \"Suiton is dark blue\" A visible shard of wind appeared on her middle finger \"Fuuton is green.\" a tiny piece of dirt appeared on her third finger \"Doton is brown...and finally.\" a tiny spark appeared on her little finger \"Raiton is white blue.\"\n<p>\n\"The best way to learn how to access an element, is to experience it first hand...which is why I have to aplogise for this.\" Suddenly, a painful shock of Raiton ran through her arm and into her hand still clasping Rias'.
