Walking over towards the counter, she would explain to them that she was told to clean out the store. Upon doing that, she would merely nod her head once as she would begin to  do her work, slowly cleaning out the shop for the most part and placing the garbage she had found in  a black paper bag. She decided to only add this part before going back to the manor to do the real work as she got a bit confused as to what the Hokage really wanted.\n<br><br>\n\"I think he meant to throw the garbage out at his manor. .\" she mumbled, realizing it before she did more unneeded work.*)</li>\n<li>(*Higashi, Nori had ran back to the manor, quickly fumbling over and trying to pick up and drag the bags of garbage and what not that was near the side of the manor. She would hoist it over her back, slowly walking south and away from the area that she was around with a tired look plastered on her face. That was one of the many bags that were there.*)</li>\n<li>(*Higashi, Nori had continued to grab the garbage that she was being told to throw out, slowly pulling the black bags and dragging them over to the compaction heap to be destroyed and what not. She had to be careful to not use all of her weight while she threw the bag so she did not fall into it herself. Yes, she was that much of a light weight for her age, which said alot in some ways than one.*)</li>\n<li>(*Higashi, Nori //This was beginning to feel like a chore, which was probably a normal thing for it to feel at this point, arms slung the bag and walked it over a few miles away from the manor to the compaction heap, \"I thought this was a mission. . Not some exercise. .\" she mumbled to herself, lazilly throwing the black bag into the compaction heap, wincing only lightly.*)</li>\n<li>(*Higashi, Nori slowly would stagger a bit backwards, as she had seemed to have broken a sweat even after a short while of sifting back and forth. She decided to carry two bags instead, having only a short amount of garbage to throw out this time, she was only mentally happy that she was getting paid for this, which all in all was better to keep her mind going than anything else.*)</li>\n<li>(*Higashi, Nori was almost done with her session, already beginning to realize how much time had passed while she was doing this, she would decide to quickly finish up, throwing bag after bag, panting rigorously as she would throw the small bags into the trash compactor, panting as she would writhe in agony. So much garbage, so much smell!*)</li>\n<li>(*Higashi, Nori saw only two more bags in the small area which caused her to wince a bit. She thought that she had gotten all of the bags already, but it appeared she was wrong. Quickly swinging her bags into the compactor. .  . Well, bag. There was only one more left, of course.*)</li>\n<li>(*Higashi, Nori had merely inched her head to the side, feeling the aching area on her right arm, \"Okay. . Yeah. . Feel the burn. . Whoooo. . .\" she mumbled to herself, though at this point, she was practically almost done. She tried to rise the garbage bag onto the top of her head instead of her shoulder, trying to balance it out as she moved closer to the garbage compactor. upon throwing it, she would note all of the garbage bags were in the compactor before she forcefully pulled the lever down to watch the bags get crushed. She sighed, but felt a bit good to see all of those bags crushed.\n<br><br>\n\"Ahhh. . Blissfulness.\" she mumbled to herself.*)</li>"

She looked a bit around, though she pointed only to the man that seemed to be in his late thirties and was walking over towards the two, \"I gue--\" sure enough, she was right and she stoped her speech just to convey a light shrug of the shoulders.\n<br><br>\n\"Ready when you are.\" she said with a curt nod of approval.*)</li>\n<li>(*Higashi, Nori nods fo a moment, grasping onto the hilt of her tanto, \"Right.\" the older man looked at the young girl with a bit of suspicion, though Nori did not let it get to her as much as it might have been assumed. She just calmly unsheathed her blade and looked over to Takeda, \"Have you been to that country, Takeda?\" she asked with a tilt of the head, trying to convey a bit of conversation.\n<br><br>\n\"What about you?\" she asked the architect.*)</li>\n<li>(*Higashi, Nori inched her head to the side, \"I see. .\" she mumbled to herself, shrugging her shoulders as she would continue with their travel. She kept the blade close to herself, but just incase there was something to have gone down during this travel, she would merely take out a small piece of paper with a string on it, tying it on the pommel of the hilt of the tanto as they continued on their journey. While Nori was not known to fight, she could atleast use explosives. ..  A lot of them. . Boom, boom!*)</li>\n<li>(*Higashi, Nori 's ears quickly perked up as Hideyoshi called out her name. Eyes widening only for a short moment, she would nod, \"Yeah. . Just. . Not used to doing work that is outside the village before.\" she said, keeping a tight grip of the blade, \"I'll be alright. Really.\" she explained with a brief nod.*)</li>\n<li>(*Higashi, Nori had begun to walk a bit out of the path that Hideyoshi was going as she had forgotten a bit about them. . For just a second of course before she moved back behind the architect with a quiet few steps to make sure that no one noticed that she was away, \"It's not that far from here. . Right?\" she asked. For the most part, it did not seem like she had to do anything else, other than guard the guy. Everything seemed rather calm and relaxing to her, so maybe she could just lower her guard. . For just a moment. . And by just a moment, I mean letting go of the blade with her left hand. . Yeah, she was still on edge.*)</li>\n<li>(*Higashi, Nori sighed for a moment, yet nodded. The walk was not really something that she had mind, rather it was just patience which was her problem all in all. Arching a sharp brow for moment, she would look over towards Takeda as he spoke about something that was irrelevant to the mission, \"Oh! Well, it's been better. I tested a bit of the herbs on some injuries I had due to an experiment. . It actually healed pretty well, surprisingly. Though I do need to try and gather more herbs to experiment before I could actually say if they are good or not.\" she explained, seemingly a bit entranced on the herbs she had.\n<br><br>\n\"I also carried some for the trip incase there was any injuries or anything.\"*)</li>\n<li>(*Higashi, Nori had continued following behind the man with a brief yawn escaping her lips. She was slowly starting to get bored with the walking, but as soon as Hideyoshi said the were able to finally stop walking for the most part, an amount of relief washed over her face as she finally sat down. Her dead pan eyes looking around before she sat down with the architect, finally getting a bit of a break from walking.\n<br><br>\n\"Eh. . Is it about that err. .test?\" she asked, inching her head to the side, though of course she was still trying to tread carefully when speaking about something like that.*)</li>\n<li>(*Higashi, Nori shrugged her shoulders as she got up. That was a rather short break that had no real relaxation behind it. She sighed lightly, stretching for what it was worth before she followed, though this time it had appeared that she was to be leading them off the rest of the way, which to her seemed like a headache. Looking down for the most part with the same blank expression on her face, she would continue this, \"Uhh. . I think I see something now.\" she said to Takeda.*)</li>\n<li>(*Higashi, Nori nods a bit as they had finally reached their destination. She blinked a few times, inhaling deeply as she would just, \"This is really tiresome. . But! We finished, which is all that mattered really.\" she said with a nod as she was a bit surprised at the fact that Takeda had called up a caravan before hand, which made her sigh with some form of relief, \"That's. . actually good.\" she said, inching her head to the side as she would simply climb in the caravan, feeling more relaxed due to just hanging out with her feet resting.\n<br><br>\n\"Hmm. . Well, since he might not be here yet. . I guess we can get something to eat or whatever, if you like.\" she said, \"Though the village has been rather empty last time I went venturing around. . . But meh, kind of irrelevant.\" she said with a nod.*)</li>"

Although, it did seem to have it's benefit as a good style, so for now, he grabbed the one that seemed promising, shifting it to the side and just looked over the to his right to the weed herb next with a boring facial expression as he analyzed the roots and grass, the color and texture to see what it was called.*)<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Herbalist - Sun Nov  1 15:04:06 2015</b><font><hr><br>(*Higashi, Nori //Upon further investigation, his eyes narrowed as he would chuckle only a tad bit, turning the pages of the book and finding the name of it that best described what it was. A medicinal herb that was used to help with pain, but it did say it could get people dizzy and stuff which made Nori even more interested in the drug than the others for the most part. Quickly putting the amount of weed he had gathered in a neat patch, Nori's arm reached in to grab the next herb, a white lily herb.*)<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Herbalist - Sun Nov  1 15:05:48 2015</b><font><hr><br>(*Higashi, Nori was beginning to find a pattern of uses here.

His eyes were beginning to burn as he looked at the time, it was already getting a tad bit late, which was not good for him. Quickly closing up the book and shoving what was left of the herbs he gathered, he would heave a light hearted sigh, running a hand through his hair before packing up.*)<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Herbalist - Wed Nov  4 21:14:01 2015</b><font><hr><br>(*Higashi, Nori had entered into the hospital, getting ready to do a bit of work.

The other six were separate coca herbs and white lily and cornflower, two of each before sighing lightly.\n\n\"Okay. .

She wanted to see what it can do with her psyche the most since it was told to be a sense of euphoria, but before she could test it, she placed it to the side.\n\nAnother plant was in her mind to test out that she had almost neglected to do so in the first place. The sage herb which was close to the area itself. She grabbed at one of them that were in the bag and had begun to open up a small book to see how to ingest the flower in a regular fashion, slowly grinding it with the small pot and what not she had obtained before ingesting it from the mouth. For the most part she felt nothing.\n\nThen suddenly, a light wincing was felt as she was only a tad bit woozy, grasping onto her stomach. It did not set right with her at all. .

This time, instead of grinding it, she decided to pound it to the point the squishy liquids of it spread outwards into decent piles. She inched her head lightly to the side, peaked with literal curious intent on what she was to do next after all of this.\n\nQuickly writing it back and forth, she would sniff the fragrance only to feel a bit. . better. . She wrote a brief note on that, and pushed it away.
