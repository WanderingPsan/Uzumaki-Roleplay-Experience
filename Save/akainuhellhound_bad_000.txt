I need some of the best ninja to step up and do this mission and get the man back to the village since I cannot do it myself. There are 4 highly trained killers, they are not shinobi, but are capable fighters in their own right. They were taught by the Red Scorpion, a powerful man who resides deep in the desert who trains young souls. I need all 4 of these men, killed and disposed of as well as the Daimyo with extremely minor or no injuries at all.\n<hr><hr>\nIntelligence: \n<hr>\nName: John Dow (B)<br>\nAlias: Big Buck<br>\nProffession: Taijutsu Focused<br>\nSummary: This man is a foreigner from the land of fire. He is fairly big standing at 6'6\" and focuses on crushing his opponents with overwhelming strength, he possesses no genjutsu or ninjutsu, but is fully capable of ending a battle within a punch or two if landed directly.<br><br>\n\n<hr><hr>\nName: Ezikiel Moralles (B-)<br>\nAlias: The Blasphemous Priest<br>\nProffession: Undefined<br>\nSummary: Not much is known about him or his abilities, it is said that he is able to bend time and move inbetween time and space, but that is all speculation. It is known that he is capable of amazing feats in battle having beaten people much stronger than he and living to tell the tale with minor injuries.\n<br><br>\n<hr><hr>\nName: Megan Orien (C+)<br>\nAlias: Mean Megan of the Strings<br>\nProffession: Puppeteer / Medic<br>\nSummary: Mean Megan is known for her puppeting abilities, the way she has her puppets savagely fight for her gained her the name mean Megan. Combined with her skills for Medical abilities, her increased chakra control has given her extraordinary control over the puppets.<br><br>\n<hr><hr>\nName: Saddam Gdaffy (B+)<br>\nAlias: The Difference<br>\nProffession: Assassin<br>\nSummary: This is the boss of the group and his presence carries the most weight of course. He is extremely coercive and proficient at killing and sneaking around. Not only that, but his strength goes a long way, as far as every outpost fearing him and sheltering him, as well as the capital recognizing his strength and allowing him to run amuck. Most who experience his abilities die then and there, not much is known about him except his fighting style. He is quick, he is precise, and he only attacks for the vitals.<br><br>\n"

				profile2 = "(*ANBU Agent wuld test the speaker system and it would appear to work rather well. With that the agent would strap on the gear and head out Sunagakure quickly// \n\nThe three members making their way to Kumogakure would strategize a plan in order to kill the revoluntionist and his bodyguards. Looking at the information given to them the agent would pass around the desciption of the man causing an ursup. The information would read as follows, \n\n\"Steel Toe Joe is a master at Tai-Jutsu and Nin-jutsu, he apparently has an ability that allows him to control his tenketsu at will. So, High alert when opposing the target. Steel Toe Joe has paid merenaries to protect him and they're expected to be B rank bingo book shinobis from various villages.\" \n\nAs everyone took a nice look and read the information it would be agreed that the target would be taken out from the distance. Koji would act as bait, but would first give the numbers before approaching directy. \n\nAfter traveling covertly and out of the eyes of people the squad of Anbu would arrive in Kumogakure by nightfall. This wouldn't effect Koji's ability of sight at all as he activated his byakugan Koji would say, \n\n\"There's three body guards... One at the door and two outside the room of Steel Toe Joe. The house has one entrance and the one guard is guarding it. They're working in shifts it seems. No sign of radio communication use, or heavy chakra usage in any of their head to think of other uses to communicate. Also there are lanterns being used as a light source, and the house is for the most part wooden. How shall we approach?\" \n\nThe one anbu and the rest would sit at a distance out of sight of the enemy, and from public eye. It was a high point possibly trees or a neighboring cliff or something else logical. This agent watched like a true Owl. *)\n(*ANBU Agent couldn't use her scroll so she had to depend on her body during this mission; well until she was able to get her hands on a different color scroll, \"Alright.\". She wasn't planning on talking through this entire event nor was she planning on letting herself been known to others since she was an Anbu after all.\n\nShe had to be careful when she plans on using her paper jutsu. In this condition, she was going to slaughter others so this would have been an tolerable situation for her to use her techniques. Once they have arrived to the village, she gazes at the two then gave them a nod, the information she got from Koji was enough for her to make a tactics from it.\n\n\"Leave the rest to me..We'll have to make this quick..Really quick..I'll have my scout take out anything that will give us away ...The guy at the door is mines and the boss guy once you two handle the other guards....You two.....Aim for vital spots, cover their mouths so their voices can't be heard..\". She replies through the transistor. She didn't want to alert them so she used 'black' sheets of paper.\n\nOnce she had gave them the order--Well, the strategy, she believes they would be able to finish the job swiftly through what she had just said. Now that everything was prepared, her body started to break away, leaving only her torso, arms and head as hundred, thousands, of sheets spread throughout the area silently and stealthily.\n\nUsing a few sheets to create her small butterfly scouts, she allows them to enter the build slowly in search of anything like a radio, cam and Etc. If they found anything then without a doubt, they would have simply transform into normal sheets, bind them and crush them with a force-certainly this had to be out of the guard's eye sights.\n\nAfter that was complete, she allows her sheets to leave the shadows with a speed-binding the lad from head then to toe. She made sure that his mouth was cover along with his noses-clearly this was to stop him from many any more noise while at the same time, restraining his movements and choking him until his body shuts down and dies due to the lack of oxygen.\n\nDuring this process, she didn't want to keep him at the door so instead, she moved him away from his guard post into the darkness to suffer and die-painfully. Once he was dead, she whispers through the radio, \"One down..Finish the other two..We'll handle the bodies after worths..\". Giving them the element of surprise, she wanted to see how fast the two would have been able to kill the other two without making much noise.*)\n(*Ouichi, Ryutaro took a deep breath, and made a single handseal, in which case his chakra was sent out around the entire building fairly easily, the male took several steps forward. Taking notice of the guard's position just in time to see Ai kill one of them, the young male sighed, wondering what he should do. And Ultimately, he decided picking them off from a distance would be much more rewarding. He was monitoring their movements via, his technique.\n\nSo when he stepped back his hands were raised to chest level, he began to gather and mould his chakra, he placed a hand against the wall, testing it's durability. Before he simply took a deep breath, and exhaled sharply, wind escaped his lips, in a small compressed ball of air, which had an astonishing amount of power, breaking through the wall effortlessly and fast, it was almost silent.\n\nWithin a moment's notice, a second ball was released with only a mili-second of lag between the two of them. Aimed at taking on both guards at once, having the ability to pierce through metal, he was sure the guard's were more than finished with a single motion. And a well placed Wind bullet to the skull. He took a deep breath before stepping back.\n\nHe figured he could provide support to Koji once he was actually in the room since he was monitoring his movements. *)\n(*ANBU Agent sees all three guards are taken out this, and this was his time to act. Knowing the information on the target he knew one thing the target would be a bit faster than himself to react, so he set a trap for Steel Toe Joe. Koji knock over a lantern and delibrately stood infront of the door. Steel Toe Joe would come out yelling, \"Hey that stuff ai--!\" \n\nA small fire would begint to spread rapidly, and as the man realized it wasn't his body guard it would be too late. Steel Toe Joe would have stepped into Koji's eight-trigram circle. This would stick his tanto in the mans mouth and unleash 64 strikes to the man's main organs (Heart, Kidney, and Lungs). Though his points would be closed momentarily his organs would be devastated. Once, this was completed Koji would speak through his mike to Ai//\n\n\"Are you able to finish off? The target is immobilized.\" If the reply was positive Koji would head to knock over the rest of the lanterns and leave the premises. No one would have heard a thing during the tussle as the genlt fist was a silent and elegant practice. If the reply was negative Koji would set another dose of palms to the man, but this would be lethal. (The house would be set to blaze afterward regardless, and this was to prevent anyone from asking question.) \n\nIt would appear as a common fire with casualties. An accident....*"

				profile2 = "1.	Acquiring the first gate Koji wouldn't stop there as he needed the second gate to counteract the first, so that he may continue his assaults. For this he would train with goal of building up his stamina. Strapping on his weights he would head out, thus marking the start of his workout to the path of the Second Gate. \n2.	As Koji began to run he could feel the new weighted garb really bear down on him. Much more so than the boulder he carried a few training session ago! Running at a consistent pace he would brush through trees and bushes within the forest. As each breathe escapes his mouth the trail becomes ever more tiring. \n3.	Perilous though the track may be Koji would continue running. Talking himself up he would say, \"I haven't quit in the past when it was hard, so I have no excuse to quit now.\" This was going to be the hardest run he's ever done, but he knew when he finished he'd be ready for the perils that awaited him. \n4.	Still running, Koji would ponder why he has made so many enemies in his life being so young, but understood that his alignment was good and theirs evil at least in his eyes. He had seen people die out of carelessness of their murderers rather than an actual purpose. Though death comes for us all he wondered if could be a purpose for it. Being so young he knew he wouldn't find the answer just yet. As he pondered he would come across a large boulder blocking his path. He thought to climb, but found it more proper to hurdle it. \n5.	Picking up his speed he would he would begin to pivot forward one foot after another. Until he was in position to jump off his power leg. Leaping into the air Koji would make it twenty feet in the air! But, he needed more forward motion! Unable to physically bounce in the air he would reach out with both arms to grab a branch protruding from a large tree. \n6.	Now gripping the branch firmly he uses the already in action inertia acting upon his body from the jump to start a flipping motion. He would then release in a way to allow him to start passing over the giant boulder. As soon as he was over he would flip forward in a rapid rate until landing elegantly on his feet. Koji would immediately get back into his pace once more and continue the trail.\n7.	Koji activating his Byakugan would look into the distance and see it was safe as far as the eye could see, but he would note that the breeze would increase drastically as he moved forward. Speaking within his mind Koji would say, \"There could be a storm coming. I'll prepare.\" Placing a rain hoodie one swiftly, and eating a meal not knowing if the storm would ruin his rations.\n8.	As he ran on it would begin to pour lightly the wind would be fast, but not anything harmful to his health. Keeping pace the shinobi would activate Suimen to run above water, because he noticed that although the rain fell lightly it was continuous, thus causing a flood. \n9.	The Ninja was having a bit of fun not ever running above rising water before it was like a joy ride to him. As he trekked on he would pant ever so harder, but would not give in to the struggle that was beckoning him to stop and rest. \n10.	This training was meant to be increasing stamina and strength, so it was mandatory that he kept going even beyond his limits. And, then when he finally made it there! It would be mandatory to push even farther! Being pulled down due to the weight his Suimen would at times add more pressure upon the water. Not sinking the shinobi, but making his heart a bit anxious as the water rose and he sunk. He would have to pay attention to his chakra levels as he progressed.\n11.	The flood rising even more in height would half way engulf the forest itself in height. As he progressed he would comment the moon has never been closer. Looking up as he ran was even a struggle for the weight was pressing down ever harder on his body. Eyes cringing from the strain he was given no choice, but to keep running as the flood raged on this night and showed no sign of letting up. \n12.	 Water perpetually rising and Koji's strength perpetually falling it would soon be up to sheer will power to keep him moving. For if he quit he would drown under the high tide that now surfaced over the land. With the moon now rising he could only hope for the water level to deplete quickly, but using his Byakugan he saw no drainage system in the distance as of yet! \n13.	Running on fumes Koji is embraced by the stress of his weighted garments. Would lose control of his chakra every once in a while running. This was due to the fact that his Suimen had been in use all day, and that the weight of his vest was really straining him. Physically and spiritually the young teen was succumbing to fatigue as he trekked on.\n14.	The boy's muscles would cry out in agony through the skin as they pulsated, and his heart would whimper as every blood cell was steadily pumped through his body. This would of course mimic the effects of the Gate of Healing, because during that state blood will be forced throughout the body. This will of course be against the will of the body much like the Gate of Opening. \n15.	Steady carrying the extra weight the shinobi finally noticed that the water level began to lower slowly, but steadily he began to see more of the trees' stem. This scene was enough to fill him joy, but on top of that adrenaline from the expressed emotion started an extra flow of blood. Thus, reenergizing him further!\n16.	Now able to giant rocks and twigs again he is yet again energized. He is now reassured that life will not escape him this day, but in its stead death would. This was not the same for his exhaustion, because he still needed to press on as the water was not at a safe level to release his Suimen. \n17.	The boy would make great head way in his journey to overcome the limits of his stamina. But, that doesn't mean he would be able to quit! Koji's eyes would widen as he sees the flood finally release the land to the air. Without thought he would remove his Suimen, and feel land once more with great happiness. \n18.	As Koji had been running for a very long time he would stop to eat, and replenish his strength not wanting to succumb to disease of any sort he would bathe in a nearby waterfall. After, he would eat dinner by chasing down wild animals and gathering berries and other vegetables. He didn't bring but emergency rations which he would save for the most severe circumstance. \n19.	After having his nourishments Koji does the next best thing after a long workout. That is, sleep! He had been running not only through the day but the night as well! This will surely be necessary if his muscles are to recover healthily and fully! Making a comfortable padding with his camping material he lay down and sleep. \n20.	Awakening later in the evening Koji starts the day by having his nourishment, and doing his stretches before continuing the training once more. Applying his weighted gear and strapping on his camping attire Koji sets off sprinting once more! Breezing like the wind he would increase in speed and strength like no other before him. \n21.	The training would increase his overall strength, so his limits would grow through each challenge. Thus, making it difficult to jump right into the limit breaker Koji would have peril to the limits each and every time, but this was good! For he was becoming stronger and more proficient in his skills making him more of a threat to those that saw him as an enemy.\n22.	Thumping the ground as he ran he the grass fell beneath his progress, and the twigs cracked beneath his driving force. With the strong willed shinobi running through the forest he would press forward even under the weight of his garments. Though he moved as though an Olympic bodybuilder lugging a truck he would not quit! Though his legs cried out in pain like babies he would not quit!\n23.	This Koji doing better, this was Koji making his own way, this was Koji becoming stronger as seconds passed, and as minutes passed he would become greater and greater. He has tuned his mind and body together so that he may accomplish a goal he set in front of himself. He would become a champion of champions!\n24.	Crushing all opposition in nature Koji spoke the words, \"No weapon forged against the Lord shall prosper.\" Building confidence within himself he would press on. Wishing to be the reason that no weapon should prosper. He would see himself as the shield that broke those weapons. Carrying with him the spirit of Suna. \n25.	As he spoke to the sun glimmered brightly today bringing Koji the realization that it was beyond hotter than normal. Sweat would pierce out of his skin, and slip down his nostril and into his mouth. His lip would burn from the salt and legs would sting from not only the heat, but the running causing strain and friction between his muscles. He was again suffering at the hands of nature. \n26.	Pressing on he would quote again, \"No weapon forged against the Lord shall prosper.\" This would bring him strength carrying the heart and pride of Suna with him. If he died he wouldn't be able to complete any of his goals, so it was as if it wasn't an option for him. Muscles flexing each stride of the way, and sweat evaporating from the heat he would continue. \n27.	Taking a drink of water he would hydrate up as he ran within the sun, but this would only do so much for the ninja. Being that there was no shade around it was only logical to run until sun down. He didn't want to sit in one place exhausting in no gain whatsoever. \n28.	Going on there was never a night time for the Shinobi. Activating his Byakugan he would not see a tree within range, but he would force himself to keep pace and keep breaking the limits. Overcoming the conquering of fatigue and heat Koji would leave a trail of his print across the ground. Unknowingly he would leave his mark on the world as the weight of his garment forced his print onto the earth. \n29.	Drinking water in heavier amounts he would extinguish the last bit of water he had. Tunneling through the heat. Activating his Byakugan to see if there was anywhere near to rest Koji would find no such place. Though there was light outside it was would do him no different if he were in a pitch black cave. For there was nothing in sight for miles as he ran on he began to feel the tightening of his muscles. \n30.	Not having water would for sure dry him out, but he was able to force himself on. Raspy in breathe, and boiling from the heat of the unusual long day. Koji's vision would become hazy not seeing what's in front he would pass out due to the extreme heat. As he fades in and out of consciousness Koji would say, \"I will not stop.\" Thud*\n31.	Falling upon his knees, and twirling over on his back Koji would fall under a leaf of a tree. Mouth opened and leaf soaked with water from a leak above it. Would fall into Koji's mouth as he laid passed out, thus allowing him proper recover. \n32.	Upon waking up Koji would cough from a droplet entering his mouth. He would then cover his mouth and raise up to witness what's around the area. Scoping out the area with his Byakugan he would sense no danger in the immediate area. Noticing the leak from above on a canyon Koji would hoist himself up and begin to climb. \n33.	Gripping the rock he knew this would be great workout for his forearms and calves. Firmly gripping a protruding rock one after another. Gaining ground with each clutch positioning himself with his foot it would began to strain his calves. Keeping from falling Koji would find this canyon would not be easy getting up. Infested with rodents on the side the young teen began to palm them off. \n34.	This agitated them as a whole so they would begin to swarm the boy! Activating Suimen he stand tall and ready to crush the pests. Before beginning his assault he would say, \"You guys really messed up my training this was supposed to be a simple climbing exercise. ROTATION!\" Activating his jutsu he would obliterate these creatures in a single swoop.\n35.	Following the events of his attacks Koji would follow up by keeping his Suimen activated and run up this canyon! Sprinting up this canyon he would make it to the top in the blink of an eye! Upon making it to the exact edge he would flip above it and witness the scene above. There before him was a gardened spring!\n36.	A true chance to relax the young teen would embrace himself in the water drinking it and later bathing in it. This would revitalize his body completely especially after his well-earned nap. Setting up camp here Koji would pass out on the spot without hesitation!\n37.	Waking up refreshed and healthy Koji would start his training yet again. His pace would be faster than he started days ago. Galloping through the gardened spring he would end up in woods. Traversing rapidly he would make a grand distance within the woods before coming into contact with trouble.\n38.	Through his Byakugan he would see a pack of wolves blood thirsty in nature seek him out. They had been following him for a while now, and he had just hoped they'd leave him alone by instinct. That wasn't the case savage in nature it was clear they wanted blood. (NEW MOVE ENTERED)\n39.	Piercing through the forest trees Koji would take his stance and begin practicing a new technique. While training for the Gate of Opening. Taking his gentle fist stance he would begin to surge his chakra within his palm he would call it Gentle Fist Death Surge. \n40.	As he channels an immense amount of chakra into his palms he would strike a wolf with a single strike surging a lethal dose of chakra in a lethal organ causing an instant death, and destruction of the organ touched. Charging one of the beast quicker than it could react Koji would begin his assault. Striking the wolf, then sending a surge through the contact skull its brain would be wrecked. \n"

Moving on to the next he would say, \"Learning to channel my chakra through the first gate, and having such control over my kekkai genkai has made this move quite easy to learn, but it still needs work!\" As he charges the next he wishes for the attack to be in unison, as he makes contact there should be a surge large enough to erupt the victim's organ. \n42.	Attacking the second wolf he would make contact its Kidney! Incapacitating the beast he would then send a surge through the exact same spot. Causing the explosion of the organ, of course. As he completed this act he would rotate and set his eyes on the third wolf.\n43.	Focusing once more with his Byakugan Koji would strike for the beast's Lungs this would deal the same effect, but this wolf would die the harshest it will choke to death. Koji wouldn't quite yet master the timing of the attack. Thus, making it incomplete but he would continue to work on it. \n44.	Surviving the threat he would continue to run, run, and run until he reached his destination. Not yet tired he would pass tree after tree after tree. Then rock after rock beginning to pant harder and harder as he exerted himself through the rigorous training exercise. Never had he ran for such a distance in a time. As sleep escaped him he would continue to run. \n45.	\"They should call me the running man at this point.\" Koji would say jokingly to himself. As the moon rose, so did his fatigue but he wouldn't quit. The boy didn't want to sleep unless he flat out blacked out. Truly bold he was running without care. Running so much brought thoughts of Kenshin to his mind. \n46.	(I wonder if I can keep up with that guy, yet?) He thought to himself with a grin on his face. Picking up speed he goes to say, \"I get that fast, hmph.\" Now running even faster! Lugging that weight for so long it was as if it had become a part of his very being, but that didn't make it any less easy for the ninja. For the weight kept him from being light on his feet. Though he was used to it he needed to master the weight itself.\n47.	Three days the ninja would run, three days the ninja would go without rest, and pushing ever harder to surpass what limits he had. This was in hopes to gain more power, power to defend what he cherished. Be it moral, physical, or imaginary he did not care one bit. As long as he could protect what he cared deeply for. \n48.	It would be on the fourth day the ninja would seek rest to recuperate. He needed rest, his body craved nourishment and rest so that's exactly what he gave it. The boy would sleep for as long as he ran without any disturbances, and would wake to eat without any as well. \n49.	Starting the run that seemed never ending he would find trouble as he strapped on his gear from some pack of lions. Feeling up to the task he would again find practice for his new technique. Taking his stance he would shout, \"Gentle Fist Death Surge!\" And charge the behemoths! \n50.	 Sending the chakra within the tip of his hand it would begin to glow much like a light bug, and the shinobi Koji would target a single male Lion with this move. Prancing quickly he would strike towards its lung this attack had seemed effective at first, but another glance with his Byakugan would show it only severely damaged it. \n51.	This is good however because now he has found a point in which the chakra is capable of almost getting to the expectation. He no longer needed to surge more chakra in after impact was made on the tenketsu. This lion would be incapacitated for a while before it found death. Koji moving on would seek out another lion in the viscous pack. \n52.	Sizing the lion up it would charge this one was prideful. Koji could sense that much and wanted to give it a quick death for it. As this beast was a warrior by nature accepting the challenge Koji once more channeled his chakra. It would light again just as a light bug, and Koji understanding this would be enough would have made preparations for a follow up. \n53.	Now coming at the lion Koji would choose to strike at the skull. Piercing through the tall yellow grass Koji would increase his speed rapidly. Edging closer to the beast he begins to move his arm forward in motion. About to make contact he would prepare himself to send a surge of chakra through the beast after contact.\n54.	Tch* Koji's lit hand would make contact this would be enough to cause a severe brain damage, but not enough to kill. As Koji makes his observation he would send another surge of chakra through his hand. This of course would end the animal's life as we know it. Rotating on the defensive he would see one more anxious lion rearing itself for an attack. \n55.	Leaping towards Koji the lion has made its way high into the air. Exposing itself for an attack sliding under he would once again attempt to harness enough chakra in a single point to execute the beast quickly shouting, \"Gentle Fist Death Surge!\" Tch* \n56.	Touching the beast's heart this was a fast motion for as the lion leaped towards Koji he would slide beneath it. If he had no struck the beast instantly in a swift move it would mean his head surely! So, as he struck he noticed his chakra was tiny but sharp much like a dagger!\n57.	It was this dagger like chakra that at the end of his tip that sent the surge powerful enough to kill the beast. As the beast flew lifeless over Koji and he slid beneath it he would speak, \"Still needs work, but I like it...\" Staring at his new technique Gentle Fist Death Surge in its final form. \n58.	Wiping the dirt off of himself he began to run, and this time he would pray that it would stay uninterrupted. As he began to sprint he began to think about the weakness of his new technique. Noting that it is strictly close range, and will be noticeably easy to dodge. As the chakra will glow from the tip of his finger. He notes it will be up to him the user as well to be able to surprise the victim and be quick to utilize it. Otherwise, he'd be throwing away chakra during battle. \n59.	Carrying on the running it would make one last observation of the move, and that is it's still close range, and that puts he would seek a move that improves upon this new one. One that can increase his range if only slightly. The thought would be to extend it into a sword, but that will take more training. He would wait and see the progress of Gentle Fist Death Surge first. \n60.	With his mind set the ninja pushes through the exhaustion. Removing the sweat from his head he would march on through the pasture he would begin to see a mountain rise in the distance. Though it would still be far and a ways to travel on foot, but this was all part of the training. \n"

He so desperately sought through the world, keeping pace he would make a great distance. Bringing his knees to his chest to exert a more powerful thrust upon the ground.\n62.	Now at this point dashing through the field it would seem like he was but a black flash to the animals grazing around him, and yet Though he moved at this incredible speed it was like the mountain didn't come any closer. This agitated Koji for he noticed his lack of speed now, and he wanted to move faster. This would improve on his skill exponentially, but he was glad he was at least trying to improve upon himself. As it would be worse if he just sat around and did nothing. \n63.	Night would fall and the mountain wouldn't be any clearer Koji exerted himself a lot with the practice of his new technique, but would not stop regardless. As he wanted to make it to the mountain in a haste. He had made it a personal trial as well, and promised himself to take a nice rest when he actually arrived at the mountain. \n64.	Knees becoming lower and Koji's form becoming a bit sluggish he thought it would be a nice idea to stop and rest, but the pride in his heart wouldn't let him even if he ended up crawling the his pride would force him to keep moving forward. At this point rest was for the weak willed in his heart. \n65.	So he pressed on rigorously without stop, and the mountain that was once a glimmer of hope became an eyesore to our hero! He really became irritated and now questions whether or not he would attempt to destroy the mountain when he finally reach the Ginormous Mountain! In his head he began to imagine slicing the mountain with a giant chakra blade. That brought him quite the smile on his face as he struggled forward. \n66.	The mountain ever so far in the distance would escape Koji as he ran and as the moon became the sun, and the sun the moon. He would venture on and on running and running. At this point he didn't know why he was running, but he knew he needed to run so that's what he did. It was religion for him at this point, and he practiced it well. \n67.	Out of consciousness, but still running with extraordinary speed would continue forward without fail. He would eventually slow down to the point to where he would walk and drag himself by sheer will. As his feet flung within the dirt, arms limp like ropes, and head locked on the mountain. His eyes would fade to the stars and eventually shut Thump*\n68.	Passed out, he couldn't go anymore the shinobi teen had done all he could for as long as he could! Now waking up with the sun batting his eye with light would wake in shock. Seeking for his water canteen he would down the water, and nourishments and rest for the day. As the journey had tired him beyond reason. He would scout the area see there was no harm in the distance and pass the freak out. \n69.	Recovered to the best he could be in the wilderness he start the usual preps before the training, and then begin the training itself once more. Now better focused and filled with energy he was ready to close the distance between him and the mountain. He knew it would take a while but he was determined and that was the real factor for how this would playout. \n70.	With his target in sight he takes a runner's start and dashes off in the same motion. Nothing but flat land scattered across the area he would be able to see fresh green grass come up. As the closer he got to the mountain he could tell it had its own atmosphere. It wasn't eerie but had a sense of healing to it, of refreshment to it! \n71.	Something Koji had never encountered before but it brought a bit of serenity to him as he ran through the pasture. He even let go of the rage he harbored for the distant mountain! Matter of fact he had lost any ill will he may had coming into this area. It truly a good place to just sit and meditate. \n72.	Koji making headway but still seeing the mountain off in the distance would run harder and faster. Trying to overcome the trials of the heavy footed-ness caused by the weight of the garments. Putting all he had into this training program Koji wouldn't be discouraged by the distance of the mountain. \n73.	He would say, \"I started this run without the vision of the mountain in my eye's presence, so I can damn well finish this training with it in my eye's presence.\" With that stated to himself he pressed forward even more. Increasing his stamina even more! He was feeling stronger as the times passed, and this was more than enough to encourage his progress. \n74.	With the distance closing ever so slightly he would let the breathe escape him heavier and heavier as he pressed on. He would break the chains that held him back as he pressed on and on. It would be as if he was running away from something, but also at the same time running towards something! \n75.	Weakness to strength it seemed Koji was headed, but another look at it was from slavery to freedom! With each stride he took it would be another step toward freedom. As he grew in strength he would be able to make a move without question. It would be a new kind of feeling that's for sure. He would find that speed would be freedom.\n76.	As he sought that freedom though the chains would grow tight on him, and he would have to break these with each stride he took across this open pasture. Any mental blocks Koji would seek to destroy them as he ran. He would allow nothing to impede his efforts.\n77.	On the journey of becoming a speed monster Koji was still running. Even though his legs screamed out their pain, though his heart pounded on his chest to stop, and though his lungs attempted to suck away his breathe. It would all be for naught. \n78.	\"Finally.\" Koji would say as he ventured further into the pasture. He could see the edge of the mountain suppressed under luxurious plants and wildlife. The ninja would let out a sigh of relief for making it this far, and say, \"Let us rest a good while.\" Speaking to his mind, body, and soul*\n79.	Now able to rest peacefully it was as if the pasture around him nurtured him within his sleep. The torn muscles, and scars he had receives during his perilous journey would be healed. As the grass brushed over them gentle at the tip of their being. Truly this was an area not ever experienced by the shinobi before.\n80.	Upon waking up, the ninja would make his way toward the edge and begin to meditate in front of the mountain before climbing the behemoth, because it was if he was drawn to do such a thing within the pasture. It was as if this was necessary. So, he stood and he channeled within himself the gates unconsciously seeking the Gate of Healing within the pasture. \n"

Koji would feel as though he was running even though he stood in a single spot. It was as if the meditative state had transferred him back into the exact moment. As he ran in memory, he panted in present he had truly found a place in his mind to reside. \n82.	This would mimic the training Krillin and Gohan endured with Bulma as they flew to planet Namek. Koji running he would begin to notice that though he was in this meditative state. The conditions in which he ran were drastically changed. Leaping ahead full speed he wouldn't find himself in a desert on the outskirts of Suna, but a high grassy hill! \n83.	The hill being as high as the famous literature work of jack and the bean stalk. Koji would drop a jaw at such the immaculate structure. Wasting no time he would begin to hike this mountainous hill. Running up would be a small hassle, but once he arrived to a point where the hill began to elevate he would find struggle.\n84.	Not wanting to activate Suimen until he reached the point at which the hill was straight vertical. Koji would press forward almost as if he lunging this was due to the angle. He had to also keep a certain pace, or gravity itself would pull him down to the ground. If that happened it would mean sure death for the ninja. \n85.	Leaving Koji's mind for a brief moment we see that the ninja is actually sweating a load! The sweat piercing every pore on his skin, and escaping to the ground below. This is not all we can see the legs fidgeting along with the arms! He was truly in motion, and face was riddled with determination. \n86.	Going back within his mind the terrain of the hill had changed no longer green and lushes, but cold and rigid! It had become a freezer wasteland knowing he couldn't jump down, or make shelter on the side of an escalating hill. The young ninja kept moving, and would not slow in pace for if he did it would be over. As the heat from motion would keep his body warm, and thus surviving a frozen death. \n87.	His prints would be made into the high-inch snow, and yet his pace would not slow. Blizzard would bump his face, and yet he would not slow! Snow would fall into balls, and yet he would not slow! This ninja determined to live would defy all forms of death and press on ever more. \n88.	Moving higher up Koji has found the break in the storm as the sun began to pierce the cold. It would evaporate it all in a flash! As if the light was fire itself and in those moments The ninja knew this would not be in his favor later. \n89.	Though he would rejoice and even pick up pace to try, and hope he would make it to the top before he would become scrambled eggs under the scorching heat. The sweat did more burning that cooling on Koji's skin as he trekked up the mountain. He would begin to stare at his while he ran, because the sun was just too bright at this point. Scoping out the distance was a no go now.\n90.	Outside the perils of Koji's meditation we see that he's entered into the first gate of his chakra flow. The Gate of Opening as his limits are reached in this meditative state he would seek to go even further than full strength. \n91.	Surging with power the ninja still stood still with his eyes shut, but face as riddled as ever with determination. The boy's body was enduring just as well but you could tell it's frantic by the tightening of flesh. Even though he must've felt this pain it wouldn't remove him from the state he's in. \n92.	Within his mind the heat was wretched in nature the once green, and then snowy plane. Was now the land of ashes! There was no color except for black how Koji survived such brutality of the heat he'll never know. He simply said, \"It must be because I'm already burnt.\" Referring to his natural skin tone. \n93.	Moving forward at the same pace the heat felt as though it started to singe through Koji's garment. As he ran his backpack would go up into flames! Next his garments, then his shoes! After that his undergarments! Koji was straight naked now as he periled through the heat. \n94.	His feet would smoke upon touching the ground forcing him to become even faster on his feet! He would not be stopped by mere heat alone, or cold weather for that matter. Persevering thorough the pain the shinobi continued forward with great haste. \n95.	It was as if the man became light as a feather pressing on the land ever so gently, but keeping the speed remarkably fast altogether. He was perfecting his body's technique becoming one with his practice. This would make a great tai-jutsu specialist indeed. \n96.	Witnessing the strain on the body within the real world was devastating you could see the fatigue truly. His body gasping for life and rest you could say at the same time it simply begged for death. As even that would bring it freedom from the strain it was enduring, but Koji's spirit and soul told a different story! \n97.	Pursuing the dream ever more Koji would break the heat of the sun, and night would come with a cool breeze. This breeze would soothe the ninja, but it would be short lived. As the wind began to pick up it was as if the wind now tried to brush him off his balance. \n98.	With the force of wind increasing with every shot of gust made at him the shinobi of Suna would have no choice but to give in to such demands by nature! He knocked off the hill and sent pummeling to his death! Or, so we thought \n99.	As he was knocked down a flood would be rising one Koji would notice through his Byakugan. He would swiftly prepare his Suimen! Allowing himself to balance on the rising flood waters, and this would eventually bring the ninja not back from where fell, but to the top of the hill!\n100.	Landing now on the top of the hill naked to all! He would step of the water, and as he did this action the water would disperse into nothing. When his foot embraced the grass it was just as calmly embraced by the grass. Koji would be revived with extra-ordinary vigor. Getting rejuvenated he would again reach a new level of strength and speed as well. \n"

Opening his eyes the boy would feel no pain, but a boost in energy and in strength he had achieved it The Gate of Healing was unlocked finally, but this was not all as he opened his eyes and examined the area he saw that he had made it to the top of the mountain. Rather, he had already been there!\n102.	Scoping the area out would notice that the water, trees, and rocks on top of the mountain had been arranged in his clan's famous art Eight Tri Gram symbol. Standing in the center the young shinobi would train to master the art, and the Gate of Healing all at once. It was as if Koji had no control at this point it was all instinct.\n103.	Gathering his chakra this ninja would expel an amount that would allow him sense the area. Not from a wide amount, but fifteen feet allowing him to feel the disturbance of an oncoming attack that may be invisible to his eye.\n104.	Using the falling leaves and nuts would attempting to palm them as the fell over him. In an attempt to perfect his striking, speed, and endurance. This would go on for days! For the top of this mountain would produce a self-restoration factor by nature when it was appropriate, so Koji would train until that set time. \n105.	No longer able to tell time the hours would seem like eternity to the ninja. As he punched each leaf that fell they would begin to fall more rapidly. So, unable to keep up with this reaction the ninja would begin dodging. This was not only thanks to his eyes, but the chakra he emitted to sense the falling leaves. \n106.	Getting over run by the leaves Koji would rotate creating release an immense amount chakra! Stopping the leaves in their track, and at that very same moment the leaves would be rotated out of his vicinity. \n107.	As leaves landed the trees would retract to the edge of the Eight Tri Gram symbol. This was also the edge of the mountain itself! With the edges secured Koji would take his rest against the bark of the tree. He would be replenished of all necessary nourishment by the miracle of the mountain.\n108.	While still sleeping the ninja Koji would be rushed to the center of the Eight Tri Gram symbol by the trees retaking their original positions. It would be as if he was slapped awake and on his feet by the branches of the trees. Focus himself Koji activates his Byakugan, and as he takes his stance he begins to emit chakra from out his body. This was to sense of any incoming attacks he couldn't see. \n109.	The leaves would begin to fall upon the boy, and he wouldn't let a single leaf touch, or even brush the cloth of his shirt. This was him honing his reflexes as he needed much improvement in that area. As this happened the leaves would begin to pick up speed forcing the hands of Koji to strike. \n110.	Striking quickly the ninja would destroy each leaf due to the force of chakra being emitted. As the leaves shattered to dust the trees would begin to drop the leaves ever more quickly. The scene would imitate rainfall around Koji as he trained. \n111.	Sweating grilling off his arms Koji would engage himself in the stress of surpassing the limits of the human body. Teeth grit as he dodges and thrust a palm at the leaves with much effort. The ninja was trying to master the art of the Gentle Fist. \n112.	Feeling the pressure of being the last competent Hokuma clan member Koji must master himself, and the techniques so he can rejuvenate his clan. It was an ugly world and he wanted to add a mark of beauty to it. Even if it's small it will be something giving worth to this dark world. \n113.	With these thoughts rummaging through his head Koji was becoming more confident and determined. His mission became more and more clear! It was no longer about revenge, but something bigger than that! Than, himself Thrust* Thrust*\n114.	With each thrust Koji made the sweat broke off his head and onto the ground. Feeling each leaf penetrate his area of chakra field Koji would strike each with great precision. It was like he could see not only three-hundred and sixty degree, but in the dark as if the sun was out clear as day. \n115.	There was no hindrance in this man's sight. Much like his devotion to Flexus! Koji had found a new way to represent his late friend. This was by restoring his Clan it would bring respect and honor back to the desolate land. He wanted his people to be the shield of Suna and protect the village forever. \n\n116.	Having these thoughts as he trained Koji would begin to hit even faster within the Eight Tri Gram symbol. It was an epic fury at this point! As his heart rate increased from the thoughts of the future so did his punches and effort. Sensing the leaves falls ever more efficiently he would strike so rapidly! \n\n117.	It was as if he was seeing them in slow motion thrust after thrust there was time to maneuver. He was moving beyond comprehension at this point no one was stopping this motion! The trees could drop at a faster rate, nor drop anymore at this point. They were forced to retreat to the outer corners for the time being. \n\n118.	After the trees retreated the rocks within the Eight Tri Gram would begin to rise. And rocks the size of leaves would begin to trickle down upon Koji. As his chakra was still being emitted and Byakugan still active the ninja would begin thrusting out his palms once more! Koji was amazed at how quickly the scenes shifted. It was as if another mountain was just grown from the dirt!\n\n119.	This amazement wouldn't make the young ninja lose focus however. With the process continuing Koji would be forced to use all his strength! As the mountain had created a boulder to fall upon him, but as the boulder came crashing down it would trigger his chakra sensors. Prompting Koji to expel all his chakra using his clan's famous offense and defense rotation! Throwing away the giant rock to the distance. \n\n120.	This exertion would force him to his butt and blacking out. The healing property of the mountain would heal him once again with all he needed. Koji receiving all his nourishment would rest peacefully until the mountain deemed it was time to continue training. \n\n"

It would force him to say, \"What the Hell!\" Taking up his stance and activating his Byakugan Koji would begin his assault on the rocks as they fell mercilessly! Thrust* Thrust*\n\n122.	This time with each destruction of the rock instead of increasing in speed would increase in size! Forcing Koji to increase his chakra output in order to destroy this rock. Thus, depleting his chakra more quickly, because with each thrust it would require more and more. It was truly ironic that the mountain healed, but drained at the same time. \n\n123.	As hours passed Koji would push the limitations of his body even more. He wouldn't quit that was the motto of the day. Surging his chakra through these rocks now the size of cantaloupes it was becoming very hard for the ninja. He was exerting more than he ever imagined he would need to!\n\n124.	Arms would now tighten as he thrusted and retracted! Legs now stiff from keeping the stance his muscle were tired from the training, but he would carry on! The mountain training Koji would not kill the boy. Sensing his limits it would keep the rocks at a constant size this was to keep the rocks from crushing the ninja to death.  Because, if they got any bigger his chakra hits wouldn't be enough. \n\n125.	Keep in mind Koji has been keeping a constant speed of attacking these rocks as they grew in size. Not letting up for a moment! Being able to see and divert his movements in time to strike. Koji was gasping at this point, but not knowing the mountain wouldn't kill him would carry on. Thrusting and thrusting it would be the destruction of the rocks or Koji's body in Koji's mind. \n\n126.	Not being able to effectively keep up with the rainfall like rocks falling Koji's body would be blistered and swollen from the pounding! Not to mention scraped and bleeding from the sharp edges! It was a brutal sight to behold imagine nightsticks being pounded on an unarmed, untrained, and an ignorant civilian! And that is the image of Koji at the moment. Koji would get desperate now that his chakra reserves were getting low. \n\n127.	 Out of desperation Koji would rotate the rocks out to the distance, but this wouldn't end the assault. Now on his knees from exhaustion the rocks would continue to pound him. It was brutal his back would began to tear and scar in various places. His rotation couldn't safe him this time. \n\n128.	It would be in this time that Koji would began to get lost in thought. Remembering the fights he's lost in the past one that hurts him the most would be the one against Hassasn. Being defeated so easily by him really hurt his pride. The wind bullets he release back in Kiri that pounded him to a straight knock out in an instant was insulting. And this instance was exactly the same it began to infuriate him. \n\n129.	With that anger and devotion to not be as weak as he was in that past time Koji would stand. Slowly he would gather himself up with his knees shaking, and head being struck bare Koji would again stand on his feet. With the energy surging through him once more, but he was stronger this time. He could feel it The mountain could feel it \n\n130.	This reflected the Gate of Healing in many aspects, so Koji knew he was getting close to opening that gate once more. As he focus on the task at hand he would take no time to reflect on such trivial matters at this time. For the rocks began to fall rapidly, but not to the point of which he could not see. That being said he would strike with devastating power pounding the rocks into sand itself!\n\n131.	At this point Koji's eyes were glimmering with perseverance! Though his eyes appear blank. Anyone in the area would see as the veins pulsated chakra to his eyes the ninja was peering far through the present time. In fact you could tell he was staring a future enemy dead in the face, and he was staring back it was life or death.\n\n132.	The fury of heavy punches would continue without fail, and the stare would become even harder. Punches just as devastating as they started Koji would not be defeated by inanimate objects. Koji possessing already great stamina was now pushing himself to new heights of endurance. \n\n133.	He would at this point seem inhuman to the naked eye. No one should take such a pounding and live! Blood dripping down his forehead into his mouth Koji would spit and continue the barrage. Blood circulating even more rapidly Koji was feeling more than energetic! He was feeling elevated!\n\n134.	Koji would destroy so many rocks at a time it created a smoke around the area, but that wouldn't slow him down one bit! He would now run up the mountain and go on the offensive striking the rocks as the fell. He was full of power and energy and he was showing it, but it was time for him to slow down. \n\n135.	As he would fall without expectation to the ground unconscious as he did this the land below would change into a pond catching Koji peacefully. It would begin to heal him as floated within the water. Wounds and all! As if they never existed, but this was unique because it also sped up the muscle repair process. Allowing him to recuperate faster and grow in strength faster!\n\n136.	Waking up Koji would be on top of land feeling refreshed and energized, but would be on the bottom of the mountain once more. He was confused, but understood whatever that needed to be done was done. So, with that wisdom he began to run, run, and run \n\n137.	Passing through trees on the way he would be clothed with new threads as he passed through each one. Upon exiting the pasture he would slapped on the ass by a branch. It was a good luck tap, because the journey won't be easy as it wasn't near easy but impossible. \n\n138.	Sprinting through the valley Koji would note his movements were faster than is arrival. Now, going through the valley the ninja would press forward as he knew the weather would be harsh heading back, and wanted to make it as far as possible before night. There was a wind coming in and Koji knew not what it was bringing. \n\n139.	With each leg flexing forward, and foot stomping upon the ground it would be as if the world was standing still in Koji's eyes. With the wind increasing in speed it began to mask his face. Making it impossible to open his eyes and move his legs forward. \n\n140.	Koji trying to keep pace would find trouble with this task, because the force of the wind was creating a wall. One that was almost as stable as a building! He would be forced to leave the traditional running stance, and change them to a pushing-position. \n\n"

Activating the Gate of Opening he would roll out the strength need to bull doze through this heavy wind. Now finding a pace he is able to run efficiently at would let out a sigh of relief. \n\n142.	Keeping pace the wind would not let up, but increase in pressure! So much so it would feel as though he was swimming through wind itself. Legs though moving unchained to anything feels as if they're lugging trains. It was madness never before had Koji experienced such a force of nature. \n\n143.	Essentially blind due to the force of wind shutting his eyes. Koji was now running in the dark for the first time! It would be the first time in his life where he had to press forward without knowledge of what's around him. This would create an insecurity within him, but not enough to give.\n\n144.	Cautious now in his proceedings his pace would slow a bit, but images of Hassan's wind attack bulleting Koji unconscious. Would force Koji to push through without fail! He wasn't for losing again to his Lord so easily. With that cause Koji began to shout at the storm enraged, \"Do you think you can stop me?\" \n\n145.	Koji blindly would began moving forward still within Gate of Opening, and start thrusting his palms at the wind. Instead of pushing Koji would now palm his way through the wind. This was effective more so than the pushing he was doing earlier, so he did it continuously! Busting holes allowing him to move forward easily at a constant speed. Although not as fast as he was originally before the wind came. \n\n146.	With the wind still raging Koji would be at this limits in punching and running now! Using his Gate ability didn't help either as this drained his stamina, but having inhuman stamina he would push the threshold once on this journey. Quitting just wouldn't be in this guy's diary. \n\n147.	Pressing forward even more Koji's muscles would feel as though they were about to tear themselves open! Literally he could feel his rapid thrust over-working his arms, and the force required to move forward through the wind would also claim its toll! Unable to continue the wind would pick Koji up, and swing him about like a rag doll. \n\n148.	Heart beating intensely and breathe panting as if he was choking briefly. Koji would regain consciousness, and find himself back on the top of the mountain. Rejuvenated and fully healed. This would immediately encourage him to say, \"What the flying Fu--? Did I even leave?\" \n\n149.	Not staying with the pondering Koji would look down and see the Eight- Tri Gram symbol was gone from the top of the mountain, and would begin his hike down the mountain. Making it to the bottom now, and this time with the experience he would begin his run. \n\n150.	As Koji was running he couldn't help but reflect on the experience he had. He felt the exhaustion and pain, but couldn't make out how he ended back on the top of the mountain. But, then again how he came to the top in the first place was a mystery as well! Striding forward he wouldn't fret, because this is officially the finish stride of the finish. (Submitted)\n\n151.	Strutting to distance the mountain would begin to fade in the distance, and Koji again would be making headway. This time even faster than the time that seemed faster than the first time! He was astounded at the increase of speed, but he would save his acknowledgement of the fact until the end of training. \n\n152.	Survival at this point was the game no longer having rations the ninja would have to fight through exhaustion, hunger, and dehydration all at once. This was necessary in pushing the limitations of his body even more, but to also simulate the feeling of going to Gate of Healing for prolonged time. Striding forward his through the perils of journey Koji's body would ache from the excessive stress being put upon them.\n\n153.	The terrain was now rough and with each jolt off the land Koji would keep the pace up, but his breathe would be all but gone. It was if he was running in space at this point no air to be held! With his lungs collapsing in on themselves slowly but surely the strain of training was becoming great. Ignoring this fact Koji would press on without fail. \n\n154.	 After a few more hours Koji would be forced to rest against his will this was due to him slipping in mud. As he slipped he would bang his head onto a tree stomp, thus knocking him unconscious. Finally resting and allowing his body the proper rest his lungs to breathe easily, and heart rate to slow the young ninja would pass out soon after. \n\n155.	The light of the sun would beam right on to the face of Koji, and this would awaken him abruptly. Rubbing his forehead he would feel the knot from the fall, and say, \"I really do miss the properties of the mountain.\" Wasting no time he would take to his journey once more. \n\n156.	Feeling a bit advantageous Koji begins upping the scale of training within the forest he was in. Activating his Byakugan Koji would check to see if the branches were homes of anything dangerous. He didn't see anything for miles, so leaping into the air he decided to give his arms a bit of a tense workout today. Accomplishing this by swinging from branch to branch. \n\n157.	This would strengthen his grip, reflexes, and arm strength as he thrusted his weight forward. Now looking like a monkey in the high trees Koji felt a bit of relief, because he didn't have to keep the boring routine of running. He would attempt to swing this whole entire forest as a game, but if he loses his grip and falls to the ground he has to run the whole way. Not wanting that ordeal he starts to will through the exercise.\n\n158.	Whipping through trees like the wind itself Koji was anxious to get out of the forest. Missing his sand flooded village so much so it ached his heart to be away so long. Swoosh* Swoosh* was the sound made as he zipped through the trees he was becoming swift in his actions more so than ever before. \n\n159.	Now feeling the pressure in his arms Koji would use his Byakugan to look around, and ahead of himself to see if he could find any trouble brewing. Sure enough a blizzard seemed to be making its way over to our hero. Stopping on a branch of a thick tree Koji would take as many leaves as possible, and stuff them into his garments this would be to keep him as warm as possible. \n\n160.	With the leaves now in place the storm would come bellowing in with no warning, but thanks to his eyes he was given time to prepare. Taking the force of the blizzard with no regard to its power Koji would swing himself forward. As he moved through the air it would be as if the storm engulfed whole. Like a snake swallowing a deer. \n"

				profile2 = "161.	Upon jumping into the snow Koji would notice it was the end of the forest, so he started running once more. It was rough as the snow began to build on top of itself. From one inch to two inches, then to three to four. It would eventually lead to the ninja stomping through the snow instead of running, but that was no simple task as the thickness of the snow required much strength to break through. \n\n162.	He would be imitating bleacher exercises as he traversed through the ever rising snow, and with the cold it made his muscles more prone to locking up. He couldn't find warmth within this weather, and he was feeling as though he was becoming refrigerated. Truly an awful experience for the young ninja!\n\n163.	As time passed we would find Koji buried under snow like a standing coffin. It would be collapsing him under growing pressure, so he needed to act fast. Focusing himself and channeling his chakra Koji would release chakra from every point of his body. Breaking the snow that had subjugated him into the unfavorable predicament. \n\n164.	Now free he would run and run, but not effortlessly for the snow would now be building. So, with each step taken he would be elevated even higher than the last taken. He was reminded of when the flood happened earlier in his training, and filled with a bit of agitation. Due to the severity increasing this go around. Ignoring those feelings he needed to get back so he trekked forward and onward without fail. \n\n165.	Escaping death would be running high above the surface in deep thick snow. It would take a great force to not only remove his legs from the gaping holes, but to force them to jolt as the muscles within were freezing. It was as if he was breaking ice from his very bone structure with each trek forward. \n\n166.	 After some hundred miles Koji would find his way out of the blizzard, and into a spring like area where he found a lake to drink from. This was the first time on his way back that he found water, and he acted as such. Leaving his proper mannerism behind him Koji would dunk his full head into the water, and just engulf as much as he could. This was the miracle and rejuvenation he needed to return back home. \n\n167.	Beaten physically and spiritually Koji would rest this day wholly, and let his body recover from its shock. He was bearing more than he thought he ever would in his lifetime, but he truly felt he was on the road to be of the greats. With this thought in mind Koji would pass out from exhaustion. \n\n168.	As the ninja slept for days you could see the muscle twitch for days. They were working even in his sleep to repair. It was as if his body had a mind of its own separate from Koji! Like the bod itself knew what was ahead, and that Koji would need them to be top notch when he awoke. It was truly unnatural but then again this journey has been an unnatural one by far!\n\n169.	Waking up Koji's body was still aching soar, but he noticed land had ended at this point. What laid ahead of him was an ocean, and he had thought to run over it, but found swimming would give his body the exercise it needed. Hoisting his garments to the side he would dive into the ocean, and begin with the frog style feeling this would better suit his muscles. \n\n170.	Frogging through the ocean Koji would encounter savage winds and storms along with them, but that was part of the journey. Using his Byakugan he would pinpoint a flock of migrating birds. Allowing him to keep his navigation correct, and not entrapping him in an ignorant voyage. Thrusting his legs and feet back and forth an idea for a new move would pop into his mind. He called it \"Heavenly Spear\", but before he started practicing it he would have to see his beloved land once again.\n\n171.	Keeping the frog like motion going through the ocean Koji would be dealing with a lot! From muscle soreness to skin peeling due to the water drying and rubbing against his skin. Also dehydration hitting him much quicker due to the salt! It was worse than running he'd think to himself as he kept swimming onward. \n\n172.	Overcoming many obstacles of this journey he began to think this was the end. No longer able to move Koji was left a float with no energy. He had swam through the night and day, but made no progress closer to land. Though he saw birds within the air it was becoming hopeless for the ninja. Not knowing the distance he would have to go was starting to take its toll, and as he floated there he pondered on whether he had any strength left. \n\n173.	Koji would say, \"I've given my all! One hundred percent! Wat else do I need to give?\" Now Koji wasn't crazy he was shouting to the stars in the night sky as he heard one day they were past greats. He wanted their answer, he wanted to know what is greater than one hundred percent. Of course, he didn't get a reply mustering up his strength Koji would say, \"One hundred and one percent is better\" \n\n174.	Stressing forward he would continue swimming keeping in mind that one hundred and one percent is better than on hundred percent any day. Scooping the water, then kicking the water Koji would propel himself forward without hesitation now. The longer he stayed submersed the quicker death would come to the door. So, he trained on and on. \n\n175.	It would be a cloudless day and hotter than normal, but Koji wouldn't give to the pressure. He had been under unfathomable pressure through this whole training exercise, so he wouldn't give to more of it. Instead, he would champion it like that champion he sought to be! He would spread the glory of Suna with his skills making sure they were not only respected, but revered!\n\n176.	Lips dryer than sand and skin more pruned than a raisin Koji would finally find a coast. There he would lay and there he would sleep and rest, but not for long as the tide brushed his face. Making him get up and seek food and nourishment. He would find some off the trees farther into land. Even clothes were out hanging on some wires! After bathing he would put on the clothes, and rest in a tiny man-made hut already assembled. \n\n177.	Koji would sleeping for days, and this would give his body the rest needed to journey and train once more! This was comfort he hasn't felt in a long time, and really appreciated this moment. Awakening he felt physically and mentally restored and able to compete once more with the challenges of life! Throwing a hooded shirt over his head and tightening the stringed shorts upon his wait. Koji's body would resemble a well-crafted sculpture. \n\n178.	Taking out to the setting horizon Koji would run, and start to recognize the area just a bit! It warmed his heart greatly so much so he would fill an adrenaline rush as he brushed through the trees and grass. The sun would kiss instead of bite today, and it pleased him so as he ran home. He felt not only his power grow, but the love of his land as well. It was as if it missed him greatly.\n\n179.	Leaving the forest he would now make it to a desert, and he would kneel down in it, and pray to God with a thankful heart! Koji would say, \"Now that I've given my thanks let us get home with our new strength. Opening the first gate Koji would sprint forward as fast as he could humanly go! He was using 100 percent of the body's abilities. \n\n180.	Pulling up sand from the ground as he ran Koji wouldn't let up for nothing wanting to see his home he would sprint full speed ahead. It didn't and wouldn't torment him that he was miles away still from home. He wouldn't let his own inefficiency be the reason he couldn't make it home. \n"

				profile2 = "181.	Opening the limits of the human felt nice to Koji as he ran with the power of the Gate of Opening. He actually began to reflect on how he came to know about limit-breakers on this journey. He would come to so many obstacles in so many forms. He knew that he wouldn't and couldn't forget these lessons learned, because they were the reason he was able to obtain another power.\n\n182.	One that would make him even more respected and revered as shinobi of Sunagakure! Jolting even faster Koji would pursue his target at even greater speed. The anxiety was really getting to him. This was unlike his normal behavior, but he had missed his home and couldn't wait any longer. The sun would begin to ravage the Suna ninja at this point. \n\n183.	Of course not caring for such matter Koji kept pressing onward with what he deemed his mission now, because his training would be complete until he ran through the village's gate. Using is Byakugan he couldn't see the village quite yet, but he wouldn't stop until it surfaced itself above the sand dunes. \n\n184.	Koji as ran would see the wildlife all around him, and say, \"Its been so long I'm happy to be back.\" Running Koji would begin to jump off one leg every few paces to give his legs more exercise. Muscles naturally flexed would glimmer within the sunlight as the sweat escaped through the pores of his skin. \n\n185.	With more time passing Koji couldn't see the village just yet, but his reserves of energy was running low. He had to make a decision to stop, or keep going. You can imagine the choice he made. Without hesitation he would keep moving forward with great devotion! \n\n186.	Now feeling it's time Koji would focus himself to open the Gate of Healing!  Allowing another burst of energy and power to his body! This would cause many mini stable craters beneath his feet as he ran toward Suna. The wind would fill the holes with sand as he dashed forward however covering his traces. \n\n187.	Now able to go this mode at choice due to his extensive training. The fruits of his labor has prospered greatly. Smirking Koji would move more persistently toward the village. Within his haste he would feel even more jolts of energy surge through his body. As the Suna was now visible to his Byakugan!\n\n188.	It would be intervene by some intruding giant scorpions however, and Koji wasn't in the mood to deal. So as he ran would slide keeping all his momentum as he activated his rotation in unison with his speed. Causing the speed to increase rapidly to the point it shredded the beast into pieces! While ending the rotation Koji would keep his speed, and reform his stride heading back to Suna. \n\n189.	Now within the naked eye view Koji would deactivate his Gates, and fall flat on his face within the gates of the village. Villagers and nurses would carry the Left Hand of Suna to the recovery building. There he would rest and recover for the required time instructed by the nurses. After this he would be greeted to a fine meal that would restore his strength and energy. (Submitted)\n\n190.	Exiting the medical center Koji would go and do his last bit of training. Something simple something he had started his training regime with. Running fifty miles, doing six-hundred squats, and six-hundred pull-ups. Putting on his training garments would head out soon after. \n\n191.	Taking the usual route Koji would be sprinting through the village using Byakugan to make sure all was well, and today it seemed that way. No longer raspy in breathe when he ran, and lungs feeling as though he was walking the ninja would smile looking up in the night sky. \"Can I become one of the stars of the night?\" Koji would ask. \n\n192.	Completing the run Koji would make his way to a tree with a thick branch. Once there he would take his position and begin squatting. Counting each one out loud he would note how his legs had lost that burning sensation he once started with. But, the tediousness of the workout still lingered, and he hated that mostly out of this self-designed workout.\n\n193.	Making it halfway through the workout Koji decided to back flips to get the feels going through his legs. With each pop up he would simultaneously plop into an elegant backflip. This would continue for hours until he finished the said workout! The sun would soon be rising now as time passed. \n\n194.	Finishing his last flip squat Koji would land, but instead grab hold of the above branch and begin his pull-ups. With time flying by he was delighted to see that the workout was not killing him like in the past. A smile would again surface on his face from the acknowledgement of his growth. \n\n195.	With day break Koji would have completed his first set, and would have repeated this process three times over. After that he would have walked home for bathing, nourishments, and bed. This would be the first time Koji walked himself home for bed after training. \n\n196.	Three days would pass and Koji would stay sleep undisturbed his muscles and organs would be refining themselves in this time, and his spirit would be as well. He was becoming strongly altogether in mind, body, and spirit.  Should he make a long life Koji would be a great in no time. \n\n197.	Awakening Koji would set out after doing his required chores such as eating and hygenes. Going out to his trusty tree Koji would begin striking it, and rotating after each set. This was to help reflexes and attack speed. Koji didn't want to slip on his techniques just because his athleticism was improving. \n\n198.	Hours would pass but Koji would still work on his gentle fist art, and eight tri-gram jutsu. He was dedicated in his proceedings and this was due to the standards he's set for himself. Wanting to leave a mark on the world somehow he figured his dedication would be a good way to start. He needed his clan to see his ways, and know how they should be in the future should he not be there to guide them.\n\n199.	On his last rotation the young ninja would pass out from exhaustion, but he wouldn't left there a villager watching would help him to his home. There he would rest, and be nourished back to good health. Koji would awaken in front of a welcoming meal, and he would thankfully devour it!\n\n200.	Upon finishing his meal the shinobi would strap on his gear and set his mind to training once more. Walking out the door he would thank the villager of Suna, and say, \"Keep up the good patriotism.\" That said he walk out the door to begin another journey one that would empower him even more \n"

				profile2 = "101.	After sparring and having a few mission Koji would realize he hadn't yet mastered the Gate of Healing. But, he would not be deterred from that fact and would reflect even more on the past events. The reflection he put himself in gave him the knowledge that his journey had gave him the building blocks to fully unlocking, and being half way there he wouldn't just stop in the face of adversity. With that wisdom in his mind Koji would strap on his gear, and walk out to begin his training once more. Eyes focused and body screaming for more training he would answer its prayers. Exiting the area, Koji made his way to an enormous rock within the desert the size of a tower! After sizing the solid earth up Koji would begin thrusting his legs toward it with whirlwind kick. Hitting high and low Koji would start the destruction of this giant rock \n102.	Koji would be unleashing savage kicks from the whirlwind kick jutsu of Konohagakure. This would be putting the minimal size of scratches on the behemoth of dirt. Koji would need to increase his strength, and this was the best way of doing. Able to move faster than he ever could before he would now aim to strike harder than ever before! Kicking the rock viscously with each turn of the body, and as he landed he would unleash his clan's rotation. Tearing the skin of the rock ever so slightly.  \n103.	 At the end of the jutsu Koji would begin to chain his attacks together in unison with each other. To the untrained eye he would seems like a tornado in the sand! Everything in the sand would be picked up, and thrown toward the giant rock! Be it sand, pebbles, or Koji's legs it would bang against the obstruction with great force. The rock would start to shake, but it would not crumble down to sand just yet. If one were to come in close contact with the giant rock one could see the marks made by the impacts of Koji. As the time passed the swirling ninja would press on trying to reach his threshold, and then once there he would pass it. \n104.	Continuing the rotating process the ninja would strike the rock even harder! With each contact sweat would break his limbs and forehead. This was due more so of the glamourous sun in the sky, rather than the extent of his training. As the day progressed even further, however, he would begin to feel the fatigue.  The pain itself would begin to effect the boy's progress in his training, and he would need to start trying to overcome the pain mentally. \n105.	It would be more aching than extreme exhaustion as his body would begin to actually be bruising his body. He would feel his legs swell form the repetitive cycle of attacks upon the giant rocks. Not wanting to give in to his weakness Koji would persevere through the pain, and continue the furious swipes of whirlwind kicks. As he leaped Koji would cringe due to the pain, but his form would be sacrificed. He would make contact splendidly, and finish with a powerful rotation once more. \n106.	Now nightfall Koji would limp his way home for rest. As the training had took its toll on the young ninja, and he needed to recover. On his way home he would pay a visit to the village's medic, and that would allow him to be healed rather quickly. But he still needed the proper rest, so that his muscle would grow in strength. After having a bowl of garlic ramen filled with tother nourishment. He rested for the night, and was awoken abruptly to begin a mission. \n107.	This mission entailed was a viscous one as he fought a giant fly monster that extended 30 meters in size! It would have taken the group of Koji, Izanami, Tetsumi, Marissa, Trilliam, and Bryson. During the climax of the battle it would take Koji's gentle fist technique to weaken the beast's enhanced armor. With rapid speed Koji would charge the beast too quickly for it to react! Sliding under the giant bug he would palm the bug five times, and rotate the beast off its balance and into the dirt with the help of Marissa's wind technique. The events would pass rather fast after this, and Koji wouldn't expel much energy on this mission. \n108.	Now back at the village Koji would continue his training this was because of the grace of Fujitora! Koji would asked Fuji if he would train him in the art of the sword, and he obliged with the requirement that Koji would go through his maze. Heading toward the arena Koji would practice his swings for hours!\n109.	Swoosh* Swoosh* was the sound made as he swung through the air with the wooden sword. Not knowing the basics of swordplay Koji would swing hard up and down trying to rip apart the very air around him. He figured it would take great strength to wield a sword, so he was preparing himself for the wielding of a blade. With sweat releasing itself from the pores of the skin, Koji would change the motion from vertical to horizontal keeping the force the same as earlier. As he tenses up would activate his Byakugan thinking he could find the source of the perfect technique through the swords structure. However, that would not be the case.\n110.	Continuing to strike harshly Koji would let out grunts and straining sounds as he kept the pressure up. He was going to master this technique at any cost, because once he set his mind to something that would be it. He wouldn't stop until the goal was met, or his body met with the dirt itself. Time would pass and as Koji heard the words of Fuji he would continue striking ferociously within the air. Koji would find that concept difficult basically having the use of the technique since childhood, but he would heed the words of his master. Closing his eyes Koji would soothe the tension he had in his grip and swing as well. His swings instantly became more fluent in nature. With each swing he would follow through with another.\n111.	Upward, downward, downward, and upward Koji would engrave the words of Fuji in his mind. As his eyes were shut the ninja would begin to enter a meditative state. Much like the ones when he travels down his inner chakra pathways to open the Gates. Imagining various fruits being sliced by a blade elegantly, but at the same time fiercely. A smile would escape into real life as he called himself a fruit ninja within his head.  After some time Koji would fashion other material things in his mind as he swung the wooden sword in real life. Such as rocks, shoes, leaves, wood, and hats These things would come at him at random, and he would swing in an appropriate manner. Koji would begin getting the sense of this skill just a little bit each swipe. \n112.	Within his mind the items would come toward him at a more rapid rate than before, and this caused him to pick up the speed in reality. Sweat jumping from him arm and onto the ground, and sweat falling from his forehead into his perked lips. Koji was working up a sweat cutting the air, and he wouldn't stop anytime soon having the ability to going to his natural ability to last. \n113.	Koji would pass out from swinging, and as he rested you see the twitching of various muscles in his arm and back. The rapid swings, and combative mission before totaled up to be a harsh training regime on his body, but this was all accepted by Koji, because he was determined to train his body to unlock the Gate of Healing. Being carried to his home in his unconscious state Koji's muscles would rebuild for the next day. Awakening the next morning he would get his daily nourishment, so that he'll be able to keep up the extensive training. After the meal he would be instructed to patrol the village by Lord Hassan. \n114.	After returning from his mission Koji would see himself back in front of the giant rock he was targeting the other day. Positioning himself the ninja would start to unleash a leaf whirlwind upon the giant earth! Leaping into the air he would begin to twirl as a feint, and as he came lower to the ground he would strike the rock harshly with a low round-house kick. He would make no more progress than before, but he could perceive the strength in his leg had increased. As the pain didn't irk him as strongly as he had first perceived at the beginning of his training. He would line up again readying himself to kick. \n115.	Performing another round-house kick Koji would begin to chip away at the rock once more. Though his kicks we powerful the behemoth could take this beating with ease. To the heart of Koji it was as if the rock mas mocking him, and in the moment he felt that sensation he would open the First Gate and strike once more with Leaf Whirlwind! Cracks would now surface from kicks and the boulder would rattle, but still it would stand prideful against the attacks of Koji. \n116.	As the onslaught continues night would come, but the ninja would not falter to fatigue! The ninja would have created a down engraving within the ground, and this would be due to the round-house kicks placed upon the rock. After each spin followed a kick, and after every spin followed another kick. Koji would be choking on the air he so depended on due to the rapid movement involved in the training. Still within the Gate of Opening Koji would be unleashing savage blows. Villagers would watch in awe as they had never seen anyone last so long in such a state. \n117.	Becoming the best at his profession would require Koji to surpass anything he thought possible of himself. With that though process and as the sweat and air escaped his body in a large mass he would continue to strike the unyielding rock before him. Pressing off the ground cause it to crack under the pressure he hit this rock even heavier than before! Upon contact the rock would resonate from the shock of Koji's impact, but instead of cracking it would shift. Now it leaned rather than standing tall. \n118.	Now staring down the now crooked rock he again attack the rock, but now his legs would start to become exhausted from the pain. It wouldn't help that he had to leap as well at this point the acrobatics, and the attacking was becoming too much, however, Koji wouldn't falter just yet! He had set in motion a new plan to lay the crooked rock on its side fully. He would accomplish at any cost At least that's the tale of his eyes. Taking his stance once more the ninja would propel himself into the air once more shouting, \"Leaf Whirlwind!\" Making contact he would shake the rock once more, and he would have successfully tilt just a tad. \n119.	Not feeling happy about the results as of yet Koji would rear himself up for another attack. Focusing on the task at hand he would charge himself with all the energy and chakra he had. While mustering the strength to hold the first Gate as long as possible as this would be key if hoped to obtain the Gate of Healing. Ready to unleash another attack Koji grits his teeth, and then shouts, \"Gargh!\" Pushing off the ground once more causing an even bigger dent to occur within the dirt, and he would spin so rapidly he would appear to be a spin top in mid-air! He would strike in mid-air, and cringe a little due to the pain, however, he would keep his composure. As he was being lowered by gravity he saw the boulder was beginning to tilt he would waste no time to follow up. \n120.	With the rock now in motion Koji would channel the momentum, and as he came to the ground he would direct it to his lower kick. This would be the strike to do it! As his leg flung slightly above ground level he would spin three-hundred and sixty degrees, and land a powerful thrusted kick onto the rock. His leg would rattle along with the rock. His head would fling back from the sensation of the pain, and the Gate of Opening would be released in that same moment! The shock would cause him to fling himself back as if he were struck by lightning, thus putting him a fair distance away from the falling rock.\n121.	Gathering himself Koji would notice the rock now falling fully horizontal now, and he would say very slightly, \"Yes\"! Before passing out from exhaustion, but he would not be left there in agony. The villagers that watched would see the boy training, and they would carry him to the town's medic where he would be rejuvenated in health. Koji would then walk home, and receive the necessary nourishment to reconstitute his body. Then, he would get the proper rest needed to allow his strength to grow. This was all needed if he hoped to not only destroy the rock, but surpass the limitations of his body as well.\n122.	Fully recuperated now will head out, and start his strength training once more. Lining himself up with the now Horizontal flat behemoth of a stone Koji would take his stance, and strike the stone with a high flying kick! He would shout, \"Dynamic Entry\"! With succession of the attack he would brush the dust off the matter that laid before him, but that would be all. Koji say, \"I knew it wouldn't crack from that, but that was just warm up.\" Smirking he would Open the Gate of Opening as he took the stance of Vegeta going Super Saiyan. After this he would go ham with his own stance called the Harden Gentle Fist. This would allow him to palm, but with more power enforced. Koji would strike the boulder left and right without hesitation. \n123.	The blows applied would be fierce and rapid in nature each palm attack he would indent on the rock, but not able to break. Hours would pass and with the last of his gentle fist strike Koji would back away, and come back in with a Dynamic Entry  on the this time with greater force as he was in the state of Gate of Opening. With the added effects he would cause a crack to surface vertically in the rock, but small only seen up close. He would say, \"Your time is soon.\" \n124.	After speaking those words Koji would begin to palm and kick the rock harder and harder. This was all while sustaining the Gate of Opening. As he used his body to the fullest of its potential, and though the boulder may have had dents and cracks The massive heap of matter stood strong. The sand would vibrate around the stone and ninja as he struck at the thing, but still to no avail it would remain intact. With a will as hard as the boulder he was targeting Koji would strike hard with determination and power. You could hear the crashes of his attacks through the village as he trained it would be as thunder. \n125.	Night would finally come, and Koji would be low on reserves due to the series of attacks. Not able to able to turn the rock to dust ached his body and pride, but he would continue on though hurting in spirit and body. He would crush the obstacle no matter what gathering his strength once more Koji would unleash a hard Dynamic Entry onto the rock, and he would finally hear a crack. It would mimic the sound of someone crunching on a large amount of potato chips at one time! A weak smile would escape the now frail muscles of Koji's face. Performing at full potential has caused much stress on the boy, but he had been persevering through it. \n126.	Contacting a mighty blow to the rock Koji would sense that there was only a single hit needed, but it would have to be powerful. So, as he landed the high flying kick to the rock Koji would propel off, and rotate into a round-house kick making contact with his heel. As he did this he would cough up the words, \"Leaf Whirlwind.\" And fall to the ground, as he gave himself up to gravity he would see multiple cracks appear on the rock. This would happen as he fell eye level with the thing, and before he could blink the stone would be in smoke and rubble form.  Prompting Koji to say as he fell fainted into the sand, \"You're not so tough\". \n127.	As luck would have t a team of Suna's medical ninja would spot Koji lying sprawled out on the ground. Examining his body they would see the bruises and scar upon his limbs, and begin to treat him on the spot. When they were finished they would take the boy back to the recovery room. There he would awaken with his bandages on his limbs, and he would say, \"I like the way these look. I'm taking these\"! After that, Koji would have himself a giant meal, and allow his body to recover before heading out to train once more. As this was necessary for the body to grow stronger. \n128.	Now that his strength had grown Koji felt closer to truly unlocking the Gate of Healing, but he had to be sure so he had set out on a run to find another feat to conquer. Koji would run seventy-miles in the desert in search of an obstacle, but he would find none so he kept running. On his way back after another seventy-miles Koji would come across a giant cactus, and the size baffled him! As he had never seen one so great in size he would run the distance to it! \n129.	Upon arriving he tell himself, \"Bring it down\". Activating his Byakugan he would note that this wasn't an ordinary cactus it had surged with chakra, and it was all directed toward its needles. Koji well prepared to deal with such a feat within the desert would channel his chakra, and enter the gentle fist stance. He would leap into the air and begin to strike the needles that were protruding. As he struck he would notice that the cactus would rotate, thus swinging needles toward him. He would note the oddity and use the needles that swung toward him as steps. Striking the arm's length away needles. This would create training for his reflexes and attack speed surely!\n130.	Stepping upon rapid spinning needles on a giant cactus Koji would find himself trapped! On what seemed to be an infinite loop on a tread-mill. His legs would be worked as they lunged and jumped to the next higher platform of needles. And his arms would be worked at they struck out to attack the approaching needles as he leaped and landed! It would all be a rather quick and continuous process causing fatigue to sit in quickly. He wouldn't give in that easily though sooner or later this thing would have to stop. As it would cause a massive sink hole if it didn't. \n131.	Hours would pass and the spinning would have seem to have increased, thus making the trial ever more treacherous. Koji a bit winded would keep leaping and striking. This would strain his muscles, but he was no stranger to this as he had faced many trials before this! With each palm strike his arms would now tighten, and with each leap his leg would tighten! There would come a point where his body would give, and he would plummet to the sand. Of course the sand would catch him, but it wouldn't be pleasant. Once he landed he would be knocked unconscious. \n132.	Upon awakening he noticed he had been away from the village a bit longer than he wanted, so he had returned. This would be a journey of one hundred and forty miles. He would have no water, and it would be a two hour run at the least. It would be a journey of sheer will power! As he stormed through the desert on foot. His legs work cry out in agony, and lungs would choke on the sand that blew in the wind. This was awful for the ninja that goes by Koji, but he wouldn't stop. An hour would pass and he would succumb to his pain, but not entirely he would use this time to motivate himself. \n133.	Grounded in the said he would say, \"Go, get up, go, get up, GO\"! Koji would open the first gate and thrust forward ignoring the pain he would again go past his limits, and as he dashed through the sand pounding more force into it he would ascend the Gate of Opening into Gate of Healing allowing him to press forward with ease! In no time he would see the gates of Suna, and he would find rest when his foot stepped into the village! Awakening in the hospital he would say, \"it's now done! I've unlocked the Gate of Healing and this time I've mastered it completely\".\n"

This would be done by using his adoptive name Hokumas. They live prosperiously in Sunagakure as they work heavily in the new police force known as Desert Owl, but in this time Koji woud come to see the entire village as his family. This force would also be started by Koji in an attempt to quel the savagery during its take back from the bandits.\nUnknowingly this path would take him through many perils that he would survive and rise to the rank of Kazekage. He didn't seek such a life, but it was thrusted upon him and instead of rejecting it.

But, he would not be deterred from that fact and would reflect even more on the past events. The reflection he put himself in gave him the knowledge that his journey had gave him the building blocks to fully unlocking, and being half way there he wouldn't just stop in the face of adversity. With that wisdom in his mind Koji would strap on his gear, and walk out to begin his training once more. Eyes focused and body screaming for more training he would answer its prayers. Exiting the area, Koji made his way to an enormous rock within the desert the size of a tower! After sizing the solid earth up Koji would begin thrusting his legs toward it with whirlwind kick. Hitting high and low Koji would start the destruction of this giant rock \n102.	Koji would be unleashing savage kicks from the whirlwind kick jutsu of Konohagakure. This would be putting the minimal size of scratches on the behemoth of dirt. Koji would need to increase his strength, and this was the best way of doing. Able to move faster than he ever could before he would now aim to strike harder than ever before! Kicking the rock viscously with each turn of the body, and as he landed he would unleash his clan's rotation. Tearing the skin of the rock ever so slightly.  \n103.	 At the end of the jutsu Koji would begin to chain his attacks together in unison with each other. To the untrained eye he would seems like a tornado in the sand! Everything in the sand would be picked up, and thrown toward the giant rock! Be it sand, pebbles, or Koji's legs it would bang against the obstruction with great force. The rock would start to shake, but it would not crumble down to sand just yet. If one were to come in close contact with the giant rock one could see the marks made by the impacts of Koji. As the time passed the swirling ninja would press on trying to reach his threshold, and then once there he would pass it. \n104.	Continuing the rotating process the ninja would strike the rock even harder! With each contact sweat would break his limbs and forehead. This was due more so of the glamourous sun in the sky, rather than the extent of his training. As the day progressed even further, however, he would begin to feel the fatigue.  The pain itself would begin to effect the boy's progress in his training, and he would need to start trying to overcome the pain mentally. \n105.	It would be more aching than extreme exhaustion as his body would begin to actually be bruising his body. He would feel his legs swell form the repetitive cycle of attacks upon the giant rocks. Not wanting to give in to his weakness Koji would persevere through the pain, and continue the furious swipes of whirlwind kicks. As he leaped Koji would cringe due to the pain, but his form would be sacrificed. He would make contact splendidly, and finish with a powerful rotation once more. \n106.	Now nightfall Koji would limp his way home for rest. As the training had took its toll on the young ninja, and he needed to recover. On his way home he would pay a visit to the village's medic, and that would allow him to be healed rather quickly. But he still needed the proper rest, so that his muscle would grow in strength. After having a bowl of garlic ramen filled with tother nourishment. He rested for the night, and was awoken abruptly to begin a mission. \n107.	This mission entailed was a viscous one as he fought a giant fly monster that extended 30 meters in size! It would have taken the group of Koji, Izanami, Tetsumi, Marissa, Trilliam, and Bryson. During the climax of the battle it would take Koji's gentle fist technique to weaken the beast's enhanced armor. With rapid speed Koji would charge the beast too quickly for it to react! Sliding under the giant bug he would palm the bug five times, and rotate the beast off its balance and into the dirt with the help of Marissa's wind technique. The events would pass rather fast after this, and Koji wouldn't expel much energy on this mission. \n108.	Now back at the village Koji would continue his training this was because of the grace of Fujitora! Koji would asked Fuji if he would train him in the art of the sword, and he obliged with the requirement that Koji would go through his maze. Heading toward the arena Koji would practice his swings for hours!\n109.	Swoosh* Swoosh* was the sound made as he swung through the air with the wooden sword. Not knowing the basics of swordplay Koji would swing hard up and down trying to rip apart the very air around him. He figured it would take great strength to wield a sword, so he was preparing himself for the wielding of a blade. With sweat releasing itself from the pores of the skin, Koji would change the motion from vertical to horizontal keeping the force the same as earlier. As he tenses up would activate his Byakugan thinking he could find the source of the perfect technique through the swords structure. However, that would not be the case.\n110.	Continuing to strike harshly Koji would let out grunts and straining sounds as he kept the pressure up. He was going to master this technique at any cost, because once he set his mind to something that would be it. He wouldn't stop until the goal was met, or his body met with the dirt itself. Time would pass and as Koji heard the words of Fuji he would continue striking ferociously within the air. Koji would find that concept difficult basically having the use of the technique since childhood, but he would heed the words of his master. Closing his eyes Koji would soothe the tension he had in his grip and swing as well. His swings instantly became more fluent in nature. With each swing he would follow through with another.\n111.	Upward, downward, downward, and upward Koji would engrave the words of Fuji in his mind. As his eyes were shut the ninja would begin to enter a meditative state. Much like the ones when he travels down his inner chakra pathways to open the Gates. Imagining various fruits being sliced by a blade elegantly, but at the same time fiercely. A smile would escape into real life as he called himself a fruit ninja within his head.  After some time Koji would fashion other material things in his mind as he swung the wooden sword in real life. Such as rocks, shoes, leaves, wood, and hats These things would come at him at random, and he would swing in an appropriate manner. Koji would begin getting the sense of this skill just a little bit each swipe. \n112.	Within his mind the items would come toward him at a more rapid rate than before, and this caused him to pick up the speed in reality. Sweat jumping from him arm and onto the ground, and sweat falling from his forehead into his perked lips. Koji was working up a sweat cutting the air, and he wouldn't stop anytime soon having the ability to going to his natural ability to last. \n113.	Koji would pass out from swinging, and as he rested you see the twitching of various muscles in his arm and back. The rapid swings, and combative mission before totaled up to be a harsh training regime on his body, but this was all accepted by Koji, because he was determined to train his body to unlock the Gate of Healing. Being carried to his home in his unconscious state Koji's muscles would rebuild for the next day. Awakening the next morning he would get his daily nourishment, so that he'll be able to keep up the extensive training. After the meal he would be instructed to patrol the village by Lord Hassan. \n114.	After returning from his mission Koji would see himself back in front of the giant rock he was targeting the other day. Positioning himself the ninja would start to unleash a leaf whirlwind upon the giant earth! Leaping into the air he would begin to twirl as a feint, and as he came lower to the ground he would strike the rock harshly with a low round-house kick. He would make no more progress than before, but he could perceive the strength in his leg had increased. As the pain didn't irk him as strongly as he had first perceived at the beginning of his training. He would line up again readying himself to kick. \n115.	Performing another round-house kick Koji would begin to chip away at the rock once more. Though his kicks we powerful the behemoth could take this beating with ease. To the heart of Koji it was as if the rock mas mocking him, and in the moment he felt that sensation he would open the First Gate and strike once more with Leaf Whirlwind! Cracks would now surface from kicks and the boulder would rattle, but still it would stand prideful against the attacks of Koji. \n116.	As the onslaught continues night would come, but the ninja would not falter to fatigue! The ninja would have created a down engraving within the ground, and this would be due to the round-house kicks placed upon the rock. After each spin followed a kick, and after every spin followed another kick. Koji would be choking on the air he so depended on due to the rapid movement involved in the training. Still within the Gate of Opening Koji would be unleashing savage blows. Villagers would watch in awe as they had never seen anyone last so long in such a state. \n117.	Becoming the best at his profession would require Koji to surpass anything he thought possible of himself. With that though process and as the sweat and air escaped his body in a large mass he would continue to strike the unyielding rock before him. Pressing off the ground cause it to crack under the pressure he hit this rock even heavier than before! Upon contact the rock would resonate from the shock of Koji's impact, but instead of cracking it would shift. Now it leaned rather than standing tall. \n118.	Now staring down the now crooked rock he again attack the rock, but now his legs would start to become exhausted from the pain. It wouldn't help that he had to leap as well at this point the acrobatics, and the attacking was becoming too much, however, Koji wouldn't falter just yet! He had set in motion a new plan to lay the crooked rock on its side fully. He would accomplish at any cost At least that's the tale of his eyes. Taking his stance once more the ninja would propel himself into the air once more shouting, \"Leaf Whirlwind!\" Making contact he would shake the rock once more, and he would have successfully tilt just a tad. \n119.	Not feeling happy about the results as of yet Koji would rear himself up for another attack. Focusing on the task at hand he would charge himself with all the energy and chakra he had. While mustering the strength to hold the first Gate as long as possible as this would be key if hoped to obtain the Gate of Healing. Ready to unleash another attack Koji grits his teeth, and then shouts, \"Gargh!\" Pushing off the ground once more causing an even bigger dent to occur within the dirt, and he would spin so rapidly he would appear to be a spin top in mid-air! He would strike in mid-air, and cringe a little due to the pain, however, he would keep his composure. As he was being lowered by gravity he saw the boulder was beginning to tilt he would waste no time to follow up. \n120.	With the rock now in motion Koji would channel the momentum, and as he came to the ground he would direct it to his lower kick. This would be the strike to do it! As his leg flung slightly above ground level he would spin three-hundred and sixty degrees, and land a powerful thrusted kick onto the rock. His leg would rattle along with the rock. His head would fling back from the sensation of the pain, and the Gate of Opening would be released in that same moment! The shock would cause him to fling himself back as if he were struck by lightning, thus putting him a fair distance away from the falling rock.\n121.	Gathering himself Koji would notice the rock now falling fully horizontal now, and he would say very slightly, \"Yes\"! Before passing out from exhaustion, but he would not be left there in agony. The villagers that watched would see the boy training, and they would carry him to the town's medic where he would be rejuvenated in health. Koji would then walk home, and receive the necessary nourishment to reconstitute his body. Then, he would get the proper rest needed to allow his strength to grow. This was all needed if he hoped to not only destroy the rock, but surpass the limitations of his body as well. \n"

Activating the Gate of Opening he would roll out the strength need to bull doze through this heavy wind. Now finding a pace he is able to run efficiently at would let out a sigh of relief. \n\n142.	Keeping pace the wind would not let up, but increase in pressure! So much so it would feel as though he was swimming through wind itself. Legs though moving unchained to anything feels as if they're lugging trains. It was madness never before had Koji experienced such a force of nature. \n\n143.	Essentially blind due to the force of wind shutting his eyes. Koji was now running in the dark for the first time! It would be the first time in his life where he had to press forward without knowledge of what's around him. This would create an insecurity within him, but not enough to give.\n\n144.	Cautious now in his proceedings his pace would slow a bit, but images of Hassan's wind attack bulleting Koji unconscious. Would force Koji to push through without fail! He wasn't for losing again to his Lord so easily. With that cause Koji began to shout at the storm enraged, \"Do you think you can stop me?\" \n\n145.	Koji blindly would began moving forward still within Gate of Opening, and start thrusting his palms at the wind. Instead of pushing Koji would now palm his way through the wind. This was effective more so than the pushing he was doing earlier, so he did it continuously! Busting holes allowing him to move forward easily at a constant speed. Although not as fast as he was originally before the wind came. \n\n146.	With the wind still raging Koji would be at this limits in punching and running now! Using his Gate ability didn't help either as this drained his stamina, but having inhuman stamina he would push the threshold once on this journey. Quitting just wouldn't be in this guy's diary. \n\n147.	Pressing forward even more Koji's muscles would feel as though they were about to tear themselves open! Literally he could feel his rapid thrust over-working his arms, and the force required to move forward through the wind would also claim its toll! Unable to continue the wind would pick Koji up, and swing him about like a rag doll. \n\n148.	Heart beating intensely and breathe panting as if he was choking briefly. Koji would regain consciousness, and find himself back on the top of the mountain. Rejuvenated and fully healed. This would immediately encourage him to say, \"What the flying Fu--? Did I even leave?\" \n\n149.	Not staying with the pondering Koji would look down and see the Eight- Tri Gram symbol was gone from the top of the mountain, and would begin his hike down the mountain. Making it to the bottom now, and this time with the experience he would begin his run. \n\n150.	As Koji was running he couldn't help but reflect on the experience he had. He felt the exhaustion and pain, but couldn't make out how he ended back on the top of the mountain. But, then again how he came to the top in the first place was a mystery as well! Striding forward he wouldn't fret, because this is officially the finish stride of the finish. (Submitted)\n\n151.	Strutting to distance the mountain would begin to fade in the distance, and Koji again would be making headway. This time even faster than the time that seemed faster than the first time! He was astounded at the increase of speed, but he would save his acknowledgement of the fact until the end of training. \n\n152.	Survival at this point was the game no longer having rations the ninja would have to fight through exhaustion, hunger, and dehydration all at once. This was necessary in pushing the limitations of his body even more, but to also simulate the feeling of going to Gate of Healing for prolonged time. Striding forward his through the perils of journey Koji's body would ache from the excessive stress being put upon them.\n\n153.	The terrain was now rough and with each jolt off the land Koji would keep the pace up, but his breathe would be all but gone. It was if he was running in space at this point no air to be held! With his lungs collapsing in on themselves slowly but surely the strain of training was becoming great. Ignoring this fact Koji would press on without fail. \n\n154.	 After a few more hours Koji would be forced to rest against his will this was due to him slipping in mud. As he slipped he would bang his head onto a tree stomp, thus knocking him unconscious. Finally resting and allowing his body the proper rest his lungs to breathe easily, and heart rate to slow the young ninja would pass out soon after. \n\n155.	The light of the sun would beam right on to the face of Koji, and this would awaken him abruptly. Rubbing his forehead he would feel the knot from the fall, and say, \"I really do miss the properties of the mountain.\" Wasting no time he would take to his journey once more. \n\n156.	Feeling a bit advantageous Koji begins upping the scale of training within the forest he was in. Activating his Byakugan Koji would check to see if the branches were homes of anything dangerous. He didn't see anything for miles, so leaping into the air he decided to give his arms a bit of a tense workout today. Accomplishing this by swinging from branch to branch. \n\n157.	This would strengthen his grip, reflexes, and arm strength as he thrusted his weight forward. Now looking like a monkey in the high trees Koji felt a bit of relief, because he didn't have to keep the boring routine of running. He would attempt to swing this whole entire forest as a game, but if he loses his grip and falls to the ground he has to run the whole way. Not wanting that ordeal he starts to will through the exercise.\n\n158.	Whipping through trees like the wind itself Koji was anxious to get out of the forest. Missing his sand flooded village so much so it ached his heart to be away so long. Swoosh* Swoosh* was the sound made as he zipped through the trees he was becoming swift in his actions more so than ever before. \n\n159.	Now feeling the pressure in his arms Koji would use his Byakugan to look around, and ahead of himself to see if he could find any trouble brewing. Sure enough a blizzard seemed to be making its way over to our hero. Stopping on a branch of a thick tree Koji would take as many leaves as possible, and stuff them into his garments this would be to keep him as warm as possible. \n\n160.	With the leaves now in place the storm would come bellowing in with no warning, but thanks to his eyes he was given time to prepare. Taking the force of the blizzard with no regard to its power Koji would swing himself forward. As he moved through the air it would be as if the storm engulfed whole. Like a snake swallowing a deer. \n"

When used defensively, Koji creates much larger, stronger, more flexible, arc-shaped chakra blades that spread out across her entire attack range, effectively forming a barricade between herself and her opponents, rebuffing even the largest and smallest of targets. The technique creates an \"absolute defence\" effect similar to that of the Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven, though the cutting nature of the chakra prevents any outside force from restricting it.<br><br>\[Con + Nin + 10vs Ninjutsu Defence x2.\]"

This would be done by using his adoptive name Hokumas. They live prosperiously in Sunagakure as they work heavily in the new police force known as Desert Owl, but in this time Koji woud come to see the entire village as his family.

This would be done by using his adoptive name Hokumas. They live prosperiously in Sunagakure as they work heavily in the new police force known as Desert Owl, but in this time Koji woud come to see the entire village as his family. This force would also be started by Koji in an attempt to quel the savagery during its take back from the bandits. <br><br>\nUnknowingly this path would take him through many perils that he would survive and rise to the rank of Kazekage.

Ths was because their stats are halved his own and he's expecting that two will give him an equal fighting chance. Thus, a higher difficulty of training was evolved from this training. As Koji took his stance and activated his Dou-jutsu he would seek to combat both at the same time. As he needed to increase his speed of attack and nimblesness. Within seconds Koji would strike out at the clone placed at his right within the gentle fist. This attack would be position within the thorax. As Koji did this he would be struck in the back by the clone standing to the left. Koji wouldl feel the nudge of the gentle fist as it gently closed a tenketsu point. <br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Toe Fighter 2 - Thu Dec 10 01:27:53 2015</b><font><hr><br>would continue this training for months unti perfected it would be grueling for his body, but he knew he must get faster in his strikes. It was necessary for him to also deliver more blows with that swiftness! Koji would be trading blows with both clones as he struck one in the bicept and lung. and another in the throat and pectorial. After which he'd slide a kick clockwise beneath him attempting to sweep the feet from under the clones, but would it succeed is the question. One clone would fall and the other would pereive the attack and gentle fist Koji on top of the shoulder. This forced Koji to shout out a bit as it was a surprising attack and well placed at that!<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Toe Fighter 3  - Thu Dec 10 01:50:56 2015</b><font><hr><br>with the time passing would be pressing his training ever more, and being relentless in this endeavor as well. The clones woud be as they were as months before. Striking as Koji struck back Koji would show little improvement, but improvement nonetheless. There would be an opening during the bouts and Koji would find a huge striking opportunity. Allowing him to hit one clone three times! (Roll - 3) The hits would be located in the heart, lungs, and kidney. In a swift motion Koji would dodge the strike from the other clone and unite his strike with its body making contact with its liver (Roll1)! Four strikes had been made during the time, and Koji felt a little proud of himself. <br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Toe Fighter 4 - Thu Dec 10 01:58:36 2015</b><font><hr><br>shows no slack in his movement as he trains to be precise and wasteing no motion or time with whatever he executed. Koji was picking up pace at this point. Causing both his clone to be pushed back rather than him for the time being. Koji was for the first time in his long training starting to feel like the legendary piccolo. Koji dodges and slide through both the clone, but in this proces the ninja would give to powerful strikes toward the opposition to the abdomen area. This would be a swift process as he brings his arms back Koji would roll with his momentum and release a body blow toward one the clones dispersing it without fail. Leaving one clone to deal with at this time.<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Toe Fighter 5 - Thu Dec 10 02:02:52 2015</b><font><hr><br>lining up the clone runs forth toward it. Koji would dodge both strikes and deliver multiple strikes toward the clone. And, then he would prepare himslef for the sttrikes back toward him. As Koji retracted himself he would be carried by his momentum and jump back dodging the blows of the clone. On the last strike by the clone Koji would implement his own attack toward the clone unleashing a fury of strikes causing the clone to disperse from the excessive damage taken during the battle. This was enough training for the time being Koji would rest up and begin again once recovered.<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Toe Fighter 6 - Thu Dec 10 16:10:14 2015</b><font><hr><br>goes out to train once more, but even with the passage of time and growth that came with it... He still wsn't comfortable with his performance the shinobi needed to get faster and nimbler! With that in his mind Koji spawned two clones as he had done previously. He would activate his Byakugan channeling the chakra to his eyes, but it would be as he took his stance and this was to better articulate his strikes. Koji was serious about improving himself, so without hesitation Koji began. Charging forward in a quick and agile way Koji attempt to deliver multipe strikes on the clone. For the first clone he would deliver a blow to the pectorial, then to the abdomen region. These were quick strikes but they weren't quick enough to deliver more! Koji would take two shots the respective region as well. Coughing just a bit.<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Toe Fighter 7 - Thu Dec 10 16:20:28 2015</b><font><hr><br>would be getting ambushed as he coughed as the second clone delivers a high kick to his face. This would throw the teen back into the distance, but he'd gather himself up quickly to begin again. Thinking to himself, \n(\"My clone would know my blindspot I. Not surprising I didn't see it coming.)\n\"Tch.\" Koji spits// \n\nPressing forward in thr training regime Koji would appear to be getting the hang of this thing rather steadily, but he needed time that much was a given. As he moves to deliver a strike so do the clones challenging him. Matching him in his strikes together this would be a hassle for Koji. Not fighting against just himself, but two other ninja. It was a tale to be told. With fatigue pressed on his Koji would have dodged all their attacks adnd then some. As the training required that he not be touched so many times, because that would force the training to end. Koji would be standing as he watched the clones dissipate from the succession of hits he gathered on them.<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Toe Fighter 8 - Thu Dec 10 16:29:52 2015</b><font><hr><br>takes a sip of water and replicates his clones he would now begin again after a period of rest. Prancing forward attempting to move faster beyond there sight Koji would strike, and this time he could feel the rush. It must be the muscle memory from the last bout, but even then Koji wasn't able to perceive such as he just lfowed into the motion like water. Striking major areas on the clone such as the heart, kidney, liver, lungs, pancreas, stomach, and intestines! This would be a perfect succession of hits! The clone would have no choice but to cripple atter such contact, but it was over yet. As Koji was being rushed from the side by the other clone!<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Toe Fighter 9 - Thu Dec 10 16:40:06 2015</b><font><hr><br>would be breaking all kinds of limits at this point as he perceiveed the incoming clone, and Koji would fluently attack the clone's attacking limbs being the left and right arms. This would at the same time knock the down allowing Koji to strike at the chest. Causing a blowback to the clone a total of three strikes on this particular clone! Koji would have received no damage at this point, and fatigue would not even have been scathed! As he was born with freakish almost monsterous stamina. The young shinobi gave hmself space as his clone gathered themselves for the next round. As they did this Koji thought to himself, \n\"Come agile, fast and precise. That's what we have to be.\"<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Toe Fighter 10 - Thu Dec 10 16:47:47 2015</b><font><hr><br>partaking in the rough tegime he set for hmself Koji would be close to resting poin, but not before eyeing down a new set of clones as he had dispelled the originals due to the longevity of their controntation. Koji wouldn't be a zombite in the mind but he was head strong in the task before him. As he thought of how this training will better suit his village. His thoughts were as followed,\n(I need to be strong if I'm going to be a leader. Can't show weakness in front of a threat must be brave must be an example of Sunagakure's pride.) \nAs he thought these thought Koji would be delivering rapid blows to his clones. There was more to the boy than geting stronger he had a family to protect a people he swore loyalty to, and if a possible a world to unite. Though, this wasn't his main objective it was thrusted upon him, nonetheless. And he didn't back from the challenge success or fail Koji was in it., and this point he had accepted it whole-heartedly.<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Toe Fighter 11 - Fri Dec 11 01:47:05 2015</b><font><hr><br>would have paused his training as he caught Mirai's presence, but his training would have consisted of fighting two clones at once. He was striking quickly attempting to get a large amount of strikes in while also being nimbe on his toes. If he was to emulate anything it would be a house fly. zipping and zapping all around the place. Unable to be touched by the opposition before him. The clone would disperse upon the arrival of Mirai, and this is when Koji would speak to her.<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Toe Fighter 12 - Fri Dec 11 02:20:22 2015</b><font><hr><br>Hokuma, Koji before begining his grueling regime again Koji would respond to Mirai, \n\"Yeah it's nice I'm glad you were able to visit it. Hopefully we can get some members to reside there as well as here. But, time will tell what will happen. And, thanks you improved as well over the years haha. I'm glad we were able to meet.\" \n\nKoji summons two clones and takes his stance while also activatiing his Byakugan in the process, thus the tenketsu points of the clones were visible to him. However, Koji's point would be visible to them as well! This made Koji much more antsy and agile on his toes. Taking hits from them decreases the longevity of the training regime. Now as the clones approached Koji they would be seeking to both strike his abdomen region, and follow up with going for his chest neart the heart. This would be fast but half the speed at which Koji applies his strikes. So, he would perceive their intention instantly, thus he would move to cut them off halfway into the motion. \n<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Toe Fighter 13 - Fri Dec 11 02:21:13 2015</b><font><hr><br>Now on the offensive Koji wouln't seek to cut in between but in front to where the clones aligned thus ruining there symbiotic attack plan toward the abdomen. This would also allow Koji to strike the first clone's arm up and to make contact with its abdoment instead! Thhis would knock back the first clone into the one behind it due to a studder step after the attack. After this the clones woulld regain their composure. Seeking to strike again as they ran up the clone would both unleash a body blow! Koji would fall to the floor recognizing the flow of chakra from his own. THhus causing a collision of both attacks. \n\nStanding up swiftly Koji bum rushes on clonse and unleashes a fury of chakra swipes from protective palms causing the clone to be slashed up to the point it couln't maintain itself. The second clone would be bum rushing Koji as he finished but Koji would rotate knocking it back into the distance.<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Toe Fighter 14 - Fri Dec 11 02:41:42 2015</b><font><hr><br>(*Hokuma, Koji would be sparring right alongside Mirai and he would be enjoying the moments as it was great for the family man. Bonding time doesn't come often, but it seems that everything was going good sense being chosen for Kage. As the fmaily was always around and the shinobis all flocked, but this could simply be due to the rank, but that wouldn't waver Koji at all. He was happy to be blessed with their presence. These thoughts all crossed Koji's mind as he trained and it gave him endurance to continue his training through. As he needed to protect his own.

He sought to send his right arm under for a belly strike and his left over for a pectorial strike. In the meantime the second Clone would be coming in on his backside to jyuken him from behind.Upon success of thte original Koji's strike he'd immediately rotate blowing back the clone seeking to wreck his back side.\n\nAfter this Koji would remark, \n\"Of course my main focus is to secure us. I feel accomplished in making it a family but I can't lie. I hope to see us bigger and better than we are now. There is still alot of work needed, so that we can establish ourselves her in Sunagakure.\" This sentence would be rather long and Koji was a bit absent minded as he spoke, so one clone would get the upper hand. coming in with a dyanmic entry! Throwing him to the ground!\n\nHis clone would say, \n\"Keep ya guard up, yo!\" \nKoji woud rush the clone and slice it with his protective palm technique. As for the second clone the same motion would follow wthout hesitation. <br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Toe Fighter 16 - Fri Dec 11 03:55:05 2015</b><font><hr><br>following the execution of his clone would hear Mirai and her worries and say,\n\"It is a hassle and sadly it's the cards we've been dealt.... If we're able to unite ourselves with each other I'm sure we can erase even that fear, but that will take time. Of course that fact is saddening in itself. You teaching them of their sacred blessing is the smartest thing you can do.. Heh, if we can do anything together easily it's worry.\"  \n\nKoji would create yet another couple as he finished his words. Thus, begining the traiing him and Mirai had endured for the passing months. This would be accompanied by loads of proper rest and renourishing of the body which is an important part of training. Koji would then charge them quickly as he said, \n\n\"I'll have to make a formal appearance myself sense they rejected us so harshly. I'm sure we can resolve whatever issue they had with us.\" \n\nPCKT! PCKT! PKCT! is the sound made as Koji made contact with clones. They would also attempt to make contact with him, but Koji wouldn't allow it. As he would swivle left, right, back, forward. As this is done the teen would also be strike in unison. He would tag each thrown limb his way in the gentle fist art. <br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Toe Fighter 17 - Fri Dec 11 04:05:20 2015</b><font><hr><br>'s clones wouldn't be quick enough to dodge so they would suffer from these strikes, but not severly. Once their stature is regained the three figures would engage each other fiercly a game of dodge and strike, or rather tag! This was increasing the teen's tai-jutsu skill greatly as he trained. It would be slow but not unnoticed that's for sure. As he was learning his limits as a fighter. Koji makes more strikes on his clone being nimble and quick in his motion. Koji was really progressing in beoming a toe-fighter. But, only time would tell if he will make it. <br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Toe Fighter 18 - Fri Dec 11 05:12:44 2015</b><font><hr><br>*Hokuma, Koji progresses as time passes and he would be training religiously! He wouldn't use his clones this time, but train his strikes and jukes now. This was necessary to focus highly on the cores and not just the broad, so Koji would set up his palming bag and begin palming. Koji would strike in a rapid succession! Connecting on the bag it would starting to be riddled but softly to the hand, but the bag itself would be flinging back due to the force of the chakra.<br>"
