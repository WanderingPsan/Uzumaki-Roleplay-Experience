With his fists clenched, he throw a few stomach jabs at the two who approached for close combat ranged. With the third, he'd snap a swift kick towards it's the knee, aiming to disable it for the time being. *)\n<br><br>\n (*Rokujou, Kida saw a mass of mud approaching him as he was combating the two clones. He quickly lifted his leg, stomping his foot upon the leg of one of clones and using it for footing. He then jumped up into the air, kicking said clone in the head in the process, and proceded to mount it so avoid the attack.  He'd stand on the clone's shoulders for a brief moment before using it as a stepping stone to jump over to the clear patch of land. \n<br><br>\n\"This is more fun than I thought.\" He quickly clasped his hands together to form the tiger seal in preparation for his next move. Suddenly, he remembered his previous experience with the jutsu and halted with forming the seal. \"Shit. I almost did something foolish,\" he muttered to himself, now trying to figure out his next move.*)\n<br><br>\n (*Rokujou, Kida didn't see the oncoming attack and was knocked off of the clone's shoulders. He quickly found himself falling into the flowing trail of mud.*)\n<br><br>\n (*Rokujou, Kida was honestly in a pickle. He was currently being pushed back by the currently flowing river of mud. \"I guess I have no choice,\" he thought to himself as he clasped his hands together forming the tiger seal. As the river pushed his body, he began to focus his chakra into his legs, energizing them enough for his purpose. \n<br><br>\nWithout a stable footing, executing the technique would be risky, but it was worth it. He started to roll his body around, aiming to at least get his feet onto the ground for a moment, even if it was brief. Once he was able to have his feet touch the ground, he executed the technique.  In a flash he vanished from his location and was now in the air just a few feet above the flowing river, Yan and his clones. \n<br><br>\n\"Shit, I shouldn't have done that,\" he commented, already feeling the after effects of the jutsu he had just learned just moments prior. His head started to feel dizzy as he started to fall from the sky and into the fresh patch of land which wasn't touched by the river. *)\n<br><br>\n (*Rokujou, Kida quickly found himself getting ganged up by multiple clones while in a weakened state from the after effects of the jutsu. He quickly went onto the defense, tucking his arms until he recovered. Once he was was finished recovering from the shunshin, sprang up from the ground with a knee to one of the clone's chin's. \n<br><br>\nIn that brief moment, he quickly twisted his torso and snapped a powerful kick to another clone's neck aiming to break it. He wasn't holding back, especially since he knew that these were clones.  There was no reason for him to hold back.  Each attack had the force and intent to inflict serious debilitating bodily harm.  In all honesty, he was having some fun when it came to this spar.  He couldn't ask for a better partner seeing how he would be able to fight to his heart's content.*)\n<br><br>\n (*Rokujou, Kida really had to focus if he wanted to win this spar. Even if he didn't win, it would be good training either way.  He took a deep breath and glanced all around at him, sizing up each and every clone that was in his vision. \"So this has now become a battle of attrition huh?\" he spoke to himself as he stood in the center of the clone mass. \n<br><br>\n\"This is really fun!\" he shouted as he stepped forwards with an elbow to one of the clone's faces. He'd quickly turn around and perform a sweeping kick on another, aiming to trip them up. Afterwards, he'd grab another and perform an overhead throw, tossing it upon a few others.  By then, he started to breath heavily, but he wasn't going to end right there.  The genin began to charge forwards, throwing a knee at a clone who was positioned infront of him. He'd swiftly perform a backflip, snapping his leg out in a reverse axe like motion. His objective was to aim for the clone's chin in an attempt to bring it to it's knees or at least rock them.  In all honesty, it wasn't easy dealing with the amount of clones that surrounded him.*\n<br><br>\n (*Rokujou, Kida found himself restrained for the time being. His elbow was gripped by one of the clones, and he could hear the rattle of the others. With a smile on his face he quickly pulled his arm from the clone's grip using all of his strength. From his earlier experience with the clones, he was certain that he possessed more physical strength than the original.  He however was growing tired and drawing out his full strength was starting to become a challenge. \n<br><br>\n\"Damn,\" he muttered to himself as he turned his head and found a fist slam into his jaw. His head tilted upwards as he soon found himself kneeling upon the ground after his stance was attacked from behind.  \"I guess this might be my loss,\" he thought to himself as he glanced around the clones who got closer. \n<br><br>\nUnsure of what else to do, he decided to perform a last ditch effort to take a large mass of the clones out.  Using the last bit of energy he had to expend, he stood up on his legs and sent out a left hook towards the first clone his eyes laid upon.  Should the clone start to fall apart, he'd turn to another clone and begin a series of combos.    He'd lunge forwards with a flying knee at the chest of one clone, then use said clone as a spring board, he'd jump to another with a high elbow. \n<br><br>\nOnce he was back on the ground, he'd flip another clone onto their beck. By now he was completely exhausted, continuing on the fight with just the last bit of his reserves.  His body began to drag, dulling his responses.  He didn't want to give up, but it was time to. A single knee touched the ground as his body was completely soaked in sweat. \"Looks like it's your win,\" he called out, throwing himself onto the cool dirt floor. *)\n<br><br>\n(*Rokujou, Kida felt his body lift up from Amon's grasp. He glanced down at the bald man and frowned. \"Who said I was going first?\" he spoke out as he quickly jammed his knee into the man's chin, aiming to release himself from Amon's grip.  \"The hell do you think you're doing, lifting me like I'm some child?\" he commented.*)\n<br><br>\n(*Rokujou, Kida saw the chance to escape and he took it. With Amon slightly rocked, he pushed off from the male, further pulling from his grip. As he parted from Amon, he looked over at Kojiro who was approaching, and snapped a kick towards the male's face, aiming to distance himself from the two.\n<br><br>\n\"Don't touch me,\" he spoke out, landing onto the ground.*)\n<br><br>\n(*Rokujou, Kida chuckled at the two as he gave both Amon and Kojiro the finger. \"If you fuckers want a fight, then bring it,\" he spoke out, tilting his head to the side. Outside of combat, he was rather average, but for some odd reason, he just loved the blood rush that followed with a fight. \n<br><br>\nAfter speaking such insulting words, he straightened his stance and began to crack his knuckles, indicating his urge to fight.*)\n<br><br>\n(*Rokujou, Kida chuckled as he watched the two become bound by snakes. \"Pathetic,\" he spoke, placing his hands into his pockets.  As he spouted those words, he as he stuck his tongue out at the two. He then began to walk off, laughing that both Kojiro and Amon were bound.*)\n<br><br>\n(*Rokujou, Kida he let out a sigh, since he wasn't able to get into a physical altercation. As he continued to walk, he glanced over at Maloth who he recognized a bit. He was large and had a decent frame. \"Hey, want a round? I'm bored,\" he spoke.*)\n<br><br>\n(*Rokujou, Kida smiled at Maloth as he raised his fists and parted his legs, entering a combative stance. He had no formal stance, and it was more of a freestyle than anything. None the less, he was capable at what he did. \"Let's start then,\" he called out.*)\n<br><br>\n(*Rokujou, Kida recognized Maloth from prior, but he wasn't entirely familiar with him. All he knew was that the man was rather physical, and had the defense to back it up. The last he saw, he witnessed the man get pierced by spikes. Since then, he surely bulked up quite a bit.\n<br><br>\nKida grinned at the opportunity to combat such a man. He wanted to test his own limits, and see just how far he was able to go. As he watched Maloth step forwards, Kida lunged to the side, ducking the initial swing.  His eyes narrowed upon Maloth's frame as he launched a bone shattering kick towards his ribs.   \"You've got to be faster than that!\" he replied, testing the waters of the sparring session.*)\n<br><br>\n(*Rokujou, Kida was taken aback by his ineffective kick. This was by far the first individual he'd been up against where his strength did nothing.  \"Tch, what a monster. This is going to be fun,\" he thought to himself, smiling at his situation.   Just as he was about to retract his foot, he found himself stuck. His eyes darted to the source, being his ankle which was now had a massive hand wrapped around it.\n<br><br>\n\"Shit,\" he muttered, quickly thinking of a counter. He was indeed in a rather disadvantageous position. A leg was held in his enemy's grip, and another leg was grounded.  In such a position, his options were limited, especially since his legs were locked.\n<br><br>\nFearing for the worst, he chuckled and spoke a few mocking words. \"Give me your best shot big guy.\" Just as the words flowed from his tongue, Maloths fist came flying into his direction. The genin quickly crossed his arms into an 'X' formation, hoping that he'd be able to cushion the blow. Either way, he knew that the man's fists weren't for show. \n<br><br>\nAs the fist made contact with his body, he felt the strength pulsate through his entire being. Maloth definitely wasn't weak, in fact, he was probably one of the most physical individuals he's been up against. Kida was of course enjoying their skin ship bonding, but the punch still had damage behind it.   The wind was indeed knocked out of him, but he felt as though his body could still keep on going. After all, none of his bones were shattered, or felt as though they were breaking.  However, multiple hits surely could do the job.  \n<br><br>\nKida was at Maloths mercy for the time being, as he was turned into a human sized punching bag, while his leg was still in the male's grip. All he could do for the time being was keep on the defensive and wait for an opening.*)\n<br><br><br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Boxer - Fri Dec  4 20:50:59 2015</b><font><hr><br>(*Rokujou, Kida shrugged his shoulders as he started to follow Violet. As he began to follow the female, he started to shadow box, throwing jabs left and right in the air.  A one-two combo, a left, right, jab combo. Such techniques were displayed. It was all for the sake of both training and warming up. <br><br>\n\n(*Rokujou, Kida watched Violet slash at the air. He was awestruck at the speed and accuracy of her strikes. \"Whoa,\" he whispered. He then smiled, feeling a bit excited from watching her.  In inner flames of passion began to burn in his heart as he stomped his left foot forwards, shifting his body weight in accordance.  In a flash, he launched a left jab into the air, then a right, shifting his upper body weight between punches.  Each punch had significant weight to them, but something felt off. \"I know I can hit harder than this,\" he thought to himself, punching the air faster and faster. *)\n<br><bR>\n\n(*Rokujou, Kida kept up with his pace, breathing in and out with each punch as to not out wind himself. He'd start to bob and weave between blows, making his jabbing session a bit more dynamic.  \n\n<br><br>\nHis fists cut through the air with each movement, almost as if it were a type of dance. There was grace, beauty and ferocity in the synchronization of his punches. Left, right, one, two, jab, hook. The rhythm he displayed with his strikes were both basic and effective.   He suddenly lowered his arms and turned his head over towards Mizumi who was just sitting there. \"Not going to train or anything?\" he commented, tilting his head slightly while regaining his breath.*)\n\n<br><bR>\n(*Rokujou, Kida waited for a few more seconds before resuming his session.  He stepped forwards and began to throw a series of jabs and hooks.  As he did so, he'd bob and weave his torso back and forth, simulating an actual fist fight. He was shadow boxing.  He didn't have much experience against other fighters such as himself, so he didn't really have anyone to visualize, so he just came up with a rather generic individual.  In his mind, the imaginary boxer had an average frame, and moved similar to himself.  It was a poor method of training as focusing on one's own moves tends to cause the individual to miss out on improvements quicker.   But for now, it didn't really matter much.\n\n<br><br>\nHe placed his left leg forwards and kept his arms up. They were positioned just in front of his chest, tightly packed to transition from both offense to defense. The objective of this training was all focused on the upper body.  If he wanted to be a successful shinobi, his body had to be limber and quick.\n\n<br><br>\nWhile visualizing the opponent, he threw out a left jab, quickly pulling his fist back before connecting and throwing out the right.  He'd follow with leaning his body to the right and dealing a low uppercut towards the ribs.  Quickly, he repositioned himself and opt for a left rib blow, followed by a hook to the chin. *)<br><br>\n\nKida raised his fists to his chest, kneading his knuckles with each hand. After a few seconds, he lowered his arms and began to take a few deep, long breaths.  He'd inhale through his nostrils and exhale through his mouth.  He allowed himself to calm down, focusing on one thing and one thing only; the tree that stood before him. \n<br><br>\n\nKida spread his legs slightly, sweeping his left foot along the ground to bring it to his rear, while his right was positioned forwards. They were about a shoulders width apart, and both were pointing towards the tree. A sinister smirk formed on his face as he brought his fists up.  He took a basic fighters stance, both hands balled up into fists, his dominant being closer to his chest, while the left was etched out.  \n<br><br>\n\nHis eyes continued to fixate on the tree before him. His fist tightened as he cocked back the left, and sent it hurling at the tree base. A loud noise echoed from the impact. Portions of the bark broke apart and split, revealing its wooden innards.  Kida quickly brought the left back and threw out the right, once again striking out at the tree.   Thwack! The tree cried with every punch. Splinters began to fly around, clinging onto his clothes and the surrounding area.\n<br><br>\n\nThe male's fists reddened with each hit. Every single hit tore more and more flesh from his skin, revealing torn and crimson colored knuckles. He reeled his fists back, glancing at them for a moment. \"Tch, child's play,\" he muttered, resuming his assault on the tree.\n<br><bR>\n\nKida started to get into the groove. He had his own beat and rhythm when he attacked, allowing him to focus more into his training.  Beads of sweat began to roll down his body, moistening his clothing. He was like an engine running on full power.  The savage soon began to bob and weave around the tree, using his midsection to position himself into better standings.  He wanted to use as little footwork as possible, opting to focus entirely on his upper strength. As a kicker, his legs were already dangerous, but he wasn't satisfied with just having legs as a weapon. He wanted his entire being to become a deadly weapon. Everything from his hair follicles down to his toe nails.  He was just that type of person.\n<br><br>\n\nHis body soon began to show signs of slight fatigue. His breathing became heavier, but he maintained that through proper breathing techniques and maximizing his movements. For every movement he made, there was a reason. The slide of a foot to gain distance, the curling of a finger to create a fist; it was all for a systematic purpose.  \n<br><bR>\n\nKida kept his steady pace of punching into the tree. By now, he'd reveal a large portion of its bark. His punches became more and more deadly with each strike. He kept an eye out for soft spots, and soon became more accustomed to moving his upper muscles.  \n<br><bR>\n\n\nKida continued to treat the tree as his personal punching bag. The tree had become worn down from his constant assault. A large hole had formed at its center from all of the constant punching.   \n<br><br>\n\nBlood began to trickle down Kida's fists, leaving remnants behind along the tree. His fists were cut up and bruised. They weren't seriously damaged, just damaged enough to cut open his skin.  The pain felt like nothing compared to the times where he'd received a full blown kick from Shiro.   His mind recalled the experience. It was akin to being hit by a truck.  From the instant that he received the blow, he understood pain. \n<br><br>\n\nPlaying the scenario back in his head, it began to anger yet motivate him in his endeavors to become stronger. His initial punching rhythm began to amplify at a relentless pace. The initial one two combo turned into a barrage of jabs and liver shots.  His fists moved akin to machine gun bullets as they pelted the base one after another.  He refused to let up, opting to allow his desire to become stronger fuel his body and mind.  \n<br><br>\n\nHe halted his barrage for a moment, only due to the fact that he noticed Kariudo from the corner of his eye. He glanced at the female and raised a brow just before stuffing his bloodied fists into his jacket.\n<br><br>\n\nKida let out a loud yawn as he awoke from his daily nap. His eyes glanced straight ahead, staring into the blue sky. For a moment, everything seemed peaceful, which somewhat bugged him. He quickly hoisted himself up into a seated position, quickly shaking away the grass that clung to his hair and body.  It was time to continue with his training.  He helped himself up to his feet, further wiping down his clothing from the grass and dirt that was around him.\n<br><br>\n\n\"Tch, I got to stop sleeping outside,\" he muttered. The male extended his arms out, stretching them as far as he could. Soon, his figure began to contort back left and right like a spring, whilst his arms motioned behind, prepping his body for his training. \n<br><br>\n\nThe last time he trained his fists, he struck against a tree and demolished it. This time however, he decided to take things up a notch. Instead of striking at a tree like a punching bag, he decided to strike out at something more durable.  This was solved by the finding the remnants of broken down armor. It was already battered, but it was surely stronger than wood.  From his gaze, he could see that it was some metal of some type.  \n<br><br>\n\nAfter tinkering around with the worn out armor, he had created a training post of some sort. He used the wood he acquired from the previous training to act as a standing post, then fitted a sand bag on top, with the armor equipped. It was the perfect punching bag. A grin arose on his face as he quickly got into a fighters stance.\n<bR><br>\n\nHis fists were balled up and positioned just above his chest. With the left stretched further out than the right, he quickly pivoted his body forwards to begin his training. Just like prior, he prioritized his upper mass, only relying on punching and moving his torso and up. Kida began with a quick one two combo, starting off with the left and ending with the right. The training dummy bounced back and forth with each hit, akin to a bobble head doll.\n<br><br>\n\nThe added armor proved to be an added challenge, not only for improving his strength, but toughening his knuckles enough to produce calluses. His fists hurt like hell, but this was only the beginning. Instead of allowing the pain to control his actions, he pushed through it, striking out at the training post once more.  One after another, he'd throw his fist into its body. The ringing of his fist connecting with the armor echoed around the area. \n<br><br>\n\nAs he continued to strike out at the home made punching bag, he'd start to bob and weave his body. He'd side step to the left, then the right, all while aligning his punches properly to make the most out of his movements.  The more he punched the humanesque dummy, the more accustomed his own body became with such foreign actions. \n<bR><br>\n\nSuddenly, he recalled his latest sparring session with Ichiro.  It brought memories back, particularly the clinch. It was something he knew those who fought with their fists used, but he wasn't entirely familiar with it.  He closed his eyes, recalling Ichiro's movements down to a T. As his mind played back the memory, his body began to mimic the hold.  He began by stepping closer towards the dummy and reaching his left arm out, hooking his hand along its \"neck\". Swiftly, he pulled the dummy closer to his own body and fired out a kidney shot.  His fist echoed upon impact, rattling the very base of the punching bag.\n<br><bR>\n\nKida's lips curled into a smile as he reeled his right fist back and launched another kidney shot. He'd fire two more in rapid succession before releasing his clinch. However, that wasn't the end of his training. The fighter threw his left fist into the upper portion of the dummy, followed by a right, then a final left into the center body.  \n<br><br>\n\nEven though he was striking out at a practice dummy, he understood the flow behind his own movements.  It was now becoming clearer to see how well his techniques would transition into an actual foe. However, since he had no partner to test his limits on, he continued to use the dummy as necessary. <br><br>\n\n He took a few steps back, readjusting his distance to bring out the most from his strikes. His eyes glazed along the silhouette of the dummy. He quickly readjusted his stance, allowing for more focus on offense rather than balance. In a single motion, he found himself on top of the dummy, sending countless punches in its direction. One by one, he'd send blurred fists at the post. His knuckles bruised and his skin began to peel. His knuckles became bloodied, and started to paint the punching bag in the lukewarm crimson liquid.\n<br><br>\n\nKida heeded no attention to his injuries and only focused on his own progression. He was driven by the need to obtain strength, and this was the only way he knew how. He was like an uncontrollable beast, throwing his fists back and forth against the frame of the dummy. He'd alternate between simple one two jab combos, to body barrages, to various clinch holds.  The feeling of slamming his fist into something had to be engraved into his mind. If he wanted to become the strongest, he'd have to go through hoops and flames to achieve it. \n<br><bR>\n\nThe fighter kept with his assault, striking over and over. He'd switch up his footing once in a while, choosing to lean his body to the left, and then the right, followed by a swift hook. The practice dummy was now riddled with fist imprints and torn apart from his erratic movement. He treated it as anything else in his way, a punching bag. <br><br>\n\nKida briefly took a rest, backing himself up from the training post to catch his breath. His entire body was soaked in sweat, glistening in the rays of the sun. He glanced down at his fists. They were a bloodied mess. His skin had peeled off and revealed the pink flesh that laid under the epidermis. Blood was spread all along his knuckles. Some of it had dried up while some seemed fresh.  His fists weren't hurting, but that was probably from the adrenaline rushing through his head. <br><br>\n\nHe reached into his bag and took out a few pieces of cloth, wrapping them around his fists to turn them into hand wraps. His fingers compressed against each other, testing out the tightness and functionality of the wraps. They weren't too tight, but they were tight enough to prevent his fists from further bleeding for the time being.  Once his resting period was over, he began his rampage once more. <br><br>\n\n34He started off by bringing his fists up to his chest. His arm laid across his stomach, while the left reeled back.  As he did so, he'd twist his body to supplement the stored potential of the punch. After a brief moment, he stepped forwards throwing his left fist out all while putting his body weight behind the attack. It was a punch, but held more power due to the added forward movement.  The training dummy rattled quite a bit, almost enough to knock it off of its post.<br><br>\n\n35 That wasn't the end.  He jumped back before pushing forwards and throwing out another barrage of punches. He kept his fists tight towards his chest and his body to the ground.  Like a hungry wolf approaching its prey, Kida unleashed his fury onto the training dummy.  His first blow was a right punch towards the lower body, followed by a left which hit the midsection.  A few more punches were thrown into the mix, al climbing up along its body. Upon reaching the upper portion of the dummy, Kida launched a powerful hook in which he stepped into, followed by another from the right. <br><br>\n\nFrom the constant abuse and battery from Kida, the training dummy's wood post once again rattled. During the final hit, Kida placed enough strength behind the punch to uproot it from the ground, sending it towards a nearby tree.  His eyes glanced at the now downed post, breathing heavily.  A smirk materialized along his face as he lowered his arms.  He had grown fatigue from the constant punching, but he felt as though he obtained something.  \"I think that's enough,\" he muttered, throwing himself onto the ground to rest some more.<br><br><br>"
