Without anyone to train with or even anyone to team him anything he thought that he should train things he already know such as his high speed, Shunshin no jutsu. It was really all he could really do and with that being the jutsu the drains the most out of him it only makes sense to work on trying to better control it.\n\nHe’d first leave from the crowd of the square and head away to a less populated area of the village. Once there, he’d have to get himself ready for his training. Instead of jumping straight in he’d actually do a bit of meditation first. It was good for him to begin by feeling out his chakra before he begins just pouring it all into his legs at well. It was something simple but it was a good warm up for his practice.\n\nNow that he was off by himself, the youngster shinobi would sit upon the ground, crossing his legs.His hands would come together at the fingertips and held upside how forming something of an upside down triangle. Once in his pose he’d take a deep breath through the nose and close his eyes. He’d exhale through his mouth as he begins to clear his mind of all thoughts. He’d focus on nothing but his chakra, trying to get a feeling for the flow of chakra coursing throughout his body.\n\nHowever, he wouldn’t feel anything at first. The young boy took in another deep breath and exhales repeatedly. His body begins to soon relax and after the boy would begin to feel his the flow of chakra throughout his body. It wouldn’t be by much but it was more than enough for him and now that he could feel it, he decided to move on to try working on the jutsu.\n\nThe boy’s hands swiftly shift into the ram hand seal and once there, he’d begin to redirect the flow of chakra within himself towards his legs. Not being very experienced with controlling his chakra, his chakra would actually flood downwards to his legs and not only that but most of it was actually wasted.

What chakra he managed to retain and build would actually vitalize his legs, strengthening them to the peek of their strength.\n\nOnce he he was at a comfortable amount of chakra built, he’d quickly spring to his feet and push off. The small child would shoot off in a amazing burst of speed. However, with this speed we wasn’t even sure where he was exactly to know when to stop. The simple fact of the matter was that this jutsu had more downsides than good for him at the moment, which is why he was trying to master it.\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Chakra T1, Chakra control T2, Ration training T2 ( Day 3) - Mon Dec  7 20:43:44 2015</b><font><hr><br>(*Hiroshi sighs and crosses his arms for a moment. \" Hmm... how am I going to do this.\" he mumbles to himself. \" Of course I have to use raiton... but one shot's not going to do it... so.. I guess i have to use my combo into combo move then. Dang... I didn't want to use that.\" he continued in his head nodding and reaching into his front pouch.\n<br><br>\n\" Okay so this is going to take a few move a bear with me.\" He says to his bro. \" You never said I had to do it in one move~\" He'd continues jumping straight up into the air. From his front , he'd upp four kunai tagged with paper bombs. He'd throw one for each cardinal direction around the stone with them all active but on an extended timer so they would blow just yet.*)\n<br><br>\n\n(*Hiroshi  begins to count the second in his head \" One... two... three.\" he though forming a single seal and building chakra to his lungs.

Bits and pieces would breaks away from the boulder but it would still stand. However that wasn't the end of his onslaught.*)\n<br><br>\n\n(*Hiroshi from there would switch hands to another seal. ( Tiger I think it was? I don't remember) and he'd take another deep breath, channeling chakra again. This eye quickly scans over the face of the boulder and took aim at a rather deep crack in it. The moment he does, he'd fire off a shot of water from his mouth directly at it.\n<br><br>\nThe water gun itself would do a small amount of damage, pushing away loose stones in the area on the boulder but hitting it with that jutsu wasn't really the full aim here. He simply wanted to get the boulder wet for the final blow. ( Gigady I know.)*)\n<br><br>\n\n(*Hiroshi finally was ready to finish this up. His hands come close together and lighting would begin to spark between his hands. A wide grin crosses his face as a ball of lighting forms between them. \"Alright! Final shot!\" the boy shout firing the ball of lighting right at the crack he shot his watergun at. The impact itself would send rocks flying but the electricity would run deeper into the stone following the water. This causes the boulder to damn near implode, causing halves of the rocks to separate and slide apart.\n<br><br>\nSo say the least the boulder just got wrekt.*)<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b> Katana proficient, T1 Studious T1 - Tue Dec  8 02:13:07 2015</b><font><hr><br>\n(*Hiroshi unseals his bokken from his scroll and take it in hand. “ Okay well it’s time to work on this some more I guess.” he mumbles beginning to get into his starting stance.

It was another day and another training session. It seems everyone was on him about mastering his jutsus so it was time for him t do a bit more training. It sucked but someone had to do it.\n<br><br>\nInstead of going straight into it and going shooting jutsu after jutsu off, he'd head to the academy for a bit of studying first. It was nothing fancy he just had to read over some of the scrolls about raiton jutsus. He thought if he could learn more about how to control and easy access his chakra than he'd be better off and it would be easier to master his jutsu.\n<br><br>\nOnce he made it there to the academy he'd head over to the classroom and find the bookshelves they had there. Scanning over them all he'd see that many of the scrolls were useless to him at the moment but then he finds one about natures of chakra. Thinking that that's as close as he was probably going to get, he'd pick it up and take a seat.\n<br><br>\nOpening the scroll he'd silently read it to himself about the natures. Much of this he already knew. ike how one element affected another but others he wasn't so sure about. In one passage the states that to use raiton, one has to \" Image their chakra sparking and flowing like an electric current.\" IT sounds strange to him but it seems all the imagery for the jutsus were.\n<br><br>\nRegardless, he was done here. After putting the scroll away the boy head on out side and finds himself a nice isolated spot to begin a bit of training. \" Well that didn't help much..\"he mumbled bringing his hands up, palms facing one another. \" Well.. it's something iI guess.\" he thought beginning the channel chakra to his hands. Sparks of lightning began to bounce between his hands before clashing together and fusing, creating a ball of lighting that'd expand bigger and bigger.\n<br><br>\nOnce it was at good size for him, he'd launch the ball forward at a nearby boulder. The ball of lightNing riddles the boulder with lightNing and causes several cracks to erupt around it after the initial hit that broke the stones. It was a much better go then his normal try but this was far from over for him. He had to master this jutsu which his REALLY unfortunate for him.\n<br><br>\nSeeing as he still had more training to go, he'd actually bring his hands back near each other. The glowing blue hue would shine brightly from his hands. THe crackle of lightning would begin to chatter as lighting begins to spring back and forth between his hands. The lighting then began to twist and collide with each other forming a ball of pure lightning. Not only that but it'd get bigger and bigger.\n<br><br>\nThe ball would grow to about the size of a basketball before it was launched forwards at the boulder. With a loud crashing sound the boulder cracks and electricity runs along the outside of the boulder. \" Better but still not good enough.\" he said bringing his hands close together again right after the shot.\n<br><br>\nHis hands steady and yet another fit of lighting begins to chatter between his hands. The electric bolts the bounced back and forth. His palms glow a blue hue and another ball of lighting would be formed. As the ball grew his hands would slowly get further and further apart until he thought it was a good size. From there he's launch the ball forth and into the boulder in front of him causing it to break and have large chuckles of it fall apart.*)<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Chakra T1, Chakra control T2, Ration training T2, T1 Studious T1 - Tue Dec  8 21:40:28 2015</b><font><hr><br>(*Hiroshi seemed to not be completely mastered his jutsu.

A blue hue begins to glow from his hands electricity began to jump between his hands. A ball of lighting would form from these sparks and grow at a steady rate.\n<br><br>\nOnce it was a good size, the boy raises it up over his hand and then thoses it forwards. The ball was aimed to slam into the ground and explode releasing a surge of lightning to dance about the impact location. \" Hmm... good but still not enough.\" the boy notes thinking he just had to try again.\n<br><br>\nSeeing as he wasn't happy with his result he'd bring his hands back in front of his chest and begin to channel chakra to them.

Once the ball was a large enough size it's be thrown at the ground again.\n<br><br>\nIt'd impact with a boom kicking dust and rock.

His bokken raises over his head and his hand slides down slightly just before sending the wooden blade downwards as he stops forwards.

This would allow him to move at near untrackable speeds. For others and even himself.\n<br><br>\nThe moment he pushed off, he’d shoot off like a rocket at high speeds. With all this speed, he was unable to even tell where he was going. Not only that he wasn’t even sure how much ground he was covering making it hard to know when to stop.

This wasn't just some idle stretch for the heck of it. \" OKay and now to start.\"he thought, drawing his iron katana from his hip. \" Just a few more of this dumb strikes...\" he continued to himself sliding into this starting stance.\n\nThe boy's feet separate, sliding wider apart to keep his balance.

His arms still swayed a bit as his strength wasn't enough to really hold it.\n\nRegardless of that small fact, he'd go to begin his training, raising his katana overhead and beginning to go through the steps of his strikes as quickly as he could. First the katana went up, his lower hand on the hilt slide down to in sure he'd keep a good grip, the katana was then slashed straight down as he lifts and stomps his leading leg forwards and stopping the slash about half way down to be parallel to the ground, and finally he'd pull himself back into the starting stance.\n\nThis motion would be repeated time after time. He simply was trying to get better at his kenjutsu and without even realizing it he was starting to get faster and faster at moving through his steps for it. The strike themselves still needed work. There were many issues. The blade was shaky, and the strikes were actually pretty slow all thing considered but the form started to get better over time.\n\nBefore he knew it, it'd seem the boy would begin to fun out of steam as his breath begins to become heavy. His arms began to burn from the weight of the katana and sweat began to run from his face. The moment he noticed all this, his arms lower his katana and he's sigh \" Better... I guess...\"\n\nHe'd sheathe his sword and bend down to take a seat on the ground. For the moment he wasn't going to do anything else but hang out.

His arms reaching high above his head in the night's moon light. With a childish groan, he'd lean over to his left side and extend his right arm up and over his head. He'd then begin a short count, muttering it to himself as he holds the stretch. \" One... two.. three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten. \" the young boy counts off before reversing the stance.\n<br><br>\n He'd now lean to his right, extending his left arm over his head and begin the count yet again. \" One... two.. three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten. \" he'd count off again before moving into another's stretch. Next he put his hands to his hips and rail back a bit. This wasn't just some idle stretch for the heck of it. \" OKay and now to start.\"he thought, drawing his iron katana from his hip. \" Just a few more of this dumb strikes...\" he continued to himself sliding into this starting stance. \n<br><br>\nThe boy's feet separate, sliding wider apart to keep his balance. He'd move his right foot forwards slight, tilting his hips slightly. He'd grasp his katana firmly with both hands trying to hold the sword steady. This would be the stance Kyu taught him, however, it still wasn't the best. His arms still swayed a bit as his strength wasn't enough to really hold it.\n<br><br>\n Regardless of that small fact, he'd go to begin his training, raising his katana overhead and beginning to go through the steps of his strikes as quickly as he could. First the katana went up, his lower hand on the hilt slide down to in sure he'd keep a good grip, the katana was then slashed straight down as he lifts and stomps his leading leg forwards and stopping the slash about half way down to be parallel to the ground, and finally he'd pull himself back into the starting stance. This motion would be repeated time after time. He simply was trying to get better at his kenjutsu and without even realizing it he was starting to get faster and faster at moving through his steps for it. \n<br><br>\nThe strike themselves still needed work. There were many issues. The blade was shaky, and the strikes were actually pretty slow all thing considered but the form started to get better over time. Before he knew it, it'd seem the boy would begin to fun out of steam as his breath begins to become heavy. His arms began to burn from the weight of the katana and sweat began to run from his face. The moment he noticed all this, his arms lower his katana and he's sigh \" Better... I guess...\" He'd sheathe his sword and bend down to take a seat on the ground. For the moment he wasn't going to do anything else but hang out. He'd pull a scroll from his back pouch and unroll it in front of him. He's unseal a textbook in a plume of white smoke and open it. The studying never ended.... the struggles.*)\n<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Katana proficient T1 Studious T1 - Thu Dec 10 18:53:13 2015</b><font><hr><br>(*Hiroshi groans yet again he had to do more of his training and more of his homework so today he was just going to put the two together. He'd sit down on his knees and open his text books. Next to them were the blank pieces of paper he took out to record the answers he wrote down. Finally he takes out the bokken and lay it down next to him.\n<br><br>\n\" Okay now I guess I'll do a five strikes everytime time I get stuck\" he says with a nod setting the rule for himself. With that, he'd move on to begin his work. Today's subject was reading and the story they had to ready was a actually tale tell expressing how guilt can eat you alive and cause you to make poor choices.\n<br><br>\nHiro wasn't the best at reading and his comprehension was okay but that is what made this training even better. This way he would have plenty of times to do his practice strikes.  He'd begin to read the story. Much of it was in riddles and similes with a few metaphors splashed in for flare. It was just the challenge for the boy, stumbling over words and not understanding a few of the metaphors.\n<br><br>\nThroughout this, there were a few words that he just couldn't get. When that happened the oy stood up with a sigh and pick up his bokken. He'd move into the starting stance he was taught. His feet separate, sliding wider apart to keep his balance. He'd move his right foot forwards slight, tilting his hips slightly. He'd grasp his katana firmly with both hands trying to hold the sword steady.\n<br><br>\nFrom there he'd begin to make several strikes through the air. Of course he'd be mentally counting his way through his steps. First the katana went up, his lower hand on the hilt slide down to in sure he'd keep a good grip, the katana was then slashed straight down as he lifts and stomps his leading leg forwards and stopping the slash about half way down to be parallel to the ground, and finally he'd pull himself back into the starting stance. The boy continued to this this several time over and over counting aloud as he does each one.\n<br><br>\n\" One... two.. three... four... five..\" he'd count for each word work he couldn't pronounce or he simply didn't know. Throughout the passage there were many. Making it so that he ended up doing more than two hundred strikes before he was done. Tired and a bit sweaty he'd go back towards the book work to answer the questions about the story he just read.\n<br><br>\nHe his focus was a bit off seeing as he just finished doing tons of strikes but he was going to go ahead and work on it anyways. There was no need for him to have to rush t finish this later. There were only ten questions. All were multiple choice. Somewhere about the meaning of some of the text while others were more about what happened to make sure the reader was paying attention.\n<br><br>\nIn the end, the boy ended up being stumped n three of the questions and would have to ask his teacher or his Bro for help later but this meant that he would have to do fifteen more strikes.\n<br><br>\nWith a sight the boy stood to his feet and picked up his bokken yet again moving into his stance.The boy's feet separate, sliding wider apart to keep his balance. He'd move his right foot forwards slight, tilting his hips slightly all like before. It was nothing new for him.\n<br><br>\nHe'd proceed to do his fifteen extra strikes. At this point his arms were burning like they were on fire and his heaving got nothing but heavier but it was all for the best. He finally was done after those stikes and falls to a seated position. \"Okay... finally done....\"*)<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Katana proficient T1 - Thu Dec 10 22:41:04 2015</b><font><hr><br>(*Hiroshi takes a deep breath and begins to draw his iron katana. He's hol it with both ahnds at the ready and sigh a bit. \" Okay well back to doing more of these..\" he'd mumble shifting into his stance. Once he was in it he'd be to backing strikes through the air.\n\nHis katana lifts upwards over his head then his lower hand on the hilt slide down to in sure he'd keep a good grip, the katana was then slashed straight down as he lifts and stomps his leading leg forwards and stopping the slash about half way down to be parallel to the ground, and finally he'd pull himself back into the starting stance.\n\nThese strikes would be repeated time after time again. Stirke after strike trying to get them faster, stronger, and better formed. The strikes he were doing actually weren't bad. In truth, they have gotten a long way from the sloppy mess of an attack he use to have but they still needed work. The strikes were still a bit sloppy and  off a bit.\n\nThe strikes swayed a bit in the air and not only that but returning to his stance seems to still need some work. When he pulls back in, his feet sometimes soome to move too close together. It was a shame but even he noticed these thing and had to constinitly be mindfull of them.\n\nThe boy continues to do strike after strike until he was completely drained of his stamina. He had no more energy left byt the end and would stab his swprd into the groun and take a knee. \" Ugh... I hate this..\" he mumbles rubbing his arms. \" They feel like there' on fire..\" he murmered with a sight and moving towards his katana. He'd pull it from the grouns and sheathe it. \" That's enugh for now I guess.*)<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Chakra T1, Chakra control T2, Ration training T2 Studious T1 - Thu Dec 10 23:30:33 2015</b><font><hr><br>(*Hiroshi knew that he was going to have to do something if he wanted to get any better but being so young he didn’t even know where to even begin. Without anyone to train with or even anyone to team him anything he thought that he should train things he already know such as his high speed, Shunshin no jutsu. It was really all he could really do and with that being the jutsu the drains the most out of him it only makes sense to work on trying to better control it.\n<br><br>\nHe’d first leave from the crowd of the square and head away to a less populated area of the village. Once there, he’d have to get himself ready for his training. Instead of jumping straight in he’d actually do a bit of meditation first. It was good for him to begin by feeling out his chakra before he begins just pouring it all into his legs at well. It was something simple but it was a good warm up for his practice.\n<br><br>\nNow that he was off by himself, the youngster shinobi would sit upon the ground, crossing his legs.His hands would come together at the fingertips and held upside how forming something of an upside down triangle. Once in his pose he’d take a deep breath through the nose and close his eyes. He’d exhale through his mouth as he begins to clear his mind of all thoughts. He’d focus on nothing but his chakra, trying to get a feeling for the flow of chakra coursing throughout his body.\n<br><br>\nHowever, he wouldn’t feel anything at first. The young boy took in another deep breath and exhales repeatedly. His body begins to soon relax and after the boy would begin to feel his the flow of chakra throughout his body. It wouldn’t be by much but it was more than enough for him and now that he could feel it, he decided to move on to try working on the jutsu.\n<br><br>\nThe boy’s hands swiftly shift into the ram hand seal and once there, he’d begin to redirect the flow of chakra within himself towards his legs. Not being very experienced with controlling his chakra, his chakra would actually flood downwards to his legs and not only that but most of it was actually wasted. Much like a white water rapid, his chakra rushed and spilled over seeping out of his body. What chakra he managed to retain and build would actually vitalize his legs, strengthening them to the peek of their strength.\n<br><br>\nOnce he he was at a comfortable amount of chakra built, he’d quickly spring to his feet and push off. The small child would shoot off in a amazing burst of speed. However, with this speed we wasn’t even sure where he was exactly to know when to stop. The simple fact of the matter was that this jutsu had more downsides than good for him at the moment, which is why he was trying to master it. Along with his extreme tunnel vision was the strain this jutsu put on a boy as small and young as he is.\n<br><br>\nSoon enough, he’d come to a sliding stop and then fall to his knees. “ Dang It… that drains way too much..” he’d pant. Even with his large reserves of chakra this jutsu, shunshin no jutsu, seemed to eat away most of it in a single use. It was obviously something that couldn’t be left alone of he was going to use it it combat.\n<br><br>\nRegardless of how useful the jutsu is for him at the moment, he’d sit down on the ground and form the ram hand seal again. He was simply going to meditate for the time beginning as he gathered his strength back. While he was waiting, he’d go back to just trying to get a feel for his chakra. He’d begin his breathing once more, in though the nose and out through the mouth. The boy repeated this cycle as he focused all of his attention inwards to his chakra flow.\n<br><br>\nAfter a while of meditation, he’d feel as if he gained back his strength. His hands shift back into the ram hand seal and he’d begin to focus his chakra into his legs. Yet again a large amount of his chakra would be wasted but what was maintained would strengthen his legs considerably. Once again he’d spring to his feet and push off, shooting off like a speeding bullet across a clearing.\n<br><br>\nSadly, the boy wasn’t able to even really tell where he was as he was moving and when he stopped yet again a massive amount of his chakra was gone. With almost all his chakra being gone, he’d fall to a seated position on the ground, panting a bit. This was going to take far more training if he wanted to be able to use this for anything at all.*)<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Chakra T1 Chakra control T2 - Thu Dec 10 23:39:05 2015</b><font><hr><br>(*Hiroshi yawns not really wanting to but knowing he had to do some training if he was going to get better at the technique he’s been trying to approve upon for some time. He’d gather his things from his home and heads into the forest of Mori. However, he would just go strolling through the forest idly roaming around. He’d have an idea of where to go but he’d need to move quickly and to spot them with ease.\n<br><br>\nTo do this, he’d use the one technique he was trying to get better use of. The high speed technique known as shunshin. So far, his body has yet to adjust to the high speed and he is unable to really tell where he is.  Thsi could be fix but he will need much much mor training on his shunshin.\n<br><br>\nSo he was going to practice more and more with it. He'd form the ram handseal again and channel chakra to his legs. With a deep breath, he'd ush off, shooting off in a burst of speed like no other. Upon trying to stop, his feet slide in the sand to a stop. \" Dammit... I still need more work at it..\" he murmered to himself forming the seal and shotting off again.*)<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Chakra T1, Chakra control T2, Ration training T2, Katana proficient T1 Studious T1 - Fri Dec 11 01:48:48 2015</b><font><hr><br>(*Hiroshi frowned as they were walking into the building. The ragged area the terrible smell he got int his nose and the burning of his eyes from the weed smoke that polluted the air. It was all rather sickening for him. Not only that but it made his head head more the closer ad closer they got to the building.\n<br><br>\n\" This place smells.. my head hurts... and ... it SMELLS!\" he thought to himself carrying a grumpy face all the way into the building. Once in there even he could feel the shift in the area and the hostility they all seemed to have towards them. Hiro's foot motions backwards, slighting afraid ina situation like this but he wouldn't run. After all he had his big bro.\n<br><br>\nAs the negotiations go on, he'd simply stand there and look over all of the people counting them in his head. \" One, two, three.... seven... ten... hmm... about sixteen counting the boss?\" he thought glancing behind him to see that there were another four or five guys behind them blocking their escape. \" They have a lot of guys in this gang.\" he thought to himself looking back forwards as the boss man started to shout.\n<br><br>\nHe'd chuckle a bit as the boss was launched backwards into the other gang of outlaw and was given to que to go ahead a fight. \" Sweet a rumble!\" the boy should clapping his hands together. As he pulls them apart, the sound of lighting chatters loudly. Between his hands would for a ball of lighting he shot at the pile of gang members shocking the living hell of of them.\n<br><br>\nThe gang member behind the two boys would pull out their weapons. Pipes, chains, and even a kunai would be seen pulled out by the members before the rushed behind the two. \" Behind us!\" Hiro says beginning to look behind them. Not only that but the boss seemed to be down but was far from out.\n\nThe large man stood back up with a roar like cry \" YOU SON OF A---!\" the man shouts attempting to draw his gun and aim it towards Blue. Was quite the spot the two would be in.... why do negotiations ever work?\n<br><br>\nSadly, even with the spot they’re in it seems other members could hear to comotion and the sounds of extra movement not in the room yet could be hear. It sounds as if people were running down stairs and stomping on the upper floor sound like thunder over head. It’d appear more men were on there way down.*)\n<br><br>\n\n(*Hiroshi wasn't all the combat savvy. If anything all of this was a bit taken by all of this but he wasn't going to just get beat up. Nah, that would look bad, very bad and he wasn't going to have that in front of his bro. PRAYS THE GODS that Hiro dodged the bullet shot at him by the thugs but with him over there, that left him with having to deal the the few men running up behind him.\n<br><br>\nHe wasn't skilled enough to just go punching them all out like his bro so he did what he always did... shock them. He'd quickly build chakra and emit it in the form of electricity as the thugs got close. They all would be stunned by the shock wave of lighting before the boy reached for his katana at his side. In a single fluid drawing strike, the boy would cut all of the men's wastes. No blood would spill but all of there pants would drop exposing those nice underroos.\n<br><br>\nJust after that the man Blue throw would collide with the group sending them all the ground. The boy chuckles thinking that that was simply hilarious but he didn't have the time to really enjoy it. His eyes look back to his brother whom was still giving the rest of the bandits the finest or hands. Already thinking ahead he knew something would have to be done and he'd begin to channel chakra to the end of his sword.\n<br><br>\nHe waited for the perfect time which, his bro would nicely give him with a sticky water normal water combo. The boy creates another ball of lighting at the end of his sword that he's raise upwards and send flying at the soaking wet men \" Buh bye~~~\" the boy chimes as they all were shocked is easily incapacitated.\n<br><br>\nSeeing as the only two left standing were the Hiroshi brother, Green would sheathe his sword and grin \" I expected that to go a TON worse.\" he says to his brother with a smile \" Happy it didn't though... so do we just leave these guys to twitch and go back to Koji?\" the boy asks this being his first mission he honestly wasn't sure.*)<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b> Studious T1 Ration training T2 - Fri Dec 11 06:47:28 2015</b><font><hr><br>(*Hiroshi // Just as Blue lets out his cry is sorry three students would come walking into the class. One was a girl, bright eyed and radiates sweetness in her pink spaghetti strapped dress and two boys, one with goggles and a cocky grin and the last a rather chunky kid would seemed to be eating a bag of chips of some kind.\n<br><br>\nThe boy's eyes turn to the youngsters as the take their seats. The goggled boy call out \" Aye! So what are we learning!\" in a overly loud tone.  Green flinches a bit before looking around. \" Ugh... this is so lame...\" he thought to himself before clearing his throat and facing the students. He fought a gang in the last mission three little kids were no contest!\n<br><br>\n\" Okay listen up!\" Green says in a clear and loud enough tone for them all to hear. \" Today we're learning the chakra natures. There's five elemental chakra natures used for ninjutsu in total. There's fire, wind, lightning, earth and water.\" he says raising a hand and counting off all the elements with his fingers. Just to the students could tell there were only five.\n<br<><br>\nHe'd then look to his bro to continue.*)\n<br><br>\n\n\n(*Hiroshi frowns a bit as he realizes... yeah he didn't even tell them his name. Honestly he was just trying to get it over with. Hiro wasn't exactly as social as his brother but getting back to it he'd sigh and nods a bit at how the lesson was going so far.\n<br<><br>\nSeeing as attention went back to him, it was his job to say the final snig bit. The boy take a deep relaxing breath and begins to speak. \" Well... elements don't just counter each other. They can also help each other out.\"The boy explains \" For example fire is stronger against wind but it doesn't just counter it. Wind will actually power it up.\"\n<br<><br>\nThe boy nods and begins walking towards the desk. As he does so the chubby kid with the chips calls out \" Oh! Just like when mom fans the fire on the grill!?\". Hiroshi nods \" Exactly like that. It makes the fire stronger.\" He says before pulling out a scroll and unrolling it across the teacher's desk.\n<br<><br>\n\" Now just like that water and lighting have a cool relationship. Lighting will actually run across water as far as it can and it's a bit stronger to boot.\" He says unsealing a long but narrow container of water from the scroll. \" Just like this~\" the boy says lifting his right hand and making a pinching like pose with his fingers. Between them would spark a small ball of lighting to be dropped into the water.\n<br<><br>\nNormally a ball that size wouldn't get far but with aid from the water the long two foot container would light up like a christmas tree. \" See a ball that size would do all this normally but by using it with water it can get a lot more done.\" he says sealing the container away again.\n<br<><br>\nAll the kids faces light up as the sparks fly. They clap and cheer \" That's cool!! \" Hiro look to blue and tilts his head a bit. \" So.. that's about it right?\"*)\n<br>\"<html><body><center><background color = \"black\"><font color =\"grey\" size = 2>\"<br><hr><br><font size = 3><b>Katana proficient T1 - Fri Dec 11 07:13:55 2015</b><font><hr><br>(*Hiroshi sighs as he follows his brother, first to get the saw and then out towards the forest. This was an easy mission. Hell -I- can cut down a tree and I'm fucked up but I digress. The mission was to give out wood like oprah so i say YOU get some wood and YOU get some wood!\n<br><br>\nOnce on the outskirts Blue would say probably the strangest thing he would ever hear. Leaving his bro behind? Even if he could tell his brother was serious he was never going to do that. He'd agree anyways making sure to cross his fingers. He'd rather die with his brother then leave him behind. \" Right~\" he'd say slipping his crossed fingers into his pocket.\n<br><br>\nOnce into the woods they're find the tall tree. It was just a tree but it was quite taller than the rest and that raised a flag to Hiro. The wood seems to be fine without any marking from anything however on the way here was claw marks on a few trees a sign of bears being near.\n<br><br>\nShrugging, Hiro figured it'd be better to just get this done then go complaining. He'd take his side of the saw and begins to help his bro cut the tree. He'd act as if it was part of his kenjutsu training, taking a stance of his kenjutsu and twisting his body as if he was doing a horizontal slash, trying to get the general motion down for training later on. it was a good start and would be rather easy honestly.\n<br><br>\nJust before the tree was completely sawed through a sound could be hear from a distance. A roar of sort echoing from the far. Green himself couldn't pinpoint the sounds but it wouldn't really matter as soon the tree would come crashing down. \" TIMBER!!!\" the boy shouts \" I always wanted to say that, heheh.\"*)<br>"

This effect goes around the body (not just the hands), making it just large enough for a person to move through. The user can pinpoint where they are, despite being underground, by sensing the magnetic forces. They can also sense what is happening on the surface and use that information to launch a surprise attack on the enemy.One can also hide deep in the ground, escaping to a depth where the enemy can't reach. It also appears that after digging, the ground can be returned to its original state, leaving no trace of where the user entered the earth."
