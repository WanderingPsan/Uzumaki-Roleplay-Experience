<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) had a mission and though he was excited he thought he shud work on a jutsu or two fire before he gets out there soon. With that in mind he thought since he got all his raiton jutsus under control then he shoud now go for some of his suiton jutsus. Seeing as he only knew one, it seems he was going with water gun for his training today.

The boy finds a nice place to train for himself, away from all the others and in an open space near the rocky walls that surround the village. Turning to face it, he’d make a single seal and close his eyes. The boy takes a deep breath in through the nose and exhales through the mouth. A simply trike to calm himself before building up his chakra. Taking in a breath, the chakra mixes with the air in his lungs and the result would be a torrent of water being shot forth from his mouth.

The water was strong enough to maybe cause a man to stumble but not where near enough to really do the damage he wanted from the jutsu near make as much as he wanted. When it crashes into the wall, the wall would take it extremely well. Nothing but a wet spot was left behind after the jutsu was done. It’d appear the wall would of taken little to no damage at all from the jutsu. “ Dang it… I need to get better with this..” he mumbles getting ready again.

His hands go right back into the seal and beginning to build up his chakra once more. It wasn’t that he really needed this to work out but he thought that since suiton aid his raiton that it would be the next logical choice even though his bro wouldn’t approve. Another water gun would be launched at the wall clashing against it and yet again not doing much of anything to it.

Water gu after water gun would be fired at the wall. However, he would stop after a while. There was nothing more he could do and he needed to save his chakra for later. “ Ugh.. this is annoying..” he muttered going off to take a break for the moment.* - Wed Dec  9 23:23:18 2015

A simply trike to calm himself before building up his chakra. Taking in a breath, the chakra mixes with the air in his lungs and the result would be a torrent of water being shot forth from his mouth.

THe water gun jutsu wasn't all that powerful. He never used it for it but it was strong enough to reach the wall form the few feet away he was at, unlike the first time. He was happy but the jutsu was still rather weak. There was no way it would do any damage to the wall, nor a bandit or gang member on a mission. THere was noting he could do but continue to work on it even more.

He'd take another deep breath before forming the hand seal again. Just like before, he'd build chakra to his lungs and spit out another burst of water. It was just as strong as the last. There was no diffence in it's force so there was no difference in the result. THe wall would take little to no damage from the cuncussive blurst of water.

The boy grins his teeth. " oh come on.." he mutters forming the seal again. This time he's let chakra flood to his lungs, infusing with the air inside of them. With an exhale, a turrent of water fired from his lips crashing into the wall. It was stronger this time but it still wasn't strong enough to do much of any damage.

" Ugh!!!" He'd cry un frustration. " All these elements are so annoying!!" he's continue in his rage, forming the seal once more. He'd poor even more chakra into it then before. After channeling this chakra he'd fire another shot of water. IT was only a D-rank jutsu but he wanted it to be stronger. However it seems the jutsu wasn't living up to his expectations as yet again it seems to do nothing to his target.* - Thu Dec 10 00:34:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) grins. It's been some time since he got to spar is ol buddy Otorius and the distance they started in was really a HUGE disadvantage for Oto. No way  he could run across all this ground that fast which puts an idea into the boy's head.

" Alright! Let's have some fun then~~" he'd cheer, forming but a single hand sign. From the boy's mouth a torrent of water would shoot out not at Oto. The shot was aimed at the ground between the two and was dragged, left to right, making a long 'C' like shape. His hands then slipped into his front pouch pockets as he waits for Oto's first move.* - Thu Dec 10 02:42:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) grin does nothing but widen. Of course he expected Oto to think there was something with the water. IT was the very same trick he pulled in the last spar but, always thinking ahead he expected that and planed to make yet another move.

Hiro would actually move forward and back, making it roughly where the bottom of the " C " shaped puddle starts. As he ran, he'd flick quite real kunais at Oto already knowing he could block them. They were only a distraction so that he could make another seal and fire off another water gun in another arc'd pattern.

Standing at the base of both of these puddles, quite literally Oto's only move was to come straight at him if he didn't want to step into the water. The boy seems to be having fun as he wanted to see what Oto would do about this situation.
