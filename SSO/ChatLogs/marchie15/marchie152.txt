<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) takes a deep breath with a single thought in his mind. " This is gonna suck~." The boy exhales raising his his hands into the ram seal and widening his stance slightly. This wasn't going to be very fun for him, nor was it going to be very easy but if he did nothing about it than he'd never be able to use it in battle.

Having a bit of a dragging his heels moment he didn't do anything at first but soon would have to get into gear. He'd begin to channel chakra into his legs. Feeling that much of his chakra was being wasted, he'd try to better control the amount of chakra being channeled for the jutsu. Though he'd have very little success with that.

Regardless, he'd be able to preform the jutsu just fine, pushing off at an extreme burst of speed. One so great, that he was still not use to it and upon stopping would fall to a knee feeling rather sickly. Even though he could perform it, he still couldn't handle it and not only physically. The drain on his chakra was great as well.

The boy sighs, sitting down and meditating for a while. He'd hold his hands in the ram hand seal and focus on his chakra. Meditation was key to chakra control,or so he was told.* - Tue Dec  1 20:18:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) was back at the normal place to yet again work on his jutsus... yay~. For a youngster that he is this was actually rather boring for him but it was all he could do for the time being. He'd raise his hand to touch the boulder inform on  him and begins to build his chakra.

He'd try to channel his chakra to his hand but it was more like a flood. Do to his very poor control over his chakra, much of his chakra would run rampant and be wasted before the chakra turns into lightning. The electricity from his hand runs along the outside of the stone chattering as it fades away. Sadly, the boulder did little to no damage to the stone though.

The boy grins his teeth and tries again. His chakra spikes and floods to his hand. An electric surge would be send into the boulder again creating a blue hue to glow around the boulder. Yet again much of his chakra would be wasted in the performance of the jutsu but he could feel himself slowly improving.

" One more time..." the young shinobi says building and channeling his chakra once more. Another blue flash of light would be seen as the electric current shocks the boulder before him. However despite him trying the boulder seemed to be completely intact.

" Dammit..." the boy says falling to a seated position. He'd sigh and form the ram hand seal. He'd meditate for the time being. Just long enough to get his strength back.* - Wed Dec  2 01:04:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) had to do a bet of meditating. According to his academy teacher, that meditation was a great way to help control his chakra. He very was one for meditation but if it helped him master this jutsu and move on to learning better ones he was all for it. As he sat, he’d hold the ram hand seal and focus upon his chakra. It wasn’t all that hard to feel his chakra but controlling it was the real problem.

Regardless, After a while of meditation he’d feel all of his strength return to him. Once it had he’d pull himself to his feet and place a hand to the large boulder before him. “ OKay.. here we go again I guess.” the boy though beginning to build his chakra. A rather sizeable amount of chakra would be focused forwards to his hand. This chakra would turn into an electric current that’d electrocute the boulder. The electricity wouldn’t even damage the boulder. Just a testament to how weak his jutsus really was.

The boy grits his teeth and food chakra to his hand again creating yet another surge of lighting to flow through the boulder. “ Oh come on!” he shouts in his head as a blue hue is released into the area. He just wanted the jutsu to be even a bit stronger if anything else. However despite his repeated attempts the boulder still stood with ease. It didn’t even take much damage or even crack it seems.

" Again!” he shouts in his mind building and discharging the bolt of electricity into the stone. The current could be seen pulsing outwards from his hand and running around the outside of the boulder before coming to an end at the opposite side of the stone. “ Argh this suck!” he’d shout beginning to build chakra to preform the jutsu one last time sending a shock of electricity through the rock.

" Tsk.. this jutsu is lame…” the boy says ending his training for now.* - Wed Dec  2 02:16:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) , now away from all the others, was ready to get the learning of his new jutsu! Finally he was given something new to learn and he wasn't going to let this chance pass him by! With that said, he'd pull the scroll from his pouch and open it to read it over.

" Hmm... looks like I just channel chakra into a ball? Seems easy enough." the boy mutters to himself as he reads the scroll. Rolling it back up and putting it away for the moment, the boy claps his hands together and slowly begin to pull them apart as he channels chakra into his hands. Just a if he was performing Raiton Flash, much of the chakra he was trying to use was wasted but soon enough sparks of electricity would bounce between his hands.

The sparks crackle and snap before eventually fizzling out. " Grr " the boy groans beginning to channel chakra into his hands again. The sparks of electricity return and this time a bit stronger. The lighting between his hands begin to increase in voltage and begin to be focused into a ball. The moment it does, the boy shifts his hands and try to shoot the ball forwards at the boulder before him.

However, as the ball was in flight it'd unravel and spark out before even hitting the rock. " Dang it! So close!" he'd mumble clapping his hands together once more. " Okay I got this." He'd think taking in a deep breath and exhaling through the mouth.

Slowly pulling his hands apart, he'd channel chakra to his hands. Trying to retain as much chakra as he could, he'd change it into his raiton nature to create lightning. THe lighting bounces between his hands and soon create a ball of electricity. " Here we go!" he'd shout sending the ball forwards at the boulder in front of him. The ball strikes the boulder with a reasonable about of force causing it to crack slightly.

" Much better!" the boy shouts " THis jutsu is so much stronger~" he says with glee. He was finally learning stronger jutsus and he was excited to learn even more.* - Wed Dec  2 11:09:52 2015
