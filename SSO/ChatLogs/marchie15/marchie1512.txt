<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) does a little yawn and stretch before strolling off to find somewhere else to train.* - Sun Dec 13 03:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) yawns, he was tired and didn't really feel like training but he might as well go for it seeing as he had nothing better to do. He was given the scroll to learn a new jutsu after all, he might as well go to learn it now rather then later. With that in mind he'd pull the scroll from his pouch and open it up.

He'd read over the scroll carefully to himself. It appears the jutsu that the boy thought it was it simply wasn't. It wasn't some amazing jutsu but just a simple wind chakra flow he could do to actually make his atttacks sharper. As he reads that a memory crosses his mind. The word of Lera when she was trainging him about the wind nature " Finely and sharply huh? heheh." the boy chuckles to himself putting the scroll down for the moment.

He was going to try it out, taking hold of his katana and drawing it. With a deep breath, the boy's eye close and begin to focus on his chakra. Chakra would be flowed into his katana which would be more or less the easy part however assecing his wind nature of his chakra would prove to be the difficult part.

The boy seemed to be really struggling as his body begins to trimble form the focus. " Oh come on... errrr.." the boy groan in his head channeling more and more chakra into his blade until the chakra actually moalded into a case like shape arounf his blade. It would be actual wind but the nature was there and Hiroshi could feel it.

Though he thinks he got it, he'd take a step towards a nearby cactus and that a swing at it. He didn't aim for it to be deep but as the blade cut through it, it seems his chakra would to as well, carving through further in the cactus on it's own. Noticing this the boy was actually slightly amazed looking down at the blade and slowing the flow of chakra.

" Huh?... well I guesseach nature does have it's own qualities..." the boy says with a sigh " now only if I could learn a lighitng chakra flow or even just a new move." he'd say sheathing his blade for the moment.* - Sun Dec 13 04:09:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) was just going to go now. Today has been a very confusing one as is. He'd stand, adjusting the kanata on his side, before walking off.* - Sun Dec 13 04:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) would head off to somewhere far away from the square. He didn't want to both anyone with his next set of training. After all he was going to work on ne of his annying little jutsus again. Today was the day he was going to learn to master the jutsu Shunshin which had always have him trouble.

With that in mind, he was going to take in a deep breath and form the ram hand seal, closing his easy and focusing all of his chakra into his legs. All of the boy's focus would turn to his chakra and he'd try to channel this chakra into his legs attempting to us his chakra t strengthen and revitilize them as much as he could. This strengthening would push his legs to the limit, making his legs strong enough to carry him at extreme speeds.

He'd push off, shooting off at a blinding fast speed. " Craaaaaaap!" he thought as he ran at such speeds that he wasn't even able to see where he was going. The high speeds actually made it very hard for him to tell where he was going. Not only that but he was moving at an extremely high speed which amde him unsure how far he was traveling as well. Still being a novice at the jutsu, he wasn't able to tell were he was on his own before yet. 

He'd come sliding to a stop and with a bit of his chakra drained out of him as well. " Dang... still too much.." he'd say to himself shifting his stance to get ready to do it again. His eyes lock next to a far off tree. With his shunshin he new he could make it there but the real question was if he could stop there without over shooting it or just stopping short.

With the target in mind, he'd form the ram handseal and begin to channel chakra to his legs once more. His chakra would infuse with his mussels, strengthening and revitlizing them. His chakra would boost his leg to their peek and allow him to move faster than he ever could before. With a push he'd shoot off like a rocket, turning into nothing more than a blur as he moved.

Seeing as he still was rather new with it, it seems he would miss his target location ever so slightly. The problem was that he could see where he was going so he could only take a guess from how fast he deemed he was moving at but even then he wasn't sure. Because of all this he acually ended up just past the tree and having to turn around to tell.

" Oh shoot over shot it...."* - Sun Dec 13 04:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) was close. He could feel it! The pesty jutsu that bothered him for so long would soon be mastered!! He'd actually get excited! Happy that he could finally be done with the bothersome jutsu. " kay just a bit more! I can do this..." he thought to himself beginning to channel chakra into his legs.

At his point it was just like if he was using a chakra flow jutsu. He became so skilled with the shunshin jutsu that he could now just flicker away without so much as a hand seal. Something that will actually be very handy in the future for him to do. Was always good to keep that in mind for later.

But at any rate his chakra pools into his legs, strengthening them. The jutsu would do as it always does, boosting his leg mucels to their peek and making them able to carry the boy at high speeds across a length of distance. This was good seeing as the boy was normally very slow.

his eyes lock to the side of a nearby tree and then he'd push off. To the eye, his form would blur and distort before vanishing all together. At the high speeds he was moving at, it would be defficult for anyone to really follow him and although he couldn't tell where he was going, he did know exactly where he would end up as he moved in this blinding tunnel vision.

He'd reapear next the the tree as planned with a smile on his face. " Heheh, I'm really getting this jutsu down now." the boy says taking a deep breath. Well I might s well do a bit more." he says to himself building chakra and pushing off again vanishing in a flash of speed. * - Sun Dec 13 05:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) was going to do a bit more of his training. He'd head out to a spot where no one will mind if he put a bunch of holes in. Once there he could have his training begin! Today's jutsu? It was the jutsu Hiding likr a Mole! A simple jutsu that just lets him sink under ground and stay from harm. Not only that but he could still tell what was going on over head.

With a smill he'd form the tier hand seal and begin to build up his chakra. THis chakra would be projected outwards onto his body. This results in a coat of chakra around the boy. NExt he just needed to change the nature of the chakra to doton and once he could he would sink under the ground.

He's quickkly drop under the ground as if it was water. The gorund around him would turn into sand allowing for easy movment. While under ground, he could even still tell what was hapening above ground as well by using the magnetic feild above him. Although there was nothing going on at th moment see as he was alone.

With a smile the boy begins to move through the ground as if it was nothing. As he moved, the ground even coses up behind him making it as if he was never there int the first place. It was an amazing jutsu and an actual fun time playing around with it befire he come back up to the surface.

" Heheh, that actuall wasn't too bad." he says to himself with a grin. He'd begin to dust off all the dust and sand left on him and walk off to do soemthing else.* - Sun Dec 13 05:48:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Cause... reasons but yeah you know her too? Mitsu must have lot of friends. - Sun Dec 13 07:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Thats nice to see, she likes to think she doesn't have friends. But, shes got tons of them. - Sun Dec 13 07:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Mhm..  - Sun Dec 13 07:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Well. There is a difference between friends and people who know eachother. - Sun Dec 13 07:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: I know... but she really underestimates how many people love her.  - Sun Dec 13 07:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Mhm.  - Sun Dec 13 07:54:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Kyu Senpai do you know any kenjutsu techniques you can teach me? I'm trying to get better at kenjutsu still and I'd like something more to practice. - Sun Dec 13 07:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Nope, I really don't have any to teach you. - Sun Dec 13 08:16:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Hiroshi if you want to get better with Kenjutsu. Do you want to go try and spar with me? - Sun Dec 13 08:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Uh... sure? But pretty sure you can send me to the stars with one swing so take it easy on me? - Sun Dec 13 08:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Can I watch? - Sun Dec 13 08:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Hey~ what does that mean " Someone like me~" - Sun Dec 13 08:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Oh nothing lets go now. - Sun Dec 13 08:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Hey Lera. - Sun Dec 13 08:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hrm? - Sun Dec 13 08:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Hey Auntie Lera - Sun Dec 13 08:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hey thee - Sun Dec 13 08:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Just saying hi. - Sun Dec 13 08:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: So want me to use my real sword or bokken? - Sun Dec 13 08:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) blinks a few times ass sand was blown just from the woman swinging her sword around. He'd sigh and reach over to grab the hilt of his blade. He had only one thought cross his mind. " I'm dead.. I'm totally going to die..." as he draws his sword and got into a readied stance.

His feets slide further apart and his knees bend, getting himself ready for this. He knew there was NO way he was going to come out of this okay if he just charges her... but what was the point if he just used his jutsus? It'd seem like he was there frozen for a moment for actually making a choice of how he wanted to handle this. " Okay~ I think I'm ready!" he'd call out lowering himself slightly.

Chakra would build in his legs, vitalizing them to their peek. The boy pushes off with an intense burst of speed towards Chikyu. One so fast that not ever he could see where he was going but he knew where he would end up. The boy comes to a sliding stop at Kyu's right side and the sword would be at the ready to make a horizontal slash towards her side. Of course this attack wasn't anywhere near as fast as what Kyu can do and it wasn't aimed to do a cut deeper than to just break skin but it was an attempt.* - Sun Dec 13 08:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) was block and he was upset by it but he'd be more upset if that torrent of water hit him. Kyu's arms would wrap around him and he'd be rushed off. He wasn't even sure what was going on until the group stopped and he was looking down at the mass of water below.

" W-what the--? What's going on Kyu Senpai?"* - Sun Dec 13 08:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) nods. He wasn't going to fight Chikyu's judgement " Right."* - Sun Dec 13 08:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) was actually looking towards the west the moment they got to a better point. He wasn't really worried for his own safety. Instead, he was more worried about His brother and Nami but it didn't seem like the water reached out far enough to effect the house.

He'd look to Kyu and smile " I'm fine too but I have cookies if either of you want any~. I always come with sweets~" the boy says with a happy tone and a large smile. Him being upset about this wasn't going to help and judging from everyone's reaction, it seems like everyone needed so happy.* - Sun Dec 13 09:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Don't see why not. - Sun Dec 13 09:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Mhm.. - Sun Dec 13 09:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Whoa you got everything, Kyu Senpai, heheh. You just walk around with that all the time? - Sun Dec 13 09:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: I only carry six shuriken and my sword for weapons. So, I have lots of space for supplies like this. - Sun Dec 13 09:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Where are all your supplies? six shuriken is nowhere near enough. - Sun Dec 13 09:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Never needed them. - Sun Dec 13 09:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Lucky~ - Sun Dec 13 09:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) takes a seat next to Chikyu and reachs behind him. After digging around in his back pouch for a moment, he'd pull a scroll from it and open it. In a puff of white smoke, a plate of still hot cookies wouls appear for him to enjoy.

" You want any Claud?" the boy asks offering her a chocolate chip cookie.* - Sun Dec 13 09:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Huh... No.. - Sun Dec 13 09:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Well is there anything you want? I have a few different things sealed away. - Sun Dec 13 09:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: No I don't need anything. - Sun Dec 13 09:26:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Oh, I'm just saying I missed you. Think we bump into each once and awhile. - Sun Dec 13 09:37:39 2015
