<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) seemed to not be completely mastered his jutsu. Something that he was about to change for sure. He knew he was close but just had to put in even more effort than he has already. Though it was going to be hard and annoying work.

Just like before he'd bring his hands close together with his palms facing each other. " OKay this should be pretty easy." he thought to himself beginning to channel chakra to his hands. A blue hue begins to glow from his hands electricity began to jump between his hands. A ball of lighting would form from these sparks and grow at a steady rate.

Once it was a good size, the boy raises it up over his hand and then thoses it forwards. The ball was aimed to slam into the ground and explode releasing a surge of lightning to dance about the impact location. " Hmm... good but still not enough." the boy notes thinking he just had to try again.

Seeing as he wasn't happy with his result he'd bring his hands back in front of his chest and begin to channel chakra to them. Sparks of lightning begins to form  and then collide and begin to create a ball of lighting between his hands yet again. As it expands, his hands slowly come further apart. Once the ball was a large enough size it's be thrown at the ground again.

It'd impact with a boom kicking dust and rock. Lighting wildly danced about until it sizzled to an end. " Hmm.... maybe a bit more? I'm not even sure anymore."* - Tue Dec  8 21:39:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) unseals his bokken from his scroll and take it in hand. “ Ugh… practice time again” he mumbles beginning to get into his starting stance. He’s move his feet further apart, tilt slightly back on his left side and straighten himself up. He’d hold his bokken with both hands and firmly grasping his bokken. Thought his arms were a bit shaky, his stance was actually not too bad thanks to the help of Chikyu. It was lucky for him to actually get a bit of training.

From there he’d begin to do do his strikes. To anyone spectating it’s appear he was moving at a slow pace. This was because he was counting off steps in his head as he moved through the four motions to make a simple downwards strike. The sword raised over his head, then his lower hand slides downwards to support the strike, he’d stomp forwards as he makes a downwards striking motion stopping half way through the swing to remain parallel to the ground, and finally he’d step back into his starting stance.

His strikes were shaky and slow but this was just practice anyways. He’d proceed to repeat this process several times. After every strike he’d keep a mental count for himself and although he set the number for himself high, like most things, the boy would get distracted and would stop every now and then.

However, he’d still push through it. Although his arms started to ache and body started to cramp from the repeated motions.Even with all that he’d still push on for a bit longer continuing to do his downward strikes. However this didn’t come without it’s drawbacks. His takes would grow sloppier and sloppier as he did more and more of strikes. Eventually he’d have to stop and rest his arms for a moment.

“ Geeze my arms hurt…” he mumbles with a sigh leaving his arms down for a moment. “ Okay let's start this up again. he says lifting his bokken up to at the ready. His bokken raises over his head and his hand slides down slightly just before sending the wooden blade downwards as he stops forwards. He’d stop half way into his swing and then pull himself back into his starting stance. He’d repeat this motion, repeatedly striking through the air. It was rather tedious work for him but it was needed.* - Wed Dec  9 00:37:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) has got reach the point of being unable to avoid it. He had to work on Shunshin!! The terrible jutsu that he just could not get the hang of. He was far from good with it. He was much better with his raiton but that will only get the poor child so far. Because of this, he was a bit forced to work on his jutsus much much more. Seeing as his is one of his jutsus that weren’t exactly the easiest and he’d mastered his raiton ones he figured he’d go for it.

With a big sigh he’d find somewhere for him to be able to work on his jutsu. Just a bit of a clearing is all he needed to start practicing this horrid jutsu. Once he found it, he’d take in a deep breath trying to calm and relax himself. From there he’d make the ram hand seal, closing his eyes and exhaling through his mouth. “ Okay.. I know this jutsu sucks and I know it’s going to be a pain in the butt but I have to learn how to do it! Bro knows it so I’m going to figure it out too!”

The boy was getting himself pumped up for this train because god knows he didn’t want to do it. His chakra begins spike, and chakra flows to his legs. A large amount of chakra would be channeled to his legs. The chakra would actually vitalize his legs and strengthen them to there peeks. This would allow him to move at near untrackable speeds. For others and even himself.

The moment he pushed off, he’d shoot off like a rocket at high speeds. With all this speed, he was unable to even tell where he was going. Not only that he wasn’t even sure how much ground he was covering making it hard to know when to stop. There was nothing he could do but understand the jutsu better by practicing it. The boy comes to a sliding stop with a slight pant.

" Man this jutsu sucks." he says taking a deep breath and forming the ram hand seal again. He exhales, beginning to channel chakra to his legs a second time. He’d focus harder, strengthening them before pushing off again and again. He’d have to repeatedly use the just over and over if he was going to understand it but, it seems that he wasn’t improving very much. It seems he wasn’t doing very well with the jutsu at all.* - Wed Dec  9 02:34:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) yawns, putting his head down on the desk. " Lame... this is so lame. " he thought to himself. He was suck, waiting in the classroom with the other students for the teacher to come in to begin the class. Not only that but Hiroshi was actually a bit bihind on his work.

He'd left hs head slightly and hold it on his hand as he pulls out a textbook for the moment. Seeing as their last subject was math, and he had yet to do his homework, he'd quicky pull out a sheet of paper and flip to a page set for the homework we was suppose to do.

They were just simple math problems. After all he was only a child. His classes weren't but so hard. It turns out that htey were just times tables. He just needed to answer the problem given to him. Problems such as : "2 x 8" and " 7 x 6" Thouhg this isn't hard for some it was actually fairly difficult for him.

The boy actually ended up quickly repeatedly adding the numbers together to get to the anser he needed. Seeing as he didn't know thw answer right off hand, he had to do something to get to get the answer.

Seeing as he was doing it the long way he actualy ran out of time and the teacher walks in " Dang it.. I was almost done." hr thought quickly hidding his work. As the teacher walks to the front he'd call aloud " Okay class lets see you're homework huh? Come on pull it out." 

" Of course..." the by thought. He thought. A bad start to the class.* - Wed Dec  9 17:17:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) unseals his bokken yet again and gets into his stance. It seemed like everyday now the he was doing these daily strikes and from it seems like he was getting pretty good at it. His stance was held nicely. His feet were spread apart, one slightingly back, hips tilted back and both hands on his bokken's hilt with steady arms holding them.

He'd quickly raise his sword over his head and begin to make several strikes through the air. All of which, were done in the same exact fashion. The bokken went up, he'd slide his lower hand down, swing downwards stopping at about waist height, and and then pulls back into his starting stance. These strikes would actually be rather well done to the untrained katana user but it truth they could still use some work.

Even still te boy would move on, actually going into a direct strike. He would try a few diagonal slashes for once. So he raised his bokken over his towards his right shoulder and makes his first strike from right to left. For a first try it wasn't terrible but surely wasn't good It vired off to far to the left as he made the motion and it was actually pretty shaky.

THe boy groans a bit to himself before continuing on slowing down a bit to properly form his strikes in steps. Before he knew it he actually had seemed to spend hours here, swinging away at nothing. His arms burned as if they were on fire and he'd be quite exhausted. He'd seal his bokken away for the time being and go to take a break for a while.* - Wed Dec  9 19:53:23 2015
