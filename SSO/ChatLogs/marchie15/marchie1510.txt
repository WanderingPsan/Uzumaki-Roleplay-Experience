<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Wonder what he is about to do. . .  - Thu Dec 10 06:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) yawns as he slowly stroll into the middle of the training area.He'd start with a few stretches. His arms reaching high above his head in the night's moon light. With a childish groan, he'd lean over to his left side and extend his right arm up and over his head. He'd then begin a short count, muttering it to himself as he holds the stretch. 

" One... two.. three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten. " the young boy counts off before reversing the stance. He'd now lean to his right, extending his left arm over his head and begin the count yet again. 
" One... two.. three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten. " he'd count off again before moving into another's stretch.

Next he put his hands to his hips and rail back a bit. This wasn't just some idle stretch for the heck of it. " OKay and now to start."he thought, drawing his iron katana from his hip. " Just a few more of this dumb strikes..." he continued to himself sliding into this starting stance.

The boy's feet separate, sliding wider apart to keep his balance. He'd move his right foot forwards slight, tilting his hips slightly. He'd grasp his katana firmly with both hands trying to hold the sword steady. This would be the stance Kyu taught him, however, it still wasn't the best. His arms still swayed a bit as his strength wasn't enough to really hold it.

Regardless of that small fact, he'd go to begin his training, raising his katana overhead and beginning to go through the steps of his strikes as quickly as he could. First the katana went up, his lower hand on the hilt slide down to in sure he'd keep a good grip, the katana was then slashed straight down as he lifts and stomps his leading leg forwards and stopping the slash about half way down to be parallel to the ground, and finally he'd pull himself back into the starting stance.

This motion would be repeated time after time. He simply was trying to get better at his kenjutsu and without even realizing it he was starting to get faster and faster at moving through his steps for it. The strike themselves still needed work. There were many issues. The blade was shaky, and the strikes were actually pretty slow all thing considered but the form started to get better over time.

Before he knew it, it'd seem the boy would begin to fun out of steam as his breath begins to become heavy. His arms began to burn from the weight of the katana and sweat began to run from his face. The moment he noticed all this, his arms lower his katana and he's sigh " Better... I guess..."

He'd sheathe his sword and bend down to take a seat on the ground. For the moment he wasn't going to do anything else but hang out. He'd pull a scroll from his back pouch and unroll it in front of him. He's unseal a textbook in a plume of white smoke and open it. The studying never ended.... the struggles.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) sighs, sitting there looking over his text book. He'd pull another scroll from his pouch and unseals a set of worksheet. " Lame... lame!!... Math is LAME!" he'd mumble in rage as he begins to do the dreded and PURE EVIL math problems. And none other than... MULTIPLICATION!!! DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUN!!!.

In his classes recently they were learning their times tables and it wasn't exactly something he was enjoying at all but luck for his it was an easy few word sheets. The first of which was something of a cheat sheet he needed to complete in help him with the other sheets.Upon this sheet of paper was a blank times table chart that he needed to fill out.

Starting from the top left corner of the table, he'd begin to write down the times tables for all the 'x1' which was extremely easy. After that was all the twos. Starting with one time two being two then two times two is four. Two times three being six and so on and so forth you get the idea. The first worksheet wasn't too bad seeing as he got to gradually work through them and there was always the option of just continuously adding up to the actual answer.

After completing the first be moves on the the next two which were just more basic math problems. Hiroshi would fail to really realize it but this would prove to be important for him later on. Allowing his to properly calculating trajectory... that is when he go into that kind of thing.

Honestly, he'd just keep looking back to his first worksheet as a answer key to simply answer all the questions on the other two sheet. Simple work. Once completed he'd pile everything back up nicely and sealing it all back into their scrolls. " Ugh okay that's done..." he'd sigh standing back up to his feet. " To the next thing I guess.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) groans yet again he had to do more of his training and more of his homework so today he was just going to put the two together. He'd sit down on his knees and open his text books. Next to them were the blank pieces of paper he took out to record the answers he wrote down. Finally he takes out the bokken and lay it down next to him.

" Okay now I guess I'll do a five strikes everytime time I get stuck" he says with a nod setting the rule for himself. With that, he'd move on to begin his work. Today's subject was reading and the story they had to ready was a actually tale tell expressing how guilt can eat you alive and cause you to make poor choices.

Hiro wasn't the best at reading and his comprehension was okay but that is what made this training even better. This way he would have plenty of times to do his practice strikes.  He'd begin to read the story. Much of it was in riddles and similes with a few metaphors splashed in for flare. It was just the challenge for the boy, stumbling over words and not understanding a few of the metaphors.

Throughout this, there were a few words that he just couldn't get. When that happened the oy stood up with a sigh and pick up his bokken. He'd move into the starting stance he was taught. His feet separate, sliding wider apart to keep his balance. He'd move his right foot forwards slight, tilting his hips slightly. He'd grasp his katana firmly with both hands trying to hold the sword steady.

From there he'd begin to make several strikes through the air. Of course he'd be mentally counting his way through his steps. First the katana went up, his lower hand on the hilt slide down to in sure he'd keep a good grip, the katana was then slashed straight down as he lifts and stomps his leading leg forwards and stopping the slash about half way down to be parallel to the ground, and finally he'd pull himself back into the starting stance. The boy continued to this this several time over and over counting aloud as he does each one.

" One... two.. three... four... five.." he'd count for each word work he couldn't pronounce or he simply didn't know. Throughout the passage there were many. Making it so that he ended up doing more than two hundred strikes before he was done. Tired and a bit sweaty he'd go back towards the book work to answer the questions about the story he just read.

He his focus was a bit off seeing as he just finished doing tons of strikes but he was going to go ahead and work on it anyways. There was no need for him to have to rush t finish this later. There were only ten questions. All were multiple choice. Somewhere about the meaning of some of the text while others were more about what happened to make sure the reader was paying attention.

In the end, the boy ended up being stumped n three of the questions and would have to ask his teacher or his Bro for help later but this meant that he would have to do fifteen more strikes.

With a sight the boy stood to his feet and picked up his bokken yet again moving into his stance.The boy's feet separate, sliding wider apart to keep his balance. He'd move his right foot forwards slight, tilting his hips slightly all like before. It was nothing new for him.

He'd proceed to do his fifteen extra strikes. At this point his arms were burning like they were on fire and his heaving got nothing but heavier but it was all for the best. He finally was done after those stikes and falls to a seated position. "Okay... finally done...."* - Thu Dec 10 18:52:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) takes a deep breath and begins to draw his iron katana. He's hol it with both ahnds at the ready and sigh a bit. " Okay well back to doing more of these.." he'd mumble shifting into his stance. Once he was in it he'd be to backing strikes through the air.

His katana lifts upwards over his head then his lower hand on the hilt slide down to in sure he'd keep a good grip, the katana was then slashed straight down as he lifts and stomps his leading leg forwards and stopping the slash about half way down to be parallel to the ground, and finally he'd pull himself back into the starting stance.

These strikes would be repeated time after time again. Stirke after strike trying to get them faster, stronger, and better formed. The strikes he were doing actually weren't bad. In truth, they have gotten a long way from the sloppy mess of an attack he use to have but they still needed work. The strikes were still a bit sloppy and  off a bit.

The strikes swayed a bit in the air and not only that but returning to his stance seems to still need some work. When he pulls back in, his feet sometimes soome to move too close together. It was a shame but even he noticed these thing and had to constinitly be mindfull of them.

The boy continues to do strike after strike until he was completely drained of his stamina. He had no more energy left byt the end and would stab his swprd into the groun and take a knee. " Ugh... I hate this.." he mumbles rubbing his arms. " They feel like there' on fire.." he murmered with a sight and moving towards his katana. He'd pull it from the grouns and sheathe it. " That's enugh for now I guess.* - Thu Dec 10 22:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) yawns not really wanting to but knowing he had to do some training if he was going to get better at the technique he’s been trying to approve upon for some time. He’d gather his things from his home and heads into the forest of Mori. However, he would just go strolling through the forest idly roaming around. He’d have an idea of where to go but he’d need to move quickly and to spot them with ease.
<br><br>
To do this, he’d use the one technique he was trying to get better use of. The high speed technique known as shunshin. So far, his body has yet to adjust to the high speed and he is unable to really tell where he is.  Thsi could be fix but he will need much much mor training on his shunshin.
<br><br>
So he was going to practice more and more with it. He'd form the ram handseal again and channel chakra to his legs. With a deep breath, he'd ush off, shooting off in a burst of speed like no other. Upon trying to stop, his feet slide in the sand to a stop. " Dammit... I still need more work at it.." he murmered to himself forming the seal and shotting off again.* - Thu Dec 10 23:35:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) frowned as they were walking into the building. The ragged area the terrible smell he got int his nose and the burning of his eyes from the weed smoke that polluted the air. It was all rather sickening for him. Not only that but it made his head head more the closer ad closer they got to the building.

" This place smells.. my head hurts... and ... it SMELLS!" he thought to himself carrying a grumpy face all the way into the building. Once in there even he could feel the shift in the area and the hostility they all seemed to have towards them. Hiro's foot motions backwards, slighting afraid ina situation like this but he wouldn't run. After all he had his big bro.

As the negotiations go on, he'd simply stand there and look over all of the people counting them in his head. " One, two, three.... seven... ten... hmm... about sixteen counting the boss?" he thought glancing behind him to see that there were another four or five guys behind them blocking their escape. " They have a lot of guys in this gang." he thought to himself looking back forwards as the boss man started to shout.

He'd chuckle a bit as the boss was launched backwards into the other gang of outlaw and was given to que to go ahead a fight. " Sweet a rumble!" the boy should clapping his hands together. As he pulls them apart, the sound of lighting chatters loudly. Between his hands would for a ball of lighting he shot at the pile of gang members shocking the living hell of of them.

The gang member behind the two boys would pull out their weapons. Pipes, chains, and even a kunai would be seen pulled out by the members before the rushed behind the two. " Behind us!" Hiro says beginning to look behind them. Not only that but the boss seemed to be down but was far from out.

The large man stood back up with a roar like cry " YOU SON OF A---!" the man shouts attempting to draw his gun and aim it towards Blue. Was quite the spot the two would be in.... why do negotiations ever work?

Sadly, even with the spot they’re in it seems other members could hear to comotion and the sounds of extra movement not in the room yet could be hear. It sounds as if people were running down stairs and stomping on the upper floor sound like thunder over head. It’d appear more men were on there way down.* - Fri Dec 11 00:31:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) wasn't all the combat savvy. If anything all of this was a bit taken by all of this but he wasn't going to just get beat up. Nah, that would look bad, very bad and he wasn't going to have that in front of his bro. PRAYS THE GODS that Hiro dodged the bullet shot at him by the thugs but with him over there, that left him with having to deal the the few men running up behind him.

He wasn't skilled enough to just go punching them all out like his bro so he did what he always did... shock them. He'd quickly build chakra and emit it in the form of electricity as the thugs got close. They all would be stunned by the shock wave of lighting before the boy reached for his katana at his side. In a single fluid drawing strike, the boy would cut all of the men's wastes. No blood would spill but all of there pants would drop exposing those nice underroos.

Just after that the man Blue throw would collide with the group sending them all the ground. The boy chuckles thinking that that was simply hilarious but he didn't have the time to really enjoy it. His eyes look back to his brother whom was still giving the rest of the bandits the finest or hands. Already thinking ahead he knew something would have to be done and he'd begin to channel chakra to the end of his sword.

He waited for the perfect time which, his bro would nicely give him with a sticky water normal water combo. The boy creates another ball of lighting at the end of his sword that he's raise upwards and send flying at the soaking wet men " Buh bye~~~" the boy chimes as they all were shocked is easily incapacitated.

Seeing as the only two left standing were the Hiroshi brother, Green would sheathe his sword and grin " I expected that to go a TON worse." he says to his brother with a smile " Happy it didn't though... so do we just leave these guys to twitch and go back to Koji?" the boy asks this being his first mission he honestly wasn't sure.* - Fri Dec 11 01:01:52 2015

He was just going to be over here a while while he thinks of a nice and cool answer to give. " Hmm... how does a rock break huh?" he though just trying to think of a nice and descriptive answer.* - Fri Dec 11 01:47:05 2015

It is true, in taijutsu they  only use their hands to do what they do but it seems like strength is there only thing going for them. However, the ever tricky thinking shinobi would actually think of an answer to the woman's question.

" What about hitting it's weak points.." he says with a shrug. " Most the times I find the weakness in something and target it... why not on a rock? Hit it in it's weak points and it cracks and then breaks. Doing it that way you won't have to use much strength... just enough to get the effect." the boy says still looking at the stone.* - Fri Dec 11 02:09:16 2015

Simply put he wasn't a taijutsu specialist so he had no clue how to actually fight like one or even soulve a problem like one either.

For the moment he'd sit and try to think of something. Thinking like a taijutsu user is much harder then he thought.* - Fri Dec 11 02:46:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) // Just as Blue lets out his cry is sorry three students would come walking into the class. One was a girl, bright eyed and radiates sweetness in her pink spaghetti strapped dress and two boys, one with goggles and a cocky grin and the last a rather chunky kid would seemed to be eating a bag of chips of some kind.

The boy's eyes turn to the youngsters as the take their seats. The goggled boy call out " Aye! So what are we learning!" in a overly loud tone.  Green flinches a bit before looking around. " Ugh... this is so lame..." he thought to himself before clearing his throat and facing the students. He fought a gang in the last mission three little kids were no contest!

" Okay listen up!" Green says in a clear and loud enough tone for them all to hear. " Today we're learning the chakra natures. There's five elemental chakra natures used for ninjutsu in total. There's fire, wind, lightning, earth and water." he says raising a hand and counting off all the elements with his fingers. Just to the students could tell there were only five.

He'd then look to his bro to continue.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) frowns a bit as he realizes... yeah he didn't even tell them his name. Honestly he was just trying to get it over with. Hiro wasn't exactly as social as his brother but getting back to it he'd sigh and nods a bit at how the lesson was going so far.

Seeing as attention went back to him, it was his job to say the final snig bit. The boy take a deep relaxing breath and begins to speak. " Well... elements don't just counter each other. They can also help each other out."The boy explains " For example fire is stronger against wind but it doesn't just counter it. Wind will actually power it up."

The boy nods and begins walking towards the desk. As he does so the chubby kid with the chips calls out " Oh! Just like when mom fans the fire on the grill!?". Hiroshi nods " Exactly like that. It makes the fire stronger." He says before pulling out a scroll and unrolling it across the teacher's desk.

" Now just like that water and lighting have a cool relationship. Lighting will actually run across water as far as it can and it's a bit stronger to boot." He says unsealing a long but narrow container of water from the scroll. " Just like this~" the boy says lifting his right hand and making a pinching like pose with his fingers. Between them would spark a small ball of lighting to be dropped into the water.

Normally a ball that size wouldn't get far but with aid from the water the long two foot container would light up like a christmas tree. " See a ball that size would do all this normally but by using it with water it can get a lot more done." he says sealing the container away again.

All the kids faces light up as the sparks fly. They clap and cheer " That's cool!! " Hiro look to blue and tilts his head a bit. " So.. that's about it right?"* - Fri Dec 11 06:40:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: *groans* Fine~ - Fri Dec 11 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) sighs as he follows his brother, first to get the saw and then out towards the forest. This was an easy mission. Hell -I- can cut down a tree and I'm fucked up but I digress. The mission was to give out wood like oprah so i say YOU get some wood and YOU get some wood!

Once on the outskirts Blue would say probably the strangest thing he would ever hear. Leaving his bro behind? Even if he could tell his brother was serious he was never going to do that. He'd agree anyways making sure to cross his fingers. He'd rather die with his brother then leave him behind. " Right~" he'd say slipping his crossed fingers into his pocket.

Once into the woods they're find the tall tree. It was just a tree but it was quite taller than the rest and that raised a flag to Hiro. The wood seems to be fine without any marking from anything however on the way here was claw marks on a few trees a sign of bears being near.

Shrugging, Hiro figured it'd be better to just get this done then go complaining. He'd take his side of the saw and begins to help his bro cut the tree. He'd act as if it was part of his kenjutsu training, taking a stance of his kenjutsu and twisting his body as if he was doing a horizontal slash, trying to get the general motion down for training later on. it was a good start and would be rather easy honestly.

Just before the tree was completely sawed through a sound could be hear from a distance. A roar of sort echoing from the far. Green himself couldn't pinpoint the sounds but it wouldn't really matter as soon the tree would come crashing down. " TIMBER!!!" the boy shouts " I always wanted to say that, heheh."* - Fri Dec 11 07:06:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Right! - Fri Dec 11 12:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: true xD - Fri Dec 11 12:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) nods. LET THE SPAR BEGIN! He didn't expect to win but he wanted to at least give his bro a good run for his money. With that said, the boy widens his stance and gets himself at the ready. " Okay... have to out smart bro... someone who knows all my tricks... great.."he thought to himself.

With a deep breath, the boy forms a single tiger seal. " BEGIN!" he'd shout before quickly sinking under ground using the very jutsu Hiro taught him. Hiding like a mole, the boy creeps beneath the earth. However even while being underground he was not blind to water away above.

THe boy could still sense what was going on above. The handy side effect of the jutsu. He didn't really expect his bro to just stand up there and wait for him but~ he needed to launch a sneaky strat if he was going to pull of a win!* - Fri Dec 11 12:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) continued moving forwards under the ground. He'd continue moving to a new location until he feels Blue move higher up. " What the? How is he... the wall?" the boy thought to himself remembering the suimen technique he was taught long ago. " Dang it!.. I can go tunneling through solid rock!" he continued in his head gritting his teeth.

" Fine then..." he thought springing up from the ground and bringing his hands together. Electricity begins to spark between the palms on his hands before a ball of lighting was made and shot straight for Hiro. It wasn't as if he would -do- very much thanks to his lack of utility but he could at least try to get him off the wall.* - Fri Dec 11 12:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: ... - Fri Dec 11 12:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) eye widen as his brother takes off at full speed but he didn't have time to be strt stuck. His hands come close together yet again and a flow of chakra would be sent towards his hands and as a stream of water was fired directly at the poor boy. Lucky for him, as always the boy had a quickly formed trap in mind.

The ball of lighting would be created between his hands yet again. With a slight backwards leap, Green fires his ball of lighting at the water. Just like a knife through butter the ball of lighting would cut through the water sending electrically charged water around as the ball comes close to Blue. OR at least he hoped. The ball was fired in a way so that at the end of the stream it's hit the ground near the water setting it off in sparks and hopefully shocking Blue stunning him.

(^ Extra set up btw never saw a reply to how much Nin dam you have sooo just rolled with it)

From there the boy would have to act quickly, his hands lipped into his pouch and a tagged kunai would be toss at the wall above Blue. This tag was more of a weakened normal tag so if it made it to the wall, it would explode sending a few small stones to rain down and hit Blue a few times.

It was nothing like " OMG obito got crushed" bad at worse the by gets a concussion from a small-mid sized rock but hey it was a spar he's suppose to get hurt. Of course if the lighting ball wasn't strong enough to break through bro's jutsu... looking like Green was going to catch a face full of lighting water and be K.Oed.* - Fri Dec 11 12:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) smiled for a moment as at least the first part of the trap worked but sadly that glee was only short lived. It seems his rock would be used against him as the rocks were redirected straight back towards him! " You crafty..." the boy though cutting himself off as he reaches for the katana on his hip.

" Fine then.. let's play crafty!" he thought actually moving forwards a bit as he drew his sword. There weren't any big rocks heading his way. If anything any of the larger rocks would fall to the ground do to their weight before actually going any real damage to the boy but there were still some. With a single strike the boy tries to knock away as many as he could but in the end was still hit by a few sending him to a knee.

Though he was down he wasn't done. He simply wanted to get close enough to get to the edge of the water left behind by the short stream of water. At that point he'd build and release his chakra outwards, having it take the form of lighting. Not only was the boy covers in lighting shocking anything around him, but the water left behind was electrified trying to shock his bro once again.* - Fri Dec 11 13:12:41 2015
