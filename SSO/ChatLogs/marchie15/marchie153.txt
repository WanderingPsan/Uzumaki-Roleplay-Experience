<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) , now away from all the others, was ready to get the learning of his new jutsu! Finally he was given something new to learn and he wasn't going to let this chance pass him by! With that said, he'd pull the scroll from his pouch and open it to read it over.

" Hmm... looks like I just channel chakra into a ball? Seems easy enough." the boy mutters to himself as he reads the scroll. Rolling it back up and putting it away for the moment, the boy claps his hands together and slowly begin to pull them apart as he channels chakra into his hands. Just a if he was performing Raiton Flash, much of the chakra he was trying to use was wasted but soon enough sparks of electricity would bounce between his hands.

The sparks crackle and snap before eventually fizzling out. " Grr " the boy groans beginning to channel chakra into his hands again. The sparks of electricity return and this time a bit stronger. The lighting between his hands begin to increase in voltage and begin to be focused into a ball. The moment it does, the boy shifts his hands and try to shoot the ball forwards at the boulder before him.

However, as the ball was in flight it'd unravel and spark out before even hitting the rock. " Dang it! So close!" he'd mumble clapping his hands together once more. " Okay I got this." He'd think taking in a deep breath and exhaling through the mouth.

Slowly pulling his hands apart, he'd channel chakra to his hands. Trying to retain as much chakra as he could, he'd change it into his raiton nature to create lightning. THe lighting bounces between his hands and soon create a ball of electricity. " Here we go!" he'd shout sending the ball forwards at the boulder in front of him. The ball strikes the boulder with a reasonable about of force causing it to crack slightly.

" Much better!" the boy shouts " THis jutsu is so much stronger~" he says with glee. He was finally learning stronger jutsus and he was excited to learn even more.* - Wed Dec  2 20:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) was back to do some more work on the new jutsu of his. He was off to a good start but it wasn't quite there yet. Or at least according the the scroll he wasn't. His ball of lighting wasn't formed correctly just yet. In his last attempt the ball was less of a sphere and more of a jagged mess.

Getting right into it, the boy brings his hands close together and begin to flow chakra to his hands. After changing its nature, sparks of lightning would bounce back and forth between his hands. Hearing the crackle of electricity the boy knew it was time for him to focus on creating the ball itself. Focusing even harder, the begin creating the ball of lighting.

Sadly in his effort of making the ball more spherical and compact, the ball would "pop" sending lighting all around. " Oh shoot.." he'd mutter before flooding chakra to his hands again. Lightning starts to spark between his hands again before the boy focus it to create a sphere shaped ball. However, it was still a bit frayed and weak. Even still he'd be again to launch the ball at the boulder before him. Upon hitting it, the ball burst electrifying the stone but not exactly doing the damage he could of if it wa better formed.

" OKay again!" he'd shout bringing his hands back  close together. The crackle of electricity would ring out from his hands along with a blue glow. Another ball of lighting would be created and launched at the boulder, striking it a bit stronger this time. This time the ball was a bit better formed.

Starting to run low on chakra the boy thought to try it one last time before going to do something else. His hand rose up and chakra was flooded to his hands. Once the ball of lightning was formed it too would be shot out towards the large boulder before him. It would do an extremely destructive damage but it would hit the boulder with more force than any of his previous attempt.

Proud of what he'd done the boy nods " That's not bad~.. heheh this is actually pretty fun!" * - Wed Dec  2 20:59:31 2015

" This part sounds easy~" the boy mocks beginning to channel chakra to the soles of his feet. No one said it had to be a steady flow. Do to lack of control this channel of chakra was anything but steady however he could maintain it.* - Wed Dec  2 23:57:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Its another idea. I don't think it will be the same day as the Maid event. - Thu Dec  3 00:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Sounds like a lot is going to be going on in this festival. - Thu Dec  3 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Just music, dance, food, and thats about it. Also since it would be impossible for Mirai to accept otherwise, I'm giving her and Sanoke special seats that way she can dress as the maid to serve Sanoke alone. Else, she probably kill any maid that served Sanoke. - Thu Dec  3 00:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: . . .  - Thu Dec  3 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) chuckles a bit at what Kasanari says " Alright! I got this~" he'd say before power walking towards the wall. Blue's version of slow was FAR different from his own. He was simply too excited to walk slow. However, that would soon maybe seen as a mistake.

Upon reaching the wall the boy does a slight hope, extending his foot to step onto the wall. The moment he does, the large build up of chakra he had at his feet would crack the stone and throw the poor kid backwards and onto the ground. It seems the boy's abnormally large pool of chakra was his downfall as his normal thought process is just " Flood it with chakra!"

" Ouch.. yup.. that one hurt.." the boy says pulling himself off the ground.* - Thu Dec  3 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Well that's a good idea Kyu. - Thu Dec  3 00:12:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: So music, dance, food, this sounds like it is going to be fun! - Thu Dec  3 00:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Kay~ - Thu Dec  3 00:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: The food is all foreign to fit the theme. We have salad as the starters, consume' which is a type of soup, lamb or rissoto for main course, and then pudding to end it all. - Thu Dec  3 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Ohhhhh. - Thu Dec  3 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Pudding. - Thu Dec  3 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Yes. - Thu Dec  3 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: This festival needs to start, I want that pudding. - Thu Dec  3 00:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) steps back up to the wall and form the ram hand seal. " Okay... okay I got this." he mutters to himself beginning to build chakra at the soles of his feet again. While the grown ups were talking, he'd calmly build a sizeable amount of chakra. Though the talk of puddling was slightly distracting.

Regardless, once he thought he had a good flow of chakra going he'd go power walking at the wall again. He'd hesitate to put his foot on but once he did he'd feel a firm grasp on the wall as if he was walking n the ground.

" ooooo! I think I g--!!" the boy says quickly raising and placing his next foot on the wall. Sadly in his excitement, his chakra spited and the foot he place shot him off the wall again.

" Grr~!" he says quickly standing and forming the hand seal again.* - Thu Dec  3 00:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: You're going to have to pay for a seat. - Thu Dec  3 00:26:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Well, three. - Thu Dec  3 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Sorry, to keep with the prices and ease of the festivel to go smoothly. You pain for the whole meal. - Thu Dec  3 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: It's fine. - Thu Dec  3 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: I will pay for whatever I need too to cover myself, Nami, and Green. - Thu Dec  3 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Thats just fine!  - Thu Dec  3 00:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: How much will it cost? - Thu Dec  3 00:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: You know? - Thu Dec  3 00:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) was caught, thankfully but he was still rather frustrated. He'd look to Hiroshi and then to the wall and back to Hiroshi. " Umm.. okay. With you backing me up I know I can do this!" the boy says turn to face the wall and form his little hand seal. This time instead of just flooding chakra to his feet in an attempt to stick to the wall better, he'd send a calmer and steadier stream of chakra to the soles of his feet.

" OKay... Bro got my back... This will be easy.." the boy thinks to himself mentally psyching himself up. The boy kicks off charging at the wall and planting a foot on it. Instead of being thrown from the wall immediately, he was actually able to get both feet onto it. 

" Go, go, go, go, go!!" he shouts in his head beginning to run up the side of the wall. He would make in only a few feet before his foot slips from improper control over his chakra. " Crap." the boy says as he begins to fall backwards towards the ground. However, he didn't panic. He trusted his brother to catch him.* - Thu Dec  3 00:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Mmm... I don't know~... she's up pretty high. - Thu Dec  3 00:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: You got it bro. - Thu Dec  3 00:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) nods and figured to go for broke. Yet again he'd have to make the ram hand seal. He wasn't sure if he could make it all the way up there but he was surely going to try for it. After taking a deep breath, he'd send another flow of chakra to his feet.

" Okay~ all the way up there huh.." he mumbles before running at the wall again. Just like before he could get his feet onto the wall but for as far as he could go who really knew? The thumping of his footsteps increased as he tried picking up the pace to get up the wall faster. Sadly, he wouldn't make it much further than where he was before. A few feet or so before the rock cracked beneath his feet and fell back down towards the ground with his arms crossed.

" Hey, Blue! How long did this take when you learned?" he'd shot down t him as he fell.* - Thu Dec  3 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Mh... well... maybe I'll get it soon. - Thu Dec  3 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) sigh forming the seal again. He was going to try something of a different approach this time. INstead of just going at it, he'd do what Blue said the first time. Focus for about a minute or some before trying it. Youngster stood still as a statue with his eyes close as he focuses on the flow of chakra to his feet.

Already having tested how much chakra is good and bad through multiple fails, he already had a good idea of how much chakra he needed to use here. When he noticed it was too high or too low he'd quickly adjust it. Once he was able to control a steady amount of chakra between too much and too little the boy took another try running at the wall.

The moment his feet were on the wall, he's sprint forward up the wall. " I got this, I got this. I got this!" he says passing much further than the previous attempts. He'd actually make it rather far up the wall before slowing to a stop. He'd turn around to face Blue and cheers " WOOOT! I DID IT~~!" the boy shout before slipping off the wall. " Whoops..." he says falling back towards the ground. " Well I guess I need to work on my control a lot more..." he says return towards the ground from rather high this time.* - Thu Dec  3 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) fist bumps " Thanks~~"* - Thu Dec  3 01:01:52 2015
