<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) clears his throat and raised his hands into a single seal. If he was going to get better, it surely wasn't from hanging out doing nothing. He was going to work on his ninja arts more... much more as they're all lacking. But for now he'd work on Ninja Art: Water Gun.

He'd proceed to take in a deep breath in and channel chakra to his lungs. His stance widens a bit and he'd expel water from his mouth at the wall. The rushing water crashes into the rock wall nearby and soaks it. " Right now to move on the the next." he'd say raising his hands up and moving them close together.

He'd channel chakra to his hands and change it's nature. Electricity would sparks would begin to arc between between his hands. This electricity would then begin to collide and create a ball of lighting. This ball of lightning would be shot straight towards the area still dripping wet on the wall.

The area would be electrified from the lighting running about on the water. The boy frowns. " Good combo but I still need more work on it." He'd mutter bringing his hands up again and channeling chakra to his hands causing them to spark up lighting and form another ball. " Much better working with lighting.." he'd mutter shooting the ball at the wet area again.

One more time he'd bring his hands up and channel chakra to them creating lighting. Of course like last time they'd create a ball of lighting to be thrown forwards towards the wet area. The lighting would actually cause the area the glow a blue hue from the lightning. " Hmm.... wait... I was trying to train Watergun not lighting ball, heheh... okay back on task."

Shaking his head he'd get back on track and go to use his Ninja art: Water Gun. He'd form a single hand seal and take in a deep breath. Chakra would be channeled to his lungs, infusing with the air in them. He'd then exhale water in a stream, hitting the wall once again but not really caring much power behind it. He'd sigh " Man~... I need a lot more practice with this stuff."* - Sun Dec  6 00:51:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) thought it was about time he did a little kenjutsu training. Though his bro wasn't around he'd have to do some work on it eventually anyways so might as well get it started now but first he'd do something else for a while. He'd do himself some studying at the academy first about the subject.

He'd head into the school and look for a scroll about about kenjutsu. It would take very long to find one about it. He'd take the scroll into the classroom to read over to himself.

"  pertains to techniques that entail the use of swords, whether the users be shinobi, or samurai. Kenjutsu can be used in combination with taijutsu, ninjutsu, fuinjutsu, chakra flow and even genjutsu in order to achieve more devastating techniques. It is regarded as a branch of bukijutsu." 

The intro reads. Hiro sigh thinking over it over " Well I knew that... but this doesn't really help me..." the boy sighs and shrugs continuing to read on. THe scroll proceeded to give basic knowledge about how to carry himself with a sword to try not to hurt himself. It even went into how he should hold whatever type of sword he wanted to use.

"Hmmm that might be useful..."* - Sun Dec  6 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) moves on out to an area to be on his own for a while. He'd pull a scroll from his pouch and open it, unsealing his bokken from it. He'd roll his scroll and put it away, picking up the bokken and holding it with both hand, right over left. " Oay so I hold it like this right?" he mumbles trying to remember what he red from the scroll at the scroll.

He'd raise the wooden katana and make a few strikes. The first was a straight down strike and the he'd try to make  a horizontal slash. Sadly he'd put far too much force behind each swing but would unfortunately be thrown off balance. THe first one makes him lean forward and the second causes his to half spin and stagger a bit.

" Whoa... okay... heheh, pretty cool though." he'd say with a smile turning back  to face a dead dry wooden tree. He'd ready himself again, taking hold of the bokken in both hands and widening his stance a bit. " Chaaaaaaaaarge!!!" he shouts running at the tree at full speed.

Once he got close to it, he'd take a horizontal swing at the tree trunk. The sword slams into the side of the wooden tree trunk making a loud 'SNAP' sound. The boy smiles as he actually was enjoying kenjutsu 

" Heheh, this is so awesome~~~"* - Sun Dec  6 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) chuckles and raises the wooden sword again. He was having fun playing with this sword. Although his swings were weak and slow, it was a nice little break from all the jutsu training he's been doing. With that in mind he'd actually want to use a few jutsus with his kenjutsu so he thought now would be a nice time to try.

He'd take a deep breath and move towards the trunk striking it in a right to left downwards slash. The moment he does, he'd then build chakra and release it, creating a surge of chakra around him. This electricity would go into every direction around the boy, electrocuting the tree and doing some minor damage to it.

" Heheheh, hey~ not bad close range move actually..." he says taking a step.* - Sun Dec  6 03:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) wanted to try one more thing. He'd take his bokken and take a swing at the trunk.  After that, he'd bounce backwards  holding his hand next to where the blade would be. He'd focus his chakra and create a ball of lighting between the sword and his hand and fire it forwards at the tree. On impact the dry tree bark would crack a bit.

" Hehehe~ I can get use to this kenjutsu thing. He says with a nod."* - Sun Dec  6 04:03:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) raises his hands and begin to channel chakra to them, changing the very nature of the chakra. This turns the flood of chakra into lightning that'd spark between his hands. With ease he'd create a ball of lightning he'd raise and shoot towards the wall, hitting it was enough force to do some damage.

" Hmm... still not bad but not exactly good." he'd mumble before going for it again. Going for another try, he'd raise his hands close to each other and channel chakra to them again. Lighting bounces back and forth between his hands. The snap and crackle loudly before creating a ball of lighting to be shot towards the wall. It didn't do very much damage to it but he was just trying to get a better feel for the jutsu after all.

" You know what'd be cool?... If I could shoot more than one of these at once..." he thought bringing his hands closer together and creating a third ball of lighting. " Yeah~ that'd be cool...." he thought shooting the ball forwards. This ball of lightning crashed in the wall dealing a sizeable amount of damage, causing a few rocks in the area of impact to break away and fall to the ground.* - Sun Dec  6 17:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) continues on, raising his hands close together. With his palms facing close together he'd yawn beginning to channel chakra to his hands creating lighting. This lightning would come together and form a ball between his hands that the boy would then turn and shoot into a nearby boulder. It wasn't the strongest hit ever but it did a notable amount of damage.

" Hmm... you know.. I should learn study a bit more or something... learning these jutsus is actually pretty hard."* - Sun Dec  6 17:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel) says: Hey. - Sun Dec  6 17:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Hey~ uh... huh? Who are you again? - Sun Dec  6 17:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel) says: I'm Otorius. - Sun Dec  6 17:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel) says: I'm a freshly new Genin. - Sun Dec  6 17:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Hiroshi and oh~ cool. Alright I guess. - Sun Dec  6 17:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Lets go to the training area. - Sun Dec  6 17:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel) says: Alright. - Sun Dec  6 17:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: So you wanna start? - Sun Dec  6 17:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) was all ready for the spar. He was happy he got to be -IN- a spar and not just watch one... there was just on problem. The moment he saw the vain buld out around his eyes he knew. " FUCK! It's one of THEM!!" he shouts in his head knowing of these eyes from fights he's watched.

" Heheh, well this is going to be tough.." he mumbles " Okay! Let's start!" the boy call over to Otorius, slipping his hand into his pouch and pulling out a scroll, he'd open in an arcing path next to him. As the scroll was still in the air, it'd unseal three bunches of wooden shuriken loosely tied with wire. The boy would grab them and throw them all towards Oto as he steps backwards and spins.The wires unties as it flies making it twelve wooden shuriken flying towards him.* - Sun Dec  6 18:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel) says: 6.5 - Sun Dec  6 18:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) grits his teeth as Otorius knocks his shrunken away and moves forwards. He wasn't going to lie to himself. He knew if Otorius touched him it was going to hurt... a lot! So his only option was to try to stay away for a long as he could manage. The boy makes a single seal as Oto approaches, but not being very reflexive he'd be already atop of him and going for his first strike.

Hiro would backpedal as the first attack land and Hiro to twinge a bit but with him so close, oto would have a difficult time avoiding the torrent of water expelled from his mouth aimed at his chest. If the water hit, it'd probably have enough force to cause his opponent to stagger a bit allowing Hiro to get a bit further away. However, Shiro didn't have much training in water and it was only a D-rank jutsu so it wouldn't do a very large amount of damage.* - Sun Dec  6 18:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: Mmm.. - Sun Dec  6 18:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) smirks as Oto speaks. He wasn't going to just let him get close to him again. Hiro already set his trap after all. Why else would anyone use a jutsu so weak? His goal wasn't to just hurt Oto but to get his wet! The moment his new found fright comes towards him, the boy's chakra fluctuates and a flash of electricity would erupt around him. If no dodges, this lighting would shock and stun Oto setting his tap in motion.

" Heheh, sure!"

( ^ etra turn from strategem of wind and down is my real turn)

With Oto stunned from the shock, Hiro would jump backwards pulling a tagged kunai from his bag. The kunai would be throw to the ground in his wake and explode. Just like with the dummy shuriken this tag would be meant for training and was actually pretty weak with only enough strength to send Oto flying backwards.

" Just don't be made with I win~" The boy mocks. Do to this combo the distance between them would be even bigger than at the start of the match. Hiro hoped Oto couldn't run fast enough to close it and if somehow Oto avoided the shock he'd still throw the tagged kunai.* - Sun Dec  6 19:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel) thinks: That explosion really weakened my arms..or I'm just getting tired? - Sun Dec  6 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) was actually impressed with how tough Oto was. He thought after that the guy would have the impress already that he could of died if that was a real tag but then again this was a spar, it was probably good that he kept coming. However, as said, he couldn't run forever.

Knowing this he only had a few trick left. Not really wanting to use this, he'd continue trying to get distance from Oto, backpedaling and such. As he does his hands raise and hover near each other. Electricity sparks between his hands before creating a ball of lighting to be sent flying at Oto. * - Sun Dec  6 19:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) seemed to have a vast amount of chakra at his disposal. Much more than the average genin... if Oto has used this on any others. However, do to how dependent he was on his chakra, his reflexes were lacking. He'd be tripped and sent to the ground, but that wasn't the end. He'd have his chakra spike and send out a shock wave of lighting again to shock Oto before trying to roll away.* - Sun Dec  6 19:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) chuckles actually happy it's over " Well better to be sneaky then get my butt kicked, heheh."* - Sun Dec  6 19:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel) says: Phew..I'm tired. - Sun Dec  6 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Yeah... - Sun Dec  6 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Sorry about all the running but I'm not all that good with a katana yet and I didn't want you to hit me. It'd hurt.. a lot. - Sun Dec  6 19:56:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Okie dokie.. how does this work? - Sun Dec  6 22:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) nods rubbing his chin a bit as he thinks over what uses it may have. In his thought, Blue would slip under the earth leaving him confused on where he went. That is, until his bro came back up behind him and spoke. " Woooah this is cool~" he'd say with a smile.

He was ready to go, making the tiger hand seal like Blu showed him and began to focus his chakra. The problem was that he never used doton before so actually accessing it was a bit tricky. He'd be able to coat himself in his chakra but it seems like he was having trouble changing its nature. Clear to see by Hiroshi by the struggling look on the boy's face.

" Uhhmmmm~"* - Sun Dec  6 22:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: *laughs* This was the first Jutsu I ever learned. - Sun Dec  6 22:49:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: It was kind of natural for me. - Sun Dec  6 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) continues to struggle trying to change the nature. As he hears his bro he'd say " But there's some trick to it... what do you think about?" The boy says beginning to flood chakra to this cloak. It wouldn't help seeing as he could figure out how to change the nature but hopefully Hiroshi would have some advice to help him out a bit.* - Sun Dec  6 22:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Ummm. . .  - Sun Dec  6 22:55:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Try imagioning that your chakra is a lump of mud. - Sun Dec  6 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Mud? - Sun Dec  6 22:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Try picturing your chakra as mud. - Sun Dec  6 23:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: And you are a pig, trying to get the mud all around you. - Sun Dec  6 23:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: That is the best I got for you bro. - Sun Dec  6 23:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: That... sounds weird... but okay? - Sun Dec  6 23:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) shrugs " Mud it is." he says continuing the flow of chakra. As odd as it sounds, the boy began to learn put the image of mud around him and with it the imagery of i'm sinking into the Earth. As he does this the grounds slowly begin to loosen beneath his feet. The hard ground slowly turned into sand and he's sink downwards into it.

He'd only make it halfway before it seems to stop. Noticing this the boy start to wiggle but he was unable to move his legs. " Help! Hep!! I'm stuck S.O.S!!" he shout flailing his arms.* - Sun Dec  6 23:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: *laughs* - Sun Dec  6 23:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) was pull out the ground and nods " Okay okay... I got this right?" he says with a grin making the tiger seal again. Taking in a deep breath, the boy builds up his chakra and coats himself in it. Adding to that his imagery of the mud again, the boy slowly begins to sink into the sand again.

It was rather slow but he was able to sink down beneath the earth. Once he was underground, he just had to figure out how to get back up. He'd simply move was he was a snake working his way back up to the surface. Thankfully he could sense what was above with the electromagnetic fields or he would of actually came up under the cactus he popped out next to.

This process was actually pretty slow do to lack of doton experience and well a lot of things okay* - Sun Dec  6 23:17:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) get bored as all kids to. He'd step forwards a way and crouch down, bring his hands close together. He'd channel chakra to his palms and create sparks of lighting between them before creating a ball of lightning and shooting it into the sand.

He'd yawn a sigh creating ball after ball. Was just something to do I guess.* - Sun Dec  6 23:42:30 2015

My name is Hiroshi or Green Hiro or just Hiro."* - Sun Dec  6 23:57:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Don't let him slack off Kyu. - Mon Dec  7 00:03:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) chuckles and turns back towards Chikyu " Oh I only have a Bokken at the moment." he says pulling a scroll from his hoodie pouch. He'd open it and in a plum of white smoke the bokken was unsealed for his use. He'd take it in hand and put the scroll back into his hoodie.

( Don't have the ooc item but do have it icly )* - Mon Dec  7 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) nods " Right!" the boy says turning forwards. Now normal people would just take their stance and make a very formed slash right? Well not Hiroshi. Do to FAR too much t.v he had a much different perception of kenjutsu in mind.

He'd widen his and raise the bokken with one hand, just trying to be cool. As he sings down, he'd put far too much force behind it and it's actually cause him to tilt forwards and stagger a bit. Not only that but a un-nature 'battle cry' escaped his lips. 

" WHOOOCHWU!!!"* - Mon Dec  7 00:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tsukinomi(Original Ziare) says: Koji nii! - Mon Dec  7 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: *internal laughter*. . . You get'em Kyu. . .  - Mon Dec  7 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Tsuki....how are you today? - Mon Dec  7 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) flinched from the chop but seeing as he's already hit all the time but Blue he was probably used to it.( Seriously I need an abused perk) His body would quickly a shiftly be shifted into a proper stance and honestly he was okay with the stance even if it wasn't as cool as he thought it'd be. However, he wasn't so keen on the battle cry.

" Whaaaa~? That cries all basic. It was to be all awesome like..." the boy pausing as he grabs his bokken with both hands and raise it upwards. With a downwards slash the boy cries out again " HWYAAAAAA!!!!" after the strike his arms lowered but his body stayed in place as best he could manage. HIs feet did shift inwards a bit.

He'd then nod " Yeah~ just like t.v"* - Mon Dec  7 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tsukinomi(Original Ziare) says: Awesome - Mon Dec  7 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: I'm working on a surprise for you. Going to be awesome I forgot to cover sadly so it's sitting right open in the fridge. - Mon Dec  7 00:30:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Can we go talk really fast? - Mon Dec  7 00:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) looks down to see his foot has shifted places. He'd widen it again and he frowns a bit at her statement. " You forgot the WA. Gotta but the WA it there!" he shouts looking forwards and raising the bokken. He himself would begin to do a few right to left downward diagonal slashes. He'd try to copy Chikyu, stepping a foot forwards and pulling back into his stance with every strike. His slashes were ill formed, shaky and slow. I wish I could say they'd get the job done but they probably wouldn't.

With every swing his stance would actually degrade bit by bit. First his foot starts to move inwards. Then the tilt he was put in starts to move forwards a bit. With one of his last one he'd do his little battle cry " HWAYAAA!!! " before looking back at Chi " It's awesome! Not girly at all."* - Mon Dec  7 00:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Trilliam(ZaVante) says: Huh oh sure Iza. - Mon Dec  7 00:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tsukinomi(Original Ziare) says: The fridge? - Mon Dec  7 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tsukinomi(Original Ziare) says: Is it food? - Mon Dec  7 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Maaaybe. - Mon Dec  7 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) tils his head at her explanation. He wasn't exactly a hundred percent on what she was saying but he got the jest of it. One thing for sure is that he was no prodigy so he'd take her advice for now. It wasn't like he was getting anywhere on his own. He'd then check his stance again, noticing that his feet shifted yet again. As he returns to a proper stance he'd lift his bokken to a starting stance and try to hold it steady.

" Grrr!! They're awesome battle cries." he'd say with a laugh raising his bokken upwards. Hed take it slow and in steps. After raising it, he'd move his lower have down slowly. From there he'd make a strike downwards, stopping about where his standing position started. Although the strike was still shaky, it was a start and better than the others so far.

" So just keep practicing huh? Seems like everyone keeps saying that to me today." he says raising the bokken again and slowly going counting through the steps he made for himself again.* - Mon Dec  7 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) thinks: I should think of some more really good ones to do~ hmmm. Gwaaaaa? Nah that's a bad guy cry. - Mon Dec  7 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) would grow silent as well simply continuing his vertical slashes in the same four step striking motion again and again. First he raises his sword, then slide his lower hand downwards before slashing vertically stopping halfway into the strike, and finally move back, returning to his starting stance. Though this attack were sloppy at the moment, he thought he was starting to get the hang of it. He would no longer go stumbling about as he makes his strikes.

" You know... it's not as cool as on t.v but you know this isn't so bad." he thought to himself continuing on with his practice.* - Mon Dec  7 01:14:40 2015
