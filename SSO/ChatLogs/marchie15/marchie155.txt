<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) strolls off for now. It seems all the fighitng was done with. Now it's just normal training for them.* - Fri Dec  4 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) was going to go do some training of his own. He might as well seeing as there was nothing else for him to do around here. Also seeing how strong the other where he had to do something if he didn't want to do falling behind... well more like he was going to have to catch up to them with a few tricks or something. 

Regardless, he'd get to work. bringing his hands up close to each other with their palms facing each other. His chakra spikes and be directed towards his hands. With a change of chakra nature, electricity would be seen bouncing between in palms. Focusing his chakra, the electricity would form a ball to be launched forward into the sand. The impact kicks up dust and sand and even forms a small crater but the boy wasn't done just yet.

He'd go for it again, railing his arms back into position and focus his chakra. The lighting begins to bounce between his hands again. " Okay...this is getting a bit easier actually.." h thought as another ball of lighting would form between his hands. Just like the last a ball of lightning would be launched forwards and strike the ground creating another plume of sand and dust.

" Again.." the boy mutters bringing his hands together and focusing his chakra again. As he repeatedly used the jutsu, he'd notice that a notable amount of chakra that he was trying to put into it was actually not doing anything but it couldn't be helped. He's flood chakra into his hands and create yet another ball and fire it forwards.* - Fri Dec  4 05:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) still had plenty of chakra to use and he intended to. With his quite large reserves of chakra, he could bring his hands back into position and begin to channel his chakra. With his hands beginning to spark with electricity, a ball of lighting would be created and launched forwards into the sands of the village.

" Tsk, this jutsu..." the boy mumbles bring his hands back into position. o even him the repetition of motion and using this jutsu repeatedly was getting a bit annoying. However it was "Necessary" t learn how to use his jutsu better. He'd focus his chakra and create yet another ball of lighting. " This jutsu... why does it have t be so tough!" he'd mumble sending the ball flying forwards.

Right after shooting of that ball, he'd bring his hands together again and form another to shoot off and then another. His reserves of chakra was obviously far greater than any other normal new genin. Regardless he was done for now. NOt really feeling like doing it anymore.* - Fri Dec  4 06:09:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) the boy seemed to stumbles over sentences before clearing his throat and starting to walk forwards a bit. As he came closer he'd begin to search his pockets pulling out scroll after scroll trying to find the right one. 

" Well, the other day you said like you were pretty down... and uh.. bro says I should be nice to people.... and you seem like you help out everyone else and give them stuff..." the boy says before pulling out the correct scroll " Here it is." he mumble opening it and making sure to put his hands under the seal draw in the scroll. " So~ I thought it'd be nice to get you something to cheer you up!" he says flowing a bit of chakra into it. From a plume of smoke a piece of chocolate cake appears. Still rather warm.

" I got you cake!! Cake makes everything better~" the boy chuckles with a smile.* - Fri Dec  4 13:47:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: *looks over at Kaiko*  Hey, I still don't know your name. - Fri Dec  4 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) nods watching over the jutsu carefulling. It didn't -sound- very hard but in his experience things that sound easy were just too good to be true. He'd turn to face the wall and form the seal shown to him.

" Okay.. so seal." the boy mumbles before taking in a deep breath " ...now imagine..." he thought beginning to picture a real water gun shooting water. Something probably very easy for a kid his age. " ...access and envision." the boy finishes in his mind before beginning to build his chakra and channel this to his lungs.

A large flex of chakra could be felt to any sensors if any were in the area as a large amount of chakra was flooded into the technique. With his lack of control it was hard for him to even control his chakra and now he had to use an element he doesn't normally use?

Whatever he -thought- he was going to do clearly didn't happen as he blows the air out with little more the drool coming out. The boy groan wiping his mouth and forming the seal again. " Of course, this isn't a one time win thing..." the boy though beginning to build up chakra again. With a deep breath chakra would be channeled to his lounge for a second time and he'd exhale with literally nothing coming out but air.* - Fri Dec  4 19:22:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Uh.. right - Fri Dec  4 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) sighs raising his hands and forming the seal again. " Okay.. okay maybe I just need a bit more focus with this one.." he'd think to himself beginning to focus his chakra yet again. " Almost there.." he thought taking in a deep breath. However, this time he actually did it in the wrong order. Because of this, when he take in his breath the air would be turned into a never small amount water and caused him to caught.

He'd ignore Kaiko for the moment.* - Fri Dec  4 19:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Chakra is the key. - Fri Dec  4 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: More chakra equals more volume. - Fri Dec  4 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: More chakra huh? - Fri Dec  4 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: But if you can't hold that much chakra at once, then you need to practice control. - Fri Dec  4 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: I think I can do it. - Fri Dec  4 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) , after his coughing fit, was just going to continue on. He wasn't sure about his bro but he planned on learning all these basics real quick. Jutsus are life! But with that he'd form the seal again and take in a deep breath. " At least I made water that time." he thought beginning to go through the steps yet again.

He made the seal, took his breath, imagined the water gun, and then began to channeling his chakra and to his lungs. As he focus his chakra, a large amount of chakra would be flooding into the jutsu yet again. Mostly lack of control and the fact that he could but also because he control was piss poor and was unable to use a lesser amount.

Regardless of how he got there he'd exhale and a small spout of water would escape his lips. Being extremely weak, the water wouldn't have enough force to hit the wall. It'd arch and hit the ground just shy of it.* - Fri Dec  4 19:35:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) rubs the back of his head " Finest and sharpest huh? " the boy says before turning back towards the wall. It was only one seal like the last one bt with it he'd have to use a completely different mind set? It could be help, it was another element completely.

The boy forms the seal and begins to focus his chakra into his lungs. He'd picture the twisters Lera made and trying try to recreate them himself, exhaling and just like last time he embarrassed himself by literally nothing happening. To be expected when he hasn't training at all in fuuton.* - Fri Dec  4 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Good~ - Fri Dec  4 20:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Yup yup!~ - Fri Dec  4 20:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) shrugs " okay... that need to be better.." the by sights making the seal again " Fine and sharp huh?" he thought to himself beginning to take in a deep breath. As he began to focus his chakra, he imagine thin blades of fine metal spinning like a twister of wind.

With that picture in mind, he'd flood even more chakra to his lungs before exhaling sending a small gust of wind from his mouth. The jutsu was quite there yet but that was close. It was just a simple matter of forming it properly. " Almost there..."

Without delay he'd go into the jutsu again not wanting to get the momentum die out. The same process would be repeated again. He'd make his seal, picture the blades, and take in a deep breath before channeling or rather flooding chakra to his lungs. It was simply the way he did things without proper control over his chakra.

However, this time he'd try to but more spin into it. As the wind escaped his lips it's spring creating the tornado like effect he was looking for. Again being weak it would go very far or do little more then shift some sand about but it was the jutsu regardless... even if it was terrible.* - Fri Dec  4 20:02:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) was forced to do this -stupid- work although the poor kid JUST got out of the academy. But kay whatever sure. Not sure what kinda random everyday school work system we have going here but it seems he had some more work to do... whatever.

Point is he was going to have to look over and do the work given to him earlier AND have to still go to whatever dumb class there was for him to go to today. However upset he was it wasn't like he could avoid it forever... even if he didn't exactly care about being a shinobi. Though it didn't really matter. It seems it was work or get tortured or something so might as well.

The boy makes his way to the class room extremely early. And once there, he'd take a seat and open up the scroll he sealed his work into.  With a bit of chakra the foot or so tall pile of paper would be unsealed for him to do. "Ugh this is going to be a pain.." the boy mumbles pulling down the first set of papers. 

The first set seems to be a father thick stack of papers that were stapled together. With a sigh he'd lay it in front of him and begin to read over the paperwork. IT seemed to be able the kages, about what they have done in the past and how the kazekage's furthered the development of the village. All so very very boring.

However at the end of it was a little quiz for him to do with questions such as "Name all the previous kazekages in order." and " How did the first Kazekage, Sazuke, Jak was killed?" All answers he knew of course, He'd simply have to write the answers in. For the first question he'd write in "Jak, seto, kastya, tategama, chiiyari, and Hassan" and the second " Died in combat to the Nidaime Mizukage."

To him all these questions were trivial.He just got out of the academy and all of this should of been taught t him already but he'd continue on going through worksheet after worksheet. Soon enough the boy would just skip to the question part of the papers and answer them easy. As said, the boy just got out of the academy and all of this should've been taught to him already. Though a little bit of review has never killed anyone... but almost boring them to death was still torture.

It would take some time but he would eventually finish all his work and by the time he does, the bell would ring which marked the start of the class. " Fudge.. I thought I would have time to do something else first..." he mumbles as students come into class along with the teacher.

" Alright class! Today is yet another history lesson." the teacher says to which Hiro replied with a sigh crossing his arms and readying himself for the long and boring class that was going to take place. At least he was caught up in  way after finishing all that work. " Oh! I see you've actually did your work Hiroshi.. nice of you to catch up with the rest of the class." the man says taking the papers from in front of the boy to grade later. Of course the class chuckles and snickers.

Hiro didn't even respond, he'd just stick to a slouching position and hope he didn't fall asleep during class.* - Fri Dec  4 23:58:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) was, as always, forced to do a bit of jutsu training but for once he was actually happy about doing it as he had several jutsus he wanted to work on mastering. And of course he wanted to play around with them to see what jutsus could be comboed with what and if they have any non combat use. With a smirk and a nod he'd get right to work.

First, he thought to do a quick test with his Shunshin. Of course, he knew it was going to be annoying. He was never really good with the jutsu but with him working on his control recently he thought it was at least worth a shot. His hands come together into the ram hand seal and he'd take in a deep breath to calm himself, body and mind, and begin channeling chakra into his legs.

As the chakra flowed into his legs, much more of it then last time would be able to be retained and used. This result wa do to the better control he had with his chakra in general and actually allowed the jutsu to go much easier than before. The jutsu actually vitalized his legs to their peek, increasing their strength and with it the speed in which he could move.

The boy's knees bend and he'd set his eyes on where he wanted to go. He aimed to stop at near a boulder before pushing off. In a burst of extreme, he'd shoot across the open field a ways. Though it wasn't without it's drawbacks. The burst of speed was actually so great that he wasn't really able to keep track if where he was going nor was he able to really tell how fast he was going making it difficult to stop when he wanted to.

When he does come sliding to a stop, he was unsure where he ended up. He'd look around and frown " I wasn't running that long... how far did I go?" he questioned taking a look around. It seems he long past the boulder he wanted to stop at. " Oh shoot I past it... and that jutsu still drains too much... ugh..." the boy says just moving on for now.* - Sat Dec  5 15:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) with his shunshin just falling flat he'd move on to just work on a few of his other jutsus. Starting with the new jutsus that he was taught not too long ago. " Right now lets dooo~... hmmm... lets work on water gun I guess..." he'd think looking about before turning towards the wall. " Okay this is going to be a bit weak.. but I guess that's why I want to work on it."

He'd go right into making the seal, making only one and taking in a deep breath. " Okay. Now, seal, breath, picture, nature, picture, fire!" hr quickly lists off in his head. These were the steps that it he was told to use while performing this jutsu and he'd surely make sure to follow them.

With the seal and the breath down, he'd begin to channel chakra into his lungs. He does this in an attempt to infuse suiton natured chakra into the air filling them which mean when he exhales that air it turns to water that's be projected forwards at the rock wall before him. It was a good try but a few things seemed to be wrong as the water flew from his lips. Things that he only noticed from using the technique.

The jutsu seemed to be extremely weak. That could be attributed to the fact that he had no real training in Suiton but even still it should be a bit stronger. With that in mind, he'd form the seal again, taking in yet another deep breath. " Come on~" he thought as he began to channel chakra into his lungs. The boy's stance widens to brace himself as he expels the water from his mouth to crash into the wall not really doing much damage on it.

The boy rubs his chin and thinks for a moment. " Hmm.. well she did way more chakra would do more.. soo..." he thinks aloud before forming the seal again and taking a deep breath. " Read... aim... fire!!" he thought firing another stream of water at the wall. The jutsu was simple but it wasn't at all powerful just another jutsu to be comboed later on.* - Sat Dec  5 16:26:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) turns back to face the wall " Okie dokie~ back to it!" the boy said raising his hands back into the ram hand seal. He'd widen his stand and take a deep breath inwards. As he does so, he's begin to channel chakra into his lungs before exhaling, creating a twister of wind to that'd move cloer to the wall.

Thee winds were weak and weren't even stong enough to make a toddler stagger but to him, it was just the beginning. He'd form the seal again focusing even harder then time. " Freak'in jutsu training." he thought to himself inhaling and channeling chakra to his lungs. He'd exhale creating a another twister of wind to run towards the wall never actually reaching it before it spun out.

" Hmm... maybe I need to add a bit more chakra to it..." he thought to himself before looking towards Hiroshi.
