<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) knew that he was going to have to do something if he wanted to get any better but being so young he didn’t even know where to even begin. Without anyone to train with or even anyone to team him anything he thought that he should train things he already know such as his high speed, Shunshin no jutsu. It was really all he could really do and with that being the jutsu the drains the most out of him it only makes sense to work on trying to better control it.

He’d first leave from the crowd of the square and head away to a less populated area of the village. Once there, he’d have to get himself ready for his training. Instead of jumping straight in he’d actually do a bit of meditation first. It was good for him to begin by feeling out his chakra before he begins just pouring it all into his legs at well. It was something simple but it was a good warm up for his practice.

Now that he was off by himself, the youngster shinobi would sit upon the ground, crossing his legs.His hands would come together at the fingertips and held upside how forming something of an upside down triangle. Once in his pose he’d take a deep breath through the nose and close his eyes. He’d exhale through his mouth as he begins to clear his mind of all thoughts. He’d focus on nothing but his chakra, trying to get a feeling for the flow of chakra coursing throughout his body.

However, he wouldn’t feel anything at first. The young boy took in another deep breath and exhales repeatedly. His body begins to soon relax and after the boy would begin to feel his the flow of chakra throughout his body. It wouldn’t be by much but it was more than enough for him and now that he could feel it, he decided to move on to try working on the jutsu.

The boy’s hands swiftly shift into the ram hand seal and once there, he’d begin to redirect the flow of chakra within himself towards his legs. Not being very experienced with controlling his chakra, his chakra would actually flood downwards to his legs and not only that but most of it was actually wasted. Much like a white water rapid, his chakra rushed and spilled over seeping out of his body. What chakra he managed to retain and build would actually vitalize his legs, strengthening them to the peek of their strength.

Once he he was at a comfortable amount of chakra built, he’d quickly spring to his feet and push off. The small child would shoot off in a amazing burst of speed. However, with this speed we wasn’t even sure where he was exactly to know when to stop. The simple fact of the matter was that this jutsu had more downsides than good for him at the moment, which is why he was trying to master it. Along with his extreme tunnel vision was the strain this jutsu put on a boy as small and young as he is.

Soon enough, he’d come to a sliding stop and then fall to his knees. “ Dang It… that drains way too much..” he’d pant. Even with his large reserves of chakra this jutsu, shunshin no jutsu, seemed to eat away most of it in a single use. It was obviously something that couldn’t be left alone of he was going to use it it combat.

Regardless of how useful the jutsu is for him at the moment, he’d sit down on the ground and form the ram hand seal again. He was simply going to meditate for the time beginning as he gathered his strength back. While he was waiting, he’d go back to just trying to get a feel for his chakra. He’d begin his breathing once more, in though the nose and out through the mouth. The boy repeated this cycle as he focused all of his attention inwards to his chakra flow.

After a while of meditation, he’d feel as if he gained back his strength. His hands shift back into the ram hand seal and he’d begin to focus his chakra into his legs. Yet again a large amount of his chakra would be wasted but what was maintained would strengthen his legs considerably. Once again he’d spring to his feet and push off, shooting off like a speeding bullet across a clearing.

Sadly, the boy wasn’t able to even really tell where he was as he was moving and when he stopped yet again a massive amount of his chakra was gone. With almost all his chakra being gone, he’d fall to a seated position on the ground, panting a bit. This was going to take far more training if he wanted to be able to use this for anything at all.* - Mon Nov 30 17:31:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: *laughs*  Alright man. - Mon Nov 30 19:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) takes in a deep breath trying to calm himself a bit before widening his stance. Seeing as Green Hiro was part of the chuunin exams, the boy was already just going to assume that he was stronger then him and was going to have to fight accordingly.

With that in mind, he'd simply test the waters a bit. His hand slip behind him and pull out six shuriken, three in each hand. He'd throw them all at Hiro, however most wouldn't even come close to where he was standing. In fact only to even came close. Result of bad aim maybe?* - Mon Nov 30 19:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Let's test him a bit. . .  - Mon Nov 30 19:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) groans and stomps his foot, typical of a child his age." Grr fine! Try this!" he'd shout reaching into his hoodie pouch with his right hand and behind him into his pouch with the other. From the pouch a tagged kunai would be pull and thrown straight at Blue Hiro. In a whipping motion, two more tagged kunai would be thrown from his hoodie pouch but these would be WAY off from Blue hiro and probably nothing he should worry about.

If Hiro happened to be able to sense chakra he'd notice that the two that were off actually had a chakra signature but didn't fluctuate as if it was going to go off and the one going towards him gave off no chakra signal.* - Mon Nov 30 20:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) 's kunai were deflected and although it wasn't optimal it seems he was happy with it. His childish rage him to just vanish as he smiled. " Alright then... Let's begin." He'd mutter to himself with a devilish grin. 

His hands clap together in the snake hand seal, setting off the two real explosive tags. The one near the cactus shouldn't affect very much.. unless you're the cactus but the one in the wall would explode sending dust and stone between them.  ( Trap activated.. Extra turn?)* - Mon Nov 30 20:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) , with his trap set off, he'd quickly pull a scroll from his pouch and throws it over head. Unsealed from the scroll would be several shuriken in a wide spread fashion. With keen eyes, and if the area wasn't covered in dust at the moment, Green Hiro would see that all the shuriken were connected with wired creating a wide casting net.

Saito would spring forwards forming hand seals, if this jutsu even needed any, and extend his hand towards the falling net. A flash of lighting would shoot through the net as the boy attempted to trap Blue under an electric net, stunning him.* - Mon Nov 30 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) tried. He really did but it seems his trap didn't exactly go as plan. Probably because it was a rather basic trap. Not only that but he would then get slammed with a torrent of wind actually being sent backwards a bit and staggering to stay on his feet.

" I thought you said you had water not wind!!"* - Mon Nov 30 20:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) h and he'd probbaly fall on his butt... he'd like 7* - Mon Nov 30 20:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) 's eyes widen and he'd grit his teeth and Blue seemed to burst towards him. Before he could even react, Blue was already there about to punch him. The boy's eyes close and he'd ready himself for the naruto face caving punch but it simply never came. A life tap was felt before he'd open his eye again.

" Heheh, yeah~ I wish I could of done more." he says with a chuckle pulling himself off the ground.* - Mon Nov 30 20:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) nods and smiles " Gotcha'!" he'd say before heading towards the collection of tools he used and gathing what was still useable. He of course seals his net trap back into it's scroll too.* - Mon Nov 30 20:38:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) distanced himself from the group of people at the square and went off to do some training of his own. He wanted to do some more training on his shunshin no jutsu. Of course, it was quite the task for him with how poorly he can handle his chakra and how poorly he used the jutsu but he was determined to work on it no matter how long it took... and he knew it'd take a long time.

Regardless the boy gets to it, finding a clear straight away to line himself up with before forming he ram hand seal. For this, he'd take in a deep breath and begin to focus his chakra to his legs. With his poor control, much of his chakra would leak from his body and be wasted but what he was able to control would revitalize his legs temporarily boosting his speed.

With his jutsu active, he'd push forward, speeding off like a flash of light. He would be able to go very far but it was further than he could go on his own. However, with his great speed he was still cursed with tunnel vision, making him unknown to where he was going.

The boy slides to a stop and with a large chunk of his chakra gone, he'd sigh, sitting on the ground and crossing his legs. He'd form the ram hand seal and calmly meditate to himself. He'd breath in through the nose and out through the mouth, attempting to calm both body and mind. As he does so, he'd begin to feel some of the chakra flowing throughout his body.* - Tue Dec  1 05:30:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) sighs, heading off to do some training with his jutsus but there was nothing he could do. Trill was only going to teach him more jutsus if he mastered the one he already had. It was a shame but he was going to have to work on his jutsus eventually.

He'd find one of the many large rocks around the village, he'd approach it and put a hand to the stone. He'd take a deep breath and begin to channel chakra to his hand. The boy exhales through the mouth as he begins to build his chakra even further and changing its nature to create a flash of lighting that's run through the boulder.

In the proceeds much of his chakra would be wasted. He wasn't able to really retain much of the chakra used. This increases the cost of it though it didn't matter much to him do to the boy having an abnormally large amount of it.* - Tue Dec  1 09:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) frowns as he sees his jutsu do nothing to the boulder " That's no good..." he mutters to himself beginning to build chakra yet again. " Again!" he'd shout at himself as the chakra begins to flood to his hand and change into lightning that'd electrocute the boulder.

However, the jutsu would do little to no damage and he could feel the large drain on is chakra. He seemed to have trouble focusing his chakra without lots of it leaking from his body as he performed jutsus. Something he took note of long ago but figured he'd get better at controlling his chakra the more he practiced his jutsus.* - Tue Dec  1 09:21:04 2015
