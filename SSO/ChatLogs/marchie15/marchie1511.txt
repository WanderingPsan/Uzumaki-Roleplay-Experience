<br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) 's kenjutsu wasn't all that epic. He wishes.. in his head it was.. but it wasn't. Regardless, he only had so much time to really react and handle the situation as it played out. Seems that Blue was able to not only avoid Green's attack but also launch a counter attack as well. This was not good.

Hiro was having trouble keeping up and do to this he only caught a glimpse of Blue as he launched the air bullets. " ... Crap..." he thought as he was impacted several times and causing him to call onto his back. " ow..." the boy says holding onto his side. Being so " squishy " surely had it’s downsides just like this. The boy simply couldn’t take a hit.

" Geeze.. I really need to work on... everything." He says with a chuckle. It was clear the match was over. No need getting too hurt over this.* - Fri Dec 11 13:34:52 2015

Green was just going to assume his bro and Mitsu was going to handle thing for the moment with defending off attacks. He would move towards the left side and bring his hands up. Chakra would be channeled to his hands and turned to lighting. The lighting bounced between his hands before forming a ball of lighting to be fired at the gang of...

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) just was happy he could dodge doing that training. If anything he wanted to work on the things he wanted to and not actually spar with anyne so above his level it wasn't even fair. That and he didn't want to end up like Mitsu and be broken. Regardless he had his own little training to do at the moment.

He'd head off to a far cornor of the village and take in a deep breath. " OKay now I can just work on whatever I want~." he says with a smile " Lets see~ I'm thinking shunshin and the hiding like mole thing..." the boy says to himself with a nod. " First up hiding like a mole." the boys says widening his stance and raising his hands.

The boy's hands form into the tiger hand seal. His eyes close and he'd begin and his mind begins to focus on his chakra. He'd begin to coat himself in his chakra. From there he just needed to change the nature of the chakra to doton and then move on to exacute the jutsu.

The ground benith him opens, allowing the boy to slip dowards benith the earth. He'd quikly sink further and further downwards until be decided to stop. Though he was under the ground, he was still able to tell exactly what was above him. It was actually rather easy using the magnetic field above him to sense what was happening over head.

Of couse nothing was happening but it was still nice to know exactly what was going on. He'd then slowly begins to move forwards from his current location. Actually moving through the soil as if it was nothing. This was acheived by trying the ground into sand around him allowing for easier movement through the ground. Not only that but the ground actually closes and returns to normal behind him, making it as if he was never there in the first place.

It was a very handie jutsu to him. There wasn't anything else he could really do with it though as it seems he wasn't all that skilled with it. HE'd begin to move again returning back up t the surface. " Ugh~ so dusty~" he says before coughing a bit. He'd finsh pulling himself out of the ground and dust the sand off of himself* - Sat Dec 12 13:58:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) had to do a bit of work with his fuuinjutsu. It was nothing but a hazord for him at this rate seeing as if he tried to use it it'd do nothing but be a bother for him. With this in mind he was just going to do something basic and easy today. He was just going to seal away a bunch of weapons in scrolls to use them.

He'd pull the first of his scroll out from his pounch and oppen it, laying it to rest ontop of a table. From there he'd pull out his ink and brush to use. " OKay now lets see here..." the boy mumbles as he dips the brush into the ink. " I think it goes something like this if I'm right." the boy continued beginning to dra out the formula on the scroll.

The formula would be long and a bit messy. Hiro wasn't exctly the best at funinjutsu. He was just good enough to actualy get them to work honestly but even still he'd draw out the symbols and lines needed for it. Finishing it off with blank space for object beging sealed.

One that was done, he'd then move on to get something to seal. He'd get is little wire net fitted with shuriken would be lined up and set it onto of the blank spot on the scroll. " OKa now this should work right?"

the boy then touches the end of the scroll with one of hs hands and begin to channel chakra into it. The chakra would run into the formula he drew and destort time and space. In a puff of white smoke the wire and shuriken net seemed to of vanished. The boy grins and pushes the scroll up a bit to let the ink dry a bit more.

The boy then continues on to pull out another scroll and un roll it. He'd proceed to begin to draw out anothe formula on this new scroll as well. They were just basic sealing scrolls so it wasn't anything major bit drawing out such long formulas did take some time.

After writing out that one he'd allow it to dry before picking it up and takes it over towards the sink. He'd begin to fun the water and allow it to fill up before channeling chakra into it and lower the scroll to the water. He'd seal away as much water as he couls before letting the rest of the water drain down the sink.

" Hmm... I think one more will do..." The boy says walking back over to his seat. He'd roll up the two scrolls he had completed and put them away. He'd then take his set and take out a few shuriken and wire. He'd loosely tie the shuriken in bundles of four.

After setting those up he'd draw out one final formula before laying all three of the bundles he mad onto the scroll. With a nod and a flow of chakra, a puff of white smoke will appear. Along with the smoke, the bundles of shuriken would be gone as well.

" Alright, that should be good for now... I'll think of some ore stuff to seal later."* - Sat Dec 12 18:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) had another idea. He watered to seal up a few more things in order to give him a bit of an advantage in battles. So yet again he'd sit at the table and pull out a scroll." Okay so just need a seal up a few more things and I should be all good." the boy says as he unscroll the scroll on the table.

He'd take back out his ink set and sit there drawing out the formula with a smile. The boy hums a bit to himself as he draws out all the symbols and what not of the formula for the basic sealing. It was a simple formula but it was a rather long one seeing as he didn't have the knowledge to do short cutes to shorten it.

" Hmm... there we go. Lets see.." he says pulling out an a sortment of kunais. He's lay about six kunai onto the blank area of the scroll. With a slight flow of chakra the scroll woulds seal away the kunais to be used whenever he sees fit.

" Okay~ now for a good one!! " he shouts putting away the scroll he just made. Next he'd pull out a second scroll and open it up. " Okay this one is oing to be for the best thing ever~" the boy says quickly drawing out the formula for the basic sealing. After finishing it he'd push it up a bit and allow it to dry as he stands back up.

The boy then runs to the fridge and pulls out the plate of cookies he saved for himself. He'd take them and run back over to his seal and pile all the cookies from the plate onto the paper. " Sweet~" the boy says channeling chakra through his formula and puff! The cookies were all sealed away.

" Heheh, bro will have no cookies for a while but he'll live."* - Sat Dec 12 19:04:41 2015
