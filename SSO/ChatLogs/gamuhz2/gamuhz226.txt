<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looked ahead to Shin as the boy diligently worked hard to reproduce the sequence that Sanoke had taught to him.

Of course, with some stroke of luck, the genjutsu specialist seemed to have displayed an unreal level of talent. In a few short minutes, the rock had been reduced to rubble, now in the form of smooth sand.

"Hrm. . .Wooow! That's it. . .? I guess I can teach ya a jutsu," the boy replies, holding his hand into a single seal.

"Using this property, I'll teach ya to make mud. You can either spit it from your mouth or form it from the ground. In this occasion, it'll be from the floor itself," he says, allowing chakra to be built up from his form,  and flowing onto the ground. The sand shifts, being broken down into a liquidy state, and soon after developing into perfect mud.

"You see what Idid here is just break downt the sand beyond powder. It can change an area to the condition you want. From there, I can send  the mud flying in a wave -- although it isn't very powerful," Sanoke remarks.* - Thu Oct 22 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Mud, huh? - Thu Oct 22 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: That's right. - Thu Oct 22 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) motions Nyoko over.

"Yo. Don't leave your scrolls laying on the ground."* - Thu Oct 22 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyoko(Emeralia) says: Huh? - Thu Oct 22 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyoko(Emeralia) says: Did I forget some? I apologize; I hadn't slept in a long while and more or less fainted for a bit. - Thu Oct 22 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) unseals two scrolls and tosses it over. 

"Yeah. Your teacher left some for you, but you fell a sleep."* - Thu Oct 22 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods.

"That's right. They look like cool skills -- well the Rotating Shuriken one. I snuck a peak, it's pretty sophsticated. Good luck," Sanoke replies.* - Thu Oct 22 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyoko(Emeralia) says: I'll need it!  - Thu Oct 22 03:54:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looks ahead as Shin again displayed near prodigious skill. In time, the ground was vibrating, before a load of mud had been developed, right in the middle of the boy's palm. "Woah! Not bad, Shin. Not bad at all!" Sanoke remarked, clearly impressed with the genjutsu specialist's clear talent.

--A glance is given back to Nyoko briefly. 

"Yeah. I ain't an expert in wind release. But it isn't too hard, even if it is pretty sophsticated. If you know a thing or two about chakra flow, you should be fine."* - Thu Oct 22 04:04:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blinks. 

"Fuckin' clones," Sanoke replies. Thankfully, with the clones being in place, the techniques casted weren't nearly as possible as you'd expect. With a slight kick off the ground, the warrior was off, his body legitimately being nothing short of a white-ish blur, that moved in an arc-ing fashion. The velocity was disgustingly swift, enough to be confused with a proficient usage of Shunshin.

Mid-way, Sanoke unseals a single explosive-tagged bomb, allowing it to roll underneath the gigantic sphere of fire. Presuming the inferno was enough cover, Saeza perhaps would not be able to take notice of the incoming projectile that rolled along the groud.

Tsk. . 

The tags ignite on cue, and without question, it combusts, releasing it's explosive nature. Meanwhile, the real shinobi stood out towards the west, arms folded.* - Thu Oct 22 06:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Promptly, his fingers press together, allowing for a swift build up of chakra.

Once an adequate source had been developed, two clones of his owns are spawned, and they're quick to spring into action. Effortlessly, one grasps upon the Tanto that was sheathed along the back -- We'll call him Sanoke #1. It slashes ahead, aiming to parry off two of the shurikens, while his body dipped to the right.

Sanoke #2 mere presses a hand against the ground, allowing for the dirt to shift and thus giving way for a partial 'Hiding Like a Mole' execution. Hideo hadn't been forgotten about, after all.

Lastly, this leaves the original Sanoke to keep up with the intensity. His hand speedily moves, grabbing ahold of his trusty scroll. Chakra funnels, releasing three sets of Kunai, each one with two tags attached to it. "A flock of bats. . . How the hell am I going to hurt this? Maybe if Ican take out each individual bat. . . She'll be forced to revert?" The teen theorized, as the technique was foreign to him. With a flick of the wrist, the three metallic objects goes soar, each one intent on penetrating the flock.

As they're gliding, a slight ember can be seen running along the end, making it clear that the Kunai are meant to be detonated.* - Thu Oct 22 07:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Fuuton elementalists. Almost as annoying as those damn Hogos!

"Hrm. . .Yeah. . . Just a spar, I can afford to be this careless with my chakra," He comments, considering the odds were now being stacked up against him. Both hands came together on instict, looping each finger inbetween one another, forming the commonly utilized Snake handseal. Considering it's close affinity with the doton nature, the ground is easily beckoned to Sanoke's will.

Immediately, a slab of earth spawns, jutting upward and blocking the vast torrent of wind. If the flames had somehow become empowered, that too would also be defended against most likely.

Quickly, from this, Sanoke broke off, moving towards the east -- eyes set right onto Hideo. Assuming the ability to get within a close enough range, the boy's speedy frame instantly breaks off into a spin, releasing two lightning fast kicks, one initially towardst he upper torso -- a feint -- while the other goes towards the lower body, all in hopes of sending Hiroshi tumbling onto his ass.* - Thu Oct 22 07:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||His clones were destroyed.* - Thu Oct 22 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: If he hits me like that again its a wrap. . . .  - Thu Oct 22 07:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) decides to show off.

From his rib cage, two extra arms would sprout, both actually thrusting their forearms ahead, blocking the kick before it can land. Hopefully Hiroshi wasn't lowkey some physical beast.

Assuming success, he kicks off lightly into the air, his body contorting to perform a heelkick against Hideo's cranium! Risky? Perhaps, but Sanoke honestly didn't care that much. "I can smell your chakra getting low! You should work on your overall reserves," the teen lectures amidst the battle, his tone as whimsical and carefree as you'd come to expect from him.
* - Thu Oct 22 07:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) does a flip again, stepping a few paces towards the north. His head tilts subtly, looking ahead as Hiroshi just laid there, motionlessly.

"You okay there, bro? I didn't mean to hurt you that badly."* - Thu Oct 22 07:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He quickly moves ahead, carrying Hiroshi in a bridal fashion.

"Ssh. It'll be okay! Good fight, though. I can tell you got potential," Sanoke replies with a shrug. He saunters into the north, prepared to set Hideo off onto a nearby bench.* - Thu Oct 22 07:56:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Stop speaking to me. - Fri Oct 23 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Stop being such a hardass, geez.. - Fri Oct 23 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) thinks: I don't even understand what they're saying, I shouldn't interfere with whatever they're talking about. - Fri Oct 23 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blinks as the warrior m akes her approach. There's a blank stare for a second, as he anticipates Makoto to actually speak -- yet there was nothing.

In no time at all, it seemed she had promptly turned about face and headed towards the west, much to Sanoke's surprise.

"---Uh. Can I help you, lady? Did ya want to say something?" the summoner inquires.* - Fri Oct 23 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||To say that he was perplexed would be an understatement.

Sanoke's face scrunched up and contorted in all sorts of weird ways, making his clear confusion in the process all too evident. "Uh. . Yeah. . well--" the boy stuttered out, a hand rising to scratch the back of his neck awkwardly.

"You should like-- Do you speak the common tongue here or something? I didn't understand that at all. "* - Fri Oct 23 01:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) thinks: I should never have spoken. - Fri Oct 23 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) thinks: It's given rise to such a conflicting situation. - Fri Oct 23 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) thinks: I've no clue how to speak his language. Did I say the words right? - Fri Oct 23 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) thinks: Maybe my accent was just too heavy...?! - Fri Oct 23 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) thinks: Oh I hate this... - Fri Oct 23 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) 's right brow quivered, before elevating upward. "--Oh! So you're foreign! That's new. . .I ain't ever meet anyone that couldn't even speak our language," Sanoke articulated aloud. Of course, it was clear that Makoto could at the very least comprehend the tongue, although her ability to speak it was less than desireable.

Aiming to make this easy on them both, the summoner's hand gestures towards his own body, beckoning the young -- presumablyTaijutsu-minded -- warrior to approach him.

"Well c'mere. You had somethin' to say didn't you?"* - Fri Oct 23 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) thinks: He should smile.. thats universal, - Fri Oct 23 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Damn. - Fri Oct 23 02:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I can't even heal myself without taking some time for my charka flow to return to normal. - Fri Oct 23 02:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blinks again, confused.

Had the girl nothing to say?

Regardless, one of Sanoke's arms stretch out, his palm stretched out. It gestures for a handshake -- even if Sanoke wasn't actually prone to touching people he didn't know. Fuuinjutsu was a bitch.

"Hi. M'name's. . .  Sanoke. You. . . are?" the teen stated in an awkwarrdly formal fashion, his words slower than usual to avoid any confusion. This was his attempt at being kind or proper.* - Fri Oct 23 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He gives an almost hurt look to his lonely hand that lingered in the sky. . 

"Damn. . Left me hangin'," Sanoke replies with a slight frown, although that facial expression quickly fades away once the foreigner spoke up again. His head tilted, as it usually did when he was mildly confused.

"--So we got a name. Whatcha all the way here for? I'm guessing Sunagakure is far away from your homeland. You must have a reason if you're  coming to a foreign, somewhat dangerous nation," the snow-haired teen speaks, his speech gradually speeding up. It looked like Makoto could understand him after all.* - Fri Oct 23 02:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Koji...Koji..Points at his chest* - Fri Oct 23 02:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He goes to rub the back of his head as the awkward silence settled onto the area.

Clearly, his speaking pattern was either too swift. . .Or, Makoto didn't know what the hell he was saying. "Uh. . . Why. . Did you come here?" Sanoke again re-iterates, this time in a far more animated sequence. The question was placed on repeat, with his fingers pressing together, building up a mass of chakra. An expert by now, the build up of energy is swift to break off into three pieces, thus spawning four total Sanokes.

They briefly act out the scene, each one henged as foreigner -- save for the original. The three clones effectively were wearing Sunagakure garbs, and holding a small suitcase. Their head held high, and their bodies moving in a marching fashion, as they presumably weathered the harshness of mother nature.

Marching almost like a mexican immigrant, they briefly put on a 'play' depicting immigratation or long travel. Subsequently, the dopplegangers are dispersed. Sanoke holds up a sheet of paper now, with a giant 'Question Mark.' 

"But why, though. . ?"* - Fri Oct 23 02:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Ah, right, Bryson, you have another healing scroll right? - Fri Oct 23 02:22:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Because you're a priest, I thought you were more skilled than this. - Fri Oct 23 02:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He sighs in an exasperated manner.

Makoto was being impossible!

"Hng. . . I know how you came here. Was just wonderin' why is all! Hrm, I wish there was a way I could like leap inside her brain," the teen replies. He looks the traveler up and down, and vaguely recalls seeing her out of peripheral vision.

Both hands rise briefly, giving half-hearted jabs into the skies.

"I guess ya came to see what warriors this village had to offer? If it ain't this, I give up!"* - Fri Oct 23 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: My moves can only be used by priests - Fri Oct 23 02:31:53 2015

"Oooh. Now that makes sense. You do look like some battle freak. Like. . Like. . Hrm, Izutora!" he replies, then nods vehemously in agreement with himself. 

A hand moves, slappin' the woman on the shoulder. "Good luck with that." With that, his arms fall limp, placing a hand into his pocket. Clearly, he didn't think this was going to devolve into a spar.

"Ya need to get like a translator or something."* - Fri Oct 23 02:35:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Well this was unexpected!

"-- Hey!" He shouts with wide eyes as Makoto quickly grasps at his triceps and armpit!

His body is promptly being pulled forwar towards her shoulders. However, before Shizune can complete the sequence, Sanoke acts on his feet. His hair -- far long than the spriet depicts -- elongates, with some of the locks speeding onto Makoto's torso. Assuming success, she'd find the rest of her motions cut short, as she was now tethered or held in bondage.

"--Yo! I wasn't asking for a fight, you know!"* - Fri Oct 23 02:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Hey, Mirai. - Fri Oct 23 02:48:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Things are fine. - Fri Oct 23 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||The hair retracts and he's set back onto the ground.

"-- Man! You don't just randomly go try to body slam people," Sanoke replies in between heightened breaths. "Anywho! English or whatever this language is called.  M'kay?"* - Fri Oct 23 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: Eto... - Fri Oct 23 02:51:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . .What. . ? Hrm. - Fri Oct 23 02:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeah. Can you write. . ? - Fri Oct 23 02:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) does the writing motion.* - Fri Oct 23 02:52:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) thinks: That's usually worn by women.  - Fri Oct 23 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods. He goes on to make that same writing motion.

Soon after, Sanoke does the same point, and inaudible mouths words. "Can you?"* - Fri Oct 23 02:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) wears fish nets 'cause it makes him look swaggy.* - Fri Oct 23 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) motions to Makoto again. Paper is summoned with ink.

"Can do. . ?"* - Fri Oct 23 02:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) takes that paper! 

He thrusts it into Bryson's chest! "Yo. Use this and look up like a library. I wantcha to like find a dictionary or something,"He replies. Without even waiting for an answer, Sanoke gives a bow towards Makoto.

"Alright. My friend here gonna take care of ya. . ." the teen mutters.

"Now. . Who was I supposed to be helping again?" He looks up absentmindedly, having already forgotten what he was doing before the young lass had arrived.* - Fri Oct 23 03:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: <*Would have slapped it against Bryson's chest beforehand*> - Fri Oct 23 03:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I'm okay. - Fri Oct 23 03:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: It was me Sanoke. - Fri Oct 23 03:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: ---Oh yeah! The kick. - Fri Oct 23 03:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: <*Whistles to Hideo*> Alrigh. Let's rock. - Fri Oct 23 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) poofs in a plume of smoke to go help a ninja in taijutsu.* - Fri Oct 23 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Right. So what's the problem. . ? - Fri Oct 23 03:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Well that's part of my issue. - Fri Oct 23 03:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: I don't know why it isn't so great yet. - Fri Oct 23 03:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Show me what you got. - Fri Oct 23 03:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Right. - Fri Oct 23 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looks ahead to Hiroshi as he breaks off into sucessive kicks.

"Not bad!-- But I can see the issue as clear as day. Fluidity, and momentum. You're too damn stiff, do some stretching exercises," Sanoke retorts, moving ahead to give a nice flick to Hideo's forehead.

"When you're going to do a kick, get into a free-flowing state ofm ind. Make sure that your body lacks all tension. . .Then. . ." he states, quickly allowing his body to break off into spins. One leg is pressed out, arched into a ninety-degree angle. The other remainstethered to the ground, serving as the first and last line of defense for his center of gravity.

"Alright! And for this part, while it's important to be fluid, keep your leg stern and make sure it can support your weight! Got it?" Suddenly the rotations come to an end.* - Fri Oct 23 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shook his head in disappointment at the entire sequence.

"Noo! What are you doing? You're a shinobi, this shouldn't  be happening!" Sanoke shouted as the sand rose and fell.

"Get back up, and try it again. Take it one step at a time. First work on spinning at a swift and fluid fashion. Then as you're movintg fast enough, work on balancing yourself on one leg to perform two consecutive kicks,"the teacher instructs, again displaying the Leaf Whirlwind technique masterfully. He moved at such a rate that his actual body shape couldn't even be perceived, at least not by untrained eyes.* - Fri Oct 23 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Faster. Faster. FASTER. - Fri Oct 23 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods.

He looked ahead, observing as the boy continued to work o nthe relatively simple taijutsu technique. "Good. . . Good! It's all about practice now. . . -- I still need to get you a shell, don't I? I'll have one summoned for ya in the morning," Sanoke replies, looking Hiroshi's frame up and down. Just from that alone, he could tell just how much the young lad could potentially lift or carry.

"In anycase. Will that be all?" he says, running a hand through his head of hair. There was a part that felt guilty, that he couldn't really assist Hideo further in the art of taijutsu -- it wasn't exactly Sanoke's strong suit.* - Fri Oct 23 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) is sensing for anything fishy, boy!

Assuming there's no chakra build up, he bumps the fists! "Anywho. . Should get goin'. My lady gets crabby."* - Fri Oct 23 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Right you handle your business Sanoke. - Fri Oct 23 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Alright. Catch ya later. - Fri Oct 23 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) disappears in a plume of smoke.* - Fri Oct 23 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) suddenly appears.

"Yo."* - Fri Oct 23 04:16:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gives a glance to Koji.

Was this true? That's what his eyes convey.* - Fri Oct 23 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) thinks: I can focus with or without him here... - Fri Oct 23 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods.

"Roger. I'll go do like. . Something I guess. How long you plan for this to go on?" Upon getting an answer, his body flickered from sight, his next act different depending on the estimated time/* - Fri Oct 23 04:22:49 2015
