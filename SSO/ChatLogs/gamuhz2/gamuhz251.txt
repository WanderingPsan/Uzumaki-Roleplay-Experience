He had no cuffs on his person. "Can you guys -- Oh. M'kay, come to the cells, peeps."* - Mon Nov 23 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Well, I'm not here by choice, nor am I going to get the Old Man angry. I've seen what he's done with Kenshin to Zetsumo.  He's scary. Heh. - Mon Nov 23 04:23:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) folded his arms upon reaching the questioning room.

"Anywho. Going to ask you both questions seperately."

Yes, both of them were placed in different sections, each one sealed off from hearing one another. After some thought, Sanoke -- with Mirai in tow -- go to question Kida. 

"Right. . .So why did the Mizukage have you teleported over here?"* - Mon Nov 23 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: You think this is a game?! - Mon Nov 23 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Mirai! Do you have any questions to ask, or anyway to interject? - Mon Nov 23 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: No. - Mon Nov 23 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) continues to put the pressure onto Kida.

"Hrm, alright. If you don't mind, will you go through a little test for me? My genjutsu," he inquires. Both hands press together, building up chakra for an all-to-familiar ninjutsu, interrogation.

"Stay still. . M'kay?" Assuming compliance, Kida probably would be placed under the skill, lest he had means to resist or render the technique useless. "Did you do anything hostile to force the Mizukage to send you away?"* - Mon Nov 23 04:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh. . Good. Lastly, you didn't harm anyone or anything within like. .  the last two weeks that could have irked the Mizukage enough to send you teleporting to a different location? - Mon Nov 23 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: H-.hey..? - Mon Nov 23 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: We're sort of busy. - Mon Nov 23 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Right.. - Mon Nov 23 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods.

Everything seemed to check out. He moves, locking the door and going into the next room where Ichiro had been placed.

"Alright, you next. Do you have any idea why the Mizukage would want to teleport you away?"* - Mon Nov 23 04:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I've no idea. - Mon Nov 23 04:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm. . Well your friend checks out for the most part. i'm going to check on you with a single question. If you check out, I'll have you guys wait in a cell as I report. - Mon Nov 23 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) forms the same seal to push Ichiro into the Interrogation technique.

"Right. Did you lethally attack someone? By lethal, I don't mean just being able to kill, but seriously harming anyone or anything."* - Mon Nov 23 05:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Yes. - Mon Nov 23 05:12:44 2015

NPCs would be called to escort both of the men to two different cells. They weren't going to be there for long.

"That's weird, then. They seem to be speaking the truth. Should I wait to get the Mizukage to answer? Or should I just let 'em go?"He says towards Mirai.* - Mon Nov 23 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Wait for the Mizukage to answer. - Mon Nov 23 05:23:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
The guards would be instructed simply to let the men go and ESCORT them out of the village. That is, unless the duo didn't decide to ask Hassan's permission to stay. Otherwise, they'd have to get out.

"Let's get out of here, though."* - Mon Nov 23 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: There is no need to keep them here. - Mon Nov 23 05:26:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||The region experienced a degree of calmness, as if mother nature could foresee the turmoil that would soon plague Sunagakure. The sands seemed anxious, as it prepared to absorb endless galloons of blood in the ensuing chaos that was destined to occur on this calm evening.

Sanoke, however, remained oblivious to the dangers that lurked. Sure enough, he knew full well that in time, the villain known as Edge would march, able to make his mark. ". . .Finally, a mission! Although, its far from one that utilizes my skill set very well. Oh well! Anything to help Sunagakure, since I probably won't be here forever," the teen remarks.

With activation of his shunshin, his body vanished from view. Like a supernatural phenomenon, his frame blazed through the deserted area, beelining towards the mission sight. It was near the gate, where carts of wood seemed to be piled ontop of one another. There was a local outpost -- or a semblance of one -- that desired the added material so that they could continue with their day to day activities.

Eager and willing to please, two hands wrap around each of the carts, with Shadow Clones being utilized in order to cover more ground and ease the amount of strength needed to transport said items. Almost as if this was a race against the clock, Sano blurred forward, the vehicles tweaking uncomfortably as if in protest. It takes less than hour to fully scale the needed distance, as the boy's vast speed and stamina dictated that he'd run from start to finish.

Towards the end of the travels, there was guardsmen clearly in wait, pacing back in forth impatiently. Once the snow-haired warrior had been revealed, the Sunagakure insignia perched on his forehead, each of the impatient guardsmen cheered, wearing gracious smile. The carts are delivered, and as thanks, one of the men provide or grant a supply of Shurikens.

Sanoke gives a nod, taking only ten minutes to rest before heading back home. Along the way, he's moving with a lot more patience. A shuriken is toyed with, with chakra being flowed along every inch of the metallic weapon. It glows a colbalt illumination and allows the shinobi to manipulate it's spinning momentum as welll as directions. 

After ten minutes of wallking and continued fiddling, the Fuuton nature itself is applied, allowing for a nearly invisible veil of wind currents to follow after. Accurately manipulated, the shinobi is enabled to apply thin, opposing currents along the greater flow, thus increasing it's cutting properties. In a little more than an hour, the mission is complete. He goes to collect his reward.* - Mon Nov 23 20:26:40 2015

Shockwaves. Thunderous sound waves rushed through Sunagakure, echo-ing around the desert-y plains. For a moment ensuing after, there's a moment of silence. . .

"IT"S EDGE!"

Oh boy, this isn't good. Frantically, Sanoke's gaze moved around in a swivel, and the turtle shell upon his back is launched off! Cue adding on his Kame Cloak! A small amount of blood is formed, and after repeated hand signs, turtles sprawl out. 

They go to scout the area, and due to the mental link possessed with Sanoke, he'd essentially have eyes all over the village. Much better than using a Kage Bunshin, since those needed to be disperse in order to transfer knowledge.

Was it finally time to battle? 

"He might have some traps layered on the floor. Hopefully your shinobi can detect any traps and such. . . I'm going to send some dopplegangers in first. . " 

Why not be cautious? Along the way, his figners pressed together, forming three clones, all of which charged in recklessly to meet the threat. Their bodies, while not quite as fit and powerful as the original, still elegantly danced through the hordes of shinobi, blurring ahead to reach the entity known as Taiga Edge.

No words were spoken, just an exchange of solemn gazes.* - Mon Nov 23 21:18:43 2015

Elemental ninjutsu wasn't exactly his strong point. Regardless, he'd oblige, planting his foot right onto the ground to balance himself. Thankfully, the element of Earth didn't typically require too many hand signs. 

Both of Sanoke's hands press together, forming the 'Snake' and allowing for a vast build up of Doton chakra. He uses this nature to manipulate the sand below his feet, forming giant, thick slabs of sandstones. They jut up in a circular fashion, aiming to shield  the Shadow Clones, as well as the many of the warriors that were around his general vicinity.

Naturally, the earth does relatively well against the inferno onslaught -- but it isn't infallible. Smoke stems from the crusty shell of the Earthen Corridor, and before long, much of the rock is crumbling away. Moving through, the clones formed before dash ahead, each one reaching for a scroll. 

"Ninja Art. . . Explosive Assault!" Upon releasing, pretty much all of the Fuuinjutus specialist's entire content of explosives are released. Ten each, making a total of thirty. Oddly, these tags were especially formed, each one in the shape of a sphere and using a special formula taught to him by a former Mizukage. Speedily, they sail through the skies, intent on infiltrating through the hordes of 'Edges' and igniting. The explosives weren't much unlike a grenade, as they'd certainly send any poor soul caught within the radius flying and riddling their bodies with burns.

Meanwhile, the Snow-Haired warrior advances, still not quite clumping himself with the rest of the crowd. 

"Why is this guy even doing this. . ?" * - Mon Nov 23 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: This is getting i-interesting.. - Mon Nov 23 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
Chaos. Complete and utter chaos.

Direct contact with Sanoke's previous assault of Exploding Mines had be evaded -- much to the army's delight. Unfortunately, this was easier said than done. Each of the paper-covered tags glowed briefly, before every ounce of stored chakra is released at once. 

The thunderous roars clearly stick out, even among the battle cries of thousands. Naturally, the earth is torn asundered, craters left in the aftermath of the violent release. If none of the men were caught? They'd certainly at least be effected by the collateral damage as the momentum carried the wind.

And in that moment, that's where the clones struck.

From their paws, blackened chakra receivers could be seen manifesting. The two towards the right continue charging, moving towards the forefront while sending the spawned projectiles ahead to pierce and disable the whoever was struck. Meanwhile, the last stood towards the back, using his doppleganger brethren as a lift -- literally leaping off their backs to avoid destruction. 

Somersaulting, the clone fond itself infiltrating the ranks of Edge's army and engaging in melee, although this engagement is likely short-lived. Regardless, be it from the water or the fuuton onslaught, all of the Shadow Clones are destroyed.

-----------------
Meanwhile, the actual Sanoke still is getting into the fray. Just as his copies had done, he forms receivers and tosses it, this time with the intent on catching the same Edge that had been battling Izanami! It's aided in part by Hassan's overwhelming Fuuton ability.* - Mon Nov 23 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Yada, he flicks in and out, almost as if using speed enhancing abilities to line up with the male.* - Mon Nov 23 22:42:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Gah. I don't want to charge in and fight all of those men myself. Hopefully I  can get some cover. - Mon Nov 23 23:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
'Charge!'

And so he does. Exercising his agile nature, Sanoke closes much of the distance between himself and the fleeing assailants. His hands were together, and without any hesistance, a small string of handseals are compiled.

From this, a thick layering of chakra guides itself forward to his cranium, manipulating the natural metabolism of the body. Suddenly, like fuckin' Repunzel, he lets down his long hair -- which just happens to be durable as natural steel, maybe even moreso. The tangled strands take on a strange shape, that of a Lion's Maw, and wildly it charges towards the closest Edge, aiming to engulf and constrict his movements.

Naturally, not much is being held back, and if caught, the Rinnegan (or Sharingan if this is Ortho) user would find his bones being crushed to render movement impossible. Likewise, his body was going to be held in bondage. "Ninja Art. . . Wild Lion's Maw!"* - Mon Nov 23 23:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Who? - Mon Nov 23 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) had been prepared to speed blitz after his opponents -- until additional roars could be heard. The explosions from the Hassan clan was enough to deter an advancement. Sure enough, Sanoke moved on over by the Kazekage's side, lagging just behind.

"Sheesh. . . What kind of jutsu is that?" he murmurs to himself with surprise, while still remaining as vigilant as could be. Adrenaline continued to pump, keeping the teen at edge.* - Tue Nov 24 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Best element so far has been fire. .  - Tue Nov 24 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) was prepared to give chase as best as he could. 

Sadly, the duo were far too out there to actually be within Sanoke's grasp. Like a ballerina, he manuevers throughout the area, before the flying warriors were within sight. 

Even as the NPCs waged war, he lined them up. A few seals later, and the earth itself is being manipulated into condensed rocks. They fling, albeit from afar, aiming to pelt both with dozens of rocky projectiles. Hit or miss, Sanoke begins to back up, as he wasn't exactly going to go leave his allies behind and chase duo alone.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) formed a single seal.

His body disappears in a plume of smoke, re-merging beyond the attack's range. Likewise, he'd have notice any traps regardless, given his ability to see chakra. Not that he was going to trigger any.* - Tue Nov 24 01:06:33 2015

Apparently the launchers reached a far length.

He stood amidst the pack. Whatever Hassan and his cronies missed, Sanoke sought to clean up. A single seal formed, spawning three clones, all of which release a Great Breakthough -- assuming any of the projectiles get through.* - Tue Nov 24 01:45:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) did all that he could. Getting in close with such a massive army wasn't going to happen from the look of things.

Instead, generic ninja weaponry are flung outward from the scrolls that remained at his side. They buzz through the sky, aiming to pierce opposing forces to whittle down Edge's forces.* - Tue Nov 24 02:10:33 2015

And the deed was done.

Countless shinobi were either slain or taken in for interrogation. Once the dust settled, Sanoke sends a strand of hair forward, lifting Izutura's carcass on over, and holding it in a bridal fashion.
