The shinobi was in quite a pickle, as he couldn't think of how to appease the curved Hokuma, and get back onto her good-side. For a moment, his mind drifts off, thinking of a proper or feasible method to undo all of the damage.

As a romantic retard, it's clear that Sanoke has some issues displaying intimacy. . . But alas, he had uncovered the secret during the travel! Women loved to be given attention and affection -- an immense amount. Spontanenously, he twists around, landing right infront of Mirai, on a single knee. A hand moves, unsummoning a nice gathering of flowers.

"Uh. I'm sorry! Let's cut this all out. Geez. . . Soooo! Marry me," he says in a casual, yet hopeful manner. He blinks, looking on blankly, wondering if the proposal would even work.* - Sun Oct 25 07:04:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) cue sweeping up bridal fashion.

A wave is given to Mizora -- nope she's gone. "Catch ya later, Saeza."

With that, Sanoke disappears in a plume of smoke.* - Sun Oct 25 08:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He was fast as hell.

In no time at all, he arrives at his home. The door is cracked open, and in the two went. She's set onto her feet shortly after.

"So. . Engaged. Mmm, this is new," he scratches his head, somewhat awkwardly. "I'll leave the planning to you -- if you don't need me to help or nothing. Anywho. . . " he says, clearing his throat afterwards.* - Sun Oct 25 08:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Why are you always so shy? - Sun Oct 25 08:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Don't be afraid to take control. - Sun Oct 25 08:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) scratches his nose. 

"Uh right. . . -- Uh, thanks for forgiving me earlier. I might not show it all the time, but I do care," Sanoke admits. Cue an exhale, and with the release came an outpour of nerves.

-- Albeit, this was far from the nervous jitters that the boy held in the their first encounter. Nevertheless, Mirai's words are taken as encouragement. He sets a hand onto her hips, while another rests onto the Hokuma's ample bum -- gripping. 

"I can try. But I'm still a little lost here, y'know?" He says, still debating on how he'd go about it. The look on Sanoke's face is inquisitive, as if asking if he should go further.* - Sun Oct 25 08:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) exhales again.

"No, it's fine. Just some jitters because I've never really been in this position," he replies, his body languing calming down considerably. He and Mirai were locked to be married, there was no point in backing down now.

His right hand continued to clutch at her derriere, giving shameless squeezes and allowing his hands to become thoroughly acquainted with that area of the woman's body. But alas, he knew it couldn't just end there.

Wasting no time, both of Sanoke's arms move, looping around her thighs. Using that grip, Mirai is speedily relocated into his bed room, and slammed onto the mattress. With some enthusiasm, the turtle summoner's hands are pulling at whatever button or latches hold up Mirai's clothing to disrobe her and give access to the woman's curved form. There's an observant gaze always on the look out, to ensure that she wasn't taken back by the sudden animosity and willingness.* - Sun Oct 25 08:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||With how fast he was, it wasn't that crazy to see how effortless Sanoke had disrobed the curvaceous woman.

Just the sight alone brings a great deal of arousal, and entices the teenager -- So much that his earlier jitters had all but been erased. His eyes scanned Mirai's form up and down, but in the end, they settle onto the woman's milk-filled bosom. While straddled onto of the 'Byakugan Princess's form, Sanoke leans ahead, the right hand cusping at her breasts simultaneously.

Gently, his mitts contorted, squeezing and contorting Mirai's bust. After the brief period of fondling, down the boy's head went, allowing his hips to settle onto her teats. In no time, his tongue flickers, lashing against her nipple. Lewd and loud suckles are performed as Sanoke eagerly aimed to please, while also gaining pleasure on his own.

Indeed, as their body passionately pressed against one another, clear heat could be felt emanating from his pelvis. Subtle movements are easily detected due to the boy's growing erection. It twitched, clearly beckoning for attention. * - Sun Oct 25 09:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||The lashes were in abundance, each stroke slowly lathering Mirai's teats with saliva. It was like Sanoke was a baby that required nursing -- a greedy one at that. For several minutes at a time, his mouth remained glued to her breasts, and the sucking was in full force. Initially, they were gentle, but with each passing second, Sanoke grew more used to the lewd acts, and thus gained a bit of ferociousness.

WHen it was all said and done, the Hokuma's flesh was partially discolored -- in red.

Quickly, he'd switch things up, his body blurring up until he had been saddled along the woman's upper torso. By then, Sano's pants were pulled down, exposing his pelvis reason, and of course putting on display his member. He was more or less devoid of pubic hair, his length tan-skinned and partially covered in veins. It was a decent size, being just slightly over seven inches, and of course throbbing in unison with his palpitating heart. 

A slight inkling of pre-cum seeped from the slit, putting into perspective just how entice the snow-haired warrior was. Immediately after, both hands smack onto Mirai's breasts, and they're pushed up harshly against the ex-Shinobi's cock. The two, soft mounds of flesh were essentially smothering his member, but isn't quite able to enveloping it completely. From the head, the bodily fluid served as partial lubrication -- but that wasn't quite enough.

On reflex, he begins to thrust, forcing the head of his member to occasionally bump against Mirai's chin. Without question, the teenaged virgin moans, but the utterences of pleasure are hushed and tamed.* - Sun Oct 25 09:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||In the event that Mirai's player fails to response, it can be assumed they go all the way. 

He tucks her in afterwards, and exits the house.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looks downward. He gives a friendly smile and nods.

"I mean. i'm okay, I guess. I don't really fight much unless the opponent is interesting."* - Sun Oct 25 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Why do you use that giant scroll? You know you can seal things into a smaller scroll too, right? - Sun Oct 25 14:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I'm just saying though. - Sun Oct 25 14:50:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Although Fujitora might be a tad bit better than I am. - Sun Oct 25 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: If he was ever around. - Sun Oct 25 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm Kilm, Yes. - Sun Oct 25 14:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeaaah. He's a  bit hard to find. - Sun Oct 25 14:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Yeah, I've been waiting for him forever. - Sun Oct 25 14:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Well, come on. I wanna train a little bit. - Sun Oct 25 14:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: If you insist. - Sun Oct 25 14:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) yawns.

"Alright. Go at your leisure."* - Sun Oct 25 14:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) remained in a stationary positioning. One hand was in his pocket, and the body language worn made it as clear as night and day!

This spar wasn't taking seriously in the least.

As Nina rushed ahead, Sanoke was as still as a mouse. He moved once the punch was coming in. Before it can land, the arm that remained out of the teen's pocket -- the left -- would swipe, aiming to stray the blow off course. Assuming success, a follow-up is given. This being a palm thrust, intent on not dealing a greater deal of concussive damage, but sending the girl skidding backward.* - Sun Oct 25 15:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He was calm and collected through the motion.

"Ninja 101! Taijutsu. . . You aren't half bad, you know."* - Sun Oct 25 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: (Trying to keep my stats on the downlow. If u ever feel am downplaying, tell meh ur Attack spd - Sun Oct 25 15:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) whispers: (look at these lame perks lol) - Sun Oct 25 15:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blinked with mild surprise. A smile was creeping onto his feature.

". . .Kids nowadays are so strong," Sanoke remarked. The kick from Nina goes on with full force, but it fails to hit it's mark once again. Just before the attack can collide with Sanoke's head, the teen's appendages quickly blurred through the skies once more, latching onto her ankles. 

With a single pivot, his body does a partial spin-- acceleration reaching it's climax almost instantly. All that force or momentum carries over, and once it's swinging, the male's grip is relinquished, hopefully sending the black-haired sword-girl sliding along the soften sand. "---Yo! You got spunk, that much I'll admit."* - Sun Oct 25 15:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: A generalist? - Sun Oct 25 15:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) skips back, looking towards the girl as her hands raced through a string of handseals. With his sensory ability, the male is more than capable of reading the relatively large build up of chakra. Rather than be fearful, he's estatic and charmed to see just how powerful the growing generation of Sunagakure was proving to be.

"Fireball jutsu? It took me so long to learn just a basic Doton technique. . Tch! Tryin' to show me up!?" Sanoke shouted as the sphere of inferno came his way. Of course, given his skillset there was no actual danger.

--He'd disappear in a whisk of sand, his body obscured thanks in part to the massive ninjutsu technique that had been unleashed. 

Kaboom! The explosives settle, charring the ground due to the chaotic ember. The floor is left blackened and devestated by the assault, yet Sanoke was nowhere to be seen. Where had he gone? Underground, and it was a safe assumption that Nina would be capable ofo detecting such. There was a faint hole in the ground even, making something clear.

From this, an actual Sanoke arose. His frame covered in charred flesh and burned clothing. Half of his hair had presumably been burned off as well. "Gaah! You. . You. . I won't be able to live much longer. . !"

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Don't you guys have a medic or something around here? - Sun Oct 25 15:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Damn.

The clone disperses. Swiftly, the actual Sanoke speeds on off the ground. "Wooow! I expected you to be all shocked or surprised. So unfun."* - Sun Oct 25 15:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hm, I've seen it all. That one was new, but I'm not so easy to fool. - Sun Oct 25 15:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Heh! Remember one thing, kiddo. The basics will always have some use. - Sun Oct 25 15:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: That jutsu isn't basic, people refuse to teach it to me for some reason, it must be strong. - Sun Oct 25 15:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: On a side note. That's all? THis was getitng interesting! - Sun Oct 25 15:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Oh, I have plenty of jutsu up my sleeve. - Sun Oct 25 15:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I mixed Kage Bunshin with Henge -- a basic. - Sun Oct 25 15:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: But I guess the spar is over? - Sun Oct 25 15:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: You wish it was. I only wish we didn't have a crowd. - Sun Oct 25 15:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Cue speed up.

His movements are damn near untrackable. Upon landing by Nina's side, a hand rests onto her head. "You got potential, kiddo. You're going to be really strong when you're older. Maybe next time we battle it'll be in a more. . . Uh. I think conspicuous is the word?"* - Sun Oct 25 15:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Aww, you're quitting? - Sun Oct 25 15:47:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: No, it's fine. I have a lot to prove so that you can teach me that jutsu, unlike anyone else in this place. - Sun Oct 25 15:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm. . .It's not exactly easy to do that jutsu, y'know. - Sun Oct 25 15:48:03 2015
