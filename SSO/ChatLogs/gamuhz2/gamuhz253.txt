<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Marrisa had aarm missing. - Thu Nov 26 07:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: What was I thinking, I clearly wasn't enough to protect the village... - Thu Nov 26 07:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: And Fuji's gril wife thing fixed her good as new. - Thu Nov 26 07:47:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gives a nod to Trilliam.

"Keep her safe, please. And Bryson, do what you can to end the pain." His body blurs out of view, beelining towards the gates.* - Thu Nov 26 07:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) flicks into view. 

"Alright. . .This is simple. We're not burying any bodies just yet, but gathering them up. We'll be taking them to the make shift hospital -- which is what we're using until the village's hospitals are repaired."

In the distance, dozens of disheartened Sunagakure shinobi marched along, carrying their fallen brethren. Some couldn't hold back their tears, and chugged on while sobbing. Others just wore solemn expressions. Given the massive holes along the walls, there were many passages to go through to get the job down.

Sanoke gives a gander to the two Hokuma, wondering if they understood. Meanwhile, his hands formed a specialized 'cloning seal.'* - Thu Nov 26 07:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

Once his two fingers had been pressed together, about a dozen or so Shadow Clones were spawned. Given his above average chakra reserves, and inhumane stamina, Sanoke seemed a bit more chipper than you'd expect. 

Quickly, the clones took off, bolstering Sunagakure's relief efforts. 

The sudden force is enough to greatly improve the group's efficiency. Just as Mirai had done, Sanoke too utilizes his Hair Binding technique to serve as additional arms. -- What more, the boy could put his rinnegan to use, literally forming additional appendages in order to make the work efficiency far more efficient and capable. In no time, an entire legion of carcasses were being transported.

Seconds develop into hours, and from start to finish, Sanoke was tirelessly aiding in the relief efforts. By then, a bit more than two hundred bodies had been transported away, at least clearing out Sunagakure's entrance. Thankfully, the stench of burning or rotting flesh was dissipating given the massive transportations. 

Tired, Sanoke regroups with the duo of Hokuma, breathing heavy. "Phew. . .You all want to continue or can we take a break? I think we should be done in less than a day, if so many shinobi keep aiding. Funerals can be held through the week," He leans against the wall, awaiting a response. * - Thu Nov 26 08:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: It's up to you. - Thu Nov 26 08:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: You're in charge now. - Thu Nov 26 08:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ponders on it.

"No. . That's enough for now." He moves up, approaching the two. "So who's the little one? Another of your cousins?"* - Thu Nov 26 08:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Maybe. - Thu Nov 26 08:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Wanna just go home for now? - Thu Nov 26 08:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Maybe? - Thu Nov 26 08:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Sure. If it's still standing. - Thu Nov 26 08:14:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Wouldn't make it infalliable, though. - Thu Nov 26 08:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Why not? - Thu Nov 26 08:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Because. There's no such thing as a jutsu that's perfect. It'd make the house more durable for sure, though. - Thu Nov 26 08:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: There are jutsu that are perfect. - Thu Nov 26 08:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: <*Shakes his head*> Every jutsu has a weakness. - Thu Nov 26 08:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Or a counter. - Thu Nov 26 08:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Not true. - Thu Nov 26 08:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: You don't feel like you're the best at what you do? - Thu Nov 26 08:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shook his head, clenching his fist.

"Today opened my eyes. What I can do now is only scratching the surface of ninjutsu.."* - Thu Nov 26 08:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: What did you see today? - Thu Nov 26 08:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: The man that defeated  Marissa -- he was a Gezo Field COmmander. - Thu Nov 26 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: His strength was. . It was on an entirely different realm.  - Thu Nov 26 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: His chakra outpour was so intense in that slash, it vaporized her entire body, not leaving a trace. - Thu Nov 26 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: You know what you sound like? - Thu Nov 26 08:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm. . ? - Thu Nov 26 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: A groupie. - Thu Nov 26 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's not being a group, I could hardly perceive the man'sattack. He was way stronger than anyone -- But I'm going to get stronger. - Thu Nov 26 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Had that field commander been our opponent today. . .I don't even want to think about what would happen. - Thu Nov 26 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: What did she even do? - Thu Nov 26 08:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I don't know.. - Thu Nov 26 08:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: She contacted the Gezo about something.. - Thu Nov 26 08:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Wasn't she a private? - Thu Nov 26 08:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Mhm. . It was about Edge's body, and the Rinnegan.. - Thu Nov 26 08:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I don't know what was in the message precisely, but those were the two topics. - Thu Nov 26 08:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Mainly letting them know that the Rinnegan was taken from the body. . ? I don't know. . She did something to make them mad. - Thu Nov 26 08:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: So you don't have it? - Thu Nov 26 08:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) finally takes off his glasses, sporting the now completedRinnegan!

"Before I defeated Edge, he mentioned something about me being able to resurrect people? Hrm. . . I think I'll try to master my doujutsu."* - Thu Nov 26 08:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: The ability to bring people back would be neat. . .Although, I'm willing to bet it'd have a big price to pay.. - Thu Nov 26 08:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

Mirai made good points. He should bee feeling triumphant upon taking out the most dangerous man in the world -- even if the costs were steep.

His eyes peered forward as well, as if staring into the Hokuma's very soul. The gaze is unwavering, and he doesn't says a peep as the lecture is given. Before Sanoke knew it, a kiss had been planted onto his lips, much to his delight. 

"You make a lot of sense, you know. Hrm. . . Although, with authority being passed onto me, might put a hamper on my traveling gig. Once everything is settled down, you'd want to go explore the world with me?" He inquires, adamant in his desire to get back to some adventuring now that the world was devoid of Edge and Ortho.* - Thu Nov 26 09:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I would follow you anywhere. - Thu Nov 26 09:09:32 2015

"Alright, this is a basic technique, but invaluable. To do it, you'll need to actually have the Wires in place to manipulate. It's easy for me because I'm a Fuuinjutsu specialist, so I can summon any on the fly. Although, I usually keep a small amount wrapped underneath my clothing. . "

From his scroll, ten feet of thick steel wiring was released. It's tossed on over for Mirai to take, and use as her own practicing tooling.

"Basically, you're just wrapping the chakra in a thi-- I mean, the wire in a thin layer of chakra. Watch as I demonstrate with your byakugan." Had Mirai obliged, she'd be able to see a nice layering of the ninja wiring along his body, mainly on the forearm. A single seal is form, allowing chakra to be built up along his body and rush ahead along the chakra pathways.

They target the tenketsu along the forearm, allowing energy to ooze out in a slimey sequence. Diligently, each grain of spiritual energy finds it way along the durable wiring. Considering Mirai's potent doujutsu, she'd find that the chakra formed a viel or aura around the targeted items, and thus gave Sanoke a limited ability to manipulate it's movements and directioning. The hand sign employed was a common one -- the Ram -- and with that, the wires were unwrapping and slithering out from his cloth.

It'd rush ahead, as if to constrict or strike the student in the situation. But. . .! The items stop shortly, teasing flapping and being returned to the user. "Get it? It's like. . Suimen in a way. In the fact that you're forming a cohesive effect with your energy. Once that's in place, you can use the seal to become more precise with your flow, and send the wires ahead -- controlled by thoughts. It's a nifty technique, but teends to lose effectiveness against higher-leveled opponents."* - Thu Nov 26 21:05:29 2015

Sanoke spoke, giving a glance to Trilliam.

"Hi. Do you think you can help with some demolition? We need some areas cleared up to start anew. CAn you use your exploding expertise?"* - Thu Nov 26 23:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Necromanceress(Gamuhz2) ||
Sanoke shrugged.

"Your efforts in the war won't go unnoticed. I know you did a lot, and were instrumental in us being successful. So I am willing to make you a chunnin -- but I want to honor you. That's something to be handled later, once the village is perfectly fine," Sanoke replies.

A hand goes to shoo Mirai and CHikyu off to do their business. 

The mission is handed on over to Trilliam to complete. It was pretty standard, although e'd have to be careful not to harm any civilians or employees in the process.* - Thu Nov 26 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Necromanceress(Gamuhz2) ||
Sunagakure had seemed better days. 

The village, days removed from Edge's sudden attack, had yet recovered. Much of the village's workforce still remained occupied with relief efforts -- with a large chunk finally going to work on the sewage. 

Thankfully, Sunagakure didn't lack in terms of Doton practitoners. Hordes of Doton elementalists were huddled to the north, using their fiercesome talents to dig massive holes into the ground -- each being sturdy and stable. It works wonders, allowing the actual carpenters and other constructions workers to ease their way in with vehicles.

It stretched deeply, allowing the sewage pathways to be revealed -- and boy did they wreck. There were various empty spots to walk along, but with the path there seemed to be a river of waste -- compiled of the obvious sickly materials that came from a human's body. The chief captain-ing the task would warmly wave towards the women, telling them the situation.

"Oi! I take it you two fine ladies are the ones meant to help us with a little reconstruction? Normally. . . I'd ask of you to help keep the floor stable, but there seems to be an issue. We sent some men in about three hours ago to go repair some broken pipes and fix the sewer's flooring -- but they haven't come back. No screams, so I'm sure all is well. . But can you go help those poor souls get out?"* - Fri Nov 27 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Where did you send them? - Fri Nov 27 00:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Necromanceress(Gamuhz2) ||
The Chief spoke.

"Downward. . . And times are rough, we can't exactly give radio communication to everyone."

Sunagakure wasn't that developed, and many of the radio towers that may have hypothetically exists probably were taken out. Unlike Chikyu, it seemed as if the chief didn't seem at all phased by the horrid aroma. "The sewers are pretty extensive. . But eh, shinobi excel in tracking, right?"* - Fri Nov 27 00:14:56 2015

As they entered the underground carven, they'd find that the area was dimly lit. Some of the light bulbs that were layered onto the walls were flickering in and out, as their lifespan was waning and nearing an end.

Oddly, the floor cracked upon having to support their weight-- as the entire sewer was still unstable given the explosions set off by Edge's last attack. To the left and right both, a river of waste continued to roam, intensifying the overwhelming bad strench.

Mirai's Byakugan was a great help, at the end of the day. But even then,  her range wasn't so large as to completely be capable of viewing the elaborate maze that was Suna's sewage system.

Her eyes would be able to pick up on a number of odd sightings. Blood that painted along the floor of the distanced sewers, strange symbols of glpyhs being written along the wall -- and of course, odd entities. Sadly, their village seemed obscured, as if by an aura of sinister chakra. Likewise, creatures lurked within the waters in some areas. But where?

Based on Mirai's vision, the best bet was clearly towards the east, which is where the largest source of un-natural seemed to be pooled. The cavern was completely silent, however.* - Fri Nov 27 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Necromanceress(Gamuhz2) ||
Mirai and Chikyu would find that their movement along the eastern portion of the establishment went relatively smoothly. Although, even if there were no CLEAR signs of something going amiss, there was still an omnious aura that stuck in the atmosphere.

The Hokuma in particularly could probably infer such. As she comes along towards an open area, there seemed to be a strange barrier of sorts. The energy was clearly different from conventional chakra-- More potent, and clearly not of human nature. After all, it lacked the usual warmness and general sensation you would expect when sensing a human.

The biggest kicker of the smog-like barrier was that it completely and utterly blotted out even the visual prowess of the byakugan. The sickly waters that seemed evident in almost every corner of the sewers also suddenly began to bumble, as if someone had turned on a massive oven at the bottom of the dirty pit. 

What lingered here? That was something to discover. Symbols also seemed to be written along the walls, clearly infused with energy as well, but they aren't exactly used or activated just yet. Remarkably enough, there STILL wasn't a sound to be heard. Not even a stray rodent to rush away in panic at the first sign of human life.* - Fri Nov 27 01:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Necromanceress(Gamuhz2) ||
The barrier seemed to be resistant. 

As the two make contact, their flesh would begin to sizzle -- giving light burns. Although it could get worse with continued in exposure. Of course, had they desired to endure the pain, both could eventually move through the gaseous barrier. 

However, despite the oxygen-like state, it was still very much susceptible to strikes. Be it physical, or spiritual, with the latter being effective. However they did it, both Mirai and Kanasari would find themselves moving beyond the barrier and beginning to tackle the root of the issue. Beyond the ethereal wall was yet another opening -- but this time things seemed different.

The second both had made it through, screams could be heard, albeit muffled. At the epic centre of the room was a cloaked figure, adorn in black cloth from head to toe. It made it difficult to detail just who or what was hidden behind the spooky cloth. 

Seals on the wall in the aforementioned rooms began to glow, forcing the flowing waste to bubble even hard. The temperature took a stark incline, and the stench intensified as well. 

"Well. . . Someone finally found me? Tch. . . I blame that Edge fellow for makintg such a ruckus. Didn't actually anticipate any to really come snooping. Bah. . " It was a clear feminine voice. Dark energy exerted from the figure's form, the density and strength was enough to give tremor-like symptoms along the ground. The flooring was clearly cracking as well, forcing some of the nasty liquids to seep through the cracks.* - Fri Nov 27 01:53:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Necromanceress(Gamuhz2) chortled at the rude comments.

"A fiesty one. . This is both pleasing -- and irritating. Tell me, will you speak in the same manner once you're captured? Or how about when I'm picking at your soul with my mana? . . . Doing such tends to eliminate any defiance in most my captives," the Necromanceress retorts with a devilish grin. Oddly, she doesn't bother to turn or face either of the parties.

Dark energy floods through her veins, before summoning a staff out of thin-air. It's made of crystalline material, dark orchid in terms of tint.

She taps the magical tool against the ground, sending yet another massive surge of mana energy.The ground continued to shake and crumble, the overall flow enough to completely oblierate a bigger portion of the flooring. The sealing glyphs that were seen beforehand continue to glow, before the a ray of energy explodes from the written symbols.

Given the Necromancer's outpour, a wave of energy eventually swept over the area, pulsating and aiming to push back the two kunoichi that served as street. The continued implosion damages the infrastructure more and more, but importantly. . . a creature is spawned beneath the surface, likely out of the view of the two beauties.

". . .I suppose I can play with you for now, since it has to come to it." 

With Mirai's Byakugan, she'd probably be able to read chakra beyond the walls in the caverns -- which were hollowed. Like cacoons, various citizens were stored inside, being fed or mutated with dark magic.* - Fri Nov 27 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Necromanceress(Gamuhz2) ||

The rumbling ground served a purpose.

Unbeknowst to the women, a creature still swammed in the disgusting swamp of waste. It was a slime creature, a mutated version of the traditional Gulam  Jamun. Albeit, the woman wasn't too proficient in the usage of dark summonings, thus the demon was a tad bit weaker than you could anticipate. 

Gulab Jamun is a grotesque blob of disgusting materials.  It is difficult to pierce Gulab Jamun and he doesn't seem to have any organs to target.  From its body, large slimy and stick brown tentacles can emerge to harass the opponent and even maim them, as spikes can be grown from the ends of the tentacles. Each layer of skin was slimey, and seem to have a musky scent clinging to its flesh.

Base Stat: 10
Attack Speed: 13
-- Five Tentacles, each capable of spawning he spikes.

Two strands of tentacles juts out, sending ripples along the liquids along the ground -- that was filling the area more by the second. The target? Chikyu. They seek to grab the girl by the ankles and begin to pull her inward. 

"I suppose then. . I am your opponent? . . " Cue a small string of latin-esque incantations. A ray of dark energy moved through the air, aiming to surroundingt Mirai's body and incase her within a typical prison. This was dark magic, but the effects were still very much like a regular chakra barrier or other prison-based techniques. If the rays could be evaded, than she'd certainly be able to avoid being imprisoned.

* - Fri Nov 27 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Necromanceress(Gamuhz2) whispers: (Paine. U guys done - Fri Nov 27 03:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Necromanceress(Gamuhz2) ||

Lazily, the staff is continuous manuevered along the air, as more spells are chanted. Dark purple energy sparked from the magical staff,  and shot forward -- this time being far more swift than the last.

Each spark of energy seemed to take the shaping of a regular kunai. Subtly, the Necromanceress held the ability to manipulate the constructions as they were airbourne, although the control wasn't absolute.  They beeline, intent on striking Mirai's shoulder and ribs. Non-lethal areas, as the intent was to capture and perhaps torture.

Meanwhile, Chikyu has mild success.

The swing is capable of cutting through the bulk of the slimey tentacle.s But just  like that, the Gulab was using it's gelatin-like body to grow more, and thus keep the pressure up. Before long, the demonic entity had suddenly emerged, bursting through the surface like a missile. The water quaked, and the ground was ruptured even further, revealing the gargantuan entity. 

It stood at just a bit over twenty feet, and save for the grime, held a translucent body. The creature howled, and as it's voice box is flexed, toxic liquids are spewed out. The solution holds somewhat corrosive effects, and could numb any body part afflicted.* - Fri Nov 27 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Necromanceress(Gamuhz2) ||
The solution that Chikyu had to endure would give mild burns.

The numbing effects seemed to have been intensifying from the start as well,  slowly but surely working to paralyze whatever portion of the body had been struck. This'll take some time however -- roughly seven turns if the battle lasts long enough.

Naturally, as a mindless beast, it pays no mind to the ensemble of handseals, figuring it to be nothing more than jittery nerves. The gelatin tentancles from before whip forward, intent on making it beyond the teen's armor, and of course striking flesh. Spikes protruded as well. Hit or miss, three more tentacles follow shortly after, aiming to make evasion as difficult as possible. . !

--- 
And then Mirai went ham!

Already, the Necromanceress was well within the Hokuma's circle. The invisible trigram was layered onto the ground just as her opponent had danced around the spikes. ". . .!" With wide eyes, the dark magic user is nearly helpless as Mirai's viciously swift hands moved. 

She'd find that the Necromancer didn't quite have the conventional reserves, but the strikes hurted all the same. Twenty of the '64' palms manage to hit their mark, each one faster than the last. But of course, the demon summoner wasn't going to go out without a fight. By this point, she had realized just how fucked she was.

Her insides were hurting, and some blood trickled out of her lips. With a stunned expression, a particularly interesting spell is employed, requiring just about no handseals, incantations, or movements. Indeed, energy pooled together around the woman's pupils, before being released in a single, swift concussive blast. The blow arms to rush forward, striking Mirai along the chest.

If hit? She;'d be pretty banged up as the explosion is unleashed. It held enough concussive force to send the dainty figure flying, and of course to burn through any protective gear, and burning flesh! 

Did it work? Assuming it had, the Necromancer takes a step back, breathing heavy and exhausted. Her form proceeds to levitate into the air at a moderate pace, as being airbourne could aid in her endeavors..* - Fri Nov 27 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Necromanceress(Gamuhz2) ||
Sanoke was chilling in the mansion.

Had the mission gone well? "Paine! Good work, these materials will greatly aid Sunagakure's growth. Momura, and those other two, good too!"* - Fri Nov 27 04:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Necromanceress(Gamuhz2) ||
Boom!

The cieling was crumbling with a single hit, forcing some of the debris to be caved in onto the  mutated Galub! Of course, the creature displays more of its ability, allowing the density of his phisology to shift.

The rocks would fall inward, filling it's contents and being grinded up. The creature possessed no actual organs, although the epic center held a concentrated mass of densified jelly. The relevance? Not quite known just yet. Still, there's excessive debris falling over the area, prompting the creature to liquidy, squeezing the cracks and continuing in stride.

It aimed to envelop Chikyu's entire body with the slime to reform and bind. Hit or miss, the reformation is something that's a bit difficult, as evident by the demon's quivering form, and hesistance to move immediately after. Would that be an opportune time to strike?!

"GRAAHH!"

------

Mirai is hit dead on with the blow, sending her skidding back much to the Necromanceress' delight. "That should learn you! Oh. . I'm going to really love prodding and turning you into a pet. . . Mmm, what will be your demon name?---" Of course, things stil don't go as planned, as the Hokuma displays a bit of ability to engage in combat even at long-ranged. Naturally, the Necromancer's nimble form allows her to evade a direct hit, although her leg was likely to be caught in the effort.

The staff is dematerialized, and reformed, this time as gauntlets. 

Having recustomized the magically enhanced weapon, the Necromancer's hand cup together, generating a dense amassment of dark energy. It builds up surprisingly quickly, into the shape of a perfect sphere. In no time, the spell is launched ahead, intent on slamming and rocking Mirai's form. 

"--God damn it! . . .This better work," the sorceress muttered audibly as the chaotic sphere moved ahead.* - Fri Nov 27 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Necromanceress(Gamuhz2) ||
The cut went through, of course.

It slams right into the base of the Gulab's body, cutting a thick hole. Some of the more liquidifed jell seeped out -- but just the same, it's body is being stitched together.

Although, it's ability to stitch itself wasn't instant and took legitimate time. Clearly, to win the battle, you had to overwhelm the demon with offense. But with the two split up -- could Chikyu manage on her on?* - Fri Nov 27 05:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Necromanceress(Gamuhz2) ||

Clearly. .. The body heals slower than the tentacles, of course.* - Fri Nov 27 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Necromanceress(Gamuhz2) ||
Fucking clones!

Of course, the combined effort of the multiple spinning Hokumas is enough to deter the incoming blow. Like a time bomb, it combusted, releasing a giant, overwhelming explosion. The strength was so vast that it spawned a massive gale over the area. The currents sweep, spawning waves of dirty residue.

This probably gets rid of the clones but leaves her susceptible to the rest of the hair binding.

Still, the necromanceress is giving up without a fight. Another explosion is released, this time at close range to go against the Hairing Binding -- but likely to no avail. Some hair probably was to be destroyed, but i nthe end, all she's doing is hurting herself and leaving her own form damaged and tattered. Successfully, the demon summoner is binded! "UGHH! LET ME GO!" howled the witch in protest.
---------------------------------
Chikyu still fights admirably and can keep the beast at bay. 

Her magnificient sword swings go a long way, slashing through more of the gelatin flesh --  but each time missing the core given the demon's gargantuan size. It howled, not quite feeling pain, but still being irritated that a meal refused to stay put!

Each time, more of it's body is cut off and seeps into the depth of the sewers, mixing in with the biles. But the creature refuses to be put to rest. . .

Seeing Chikyu's exhaustion, the Gulab ceased in it's attempt to assilimate her into its body. The regrown tentacles slip underneath the waterways, creeping below the surface and out of view. If Chikyu couldn't be defeated conventionally, maybe she could be drowned?

Feigning an advance, the creature steps forward in hopes of distracting the sword woman. But just as it's moving, the appendages creep up from behind -- or at least tries- and aims to latch onto the ankles once more. The second contact had been made, there's a tug, intent on disrupting the Suimen and bring the teen down for a ride.* - Fri Nov 27 05:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Necromanceress(Gamuhz2) ||
BOOM!

Talk about over kill. . The force of the hair binding is enough to leave a crater on the ground, sending the Necromanceress into a state of unconscious. 

"GRAAH!" The Slime demon howled in rage, and rushed forward now that Kasanari was finally bond! The gelatin body manages to seep over her face, prepared to assimilate her. . ! Until the connection between it and the spirit was finally being ended.

It's body quivered, before being reduced to sludge. It trickled forward, falling into the pit and dissipating back to it's own realm of origin. The flooring was still unstable, and cracks were evident along the walls -- but things weren't exactly going to collapse on itself. 

The muffled screams finally can be heard as the chaotic fight had been ended. All of the citizens captured probably were casually going to be located with just a brief search, Byakugan or not.* - Fri Nov 27 05:48:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) taps his hands along the table casually as the crowd continues to spill in.

The turtle-shell bearing warrior stood up, and gave a wave to the gathering, a slight smirk on his body. "Things have been going well in Sunagakure! So far, we've managed to gather up all of the body and have them made presentable. Mass funerals are planned to be held in about three days [OOC Tomorrow]." He paused, giving a gander to the crowd that was probably still hurting.

"In addition, I want to announce that as Hassan wished, the chunnin exams will continue as planned. I'll host registrations around the same time tomorrow, once our fallen comrades have been mourned."

After a few more momentary pauses, a hand gestures to the crowd. "So. DOes anyone have anything they want to say or add? I'm all ears if you have suggestions on how to aid Sunagakure's conditions, or ideas you want to see employed as the village recovers."* - Fri Nov 27 06:26:08 2015

He smirks. "I'd like to announce we'll be hosting a ceremony in his honor. Even as a knuckle-headed child. . .One that may not completely have control overh is power -- he's shown exempli. . . Good qualities that I look for in a shinobi! Given his young age, I won't promote him to Jounin. But be alert, he'll be promoted to Tobeketsu Jounin in a few day's time."

He had more to say -- but figured it was best to stop for now.

"--Well, one last thing. I want to mark down Sunagakure's victory as a national holiday. So we can remember the people that fought to keep this great nation standing. For now, however, that'll be all. We can discuss more later once the events are handled."
