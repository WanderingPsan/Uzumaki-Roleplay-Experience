<br><br><font color=yellow>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) looked on strangely.

He's also confused. . "Alright, answer me this. Do you want me to stay or go?"* - Mon Nov 30 06:58:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) pushes the turtle forward.

"You can communicate with me through this. I'll give you time to calm down. Hopefully Chikyu can help with that."

A nod is given to Gono -- the turtle -- and if not interrupt, in ten seconds Sanoke disappears in a plume of smoke. Oddly, his body didn't move. He was essentially teleported.* - Mon Nov 30 07:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I don't want your turtle. - Mon Nov 30 07:00:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) says: <*If not stopped, he's gone off to the Oasis for training*> - Mon Nov 30 07:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) ||
Poof! 

More chakra-based residue flowed, clouding his apperance and of course making it impossible to immediately see beyond the distance. Naturally, as the smoke cleared, Sanoke wore a simper, finally able to get a good view at the luscious environment of the infamous Turtle Oasis. "Geez. . . She gets angry at me a lot. Best if I let her cool off. . . And focus moreso --"

". . .Quit talkin' to yer self! It's been a long time, Sanoke boy. . .! Are you finally here to begin training for real?! Also, put on that damn shell!" The reptilian that spoke was none other than the shinobi's old master, Mr.Genbi. The turtle leapt, pressing a hand onto the Interim Kazekage's back, and of course summoning an especially heavy Turtle Shell onto his frame. It was particularly dense, and forced Sanoke's knees to buckle.

"G-Gah. . . As flamboyant as ever. . .But yes, I came to get stronger! I need to further along with my training if I want to reach the mountain top! But I know. . . what I can do now, it probably ain't enough. . . "

Indeed, Sanoke had gotten very lazy. And thus, it was time to kick his training in over drive. The turtles of the illustrious cove held a secret cave, one that could alter Sanoke's perception of time -- and thus make days seem like weeks. . Or the opposite of such. It was this instrument that he intended to utilize in order to rapidly improve with his own skills.

Albeit. . . just like the abuse of shadow clones, doing such held drawbacks -- which would be immense mental strain. For the next week or two, the would-be sennin was put through rigorous exercise to enhance his abilities to summon creatures or other items from the Chelonian-dominated kingdom. The process beckoned for him to be more capable of drawing out a large amount of chakra, and of course putting it forth to one uniformed place in space.

Naturally, the staggering requirements in addition to the strain from the time-cave left Sanoke under a great deal of stress. But as it came to be, he gradually grew more proficient, particularly once the summoning in question -- Ganatora -- came about, and provided tips. Time and time again, the male reattempts the space-time ninjutsu, and on what could be called the 1000th attempt, a massive monstrosity finally is brought to life!

Sanoke subsequently exits the cave, and is greeted by a half-sleeping Genbi. "Huh? Ya finally did it. . .?! -- Good. It only took you eight hours!! Although, I bet it felt more like a eight das to you, huh? We're not done, though. .  Since you seem to still struggle with the basic principles. But for now, get on out."

Fatigued, the boy hardly utters a word. He just nods breathlessly. Genbi gives the orders, and before long, the stand-in Kazekage is reverse summoned right back to Sunagakure. Abruptly, a symbol appears along the ground, teleporting the youth violently. He stumbles onto the table, eye setting onto Mirai?

Or was she just now arriving?* - Mon Nov 30 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: ... - Mon Nov 30 09:50:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) exhales. He's clearly a little tired, with beads of sweat running down his forehead. A slight musk persisting.

"Huh?-- Oh, you actually came to see me." Despite the fatigue, Sanoke seems able to gain some pep to his step, easily closing the distance between himself and the Hokuma. 

"How are ya?"* - Mon Nov 30 09:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I didn't come to see you. - Mon Nov 30 09:53:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) perked a brow.

He starts from the bottom.

"The lowest mark proved to be Kuro, with a score of three. Given his crappy showing in the written exam, this means he's no longer even eligible to advance to stage three. He taps out at a total of eight points!"

Sanoke pauses, before continuing with his announcements.

"Next! Hideo also falls short of glory! He scores a meager score of five overall! However, he'sstill in the running, with a total score of of 13!"

Looking down the list, Sanoke continues. "Paine, while fighting admirably. . Just falls short of glory as well. She scores a seven, just short of being eligible to advance to the next round!" After some thought, the Kazekage continued to look on, his eyes now falling onto Momura's. "Then comes Momura with a score of six! She remains in the running. . .Capping out the efforts are Izanami and Ai! Izanami with a grand total of nine! And Ai, with nine-point-five! Excellent, ladies!"* - Tue Dec  1 01:21:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) didn't exactly resist.

His ears perked up at the mention of a 'Maid Cafe.' Naturally, the habitually air-headed Kazekage wasn't quite knowledge-able of what the proposal entailed. Shaded eyes gaze over to the sheet that the clumsy teenager hastily proceeded to remove --

At the sight of Chikyu's skirt ruffling up, Sanoke reacts as you'd expect. With reddened cheeks, a hand moving to cover his noses, eyes averting briefly. 

". . .It could be good for business. . Hrm . . .!" The whispers serve as further enticement, forcing the lad to don a cheeky grin. "I like the idea! -- But most importantly. . . What food will they serve?"* - Tue Dec  1 02:51:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) 's smile widened.

Although, this was tamed. He liked the idea, even if he'd never personally be able to indulge in the lavish style given his engagement! "I like the idea. You can put together some plans, and present it to me. Like . . .Building location and so forth," the Kazekage replied with a clear nod. 

A hand goes, patting the girl on the shoulder. "Good work, though. It seems like a splendid way to attract more tourists."* - Tue Dec  1 03:03:02 2015
