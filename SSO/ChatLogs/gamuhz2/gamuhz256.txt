The goal will be to protect your base, while capturing the enemy's."

A simple, no?

With that, Sanoke magically unseals sixscrolls, each one with the participant's name written along it.It's specifically rigged to detonate if open. 

"Do not open these. These are special scrolls that you are to protect. If you're captured, your opponents can take it to add onto their score total, while also subtracting the overall points you can obtain. The more you capture, the better. And what more, it lowers your opponent's chance to advance."

Towards the south of the village? Massive constructs can be seen, clearly erected thanks to the application of Doton ninjutsu.

Before they could enter, towards the side is a load of supplies for the taken. Weapons, scrolls, clothes, and even food -- but oddly no water. "You can restock here. Everyone will go through a strip searching, and have their scrolls taken. You have an hour to make sure you got everything you need. "

He gives a glance. 

"Your only supply of water will be oasis we crafted personally. Team Mip, you're the team with the blue flag, west of here. Team. . Uh. . The other one, you have the base with the red flag. Use the environment accordingly. The examination is meant to last a maximum of three days. If it ends sooner? So be it."

-Scorpion-

Base Stat: 12
Reflex: 14
Dura/Nin: 15

Ability: Holds poisonous venom that can be secrated from it's tail, or fangs. Striking anyone with it reduces their reflex/speed/attackspeed by 3. For every five turns, the process repeats itself.

If not treated by the end of the day, paralysis will be induced. It persists for about 12 IC hours.


- Sandworm -

Base stat: 12
Reflex: 16
Dura/Nindef: 10

Ability: Can release acid residue from it's maw, as well through it's pores. Does seven damage indiscriminantly -- meaning ignoring defenses. 

Both creatures are fairly large. About the size of a house. Both can burrow underground and blend in with the environment.* - Mon Nov 30 01:30:27 2015

And the long day had come to an end.

The sun was setting, and from the looks of things, Team Ai was doing far more efficiently than the opposition. Sanoke had clearly seen the binded Paine.

With a quick burst of speed, the male flickers into view, inbetween all of the chaos!

"Enough! Things are going poorly. Hideo is unable to continue battle, Paine is out of commission! I'm calling the match in. Everyone line!" Alarms are fired off, along with flare signals. Each of the combating genins are called front in center to be evaluated.* - Mon Nov 30 05:20:51 2015

It appeared no one had successfully captured anyones scroll. Sanoke was visibly seen scribbling down, jotting down various notes of what he personally observed, as well as what was viewed with his summons.

"I can visibly see who were the stars of each team. Many of you were extraordinary, some. . average, and others lackluster. Still, your scores will be distributed accordingly -- in the following days. Some may find that they have nearly enough points to graduate as is. Others? Will probably need to work -very- hard for the third portion of the chunnin exams."

With that, Sanoke dismisses them all. They had worked well.
