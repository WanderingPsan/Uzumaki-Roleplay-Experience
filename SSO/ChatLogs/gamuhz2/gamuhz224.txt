<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) grabs Shin and speeds on off to the local training area.

He plants his feet onto the ground, a giant grin being worn. "Alright. . Let's rock!" He gives Shin the first move to go.

"-- On as side note, if you even need training or somethin', let me know. I know some Fuuinjutsu and shit."* - Mon Oct 19 17:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Hmmm, okay. - Mon Oct 19 17:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blinks!

He had anticipated moreso of a fight based solely on Genjutsu -- ala Itachi v Sasuke. But alas, it seemed that Shin had some other ideas. With a slick grin, the shinobi kicks off, his body breaking off into whisk -- with only the colors that he typically wore being usable. ". . Katon elementalist. .. Fuuinjutsu. . .Genjutsu? This guy has it all," remarked the speedy, turtle summoner.

Kicking into the air, the Snake handsign is formed simultaneously, allowing mud to speedily develop. It shoots from the ground, it's thick, brown substance rushing to dose the incoming flames and thus make the battle remain stationary. 

In the event that the  fire had been dealt with, Sanoke would have been upon Shin in no time. His right hand was already cocked back, and juts forward, aiming to slam right into the cheek. 'Course, despite his impressive taijutsu prowess, the shinobi lacked much physical strength. It wasn't going to be boneshattering sure enough, but perhaps had the strength to send the genjutsu-minded warrior skidding. * - Mon Oct 19 17:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Combined - Mon Oct 19 18:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||The shinobi in question was pretty clever.

At the last second, the right handed punch lands, ramming against Shin's cheek, and sending the boy skidding along the sand surface. It likely even left a bruise.

Nevertheless, that closeness was all that Shin required to cast his illusion. The area morphed -- and like any sensible person, rather than automatically assuming something strange to be a genjutsu, he was fully in the belief that this was an actual ninjutsu.

The ground doesn't sink into quicksand. Rather, the ground heated up, giving the impression that the sun rays had finally picked up in intensity. Fully believing that the ground was now gaining oven-like qualities, Sanoke leaps into the skies, forming a seal to unleash a plume of smoke. As it clears, his typical reptilian had been conjured -- Ganba. He's hidden within his shell, and wserves as a platform.

"What a jutsu. . "* - Mon Oct 19 18:57:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Cue a long winded battle.

Time and time again, Sanoke would find himself riddled or held back by an assortment of genjutsus. The constant assaults would have been enough to wear him down mentally, before alas. ..  The summoner opts to throw in the towel. After all, even if he could have summoned clones or turtles to aid, the battle was just an expedition.

Sitting down, Sanoke exhales.

". . Yoo, good fight. You got a bunch of genjutsus, that's for sure. I need to work on my genjutsu resistance a little more," the teen admits, laughing sheepishly.

It was true, as the battle wore on, the boy found himself aiming to return the favor. Chakra seeped through the air, attacking Shin's own circulatory and inflicting illusions himself. Albeit, the more veteran and experienced practitioner in illusions was able to repel it with ease. Scratching his head, the snow-haired warrior simply smiles, taking the loss in stride.* - Mon Oct 19 20:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shrugs.

He would raise from the ground, shaking off the excessive sand that clung to his form. There was a subtle headache worn all the same.

"Hrm. . ? Well. . I'm not really a shinobi anymore. But when I was a kid, I wanted to be Mizukage. Y'know, to have the village admire me. Have all the chicks thirst for me, have all the men be jealous of me," Sanoke admits, wearing a slick grin.

"But I ain't a shinobi no more. Im a traveler. My goal now? Is to complete my training and become a true hermit! It's hard, though," the teen continued, his eyes suggesting complete genuity, and innocence. "Why do you ask? -- And what is your goal as a shinobi?"* - Mon Oct 19 20:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) chuckled, finding the entire plan or notion to be noble. A right handed thumbs up juts right on up, and the grin widen. "That's a noble goal. . But man. Believe me when I tell you, there's an entirely different realm of chakra or power that you can't even imagine. Good luck, maybe one day you and I wi.ll be able to experience that strength," the former chunnin stated with a nod -- he references the teachings of his Master Genbi.

To be a hermit wasn't simply a title after all.

"Anywho. . <*coughs*> Can ya teach me a new genjutsu?!" He was clearly eager to learn.* - Mon Oct 19 20:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Sure, I'll teach you a more offensive  - Mon Oct 19 20:33:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: . . . - Mon Oct 19 20:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Even as he was told specifically that this was an illusion, Sanoke's mind 5registered the change in the atmosphere as completely real.

In time, the dark was darkening, and a massive sphere of fire was suddenly descending onto the floor. The fire ball, from head to toe, was convincing, and certainly gave off the conditions of sensations you would expect. Heat waves lingered from the falsely spawned object, so severe that the energy distorted vision and made it appear as if the fabric of space and time was legitimately being ruptured.

The summoner's eyes remained enarmored at the sight.

His heart was racing, and sweat tingled from his pores -- making it evident that Sano's body truthfully believed itself to be in danger. Shaking, yet not willing to run, Sanoke looked ahead, his eyes scanning for even the smallest details that could denote this as an illusion. "This is-- No. He's fuckin' with me. . This is an actual Katon technique. . . Just trying to get me --" And soon, the fire just kept descending, forcing him into an even more profound state of shock.

Swiftly, a Kunai knife is produced, and it literally goes to stab himself in the hand, breaking him from the fake realm. Exhaling, Sanoke looked, soon smirking with content. "Not bad. . . Let's me try!"

Of course, it's to be assumed that Shin properly explains every detail of the genjutsu. Like a sponge, the information is absorbed, and retained within the depths of his mind. Working on the information given, it's clear that has to target two main basic senses -- the sense of Sight, and the Sense of feeling. Quickly, working on the seals, chakra siphons through the skies, and latch onto Shin's circulatory system.

Immediately, the area morphs, prompting a stream of fire to manifest. Although, he has clear issues, mostly in the presentation of the inferno. In addition to this, the flames lacked heat, denoting it's existence as a mere facade.* - Mon Oct 19 21:03:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Welp.

Given the sudden downtime, Sanoke relents, and opts to work on his various Doton Release techniques, all with the hopes of being proficient enough to use each skill regularly in battle. As it stood now, the B-ranks that were foolishly taught to him would be difficult to pull off-- mainly because of Sanoke's less than stellar chakra reserves.

Regardless, the chunnin was adamant in refining his skillset -- particularly with the Earthen Corridor technique.

Immediately, his chakra flared, forming a thin viel around his body. At once, the chakra flowing is manipuated thoroughly, subsequently being shifted into the elemental nature type of Doton. In no time, all the flowing energy only has one clear destination-- and that's the floor itself. In time, the chakra converges, gifting the typically reserved or motionless ground with some of Sanoke's will or consciousness.

Thus, the beginnings of the elemental technique is to start. As usual, considering his lack of skill or expertise when it came to utilizing anything elemental, Sanoke visibly struggles. The chakra tries it's hardest, barely acapable in forcing even the slightest of movements. Sweat runs from his forehead, as his brain overheats due to the intense cognitive working -- Yet the boy never ceases in his endeavors. With the pain came pleasure -- the bulk of which was in his soul, as it churned and burn passionately, resisting his physical body's beg for rest.

The flooring-- that comprised of entirely sand -- proceeded to shift as well. In term, from these grains, the earth clumped together, seamlessly spawning solid rocks. . Albeit, it wasn't as compact or condensed as actual, naturally spawned sandstones. Why? Simple. Doing so at this stage or point would make it more difficult to form the rest of the corridor. 

Wasting no time, Sanoke moves ahead, forcing the clumped earth formations to commune, and craft even larger, more magnificient objects. In no time, it rises up, only capable of forming a semi-circular construction. The signs of the arrival is clear, as the sand below gains profound lumps, before rocks are seen rising. The loose bits of sand that clunged to the formation's form proceeded to cascade down, falling onto the floor like little dried droplets. 

In a minute's time, Sanoke had completely his jutsu. Yet. . . There remained clear issues. Most notably in the density and sturdiness. This wasn't a corridor spawned by a master, that was for sure. This was one made bny a raw rookie -- albeit one with great potential.* - Mon Oct 19 23:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) thinks: Besides addiction sometimes.... - Mon Oct 19 23:23:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) continued with his training efforts.

The ground shook and was thrashed around, each second forcing tremors and shockwaves to resonate through the training field. For all of his shortcomings, be it the lack of spiritual reserves, low talent in elemental release -- Sanoke excelled in one facet. Will power, unrelenting. . . uncompromising willpower!

It was one of the core principles instilled to him by histeachers, and thus the shinobi -- or ex-shinobi -- would never faulter nor relent in its usage.

Again, a single seal is pressed together, allowing the Doton release energy to flow around with no restraint. Just as with the last time, the chakra settles onto the floor, manipulating the sand grains, forcing them to clump together and form several sand stones. As the build up grows significant enough, the stones from different portions are binding up as well, crafting amazing constructions -- spawned solely from Sanoke's will.

His eyes shut briefly, blocking off any worldly distractions -- as commonly done when performing spiritually-based training. It was a lesson taught to him long ago, and not once was were the results proven to be any less than accurate. Considering the state, the teenager can more easily become intune with his spiritual might, and thus manipulate the ground at a great capacity.

The sequence is anything but swift, as he has nothing but time. Again and again, the rocks along the ground continue to bind with one another, before alas, Sanoke shapes it into a circular dome. Albeit, there was no roofing or anything spawned, as having a complete structure took far too much effort or energy.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Tirelessly, Sanoke sought to speed up on his training.

The mastery of these elemental techniques would allow his overall skillset to improve be leaps and bounds. Once more, his hands clap together, forming the all-too-familiar 'Snake' handseal. This hand sign, as most would know, is one that's commonly associated with the Doton affinty.

The floor shock, in stark protest to his flow of energy. Instead of resisting, however, the floor is shifted, turning into thick mud. Immediately afterwards, Sanoke takes a stance, his fingers breaking off and forming three unique, differnt hand formations. The changes in hand signs allow for specific manipulation of one's chakra.

Quickly, the mud takes form, gaining the head or shaping of a common dragon. From it's maw, dense cannon balls shoot out, each one slamming against the floor weakly. It doesn't take much for the boy to see the clear issues, and thus proceed with a new planning process. He falls into a kneel, both hands still pressed together, and thus allowing for more mud to be pumped from seemingly nowhere.

"Alright. . .So far so good. Just have to work on my shape manipulation. That way I can produce the intricate shape in a much faster or seamless manner. Easier said than done.  . . I have to get my mind clear, and make my will unwilling to compromise. . ."

Again, the ground roars and crumbles, but alas it doesn't shift or change. After two minutes, another head begins to rise -- but it falls prematurely.* - Tue Oct 20 00:46:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||The mud around the area continued to boil. It was preparing to take shape once more -- that is until a familiar face arrived. Speedily, Sanoke rushed through the area, tossing an arm over Beth's shoulder. "You, Hasso. What's up? I've gotten good--" Then he realizes he was in the public square. Leeches galore. A hand motions for the turtle wearing, andrognyous fellow to follow closely behind.* - Tue Oct 20 00:51:37 2015

For good reason too -- Had he spoke of his tutelage in that area, soon after. . .There was sure to be heaps of other hopefully, leeching shinobi bombarding Beth in order to accumulate additional skills. Arms folded, Sanoke's stereotypical grin manifests, and it seems particularly more powerful or potent than normal.

Surely, the boy was in a good mood.

"Alright! I've gotten pretty decent at that genjutsu ya showed me. I even picked up and learned a 'Fire Genjutsu' myself! Is there anythin' else you can help me with with?"* - Tue Oct 20 00:55:53 2015

"I'll show ya better than I can tell ya," the boy mischeviiously remarks to himself, channeling his inner prankster.

"Hrm? Uh. . . Can't really show ya. It'd be too obvious," Sanoke muttered. Yet little did Beth know, energy flowed from his hands already, and aimed to be planted within her brain, along the chakra circulatory system. All that needed to be done was ensure that the young genjutsu specialist had seen the trigger actually be in place.

Assuming it had, the real fun began. From the ground, flames sparked up, engulfing her lower body. It was authentic. . . apparently. The wind howled, and abruptly was spurred in a corresponding direction, moving in unison with the flames. And there were defininite heat waves -- Alas, the fire lacked any real burning sensations, since that would be pretty sadistic.* - Tue Oct 20 01:07:50 2015

"Wow, really? I know you're really good at genjutsu! So that much mean a lot ! -- Yo, come to think of it. I've never really seen anyone do solely genjutsu. It's too limiting," He says with wide-eyes. THe shinobi crouched, taking a brief moment of rest after the admittedly hard-to-use genjutsu. It still wasn't really his forte to be frank.* - Tue Oct 20 01:16:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) points!

"Alright. These are the rules, though. . "

He bites his thumb, drawing blood. A hand presses onto the ground after five seals, releasing a large sealing glyph onto the floor. As it spreads, a singular turtle is summoned, with a single scroll on it's maw. Quickly, Sanoke grabs it, and unravels the contents.

The entire scroll is revealed to be another but signed entries, with Sanoke's name being at the bottom.

"I'm the last person to sign, and the defacto human leader. I'm going to let you sign this, and thus give you the ability to contract the baby turtles. Albeit, it'll be up to you to develop further. If I get good reports -- since it's really up to them to see if you're fit -- I'll help you develop further." SAnoke explains, sliding the item over. It was his contract to control, after all.

"You sign it with your blood."* - Tue Oct 20 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Okay. - Tue Oct 20 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) takes the scroll back.

Once in place, he sets it into the turtle's mouth, and has it's de-summoned. That way, the sacred object could forever be protected within the confined of Kame Cove.

"Hrm . . ? Two sweet techniques? Hells yeah. Let's do this!" Sanoke says, feeling that each skill granted to him would be more that was going to be able to save his life in the future.* - Tue Oct 20 01:41:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||The entire act was rejuvenating. Once in range, energy seemed to be flow from Beth's form, and latch onto his own body. The entire act was like nothing Sanoke had ever seen, as the different signals emitting from her chakra was transformed, and grew correspondant with his own.

In time, the slight lack of energy that his body was experience quickly drifts away as it's suddenly revitalized!

"Yo! That jutsu is amazing!"* - Tue Oct 20 02:02:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) doesn't notice a damn thing.

He continues to stare on with a blank or n eutral expression, as if waiting for something cool or exciting to be performed. "Hrm. . .? What you doing? I know I look good, but this is pretty odd, Sensei," Sanoke remarks.* - Tue Oct 20 02:47:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Wasting no time, Sanoke proceeds to get on with reading his books. There were two scrolls -- one on Interrogation Jutsu, while the other remained about the simple technique, Chakra Tranfer. After some thought, the male proceeds to read the contents, starting with the former.

It holds a wealth of information.

Typically, the information identifies as genjutsu, and thus Sanoke already has a clear idea of where the jutsu is going. After reading the small tidbits of information, Sanoke's eyes fall back onto the diagram, which properly detail how to insert chakra into the target's brain, to destroy their will. It was dubbed 'interrogation' as your victim would no longer be able to give false information.

"I see. . .I think I know how to do this jutsu."

It paid to be a genius.* - Tue Oct 20 02:54:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Once Beth had gone off, Sanoke resumed with his training, this time focusing on the mastery of his next technique -- Chakra Transfer. While not offensive or defensive potent, the technique has it's uses. Eager to advance his own skillset, Sanoke greedily begins to read the scroll and it's contents.

'Chakra Transfer is a skill that combines the ability to read one's chakra, and one's control. Overall, the application is simple -- at least in explanation. The user must casually build up energy, before at last flowing it into the desired target. As the energy flows, the user has to read the source, while manipulating their own current of chakra to be correspondant.'

And by that explanation, using the jutsu must have been criminally easy, no? And yet, it was much harder than you could ever dream. Quickly, chakra flows around his form, enough that a silhouette of blue around -- clearly at that. A hand juts forward, and thus the chakra leaps from his body, and flows to an undesignated area.

Considering there was no actual person to practice on, sadly enough. . . Things didn't go as smoothly as you'd think. As the power courses through, it begins to fizzle or distorts before it can raech the desired spot. Grunting through hte process, SAnoke aims to keep his flow going -- albeit with futility. Working up a sweat, the boy falls to a single knee, unable to keep his act going on for too long. "A lot harder than I thought. . ."

The teen pondered. Eventually, both knees fold over one another, allowing for the flow of energy to stabalize. He inhales and exhales, and seemingly is in high spirits.* - Tue Oct 20 03:24:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) wasn't surprised.

"Oh. You guys eyes just like my girlfriend. You're one of those. . Hokuma fellas?"* - Tue Oct 20 03:30:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) thinks: What a weird name - Tue Oct 20 03:30:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: Alright. - Tue Oct 20 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) was sitting on the floor indian style.

Chakra poured from his right hand, visibly in nature, and elegant in it's motions. The translucent appearance was slowly receding, as the thickness gain intensity. Casually, the flow of power rolled ahead, pressing against Arata's form, and perhaps rejuventating the boy should he been in need of extra energy.

"Hrm. . ? How goes the new jutsu, by the by? Ya learned it yet?" He notably doesn't ask if it's mastered or anything. After all, Sanoke doesn't expect nor anticipate Arata being some prodigal shinobi.

Nevertheless, that flow of energy abruptly comes to an end, as he's unable to keep the technique up for prolonged periods of time. A glance is given ahead, and the energies within Sanoke's internal workings continued to bubble over. It was time to build up his control.* - Tue Oct 20 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) 's looks on with a risen brow.

The jutsu was far from perfect, but the simple notion of a fledgeling shinobi comprehending and even being able to produce the mud from hiss maw that swift was surprise to the say the least. ". . What? that was pretty fast. You might be a smart one kid," Sanoke remarks, casually as the chakra in his body continued to knead and grow more powerful.

It prompts another viel of energy to go around his frame again, but that too quickly subsides.* - Tue Oct 20 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) continued with his processes, eventually switching up the script.

"I do plenty of things. Most of the stuff nowadays is hanging with my girl and her family. But back in the days I used to go around harrassing people and playing pranks. . "

Discreetly, her formed a seal or two -- to catch Arata within the trap.

On the inside, chakra continued to vibrate along his insides, each second allowing it to build up and grow more potent.Eventually, a large enough mass is developed, and invisibly to the naked eye, it flows, imparting itself through Arata's eyes and settling within his chakra circulatory system. Of course, this means that the male's brain is under attack.

Two specific feelings or sensations struck. One being the sense of sight, the other being the sense of feel. Just as Arata comes to sit, the ground shook -- at least to him. And no time at all, unavoidably, the ground's consistentcy took a change for the worse. It became a half mix of liquid and solid, quicksand at it's finest. Immediately, the male's foot would have been entrapped, and in a slow gradual pace, he was sinking below.

GivenSanoke's recent advancement in the art of illusionary-based ninjutsu, the facade is quite authentic. It felt and actually appeared to be quicksand randomly being developed.

"Mmm. What about you?" No mention is made of the quick sand, as if Sanoke hadn't seen it.* - Tue Oct 20 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) thinks: What the shit is this.. - Tue Oct 20 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He ensured that the genjutsu kept working to the maximum efficiency. The second Arata's worried expression crept up, the quicksand  subtly picks up in intensity and speed.

-- "Yo!" Sanoke roared, seemingly surprised by the natural phenomenon that had spawned seemingly out of nowhere.

"Dude! You're sinking! Grab on!" the teen declared, keeping his laughter only on the insides, as that would give away the entire trick. A hand extends, for Arata to grab and hopefully use as a leverage to pull himself out. "C'mon! These pesky quicksand pits!" SAnoke continued, his mind ensuring that the genjutsu remained in perfect place and harmony.

It took constant conscious effort to keep an illusion on-going after all.* - Tue Oct 20 04:09:36 2015
