Want to learn a jutsu first, or do we like hit the bar or whatever?" He asks, seemingly adamant on sating his boredom. For now, Mirai seemed like the best option to do so. Of course, they're still close by the general plaza, thus reaching any of the mentioned places wouldn't be a hard endeavor by any means.

"If you choose to learn a technique. I can teach ya either Genjutsu: Kai -- to break genjutsu. Or Shunshin, for fast movements."* - Fri Oct  2 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) stared back. Mirai's gaze. . . It was a tad bit unnerving, and further reminded him of the parallels between herself and his mother, as both were domineering -- and often time overbearing -- women. For a second, Sanoke freezes, but he manages to shake off the initial jitters. "Sounds good then. I'll teach ya, but promise me you'll at least try not go on a revenge filled rampage. It's okay to be angry, since y'know, the people in Kirigakure -- at least some -- treated your kind pretty poorly," he says, understanding the Hyuuga's turmoil.

Sanoke could easily relate, as he too was being hunted, simply for the power granted to him by fate. The thought was sickening, as it showed what mankind would truly do to obtain power. 

Putting those angsty feelings aside, he descends, aiming to get into a meditative stance. "Alright. Sit down then, and follow my instructions step by step. Since you're a beginner, I want you to form this seal," he articulates. His mitts come together, fingers interlocking and formulating the 'Ram' hand sign. "When you do this. . .Focus on your chakra. The trick of the jutsu is to manipulate your entire circulatory system at once. Slow all movement to a crawl, since when you're in a genjutsu, they're basically just infecting your system with their own chakra circulation. I'll teach ya the next step after you can do this," he replies, watching eagerly to see how talented Mirai proved to be.

"I'll be sensing, so go ahead."* - Fri Oct  2 22:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||"Ah. . .I guess it can't be helped," the shinobi mutters to himself quietly. He didnt' want to see Mirai move down a path of hatred, but at the very same time -- he could understand the frustration. It was only inconvenient that the very person behind the eye bounties was his master, Noriko. It'd be a lie to say Sanoke didn't hold a bit of fondess towards her. "Anywho. . .Keep at the process. . . I'll guide you through it." 

The summoner's 'sensing' was a bit conventional, considering it took use of the strange doujutsu that he had obtained randomly during travels. With this special eye technique, he's able to read Mirai's unique chakra system, and take note of any changes. From the beginnings, the Hyuuga's flow was leisure, calm and steady. . . But with the seal induced, the stream-like flow began to be disrupted, and was slowly losing the momentum normally found an in organism. "Keep at it. Imagine in your mind a flowing river -- That's what your circulatory system is. Using your brain power, will it to stop. Will your inside flow to be be stationary. It's this way so that any potential genjutsu has no other avenue to move," the teacher explains.

With continued investigation, it was beginning to feel as if Mirai had gotten the hang of it. Assuming she continued on her excellent path to learning the basic technique, Sanoke's mouth again opens, speaking additional instructions. "When you manage to freeze the chakra flow. The plan is simple. You shift attention to your brain, taking another quantity or gathering of chakra, and push it inward. It's to go in the opposite direction of your usual flow. With the secondary source, your system should be rebooted. Thus, in practice, you'll be able to release any genjutsu. . .Of course, this is just practice," he says with a devious grin.

His rinnegan-cladded eye continued to peer forward, although shielded by the sun glasses. Tirelessly, the teen observes, aiming to make sure that Mirai remained on the proper path. Although from the looks of it, she'd be able to perform the technique in no time.* - Fri Oct  2 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||After a few minutes of teaching, he leaves Mirai to work on her jutsu independently. After his body repositions, Sanoke's eyes fall shut, allowing his focus to be solely on his own chakra circulatory system. "Mmm. . . " hummed the former chunnin. His energies inside churned, raging inwardly like an angry storm. Eventually, there's a silhouette of chakra flowing from his form.

THere's deep meditation -- Up until Mirai speaks again. On cue, Sanoke's eyes shoot open.

"Good! Too bad I forgot I didn't learn any genjutsu yet, or I'd place you in one. For now, we wait. I'll have Yan test out your skill later," he says, leaping up, turtle shell and all. "Anywho, that's settled. What were we going to do after this again?"* - Sat Oct  3 00:11:05 2015

"Koji! What up, mate?"* - Sat Oct  3 00:14:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) would have trailed. He falls just behind the two Hyuugas, and gets back into an indian sitting position. "Yo, yo. Sorry to interrupt, but like. . . Do you guys got a surname?"* - Sat Oct  3 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) grins upon hearing the instructions. "I'll race ya, Mirai. . .!" proclaimed Sanoke, as he patted the shell on his back. This one seemed a bit more sturdy than the last, and far bulkier. This suggests an increase in weight, no doubt due to his desire to make his own training regime a bit more rigorous, and grant greater gains as a result. 

Without even waiting for an answer, the turtle savant breaks off into a sprint just as his Hyuuga companion had done. 

Unlike Mirai, his movements were flawless, each step went forward not out of just neccesity, but a purpose. His body swayed and strided about, each one making the most out of his motions, and thus granting his body the ability to cover the most ground in the most efficient fashion. 'Course, much of Sanoke's speed wasn't due to great running technique. Nay, it had to do mainly with the boy's amazing genetics, microscopic code that forced the fast-twitch fibers -- portion of the muscle for speed -- to develop at an almost superhuman pace.

Considering he didn't want to show up his self-made opponent just yet, the teen holds back much of his velocity, even with the turtle shell halving his max speed. For a moment, they'd be neck and neck. "Geez. . . . You're really good. Keep at it, I'm sure you can finish these miles. It's only like fourty," Sanoke states -- with arrogance, only in order to tease and propel the girl to go faster and with greater motivation. 

Then. . . He wants to show off a bit more. Towards the end of the laps, Sanoke speeds ahead, his body dissolving into a streak, allowing only his primary colors to be viewed. Those without trained eyes would find it difficult to view his actual appearance considering the distortion spawned. In a circular fashion, he moves along the path, finishing the course in about twenty minutes flat. Gently, he's leaning against the wall, waiting for the voluptous shinobi to make her way on over to the finish line.

"Geez. . . .You're sweat. Didn't think someone like you would ever bother to work this hard. Mmm, I'm impressed," said the male with a wink. He looks back to Koji, waiting now to see what he had next in store.* - Sat Oct  3 02:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) poofs into the area, Mirai in tow. 

"Hey, Lord Kazekage. Got a mission you can give this newb? I'mma help her with it."* - Sat Oct  3 03:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Guess not.  . - Sat Oct  3 03:16:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) s's nose flares as he gives a mighty whiff of the area. After a good second of smelling, Sanoke teasingly pulls back, a hand coming to grip his nose. "I'mma get a nose bleed! And it's not 'cause of looking at you this time, you smell. Tch," the mischevious teenager joked, simply to gauge how the Hyuuga would react. Presuming it hadn't been as effective as planned, the boy falls silent once more, descending into a sitting position and merely observing as the Hyuuga went through her own training routine-- which certainly was going to help refine her overall battle capability. 

His eyes didn't shut, but most of his brainpower was placed towards the manipulation of his chakra source. It's this process that would build up familiarity with working with a large quantity of energy, and the experience inevitably makes his stronger regardless. He'd continue to go through his training regime, up unti Mirai had popped the question.

"Why I became a shinobi. . . And why I quit. Eh. . . It's a long story," Sanoke articulates with a smile, and thoughtful sigh. Retiring wasn't exactly the easiest decision the boy could have made. Kirigakure was like family to him, and the nurturing and friendship gained while in that oft misguided nation would forever be cherished. But alas, time and time again, the village's decisions had proven to be. . . questionable. And without fail, Sanoke found himself at odds. Was he to be loyal to his village? -- As it was his duty as a shinobi, or would he follow his own heart, his own unbias morals?

"I became a shinobi because. . .Uh. I was inspired by them as a kid. So I didn't want to be just a shinobi-- I wanted to be the greatest one. My dream was to be Mizukage! Of course. . . things don't always go as planned. I watched my village do things I couldn't condone, so eventually, I had to retire. Plus, my master gave me talk about the way of Kame Cove -- the homeland of all my summons. Their philosophy demands that I don't be bias. My will must be iron-clad, just like a turtle's. So If I'm just a tool being twisted into watching my village do evil deeds, I'm in violation. You get it?" And that's all there was to it, however, he did remain a bit cryptic on the rest of his reasoning for wanting to be Hokage.

"That's the short story."

* - Sat Oct  3 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) 's face reddens. His eyes, perhaps on instict -- which were based on his own perverse nature --  fall onto Mirai's massive cleavage. It gleamed in the light, and held a shine that greatly appealed to the boy's primal senses. For a second, his mind if fading , and blood again rising towards his nose. But rather than act on it, Sanoke turns around, hoping that tranquil thoughts would do away with the nervous feelings that ran rampant through his body. 

With slightly harder breathing, his body tenses, particularly as Mirai seats herself near him. Thankfully, she doesn't see or takes advantage of his state, and actually begins to speak. He nods along, agreeing that her rage towards the former leaders in Kirigakure was justified -- yet her desire wasn't completely thought through. "I get that. . . I only don't want you to do anything brash because you could get hurt. Plus, you likely don't even know which of the leaders had actually made the eye-hunt an actual thing. One is long dead, even," he says, referencing the brash Hozuki, Tethys Hogo. It was that same man that had worked to drive Sanoke away from the village. Mainly due to the Mizukage showing a blind eye whenever he stepped out of land.

As the Hokuma continued speaking, the teen wore a simper once more, upon hearing Mirai's words. Before. . . She seemed like a snobby, perhaps irritating young lady. But now? She came off as intelligent, wise even. "Y'know, you're soundin' a lot like my master, Genbi. The comment falls in line with the philosophy I told you about," the turtle savant says with a proud smile. This girl was really growing on him.

He takes out a scroll, and presses a palm against it. Smoke pops up, revealing a cold bottle of water. It's taken and held out. "Drink up, since it's wise to stay hydrated while in the desert. Anywho. . . Kirigakure aside. Tell me a little more about yourself. Any sibling? Friends? Parents?" Of course, through this, his legs are still folded indian style, allowing his chakra to be kneaded and manipulated even during the leisure chat. 

If he could keep this up while talking, certainly, his ability to multi-task would improve, no?* - Sat Oct  3 05:10:36 2015

Without another word, he heads to the canyon's wall, and sticks a tag onto the surface. "This here is the first part of the jutsu. When I tag an object, they become a beacon. The weapons I create tend to have the 'Homing seal'. . . As the name suggests, the Beacons attract the Homings."

He takes out a Kunai, the metal marked with a specialized seal. After one hand sign, the fuuinjutsu glyph activates, prompting the Kunai to gain a life of it's own, and fly right on over to the marked area.

"Cool, right?"* - Sat Oct  3 05:23:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Cue a short along the road.

Once home, the door is cracked open, allowing the trio to enter. Moving along the house, Sanoke eventually reaches his storage room, fitted with a table at the center. The storage chambers is filled with loads of useful tools or items -- mostly related to fuuinjutsu, or shurikenjutsu. Clearly, the man was well off. 

Swiftly, his body blurs ahead, gathering the necessary sheets of paper, a bottle of ink, and an ink brush. He was going to show her how to do this the old fashioned way, just like Noriko used to do. The brush is taken, and dipped into the ink bottle. Meanwhile, a large sheet of paper is left along the table. 

"Grab some tools and sit by me. I want you to follow my process step by step." He sets Mirai next to him as well, and would ohave offered to teach, but the girl was likely occupied with making her taijutsu unmatched.* - Sat Oct  3 05:50:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Take your time. - Sat Oct  3 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blinks with confusion. ". . .You've never used ink for your fuuinjutsu seals? I find that hard to believe. . ." Sanoke said with an incredulous gaze. His wrists begin with the movements already, running along the paper, and forcing the excess ink to be slid onto the sheet as well. Considering the nature of the liquid, it's color is clung to the sheets of paper, allowing for the beginnings of a seal to be formed. With care, Sanoke took his time, making sure that Kirie followed each of his steps and could easily mimic the seal on her own time.

"You see this? This is the homing seal. . " It's filled with different kanji, more or less, and is tasked with secreting an almost constant emanation of chakra. 

Having completed the seal entirely, he begins to release energy. It evenly spreads along, aiming to to ingrain a part of Sanoke's will, and thus give the lifeless glyph actual instructions. "First, I want you to practice writing your own seal. I'll explain the technical aspect. The Homing and Beacon seals are corresponding glyphs or symbols that react to your chakra. The Beacon? Is tasked with constantly filtering -- or no, it's just rigged to react once the Homing seal has been activated."

"The homing is really the main point of the jutsu. What you're doing here is simply having the seal given three different instructions. One? To release a surge of chakra. The radius?  Is based on your skill level. Secondly, once done, the seal releases chakra in accordance to the object it's applied too. A thin, invisible veil of energy is wrapped aroundthe weapon, and thus the object gets launched forward. The more skillded you are? The more heavy an object can be, and the more fiercely it can be thrown," Sanoke notes. 

This was simply an application of the Lotus Seal. So, if Mirai had been proficienct in that regards, she'd likely have minimal troubles with this jutsu in particular. It just took trial and error.* - Sat Oct  3 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shook his head. "You can't attach a homing seal directly onto an organic being. That one has to be for inanimate object. On another note, no. You're copying my seal exactly, understood?" He says instructs. The example had already been drawn, so even if Kirie had forgotten the process, there was an illustration ready to go off of.* - Sat Oct  3 06:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Well. - Sat Oct  3 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: You can attach it to clothing. - Sat Oct  3 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: They are not organic materials. - Sat Oct  3 06:54:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Keep going. - Sat Oct  3 06:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) watched carefully as Kirie mimicked his attempt. It was. . . okay, for sure. Although, the penmanship was just one portion of successfully being a star in Fuuinjutsu. The other portion was strict chakra control, and that section was accurately observed via his sensing prowess. "That's right. . . Keep it steady," the teacher instructs, before allowing the young fuuinjutsu wielder to do what she does. 

After a prolonged period, his eyes shift on over to Kirie's. "Eh. Weird that you don't know how to use ink, but whatever. So far so good, I'm going to draw the Beacon seal now. Pretty for this, you have to inscribe instructions that tell your symbol to activate upon getting the reactional signal -- Which ya placed in the seal you just drew right now. The two parts connect with one another, and thus you have your seal. . ."

That said, it seems his desire to use ink was for no real reason. Chakra funnels around his finger tip, crafting an circular, flame-like gathering of chakra to develop. It presses against the sheet of paper, and drills a glypn along the surface. Casually, his hands moved along the sheet, carefully making the proper seal. It's filled with a slew of Kanji, t of instructions. The seal was like an intricate engine, and Sanoke was the engineer. Having wasted a few more minutes of the process, he turns back to Kirie.

"Alright. You should be able to do it now. Copy this seal, and give it a try. But don't go crazy, practice using it with one weapon. And if that works, practice adding additional weapons, and working on the efficiency of the skill," the turtle summoner instructs. He loosks on eagerlyow, curious to see if Al-Saachez -- what a weird last name -- could successfully mimic him.* - Sat Oct  3 07:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods. It seemed Kirie had the hang of it.

"Good. Nowgive the jutsu a try."* - Sat Oct  3 07:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) scratches his nose.

"Not bad. But yeah, that's how the jutsu works."* - Sat Oct  3 07:39:56 2015

'Move and he dies. . ' 

That voice tone echo'd through his head, forcing inactivity from Sanoke himself. If only he hadn't been so neglectant in his own progression. And where was this damn Hokage you needed him. After shaking off the initial 'bout of fear, the former chunnin at last breaks into an analytical mindset. It was clear, just fro mthe collision with the sword, the bones were quite durable, as they didn't even flinch despite being met with metal.

Likewise, the positioning Taiga was in left him susceptible to being killed on a moment's notice. Baen essentially had him by the balls.* - Sun Oct  4 00:44:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Want me to send the newcomers your way? - Sun Oct  4 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) had appeared on the scene, his body appearing to be nothing short of a blur.

"Hidey-hoo. What are you two doing here? You specifically, Violet."* - Sun Oct  4 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Oh. . You know them Sanoke? - Sun Oct  4 01:46:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Hi Sanoke... - Sun Oct  4 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: .. - Sun Oct  4 01:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Aint even wait for an answer, though/ - Sun Oct  4 01:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: More of your friends come to cause trouble? - Sun Oct  4 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) would have grabbed Mirai, and form a single seal. His body blurred along the area, landing in the middle of the desert. Thankfully, for the mission in hand, he had a user of the almighty Byakugan, surely she'd be of help. 

"Huh? Not really my friends, just acquaintances. They used to be shinobi alongside me in Kirigakure," he notes, before setting the Hokuma down. "Anywho. Which direction do you want to start?"* - Sun Oct  4 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shrugs. They really were just acquintances, at least from Sanoke's perspective. Neither ever really went out of their way to speak to him, likely due to finding more comfortable in conversing with their own gender. "If you say so. . . Uh. I'm guessing those eyes give you special vision? Like making you able to see far," he says, considering that there were actual veins now protruding from the side of Mirai's face. It was a safe assumption -- although Sanoke wasn't particularly sure. After all, his own Doujutsu gave no added vision, save for seeing chakra.

Without another word, his hands grab along Mirai's wrist, and begins to pull along to the west. This was just one portion of the village's outskirts, they'd have much more to examine in the coming minutes or hours. Assuming she followed along, his grip would be relinquished, allowing the young woman to follow at her own space. Sanoke, on the other hand, seemed a bit too excited.

His feet continued to move in a frantic pace, allowing for moderate velocity along the desert terrain. But it wasn't exactly anything that would be out of Mirai's own ability to outpace. The trip would bring them towards the north of Sunagakure, and generally there was nothing of note.

A few caravans traveled in interchangeable directions, and of course, there was the shady dealer or two venturing in the outskirts. One held a pocket knife, and carried around a strange body-sized bag. Muffling can be heard, but despite this, the cloaked figure continued to move along.

The second had actually set up base in a sense that he was routinely selling drugs to people who passed by. 'Course, none dared to do so as two trained shinobi had entered the scene. "Huh. . . "

After a pause.

"Yeah, don't see anything of note here. Let's head back."* - Sun Oct  4 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Don't worry about what it does. - Sun Oct  4 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) poofs into the area.

"Alright. Everything seems good."* - Sun Oct  4 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: How much we gettin' paid? - Sun Oct  4 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Was a pretty easy mission. Hrm, next time, we should do one where we gotta beat up rogues. - Sun Oct  4 02:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You two. - Sun Oct  4 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: What brings ya here? - Sun Oct  4 02:35:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) forms a single seal. After a response had been given, he disappears in a plume of smoke, and heads on over to the cells. It'd take a few minutes max.* - Sun Oct  4 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Of course you going to check on your friends. - Sun Oct  4 02:38:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: What's stopping them from coming here instead of Kiri? - Sun Oct  4 02:40:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) forms a seal. 

"I'll get you all out in a bit. But for now, farewell."

With that seal, Sanoke again exploits his high speed, and shunshin ability. His body disappears out of nowhere, heading on to the south.
