<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gives a possessive glance to Hideki.

Sanoke's body still rocked, barely able to keep his anticipation under check. "But first. . . Come with me," Sanoke asks.* - Thu Oct 15 10:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mokutsu(LordxPatrick) whispers: (You seen Iza's chakra?) - Thu Oct 15 10:02:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) stops after a few paces towards the south.

There was still goose bumps running along Sanoke's body. Just briefly prior to this, the male had given a gaze over Hideki's frame. . . No Rinnegan in sight, just sharingan. 

"I can. . . I can feel it. Why do you have those. . . eyes on you? Not the ones on your face."* - Thu Oct 15 10:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) is still sizing up Hideki's frame.

"The rinnegan. . . I can't shake this feeling off of me. For me to able to sense it on your person. . . Without any being on your eyes, that means you must have taken it from a previous. . . I theorize the one known as 'Edge'. . . Or the 'Sabo' individual. Hrn, I ask that you. . . oblige and give the doujutsu here. I am an ally of Suna, after all. And without a host, it's useless," Sanoke says in a shaking voice, still having trouble maintaining composure.

The rinnegan did weird things to it's hosts. It often made them act irrationally, or with bloodthirst. Thus, it's a testiment to Sanoke's level of control that he can even remain this composed. ..  especially when so close.* - Thu Oct 15 10:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: So the eyes name is Rinnegan.. - Thu Oct 15 10:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods.

He's breathing slightly harder. "Indeed."* - Thu Oct 15 10:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: He may have Suitengu's eyes.... - Thu Oct 15 10:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Probably why he knows so much about these uh....Rinnegan. - Thu Oct 15 10:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) grunts.

"Yeah. . . Sorry if it's weird. This ain't really my style. . .Just I -have- too," he notes, feeling obligated not only by natural instinct, but the desire to keep the great power out of the wrong hands.* - Thu Oct 15 10:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: What happened to the one known as.. - Thu Oct 15 10:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Harada. - Thu Oct 15 10:26:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Was that Taiga's last name? - Thu Oct 15 10:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Yes, - Thu Oct 15 10:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) frowns.

The thought of Taiga's unfortunate faith woreh eavy on his soul. "I-- He's dead. . .It's reported that Suitengu killed him. . . Likely for the Rinnegan," Sanoke stated with a sigh, all of this sense blood shed.

"Shortly after, in his escape. . He was contronted by Hassan and several other shinobi. Was killed on the spot. I came in afterwards to see all the commotion," Sanoke continued.* - Thu Oct 15 10:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||"Tch. . . These are my stunter glasses. Makes the chicks love me. . . But," he says, confidence with his tone.

"I also use it so people don't get thirsty for my eyes. Hardly anyone knows -- So I'm hoping that you don't speak on it either," the teen continued with a child-like smile. Could he honestly trust a complete stranger?* - Thu Oct 15 10:33:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) catches the jar with ease.

It's held tightly with the right hand, allowing Sanoke's left to rise and give a triumphant thumbs up. His teeth are shown in a smile, glimmering brightly in the sunlight -- a sparkle could even be seen.

"Oh hell yeah! Another one," he says in a DJ-Khaled voice.

"--And yeah. .. Edge. I've heard of him for a while now. I'm guessing he's the one behind that mysterious group that spawned a few weeks ago. I'm going to have to be prepared, since I know I'll be a big target once they're ready to make moves. Thanks again,"  bow is given to the Uchiha that was now aiding Sanoke in his path to power.* - Thu Oct 15 10:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Just becareful, Sanoke. - Thu Oct 15 10:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods. The thumbs up is still held strong.

"Right. . Well. .. to save you from seeing this creepiness. . ."

Chakra builds up, before allowing his body to disappear in a plume of smoke.* - Thu Oct 15 10:40:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||At last. . . He had gained access to yet another eye, thanks to the working of a strange Uchiha. . Hideki.

It remained within a jar, conserved due to the liquids that filled the container. Wasting no time, Sanoke's right hand dips right in, grabbing both of the severed body parts and bringing it close to his face.

Already, the optics glowed a bit brightly, and began to dematerialized, trickling forward now in the form of energy. The area illuminates shortly after, with sparks of chakra eventually moving beyond his shades, and landing onto his eyes. There's a prelevant glow building up, and an additional ring is firmly being etched onto Sanoke's eyes -- mainly the schelera, which was normally white, but was re-colored lavender due to his doujutsu.

For a few moments, the sequence continued, until at last. . . All of the processes abruptly stopped. The set of eyes are completely dematerialized, prompting the their previous existence to be a mere after thought. Five rings in total now surounded Sanoke's pupils. He had obtained the potential to enter five different paths -- yet for now, the bulk of his strength was completely directed towards a singular path..

Asura. In this, Sanoke could only summon arms, yet with each day reliant on the Rinnegan itself, he was growing more proficient. On instict alone, that same path activates, forcing several appendages out of his shoulder briefly. The power coursed through the male's frame, only to recede shortly after. "Hng. . .These eyes. I don't get it. . . Why did I get them out of all people?"* - Thu Oct 15 17:02:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Here's good. - Thu Oct 15 17:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) arrived at the local area.

He descends into a crouch, and begins to funnel chakra along his eyes. Immediately, one of the paths in his rinnegan is sprouted, and gains potency. This gives life to the acceleration of his muscle cell's growth, which begins to formula lumps around his body. From the shoulder, two extra appendages spawn, putting Sanoke's total arms at a max of four.

Of course, onm a moment's notice, he'd be more than capable of conjuring additional limbs should the situation arise.

"Alright, alright! Anywho, keep this a little hush-hush! I'm going to try and spar ya with pure taijutsu. Considering your elemental gifts, I figure I might need. . . an extra hand! . . .Get it? Hahaha," the boy joked. Subsequently after, his turtle shell is summoned from out of nowhere, weighing down his body and making his speed less than superhuman.

"Alright. . . Let's go! Your move!"* - Thu Oct 15 17:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Impressive. . !

The flames come speeding along the air, forcing waves of heat to resonate along the atmosphere. The space itself seemed to be distorted, but none of this seems to bother Sanoke one bit. Rather than sitting there like an idiot, his body dips towards the right, allowing the potentially fatal attack to harmlessly clash against the sand behind his back.


In no time at all, almost an instant, Sanoke is able to close the distance between the duo. Once in place, assuming she hadn't spawned those damn clones, two arms rush ahead, aiming to unleash significant punches to her ribs and shoulder -- barely anything held back.

"Hya! Take this, hahaha!"
* - Thu Oct 15 17:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||On instict, Sanoke's hands came together, forming the specialized, clone-making seal. . .  Then it dons upon him, this was a battle meant to be won solely using his Asura Path, that way more experience could be gained in utilizing this for actual combat. Who knows, maybe learning to use this path alone would grant access to the others shortly after as well.

Nevertheless, the clo0ne that had been struck before had found itself being dissipated, disappearing into nothing more than a plume of smoke. 

"Hng. . .Fuckin' shadow clones. Alright, let's try this again-- Let's see if you can still keep up!" He declares, clearly holding great fondness of his own immense speed. Even while weighed down by a turtle shell, the male's speed held true, and perhaps exceeded even the fastest of individuals. Breaking off into a streak of brown, white, and blur, the former shinobi blurs off, moving in an arc or semi-circle.

He moved at breakneck speed, in attempt of coming from Izanami's right side.

Assuming that he could actually make it to close enough distance, Sanoke's variosu appendages were employed, each one repeatily cocking back before being sent forward-- as fists. Certainly, even with four different limbs to account for, the chunnin's brain could multi-task, making him much more formiddable in close-ranged combat than you could expect. After all. . . four hands were better than two!

While not stupendously fast, the strikes moved at respectable speeds, enough to force a gale of wind to whisk about the area.

"C'mon! I'm sure you can take me on! Taijutsu ain't my strong suit!"* - Thu Oct 15 18:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: (Come rp foo - Thu Oct 15 18:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) didn't really care that much. 

The flames sprout, thus making each hit give slight burns along his fists. . . Yet, Sanoke hardly took time for recess. However, the aura of flames do serve as a legitimate detriment, and force the chunnin to twist up his tactics.

Each attack -was- going to burn, no question asked. . . However, if he avoided keeping his hands bound to her body for too long, any serious burns could be limited. Thus, the male continued with his fierce style of taijutsu -- which was simply a fast-paced onslaught of striking, the accuracy of which was nearly non-existent. Sanoke simply wished to keep his foe overwhelmed. The strikes leave his knuckles partially burned, each one now covered or riddled with irritating stings -- first degree burns. . . minor ones.

As a trained combatant in the school of taijutsu, his attack velocity doesn't seem to be taken any decline in terms of overall velocity. Each motion holds just about as much momentum as the last, showcasing impeccable stamina and muscle endurance -- two facts that were encouraged to be developed considering the creatures that taught him.

Of course, given Izanami's nature as a child, each hit is held back considerably. After two wild swings from each of the four appendages, the turtle summoner dips downward, and sends a sweeping kick to her ankles, all with the hopes of sending the girl onto the sandy terrain. 

"Come on, geez. You're getting worked, fight back! I know you're better than this," the chunnin would have urged in the event that Izanami remained on the defensive.* - Thu Oct 15 18:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looked on with some legitimate intrigue. The girl was pretty dexterous, able to perform acrobatic ass flips, and land snuggly on the wall. "Badass, hahaha! --" He roared cheerfully. And it's at this point that Sanoke breaks his own rule. A hand -- one of the four -- drifts back, unlatching his tanto and swinging rapidly towards the incoming weapons. Two of the shurikens are struck, throwing them off course, and giving the boy more than enough room to cautious move towards the left -- away from the dangerous shurikens.

By now, it's unclear whether or not Sanoke  had seen or notice the damn wires. 

Regardless, assuming the defensive measure is successful, his feet skid along the ground, kicking up a mass of dirt. A toothy grin is still worn, given that Izanami was actually proving to be a worth opponent. ". . .Mmm. Alright, lets see. . ." No actual offense is dished this round. Instead, he eagerly awaits to see what the young gal had to offer.* - Thu Oct 15 18:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Flames. . Pure, heated and hot flames. 

It runs along the wire, interestingly enough, and of course make the simple metal object  a lot more potent. In response, one of Sanoke's added appendages rush to the scene, intercepting the hot shurikens before it can strike a fatal area.

It burns harshly, and forces the shinobi to cringe. Nevertheless, he skips back, and after the pain subsides, smiles. "Alright. . . That should be enough for now. You fight good."* - Thu Oct 15 18:37:52 2015

Close-quarter-combat I guess? I remember last time, you had a pretty shitty time dealing with Saeza.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Train their muscles . . . If you add weight to your arms then it'll just make them slower and not faster. - Thu Oct 15 19:23:05 2015

"Hrm. . ?"* - Thu Oct 15 20:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Hi. Sanoke. How're you? - Thu Oct 15 20:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Pretty cool. - Thu Oct 15 20:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: How were you all trainin'? Before we came about. - Thu Oct 15 20:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: I was just practicing my jutsu. - Thu Oct 15 20:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Err. . .The bite thing? - Thu Oct 15 20:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: N-no....That's not a jutsu....It's just a trait of my people. - Thu Oct 15 20:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: I was practicing my in-line augmentation technique. - Thu Oct 15 20:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Sounds badass! Let me see, though. - Thu Oct 15 20:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looks closely. Due to his extensive training and experience, he can easily be able to see chakra-nature that latched onto the metal. 

"Chakra flow, coool. Fuuton nature, right? I've been thinking of a chakra-flow skill of my own. This one is going to be unique -- I just need to continue working on my schematic," Sanoke replies with a slick grin.* - Thu Oct 15 20:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Oh yeah? That sounds interesting. - Thu Oct 15 20:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Damn. . .She don't even want to know about it? - Thu Oct 15 20:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yep. Real epic and shit. - Thu Oct 15 20:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) snickers.

"Nope. A real ninja doesn't give out his secret. Don't you know? Tch. . . I'm actually  insulted that you think I'd just give out all of my cool techniques," Sanoke replies, grinning from ear to ear. Saezo had taken the bait, so that was good.

"Anywho. Maybe once I fully develop it, I might let ya see it. In the meantime. . . You finished your training?"* - Thu Oct 15 20:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Nothin' much. Just chillin' for a bit. - Thu Oct 15 20:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: What do ya usually do when you're not training? - Thu Oct 15 20:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Or drinkin' blood. - Thu Oct 15 20:23:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Laammee. - Thu Oct 15 20:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You remind me of Mirai. - Thu Oct 15 20:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: So in all this time you've supposally lived. Ya just ran around trraining than chilling as you stared into space? - Thu Oct 15 20:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: No. When I was younger I was...Hmm...I guess you could call me a ripper. - Thu Oct 15 20:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . .Uh. What the heck is that? - Thu Oct 15 20:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Did you have like bad gas? - Thu Oct 15 20:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: No no. I used to hunt a lot. I didn't begin training to be a shinobi until recently. - Thu Oct 15 20:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I mean. 'Shinobi' is just a title. - Thu Oct 15 20:26:14 2015
