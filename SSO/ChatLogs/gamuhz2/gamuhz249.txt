<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) goes to pick up the much taller Ai, and tosses her over his shoulder.

He speeds on off, rushing to the crib.* - Fri Nov 20 21:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: ...I see... - Fri Nov 20 21:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Didn't...Expect that one - Fri Nov 20 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) arrives!

Once there, Ai is set down. "Right. Show me your progress with the Finger-Carving seal."* - Fri Nov 20 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) peered closer to observe Ai as she worked on the ninjutsu. As expected, azure flames crept from her fingertips, hugging around the flesh and leaving her in prime condition to perform a sealing formula. 

As further proof, Ai even went as far as to carve a symbol onto his floor.

"Cool! Alright, I'm going to show you how to make a Fuuinjutsu Barrier, alright? This won't have any actual combative purposes, but it'll be good if you have something you want to protect or seal away." He nods, figuring now that would be the next logical step. After all, Ai likely wasn't good enough to learn about Root Sealing just yet.

He poofs onto the crouch and unsummons the table as per usual. It's filled with a wealth of supplies. . .Mainly being paper in the form of tags, and some ink for good measure. "C'mon."* - Fri Nov 20 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Uh, Hi. - Fri Nov 20 21:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: <*sees table filled with tags*> - Fri Nov 20 21:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: S'up. - Fri Nov 20 21:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Teaching Ai about Fuuinjutsu. She's learning the Five Seal Barrier. - Fri Nov 20 21:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) turns  back around and begins with the teaching.

"Alright, this is going to be your first barrier technique, and is also an advanced variant of the Lotus Sealing. What you're doing is simply making five tags, each one correspondant with the other. .  As for instructions. . Well. . "

He pauses, wondering how to best go over the information.

Five tags are seperated from the pack and placed to the forefront. "Hard to explain. But generally, they're reach to secrrate chakra, the length of which will be based on how far the other tags are, and how skilled you are with the skill. Basically, the chakra will form an invisible barrier between the tags, with the focal point being whatever object you have being protected. . "

Sanoke pauses, looking around for an example. Eventually, his index finger points to the door. "For example. The fifth and final seal would be on the door, while the other four would be spreaded out in hidden locations. The chakra sealed in would react to the other four, and also serve as a 'barrier' around the door. Whatever damage delivered would prove null or ineffective, since the barrier would protect said door. . and well, whatever it was attached to. The only way to bypass said protection would be via a special handseal meant to open the barrier briefly, or disrupting the chakra signals in the other tags.."

He pauses, hopefully speaking concisely enough for Ai to understand. "AKA, removing the seal all at once. You get it? If so, I'll begin showing you the sealing glyph and guiding you along the way."

With that, chakra flooded onto Sanoke's hand, allowing his fingers to scratch glyphs or symbols along each of the tag. They were made in the form of simple Kanjis that more or less read 'Deny Entry.' As the chakra being used to right the formula, more is actually being sealed into the formulas -- this being the technical instructions. 

"So you understand, right? Simply exercise your mastery of the Lotus Seal to have each seal reactive to one another. Likewise, have the fifth and final seal fitted to give an invisible viel of protection so that your barrier can be complete." 

He looks forward, awaiting any questions.* - Fri Nov 20 22:04:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods.

He licks his lips with anticipation and goes to take one of the bars. "Oh, cool. Let's go?"* - Sat Nov 21 03:19:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods.

He goes to stuff the ice cream bar into his mouth while lifting Mirai up. "Chikyu comin' too?" Sanoke questions with a muffled tone.* - Sat Nov 21 03:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I don't know. - Sat Nov 21 03:22:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Weren't you just promising to put more focus on Mirai. Hard to do that with three around. *Chomps on her ice cream again* - Sat Nov 21 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods. She speaks the truth. Before long, Sanoke disappears on off.* - Sat Nov 21 03:28:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sanoke i'm ready to be seated. - Sat Nov 21 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) makes his approach!

He slams his hand against the desk, shaking the wooden object to the very core.

"I was there for it all, Koji. Don't let her romanticize this all. Izanami and Ivel both were directly opposing an officer that was just trying to keep the peace. Shira -- the Hyuuga you knew -- was tryign to violently attack some girl. So Mirai naturally detained him. Then all of a sudden Ivel tries to play big cop and uses his manipulation of flames to try and BURN Mirai, which effectively forces her to release," Sanoke replies.

He gives a glance to Izanami disappointed that she'd only give partial truth.

"I detained Ivel for a while, and Mirai admittedly got irked and sought to disable his body. Regardless, both of these RYujins acted as if they were above the law. Izanami herself would stated 'Family over Law.' "* - Sat Nov 21 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Don't let your affection for your woman cloud what would clearly otherwise be known as good judgement.  - Sat Nov 21 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: We both know if Ivel was trying to burn her, she'd be ashes by now. - Sat Nov 21 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: He really -was- trying to burn her. If it wasn't for fast reflexes, she'd be scorched. Regardless, he had no place. - Sat Nov 21 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: He's a kid, and should learn it. Otherwise. - Sat Nov 21 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Ivel tried to burn Mirai? So, there was more after he tried to split Shira nand the bottle cap victim? - Sat Nov 21 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Don't bitch when he's detained or treated like an adult. - Sat Nov 21 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: No. - Sat Nov 21 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: That's the thing. - Sat Nov 21 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Koji. He first used fire run, then manipulated it. - Sat Nov 21 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: They think him trying to split eachother up was a means to burn or injure them. - Sat Nov 21 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Had Mirai not moved. - Sat Nov 21 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: She'd be burned. - Sat Nov 21 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Is that not trying to burn? - Sat Nov 21 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: If the person has to move to avoid it.. - Sat Nov 21 03:51:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: She needed to move and desist from trying to attack. - Sat Nov 21 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Is that not clear? - Sat Nov 21 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Then he was trying to burn. If she -- It isn't your's or his decision. - Sat Nov 21 03:52:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: But I was only upset because they overstepped their boundaries. - Sat Nov 21 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: From me trying to detain Shira. - Sat Nov 21 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: No one overstepped any form of boundaries.  - Sat Nov 21 03:52:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: He didn't try to burn you...once again. - Sat Nov 21 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Yeah okay. - Sat Nov 21 03:52:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: No, he doesn't. He's thinking like a rational human being and trying to stop violence in any way possible. - Sat Nov 21 03:54:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: And...it's sad how you are quick to just call us runts; we are shinobi of this village no more then you are. We have a right to voice our opinions and our concerns and excersize protective tendencies towards our fellow shinobi. - Sat Nov 21 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I didn't call him a runt. - Sat Nov 21 03:55:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I told him to stay out of my clan affairs. - Sat Nov 21 03:55:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods.

"I can see why she's upset, since Ivel was her brother. But he deserved to be detain for aiming to be above the law. Youcan take the quote right out of her mouth, she didn't care for the law, all she cared about was protecting her sibling. That said, thanks for your input Koji. Shira isn't a problem anymore, so that's one thing," He replies with a partially solemn expression.

The kid was super dead, after all. Koji, as the police captain would likely have heard of it.

"Anyway. I'll talk to you later once things are resolved. Just came here to get a bite with Mirai, it's pure luck that I ran into you all to iron this all out." He turns to the east and proceeds back to where the Hokuma was. A chair is pulled forward so that mirai could take a seat.* - Sat Nov 21 04:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: On a side note. . I respect that you are a shinobi. At such a tender age. But you have to choose one. If you're a shinobi, yo uaccept that you will be sentenced as an adult for any issues. - Sat Nov 21 04:12:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) exhales. Tensions were flaring, but things finally calmed down.

Regardless, once all was said and done, Sanoke takes a seat and calls for a menu. He gives a daunting gaze to it all, calculating the overall pricing for one of everything. Funnily enough, it summed up to be a pretty penny.

Nevertheless, despite how badly this was going to hurt his wallet, the teen aimed to please. "Ten of everything!" At once, the waitress nodded and shuffled on off to begin cooking.

"Are you really going to eat all of that?"* - Sat Nov 21 04:24:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: How do you expect me to maintain these curves if i'm overweight. - Sat Nov 21 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Like seriously. - Sat Nov 21 04:28:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) frantically stops the waitress from delivering the order!

"On second thought, I want a single serving of Unagi Done Freid. And uh. . . Get me like three giant bowls of rame, and some 'Purple Drank.' Uh, maybe some sweet dumplings too. Four servings," he replies before turning back to Mirai.

"And what do you mean? I like you the way you are."* - Sat Nov 21 04:31:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Funny enough, there wasn't a lot in Kirigakure. Most were sticks. - Sat Nov 21 04:45:26 2015

"Well Koeki was pretty cool. Before she went all. . . apathetic on me. And I did like my teacher in Fuuinjutsu. But I never really. . -liked- them," he says after some thought.* - Sat Nov 21 04:48:00 2015

"Look. I get that you dislike her, and what she did was wrong. But you asked me who I was fond of, and Noriko was one. Albeit, she went a bit crazy like five years into her regime. . . Started to make us use swords and become subserviant to the Gezo. But that wasn't the Noriko I knew," he admits, his body tensed and prepared to stop Mirai if she tries to leave.* - Sat Nov 21 05:02:30 2015

"I never said that made it okay. Just that you were bit. . Uh, mis-informed. And yeah, she's dead," He says placidly, although on the inside he was more than a little sad. That was his teacher, she started him on the shinobi path.* - Sat Nov 21 05:08:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: I want to do something. - Sun Nov 22 02:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: You can look for the hot springs. - Sun Nov 22 02:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'd suppose. You wanna? <@Mirai> - Sun Nov 22 02:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: We really need to find something we both like to do consistently. - Sun Nov 22 02:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sure. - Sun Nov 22 02:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) wastes no time. He lifts Mirai up in the usual bridal fashion and waves the square goodbye.

"Peace."

With that, Sanoke flickers out of view, as he was bored out of his mind. Hopefully this livened things up.* - Sun Nov 22 02:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) arrived shortly after by the local hotsprings. It takes quite a bit of time, considering he has to ask for constant directions.

Nevertheless, in their approach, they see a giant, white-painted building. Clearly, there's a lot for this place to offer, even things not relevant to being a hot springs. Sanoke pulls on up, and sets Mirai down once at the clerk's desk.

"Alright. Whatcha wanna do here?"* - Sun Nov 22 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

And that was that!

He only stares towards Mirai's goods for a moment, as they naturally fidgeted around due to their bouyancy. Sanoke fell silent, allowing the Hokuma to lead the way, giving her desired request. After all, he came here to see what -she- wanted to do after all. 

He'd nod along, figuring that Mirai had chosen well.

"Sounds good!  Let's rock! Also, I was the one that won the bet last time, right?" He asks casually, legitimately holding a bit of difficulty in recalling. Life moved too fast, man. As the order is given, the clerk at the desk gives out the price, it being nothing less than fifteen thousand yen each. A small price to pay, sure enough.

Sanoke forked over the cash, and gathers the direction. There was only one unisex hot springs, towards the eastern wing of the building. With that said, the boy motions to the direction and proceeds to move onward to the area alongside Mirai. "There should be more places like this. Sunagakure needs more than just a hungry ant, don't you think?"* - Sun Nov 22 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

And they were on their way. As the duo moved along the hallways, Sanoke's level of anticipation was on a steady incline. In his mind, he and Mirai didn't hang out alone as much as they ought to. And naturally. . . going to a place as luxurous as this, the lad was excited as he knew just how calming and liberating a hot spring could be.

The hallway comes to an end, giving way to two different roads. One being a locker for women, another being for men. He calmly obliges, and flickers on off into the locker room in order to get dressed.

For this, Sanoke takes his time, eager eyes taking in the rich scenery. Each bit of furniture appeared as if they were just ported out of a factory of manufactured point. The room smelled pleasant, like fresh mint, and ofcourse his locker had been designated by one of the staff members before hand. After unlocking, his clothes are removed and set into a scroll, which inevitably goes into the locker.

He slips into some swimming trunks shortly after, but doesn't go out just yet. 

Like a child being brought to a museum and left unattended, Sanoke sprinted about, taking in the scenery for all it had to offer. There was a shower head, and other unnecessary luxury items meant to appease those who graciously chose to use this building for the hotsprings. After five minutes, the summoner steps on out, his eyes settling onto Mirai's covered form.

Exercising stealthy abilities, the teen is more than capable of discreeting creeping up behind the beaut. And once in place, both hands move, latching onto the Hokuma's hips. "BOO!" * - Sun Nov 22 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) sported a grin once Mirai's reaction had been clear. It wasn't quite what he expected, as the woman still remained in place, and didn't shrek, but the reaction was satisfying all the same. "Hah. . Sorry," Sanoke replied with some mischief. 

That said, he remained stationary, his eyes gazing over Mirai's curves that squirmed about, as if taunting him. Clearly, this was an entirely new Sanoke, one who had become more than comfortable with seeing the Hokuma's body stripped of clothing. After all, he no longer was frozen in fear, and contemplating an escaping due to being a nervous wreck.

To the contrary, depending on how you looked at it, you could say that Sanoke sported an almost perverted gaze, or one of intrigue.

Once Mirai had settled in, the turtle summoner too proceeded to make an advance. He doesn't take any time, as his body was used to going through extreme temperature changes. As if this was a pool, the boy dived on in, giving a relieved exhaled as the hot spring's sensation does it's thing. He was in utter bliss, and most of the worries that persisted in his life seemed to fade or wash away.

For a few moments, Sanoke settles in, his body fidgeting before floating on over to his wife-to-be. "Enjoying it so far?"
* - Sun Nov 22 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Are you enjoying yourself? - Sun Nov 22 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

He inhales and exhales, just momentarily losing his nerves.

Strangely enough, Sanoke still wore his shades, even while in the pull as it was a natural instinct by now. Those shaded eyes seemed practically mesmorized, glued onto Mirai's breasts as they rested along the water. 

His cheeks were partially tinted pink upon taken notice of her nipples' erection, although he makes no comments on it. "Mhm! It's nice here. .  . Didn't know you were much of a drinker, though," Sanoke continued, finally being able to pry his visage away from the woman's chest. He closes the distance between them, stopping just an inch or two away from her front.

"We should come here more often."* - Sun Nov 22 06:12:03 2015
