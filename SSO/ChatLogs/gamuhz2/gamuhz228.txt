<br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) chuckled.

His Tanto is withdrawn, and speedily, it slashes through the air. The six shurikens would find themselves being deflected or parry. One manages to survive, yet it misses it's mark by a fair margin. Sanoke's gaze remain ed on Beth, waiting to see if she had something more intelligent planned -- perhaps the Manipulated Shuriken technique?

"Not bad! But you have to battle at a faster pace, or attack a larger radius to harm an opponent like me!" the turtle summoner roared happily.* - Sat Oct 24 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
We're now checking on your genes~
My oh my! You can last for so long in battle!
You're like a natural-born savant!
OH! I've never seen anyone that fast before!* - Sat Oct 24 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||And the illusion is settled in.

Quickly, as the flaming Windmills come, Sanoke aims for defensive measures, given that the projectiles were moving at a much faster pace of speed. At once, his legs spring, aiming to get just out of range before those dastardly objects can close in. With a single sea, the ground is beckoned to Sanoke's will -- forcing it to arise.

Slabs of dense earth come out of nowhere, hopefully blocking the illusion. 

"Shit! Shit! Shit! SHit!" roared the teen! 

"I didn't know you were good with weapons!" From there, the boy is hiding behind his own Earthen Corridor, chakra being built up in anticipation. "Looks like I have to try a bit harder now . ."* - Sat Oct 24 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||The going just kept going tough.

The burning sensation or heat from the illusion ran over his flesh. It was irritating, but also drove Sanoke to go harder. . .and to try a with a bit more vigor.


"--You brought the fire! So now I'm bringing the water!" Swiftly, after performing the needed handseals, chakra pumps and forces a magnifient space-time technique. Seals run along the ground, forcing Ganba again to be sxummoned for the tenth time today. 

"Send some water, big man!" the teen ordered. . . But alas, the summoning wasn't locked within the genjutsu. He looked on strangely, before a frown formed. "Sano. . .If you call me ahead one more damn time for nothing, I'm going to sit on you. Sit on you for a long time. . .!" Meanwhile, Sanoke is still as surprised as ever. He had legitimately believed that there were flaming projectiles coming to wreck havoc.

"---Genjutsu!"* - Sat Oct 24 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Quickly, Ganba realizes that perhaps there actually was a battle to be had.

The second Beth moved to attack, the turtle made his approach, building up a mass of Suiton chakra out of nowhere. It moves speedily, in the form of a giant sphere of water.

The water strike goes to repel not only incoming projectiles, but it also  puts Beth at risk of being overwhelmed or pushed backwards. Taking advantage of the cover, Sanoke is moving closely behind, closing the distance in no time at all. Once in the proper location, his hair speeds ahead, the thick locks aiming to wrap about the arms and legs, binding and ending theb attle in an effective, casual manner.

"Hahah! Good fight, though."* - Sat Oct 24 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: So you can spend time with the girl that looks like a man but not me? - Sat Oct 24 03:12:25 2015

"Hrm? We were sparring," Sanoke replies, relinquishing the grip.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Sanoke's eyes homed in, picking up the details of Mizora's chakra systems as the Hyuuga came in for the haymaker. -- The attack itself wasn't any actual problem for Sanoke, rather. . . He just sought to be prepared for any of the HYuuga clan's special abilities.

Indeed. The second Mizora had came in for the punch, the former chunnin's body casually dips towards the right, allowing for the punch to sail away. 

Seconds later, the right arm comes, pushing Mizora's arm away, while Sanoke's left palm comes in to deliver a stern palm thrust. Throughout the exchange, the teen's body doesn't at all seem to be tensed or alarmed. In the event that the strike had go through unopposed, it was landing towards the center of the woman's chest, hopefully knocking some wind out of her body.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He was no slouch when it came to taijutsu. 

This was a simple deduction. After all, prior to his advancement in elemental ninjutsu, and genjutsu, hand to hand combat was all Sanoke had to utilize in battle. Thus, before Mizora's fist can even come close to contacting his chest, Sanoke's right foerarm speeds ahead, repelling or parrying the strike off course. 

"Haha! Ya gotta try a little harder than that," the boy taunted, seemingly just playing around.

After effortless dispatching of the concussive blow, his observant gaze is swiftly detects the palms. What more, via usage of his doujutsu, Sanoke is more than capable of sensing the build up of chakra. In fact, he could literally see the energy pouring from the Hyuuga's hand. 

Taking a step back, the teen gets just out of range-- and just like that, his body blurs out of view. Almost as if using shunshin, he speedily runs along  the mountain and aims to get towards the Hyuuga's rear. Assuming success, a single seal is all that's required before wires speed from underneath Sanoke's clones. Ravenously, they rush, hopeful to wrap around the woman's arms, legs, and waist--- Thus keeping her in bondage. 

If that was a success, than mayhaps the Kaiten technique would be disabled.* - Sat Oct 24 04:18:08 2015

His eyes were vigilant, in attempt to pick up information regarding the Hokuma's current location.
