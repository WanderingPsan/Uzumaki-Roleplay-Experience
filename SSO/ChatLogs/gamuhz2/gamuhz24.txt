"Damn. . Is this your cousin? Teach this guy how to be a kid," he says towards the blue-haired gal-- even if she's conversing.

He was having fun teaching Suitengu how to be an actual person.

Then Koeki goes all Hulk on his ass. The flick hits hard, sending his sailing through the air. For a second, Sanoke's mind was dazed. However, before crashing, he gains control and does a flip, landing on his feet.

"Owwwww!"  criedo ut the snow-haired summoner. A hand clutches at his forehead. "Geez. . .I didn't know having three kids meant you were a ho. Noriko had three. . .And she's pretty tamed. I don't know a more modest lady. I just figured you were old, even if you are kinda built like a little girl," he mutters with subdued laughter.

"Uh. . Koeki your--" Sanoke's face deadpans upon gearing the cold, sinister voice she spoke with. His leg shook, honestly preparing to back away, yet his body refused to move any further than that.

"Uh. . I was just saying. Compared to a lot of other girls in our. . Uhm. .  Age group. ." His voice is shaky, uncertain and confused. He doesnt' even finish the train of thought.* - Fri Sep 25 06:23:08 2015

"Phew. For a second, I thought you got offended that I was noting how flat you are," Sanoke chuckles, figuring the hostilities had ended. Casually, he prances back over to Suitengu, and holds out his fist once more.

"Bump it, though."* - Fri Sep 25 06:26:33 2015

He's struck right in the face. 

The impact sends him into the sky, and before long. . He's out of there, like a fuckin' homerun. As his body sailing into the horizon and eventually faded from view, there's a distinct sparkle, akin to a shootign star.

He's covered from head to toe in water, while his hair is decorated with seaweed. Eventually, Sanoke settles back at the usual spot, allowing the salty water to flow onto the ground.

". . What in the world is this guy talking about? Intrusion is a word, it ain't none of that," Sanoke murmured. He pauses for a bit, aiming to decipher what Erebus was rambling about -- then it donned upon him.

"Oh. He's one of those pretty-talking people. Like. . a gothic shakesphere. . " he murmurs, before turning towards Suitengu. 

"Yeah, kid. If you want, I can show you some after school specials they used to make me watch. It can interchangeably be used for rogues or strangers. If someone comes all like. 'Hey kid. . Want power?' Just be like. 'No! I don't know you!' Then haul ass towards the south or whatever."

"Nooo. Kid, that dude oozes with like. . . bad intent. In fact, nah. I ain't your dad," casually responds, taking a step back. Suitengu wasn't his to rule over, after all. He was just some mook that the kid had just met off the street.* - Fri Sep 25 07:42:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
And so the training was to begin.

It had been a looonng while since Sanoke had ever bothered with working on his ninjutsu. Or fuuinjutsu for that matter. Still, his skill in both classes of techniques were as sharp as ever. 

Sadly, in his laziness, the chunnin -- or former chunnin -- had neglected to practice and refine his technique. First thing first came the mastery of the long-taught Exploding Underwater Mines. He vividly thinks back to the tutelage Noriko had given him years ago. 

Believe it or not, he greatly enjoyed the time to the two had together. It was his only regret that he hadn't spent more time with the former Mizukage -- before she fell into illness, and of course 'died.' The whole death story wasn't something Sanoke was exactly going to buy. Not until a legitimate body had been seen. "Tch. You're that paranoid, Noriko? To fake your death. . ." 

All thoughts aside, Sanoke eventually descends onto a knee. His hand reaches for a single scroll. As it's flick opened, contents begin to pour out by the galloon. Ironically, despite being poured out, each of the objects manage to land snuggly on the ground. They remain undamaged, and seemingly prepared for usage. All in al, they were what you'd expect for the endeavor. Paper, Ink, specialized-made glue, sisscors for cutting -- and a few other miscellenous items. 

That said, Sanoke is quick to buckle down, casually beginning  with the process. It is a fortunate thing, then, that he's recently learned the almighty. . .'Shadow Clone' technique. Upon sitting, both fingers press together, forming a Cross-like symbol. Immediately, chakra is building up, and pumping along his stomach. As the potency and overall ferociosity is gaining momentum, the teen eventually releases it from all points. Ever since learning, he's been using the skill frequently -- with little effects, considering his immense level of stamina.

Thus, it's a trivial tasks to split the chakra into four, thus making five different versions of himself. At once, they spread apart and proceed to work on creating Exploding Water Mines, along with refining just how efficiently they could be made. Serving two purposes, it would not only give him invaluable experience -- which the soul was dependent on to progress. But it'd also give a new arsenal of explosive tags to use at his leisure. 

They begin by taking out scissors and snipping away. This is a precise sequence, one that takes careful measuring to do properly. Sanoke keeps with the effort for several minutes, maybe even half an hour. By then, there are hundreds upon hundreds of bundles of papers. Each is cut in a rectangular shape, fitted to be used as a 'tag'. Be it a 'Sealing' tag, Explosive tag, or even an 'Elemental Tag'. This was the desired shape you'd want.

Finishing the first portion, Sanoke gathers the gunpowder-like tools, and stuffs it into the paper, before having it sealed. The five clones do this in unison with the creator, making the work rate efficient. Rapidly, like a refined factory, each of the sexy Turtle Hermits continue stuffing the gunpowder in. After sealing hundreds, Sanoke's -- and the clones' -- hands begin to glow with chakra.

A light-blue glow overwhelms his mitts, casting an illumination a few inches ahead. It would have first flowed from the forearms, before pooling together about each of his five digits. The massless chakra takes shape in the form of flame-like circles. While in the general shape of a sphere, sprinkles of energy occasionally bubbled around, due to the ethereal energy essentially being untame-able. Upon gaining control of the 'Finger Carving Seal', Sanoke presses a hand against the sheet.

It drills, releasing it's heated might onto the surface of the paper, and slowly begins to burn a pitch-black symbol onto the exterior. Casually, their hands move along, forcibly etching a Kanji. Like a blow-torched, the chakra eventually manages to make the encryptions smoothly stretch around the paper's length. Having done this, rather than sealing in chakra, the group continues to repeatily reproduce the sequence. Recall, there were hundreds of tags already prepared.. . So why not just knock out the writing portion for all of them this instant?

In another long-winded process, he's actually able to accurattely write on each of those damn pieces of paper. Now there were only two portions. ". . .Finallly! Finallllyy! This shit is boring, I remember when me and Noriko first had to make these shit for the village's defense. . . It was just as boring then," the teen reminisciences. Damn, this ninja really missed his teacher. For a moment, Sanoke damn near forests about the task at hand, and just spends a few minutes going through memory lane.

After an extended period of nostalgia, he actually manages to pry himself away from the feels, and blames the entire thing on 'ADD.' No doubt, however, the last two parts had to be completed. His hands press against the seals -- and the clones do the same thing -- chakra pumps from their palms, spreading evenly along the seal, and infusing itself within the glyph. The energy is stored easily, and the sequence is done repeatily -- just as the other three had been done again and again.

Then came the final portion. 

The hundreds of papers are balled together, forming giant spheres of destructive, explosive might. As the tags come together, he's gluing 'em with the special gluing formula. It's the 'icing' to the 'cake' if you will. Without this, the exploding water bomb would never work. But in hindsight, this wasn't the sole reason the technique was a success, as it actually utilized a specialized seal developed by Noriko herself. Having completed all of the steps, the naive but intelligent teenager is adding his own twist.

. . .You guessed it.

His patented Homing-Beacon technique. The skill that had made him so coveted by the previous Mizukage. Creeping over, his fingers again flare with 'blue' fire. His energy runs along the spheres again, each one being fashioned witrh the 'Beacon' half of the two-part technique. After completing, he's casually gathering up up the items and sealing them away for special use.* - Fri Sep 25 10:26:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) throws an arm over her shoulder. Nothing provocative -- just friendly.

"So what's up? I ain't seen you ever since you ditched that girl in a spar," the shinobi mutters. "Uh. .. Not sure if I asked ya before. But you do. . . do things other than sparring, training, or leeching techniques . . right?" He stifles a chuckle at the 'do-do' comment, immaturity evident. 

The question seems legitimate, considering he was growing tired of the inhabitants in Kirigakure's reluctance to actually live their lives. Was everything about power to them?* - Fri Sep 25 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) perked a brow. 

"Oh. So you gonna retire to?" the teen says with a simper. His right hand points towards his forehead -- which was distinctively headband-less. "Being a shinobi wasn't my thing either. . . It goes against my teachings. But. . . Why do you plan on leaving?" Sano inquires with legitimate curiosity. His eyes clearly conveyed his feelings on the matter.

"We could be traveling buddies."

For the time being, he says nothing else on the previous topic. But it was intended to actually get Kirie to spend time doing things -other- than training. Seriously, did no one in Kirigakure have any level of chill?* - Fri Sep 25 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
"That's what I'm saying--" He says with blatant excitement, clearly agreeing with Kirie's assessment. Who knew what the world had to offer? However, his excitement ceases upon hearing the rest of the girl's commentary.

"Uh. . .'follow you around'. . . Tch. You talking like you would run the show." Sanoke begins to have second thoughts. Perhaps he oughta just continue running around solo. "I mean, if we go on big bad adventures, it'd be a team effort. And I'm pretty sure I'm stronger than you, doubt I'd get in your way. You oughta be worried about getting in my way," the energetic warrior said with a snicker, though he's clearly serious. . . and mentally hopes not to offend by accident again.* - Fri Sep 25 19:38:27 2015

"Alright. . .Shunshin is something you'll probably like, since it's basically just Chakra Enhanced Speed. To do it, I form a single seal," he says, while also moving through a single hand sign. It's the typical formation, the 'Ram' hand seal. 

"The point is to build up enough chakra to account for your entire body. The energy is to go into your muscles. More specifically, the fast-twitch fibers, to increase the amount of power they can produce. In unison with the chakra's release, you move along the area, and thus will move at a heightened pace," Sanoke notes. It was a simple technique, sure enough. 

Had Kohaku activated her sharingan, she'd quite easily be able to read the specifics of Sanoke's chakra signature. At once, his body kicks off, and allows his frame to easily blur along the area. All in all? He was a good ten meters away. . .But something was amiss. Rather than standing tall, Sanoke was laying on the floor, saliva spilling out of his mouth like a gushing waterfall.

"Oi. . . . I. . Feel. . -- I'mma barf. . " His throat convulsed, and he gagged as his breakfast was preparing to exit.* - Sat Sep 26 00:36:16 2015

He had turned around, his face still green with sickness. Still, despite the now upset stomach, the instructor had to observe as the 'student' more or less sought to emulate his actions.

". . Blergh. Be careful . . This shit can make you feel bad if your body isn't used to it. . . Well -if- it isn't," he says, making it apparent that there could be actual master it. Although, very few actually were able to do so.

His observant eyes fall onto Kohaku's form, which forces a brief period of blushing to occur as the girl's bosom -- while small, bounced. However, that thought quickly falls out of mind once he sees that Kohaku actually has some innate talent.  Due to the surprise, Sanoke casually shakes off the sick symptoms, and looks on over to the dizzy kunoichi.

"Okay. . What the hell. You did that so easily."* - Sat Sep 26 00:57:36 2015

Kohaku, even as a little asian girl,actually had a decent flow and rap voice. "Woooah! You're a pretty good rapper. You can use some work, though," the teacher compliments while slapping the girl on the arm softly.

"I don't have any rhymes, sadly enough."* - Sat Sep 26 01:38:33 2015

The brief breeze spawned by Tetsu momentarily garners attention. Sanoke's analytical eyes glaze over, taking note of the strange shaping.

". . .It's fuuton release.  . . Although, that's a pretty damn high level of shape manipulation, " he murmurs. Kohaku's inquiry snaps him out of the analysis. "Uh. No more training.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Why should I. . .? - Sat Sep 26 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Because you should. - Sat Sep 26 02:03:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: One moment, Sanoke. - Sat Sep 26 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Uh-huh.. - Sat Sep 26 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Okay. - Sat Sep 26 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) just stares. He's surprised Tetsu broke that easily under pressure.

"Geez. Well. .  .At least you know how to get what you want?" He says towards Kohaku. 'Course, he probably wasn't going to let Tetsu get his ass kicked.* - Sat Sep 26 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: You wanna leave? - Sat Sep 26 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: You're really rude. - Sat Sep 26 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Only to pretty girls. - Sat Sep 26 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: That's even worse. - Sat Sep 26 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Isn't it~ - Sat Sep 26 02:15:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Me and sanoke will go do something. - Sat Sep 26 02:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: That actually hurts a bit. . . - Sat Sep 26 02:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Er. . . - Sat Sep 26 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looks ahead. He opens his mouth, prepared to speak. . . Then he sees a headband. They were shinobi, they had to handle issues themselves.

"Nah. Not going to hold their hands," he mutters.* - Sat Sep 26 02:22:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: That depends. - Sat Sep 26 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Would you care if I stayed? Or would I simply be forced into teaching you if I did? - Sat Sep 26 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I'll learn it later. - Sat Sep 26 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I don't care. - Sat Sep 26 02:29:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Sanoke, what should we do? - Sat Sep 26 02:32:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . . - Sat Sep 26 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) cheeks light up.

He isn't good with these things at all, hence why he  simply peeps rather than engage. "Errgh. . . You can get bet money if you want," Sanoke murmurs, prodding his fingers together in a nervous fashion. 

"I'll put ten grand. . "* - Sat Sep 26 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: My kimino and Five grand. - Sat Sep 26 02:37:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Sanoke. - Sat Sep 26 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: How's this work? - Sat Sep 26 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: The game is simple. We're playing to see who gets the highest roll -- Or do you all want to do lowest? - Sat Sep 26 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Or any variation of the game for that matter. .  - Sat Sep 26 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Highest. - Sat Sep 26 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: ... - Sat Sep 26 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well then. - Sat Sep 26 02:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Damn Sanoke. - Sat Sep 26 02:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Nice. - Sat Sep 26 02:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) takes a dice. He rolls a straight twelve.

"Hahaha!"* - Sat Sep 26 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Run me my money. - Sat Sep 26 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) 's face again lights up. The money is all sealed away, and he seems to be purposely looking away from Kohaku and all her glorious flatness.

A hand rises, covering the male's nose which was on the brink of bleeding just for the visual. 

"Thanks guy. . " Sanoke murmured meekly.* - Sat Sep 26 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? - Sat Sep 26 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: So you like to expose more of your beauty to us? - Sat Sep 26 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Beauty? - Sat Sep 26 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Uh-huh. - Sat Sep 26 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Mhm, Beauty, I already basically told you, that I found you to be pretty. - Sat Sep 26 02:51:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: What? Don't believe me? - Sat Sep 26 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: He's trying hard. Got spunk. - Sat Sep 26 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Are. . We going to keep gambling? <*Hand is still over nose*> - Sat Sep 26 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I could care less. - Sat Sep 26 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: And uh.. - Sat Sep 26 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I can give you guys my pants now if you want. - Sat Sep 26 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: If we continue. - Sat Sep 26 02:53:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Sat Sep 26 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Not even sure what to say to that. - Sat Sep 26 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) continues to keep his nose covered.

"I. . I guess makes sense. It's like people going to the beach in their bikini," he says with a stammer, still feeling a bit nervous at Kohaku's shirtlessness.* - Sat Sep 26 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Right. - Sat Sep 26 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Well I'll gamble my pants I guess. - Sat Sep 26 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'm kinda out of money. . .and pants and shoes is all I have left. . .so yea. - Sat Sep 26 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'll gamble an additional five grand. .  - Sat Sep 26 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Well. - Sat Sep 26 02:59:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Note to self. Never gamble again. - Sat Sep 26 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) takes out the dice and blows on them. With a flick of the wrist. .. they roll along the ground. . !"* - Sat Sep 26 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Well. - Sat Sep 26 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gives a glance to Kohaku as she strips down her pants. 

By now, the Turtle Sennin in training can't hold back anymore. A small inkling of blood seeps from his nose.

"The kittens.. .!" He thought, apparently being enarmored with the underwear design. Swiftly, he turns away, kneels, and glances towards the ground.

"I. . .I think I win. . ?"* - Sat Sep 26 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Can't take anymore. - Sat Sep 26 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Yep. - Sat Sep 26 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: You win. - Sat Sep 26 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: T-turtle bra. .  - Sat Sep 26 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Well. - Sat Sep 26 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Sat Sep 26 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I guess I'll bet my bra next. - Sat Sep 26 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Or my shoes. - Sat Sep 26 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) 's face becomes entirely red, much like a tomato once Kohaku suggests her bra.

"...! I don't think that'll. . . be necessary."* - Sat Sep 26 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Must not. . . Lose control. - Sat Sep 26 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Alright. - Sat Sep 26 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I get this odd feeling I'm an awkward third wheel somehow. . .hm.. - Sat Sep 26 03:08:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I wanted to keep going. . . - Sat Sep 26 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Alright. - Sat Sep 26 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I might have lied. . .I kinda want my money back. - Sat Sep 26 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I have a bit more. - Sat Sep 26 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Let's go again then, you two. - Sat Sep 26 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Come on. - Sat Sep 26 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Come onnn. - Sat Sep 26 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: I liked this bra to. - Sat Sep 26 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Damn. - Sat Sep 26 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: What. . .Will you bet then. . ? K-keep the bra. - Sat Sep 26 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Sanoke, roll. - Sat Sep 26 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I'll keep my bra. - Sat Sep 26 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Ah well. - Sat Sep 26 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . .! - Sat Sep 26 03:09:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Tetsu wins. - Sat Sep 26 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) meekly tosses over five grand. He turns, eyes-widened as Kohaku is apparently going to strip further. His body is shaking, and he honestly debates on fleeing.* - Sat Sep 26 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I'm good. - Sat Sep 26 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: It's a bit drafty. - Sat Sep 26 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Sat Sep 26 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) has lost it. He's growing too aroused, and feels too willing to go cop a feel. Thus, with blood trickling down his nose, and his face completely reddened, he forms a single seal.

POof. With Shunshin, the boy is far gone.* - Sat Sep 26 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hm. - Sat Sep 26 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Right. - Sat Sep 26 03:15:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Yes? - Sat Sep 26 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: One last bet Kohaku? - Sat Sep 26 03:16:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: If I win, you have to go on a d-date with me. . . - Sat Sep 26 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) returns after cleaning up his nose.
