"Anywho. Gotta go help Mirai with something. Talk to you guys later? Bye, Sensei, Mizora, Chikyu." After giving a nod, he'd briskly head off to a more private area.* - Wed Nov 11 02:43:24 2015

He suddenly brings both hands into the air, forcing a clap. "Alright. This is the base-leveled technique. I'm sure given how smart you are, you're probably familiar with the chakra-type known as 'Yang Release.' It's imperative to all of my special non-elemental techniques since it can manipulate the body in special, peculiar ways."

With a single thought, chakra visibly fumes from his form.

"Thankfully, the technique is basic level. What I want you to do is focus on building up a thick gathering of chakra. From there, you guide it upward, infusing the release of energy within each strand of your hair. Given that your is long, you should have an easier time, and see that the jutsu is more useful. Regardless, once the chakra is place, you begin wiith manipulate it's properties," Sanoke explains. It was a simple process.

From the viel, particles fo energy clearly guide itself onto his snow-tinted mane. In time, the lifeless part of Sanoke's body sudden gains life as the physical embodiment of his chakra commands such. 

"From there, you just manipulate the properties with a thought, making it more. . . malleable and durable. So it's easier to stretch and harder to avoid. With that, you just push it forward, wrapping along the limbs of an opponent. To train, you can use a seal. However, as you gain experience, the technique can be employed via pure chakra control."* - Wed Nov 11 03:23:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) rolled his eyes.

The technique left him a bit impressed, although he's still well in the belief that Mirai is getting a little too confident. "Eh. You can have that technique. Like I said. . .I got a much better one. Want to see?"

Of course, he goes to show off immediately, rather than wait for a response.

Two to three seals are performed in the blink of an eye. This produces an even larger unleash of chakra, that pools around in his hair. It forces Sanoke's moderate-length hair to spread further down, moving even below his bum and thus granting him a further range of attack. With relative ease, the chunnin commands the gathering of fur to be sent forward, blitzing ahead to the wall formation.

It punches against the wall, and due to the now steel-like composition, punches it. Rocks flow from the mountain top, and a large, seven foot dent is left int he aftermath. "I call this. . Great Lion's Maw! 'Cause. . . Where I do it, things look like a Lion Face. It's strong for binding things, and can even be used to attack head on. Further more, I can crush my opponents within it. Heh. . . "

"Mirai. I derived it from that jutsu. If you want to learn this skill, you have to get proficient. Anywho, let's head back into town," he replies. Quickly, the male swoops Mirai on up, flickering from sight and going back over the wall.* - Wed Nov 11 04:41:10 2015

A single handseal is formed, allowing for chakra to spill on over.

It enters the male's nervous system, attacking the portion of the brain that embodied your will. Assuming Shira's mental fortitude was weaker, the young lad finds himself unable to oppose or answer non-truthfully to the questions delivered.
