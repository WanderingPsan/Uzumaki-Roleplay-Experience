<br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) raised a brow. What a mysterious  way to send a message.

"A group of fuuinjutsu users. . .I'm guessing for collaboration techniques. I'd like to help, but my fuuinjutsu isn't quite at his level. I'd need to get better and stronger at it first. . . " the boy whispered to himself.Instaneously after the contents had been read, it bursts into flames, dissipating into nothingness. "I'll see what I can do. That's just something else I'll have to work on then,"Sanoke  muttered aloud.* - Thu Oct  8 11:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: So Lera. You bailed on helping me with my Doton the other day. What up with that? - Thu Oct  8 11:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sorry...I can help now if you want? - Thu Oct  8 11:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hah, no need to apologize. But yeah, if you got time. - Thu Oct  8 12:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I might as well learn my jutsu from the scrolls I have with you guys. - Thu Oct  8 12:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mmk. - Thu Oct  8 12:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Lead the way I guess - Thu Oct  8 12:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . . - Thu Oct  8 12:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: He always got time to come. But bailed once she did. - Thu Oct  8 12:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: I see you. - Thu Oct  8 12:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Let's roll. - Thu Oct  8 12:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Uh...what Doton jutsu do you know? - Thu Oct  8 12:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: None. I'm having trouble even building up Doton chakra. - Thu Oct  8 12:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh - Thu Oct  8 12:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Uh... - Thu Oct  8 12:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hrm... - Thu Oct  8 12:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Okay...I have an idea. - Thu Oct  8 12:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: For some reason . . . I still feel unmotivated to train. - Thu Oct  8 12:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Probably got sick of it recently. - Thu Oct  8 12:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We can't really afford to rest - Thu Oct  8 12:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . I know but damn . . . Makes it hard to train for me. - Thu Oct  8 12:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I might just leave again. - Thu Oct  8 12:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Sorry. - Thu Oct  8 12:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Not feeling up to it again. - Thu Oct  8 12:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: See you later. - Thu Oct  8 12:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blinks. He looked ahead as the dark grey nature of the Kunai darkened further. It was almost as if the chakra had given the object a pain job. As commanded, a hand rests onto the edge of the Kunai. 

Chakra is kneaded together, and pumps through the tenketsu along those fingers. As it pours, it runs along the Kunai's sharp edge, and intertwins with Lera's own flow of energy. Along with this, Sanoke possessed sensory ability that gave him greater insight on how the jutsu worked. 

His mind drifts off a bit, analyzing the manipulation of the chakra flow bit by bit. "Boy. . That's an interesting technique you got there. . . I'm going to assume that it's Doton nature .. . The steel. . . It got harder, but how. . . Why?" The intelligent, yet elementally inept, inquires, captivated by the nifty application of the jutsu. Under most circumstances, he wasn't usually willing to battle or spar on a daily basis, but with Lera's versatile skillset, it made him wonder just how far she had come along.

Putting those thoughts aside, his flow ceases. Just from that experience, he had gained a greater understanding of elemental jutsu in general, but moreso the Doton affinity. With hopeful eyes, Sanoke awaited Lera's explanation. Certainly she could provide some verbal insight to help the elementally challenged earn enlightenment, correct?* - Thu Oct  8 12:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The Doton element is naturally percieved as 'hard' by envision it not just covering this kunai, but saturating it from the inside out. I can increase the overal density of the kunai. - Thu Oct  8 12:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thus, making it more durable. - Thu Oct  8 12:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Theoretically, it works with any object. - Thu Oct  8 12:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Though that requires varying degrees of skill. - Thu Oct  8 12:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||And suddenly. . It all made sense.

"I get. . I get it. So Doton Release. . . It's all about making things harder. . .The harder the better-- Pause. . " he thought to himself, stifling a laugh at his own immaturity. "--Pay attention, Sanoke, gosh. This isn't about stupid jokes. . . It's about using this elemental release correct. If what she says is true, the elemental release of Doton is all about modifying the hardness of things. . .Usually earth."

His eyes shut, imagining a flow of chakra that moved along the landscape. He could imagine the chakra itself being implanted onto the very structure of an object, namely the ground around him, and being manipulated into several different jutsus. It wasn't that hard of an idea, and definitely proved to be a topic he could come to understand fully if given enough guidance on the subject. 

Going into one of his 'trances', SAnoke opts to sit on the floor indian style. Both hands press together, forming the almighty 'Snake' hand sign, which was a seal commonly associated with Doton Release. Even as a loser in terms of elemental ability, even Sanoke knew that much -- he studied. By then, his chakra is being built up, enough to form a thin or light aura about his person. 

The flowing chakra soon moves down, aiming to latch onto the rocks below him. . But to no avail. Restlessly, the former chunnin is at the task at hand, pouring endless streams of his energy onto the sandy, hot surface below. It's a sequence that seems to be fruitless and ever-present. After the ten minute mark, however. ..  There was a change! Indeed, a small sprinkle of chakra manages to bind with a rock, and forces it to. . . ! Shake a bit. It was easy to miss. Assuming Lera had stuck around, both of the teen's eyes shoot open.

"Alright. I got this. Teach me your strongest Doton technique. Mmm, maybe like a giant meteor that comes from the sky? That'd be pretty badass. . ."* - Thu Oct  8 12:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well . . . Zenaki is pissed. - Thu Oct  8 12:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ....I don't know anything like that. - Thu Oct  8 12:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Lets start with something simple shall we...? - Thu Oct  8 12:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And why kilm..? - Thu Oct  8 12:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: She found Suitengu's corpse. - Thu Oct  8 12:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Suitengu...that kid hokage? - Thu Oct  8 12:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: He's dead?? - Thu Oct  8 12:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Suitengu . . . Son of Zetsumo . . . He's dead. - Thu Oct  8 12:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Thu Oct  8 12:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Zenaki has no family anymore. - Thu Oct  8 12:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Jeez... - Thu Oct  8 12:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *sigh* - Thu Oct  8 12:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Also . . . Just me or Seisuke has been gone for a long while? - Thu Oct  8 12:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ....He has, I'm getting worried honestly... - Thu Oct  8 12:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: When was the last time you saw him? - Thu Oct  8 12:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: A few weeks ago.. - Thu Oct  8 12:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Long time. - Thu Oct  8 12:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah - Thu Oct  8 12:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm probably going to ask Pops If I can go look for him soon. - Thu Oct  8 12:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) glances down. He's startled as the river of mud is casually spawned. 

"Alright. . .Now I'm confused again. Why can this make mud again? Ithought mud was like water and earth combined,"he says with an irritated sigh. Why was elemental jutsu so annoying?!* - Thu Oct  8 12:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Heh...yeah, its a little complicated...not sure how I can explain it honestly. - Thu Oct  8 12:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But the way I see it - Thu Oct  8 12:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Is you're not controlling water. - Thu Oct  8 12:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Just mixing earth with the moisture present in the air and ground. - Thu Oct  8 12:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Sounds hard. . . Walk me through it? - Thu Oct  8 12:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thats the best way I can explain it... - Thu Oct  8 12:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yes. But it's better to watch it visually in action.  - Thu Oct  8 12:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Sharp-eyed, Sanoke absorbed whatever he could from the situation. He wasn't some genius, but the boy really -was intelligent. Sadly, much of your skill as a shinobi depended on your talent, which he held very little of -- in regards to elemental techniques. 

Going ahead with the demonstration, the student seeks to mimick the master. His hands fall into a single seal, releasing heaps of Doton-based chakra -- no matter how irregular and ill-formed the gathering had been -- onto the ground below. Just as Lera had instructed, he's mixing the little bits of moisture in the air to form mud from seemingly nowhere. Rather, he was -trying-  to make it transform into mud.

Crsp! Chish! 

The ground, the flooring made up of thousands of sandy grains, shook and possessed actual movements. The sudden shiftiness was as a result of the concentrated moisture adding to the weight.  Once more, due to the high concentration of chakra, a viel or aura manifests, kicking up very minor gusts of wind. 

In no time, the moisture continues to build up, making the floor damp. In addition to this, upon looking closer, there was a spec of mud that had formulated due to the sheer concentration. On the flipside. . . Judging by his massive outpour of chi, and the very minor -- perhaps even un-noticeable success -- the jutsu was far from complete or even battle ready. Still, this was by far the closest her had ever came to being called an elementalist. Leaping up in joy, Sanoke strikes a pose.

A jubilant smile and thumbs up is given. The grin is widening by the second, forcing his pearly whites to shine in the sun light. .  .It sparkles, gleaming, completing his trademark pose. "Wow! I did it, finally learned my first elemental ninjutsu. .  Uh, on a scale of one to ten. How useful is this jutsu for battle?"* - Thu Oct  8 13:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Er...generally...more useful for combination attacks. - Thu Oct  8 13:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Combos like. . ? - Thu Oct  8 13:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmm...like this., - Thu Oct  8 13:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looked on, eyes dialating with excitement. Lera had certainly come a long way, and learned a plethora of different ninjutsu -- much more than he had.

"Geez! You know a lot of shit. I'm going to assume you're tired. But you and I need to go one on one sometime. I wonder if I can still knock you around as easy as I've done before. . . Probably not, you might even best me," Sanoke admits, though still remaining curious as can be.* - Thu Oct  8 13:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hrm. Yeah, we'll have to try later. - Thu Oct  8 13:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Though I'm not really tired... - Thu Oct  8 13:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Good shit, though! I think I finally understand Doton Release a little more. . . Probably won't ever be great it,' - Thu Oct  8 13:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: But's a good thing to have, y'know? - Thu Oct  8 13:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm, its very good for defense. Ocasionally good in defense. - Thu Oct  8 13:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Precisely! And for strategy. - Thu Oct  8 13:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm exactly. - Thu Oct  8 13:26:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You done lost me again. - Thu Oct  8 13:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah...the technique behind it is pretty advance. - Thu Oct  8 13:27:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Sounds useful. - Thu Oct  8 13:27:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm it is pretty useful. - Thu Oct  8 13:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I still need to make an ace-technique. . . Or trademark. - Thu Oct  8 13:30:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm not sure. I toyed with the idea of combining my elements, like I've seen other people do. - Thu Oct  8 13:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Just not sure how I'd go about it. - Thu Oct  8 13:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I need an ace technique as well. - Thu Oct  8 13:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Huh? Combining elements is genetic. - Thu Oct  8 13:33:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) wastes no time. After whisking Mirai off her feet, he enters his home, setting her down.

"Eh. . . So. . I think I've done some bad things. Yesterday. . . I saw a kid dead. But he had the same type of eyes that I did. . .I don't know what came over m -- But I took his eyes for myself, and assimilated it into my own," Sanoke notes, taking off his glasses.

Mirai would notice some changes, as it now held four rings, rather than one. You can tell, the fact that he actually went as low as to assimilating Suitengu's power -- meaning the guy that killed -- for his own personal gain was killing him. ". . .I know how you feel -- Do you think I'm a bad person for it? It was like these eyes just. . . forced me into taking his strength. It's like they want to be complete," the male confesses.* - Thu Oct  8 19:46:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Just like that, a large portion of the guilt left his body.

"Good. . . It goes further than that, though. . . I felt strange ever since I did that. It's weird, but these weird eyes gave me a new power. . .Something completely unrelated to eyes in general," the teen explains. No seals are required.

Chakra burns on the inside, and his doujutsu again is activated. From the shoulders? Two extra appendages each sprout from seemingly nowhere. Sure, it wasn't the most useful of skills considering taijutsu wasn't hisstrong point, but it had it's perks. ". . .Do you need. . . a hand?" Ba-dum-tssh! He stares, awaiting laughter.* - Thu Oct  8 19:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) smirked. He felt pretty good that Mirai seemed dazzle by his technique. As his ego soared, the arms retract. 

"Huh. . .? - -- Oh yeah. There are some more rinnegan users out there. I need to keeep training since I feel more will come after me to take my eyes. . .Just like that kid did to Taiga. In anycase. . . Just wanted to share this with you. Didn't want ya to think ill of me for doing something similar to my comrades back in Kiri," Sanoke says with a pleasant smile.

A giant weight had just been lifted off his shoulder. Having settled the guilt issue, the boy moves to lift Mirai back up bridal style. "Anywho. Let's get ya back tothe square to bug Koji for some training. -- What did you think of my proposal to have a festival? The village needs to get more lively." Before long, he's speeding ahead, ready to go back to the public domain.* - Thu Oct  8 20:19:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) frowns. He disliked being restricted from going to other villages. Once at the training field, Sanoke's hand falls into a single seal, he waits eager to see how Mirai would respond to the next string of actions.

"Alright. . . Look at me, please."

Assuming Mirai had complied, she'd fall for his trigger. Chakra flowed from his finger tips, and moved through her bodies, entering the brain. It would induce a relatively simple genjutsu, one that homed in one some's worse fears and made it a reality. As a distraction, sand is briefly kicked up, giving Sanoke an avenue to speed away. Before long, she was all by herself. . . seemingly.

He's perched towards the end of the mountain, his doujutsu blaring to view how long it'd take the girl to get rid of the genjutsu. 'if only I could see her worse fear firsthand," Sanoke muttered, as that was something that made him greatly curious.* - Thu Oct  8 22:08:12 2015

"Those grudges, though."* - Thu Oct  8 22:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looked ahead. The screams pierce through the skies, and again makes him feel guilty. "It's a genjutsu! Just use your Kai to break it!" Sanoke urges, as he couldn't bare the thought -- let alone the sight -- of Mirai being forced to endure her worse fears for god knows how long. Already, his body was primed and ready to rush over if the Hokuma hadn't taken his advice. Chakra is already being built up in preparation for an external Kai to force the release.* - Thu Oct  8 23:49:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) glances ahead. He had missed Mirai being able to break his genjutsu. 

"Good! Alright, Mirai. I can show you a few more techniques. Considering you're still kind of a rookie, why don't you choose from the following. Shunshin -- which is just fast-paced movements, or Kage Shuriken technique, a jutsu that lets yo uhide your shuriken behind another. It's good for surprise attacks," he notes in hope of getting Mirai to pick up additional skills to build up experience.* - Fri Oct  9 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Can we do this elsewhere? - Fri Oct  9 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: It's crowded here. - Fri Oct  9 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Alright. - Fri Oct  9 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) grabs once more.

"I'll catch you all later." He disappears in a plume of smoke.* - Fri Oct  9 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Can I learn both? - Fri Oct  9 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Sure. Which would you want to learn first? - Fri Oct  9 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Doesn't matter. - Fri Oct  9 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Alright. He moves back, and withdraws a large gathering of shurikens. 

"The technique really is just about precision and control. You have to throw it in a particularly fashion. The first shuriken leads the way, while the second is to line up in accordance to where the shadow is. Likewise, the second must be thrown at a speed superior to the first so that it can catch up, and eventually catch your opponent off guard."

It was a simple technique, but still required near super-human perception and control. Of course, this was something most genin-level shinobi were already -- superhuman, at least by real world standards.

Talk was cheap, and thus Sanoke moves to demonstrate the Shurikenjutsu-based technique firsthand. He gestures for Mirai to activate her byakugan to improve her perception. Assuming she had followed his instruction, the shinobi takes a step forward. The second his body is moving ahead, a hand flicks forward, sending one shuriken richocheting through the skies. It has some torque and rotates swiftly, making it much like a common buzzsaw.  

Following this motion would be a second shuriken that was coming right behind it. Sanoke made sure to have thrown it in Mirai's general direction to ensure that she could see the magic of the technique. Indeed, the goal was to catch an opponent via surprise as they'd notice the second Shuriken late, and this would have less time to react or avoid. Before long, the two projectiles lodge into a nearby cactus.

"Simple, right?"* - Fri Oct  9 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||The technique had been handled effectively. Speeding over, his hand grasps at the wo shurikens lodged into the cactus. Once in hand, they're handed on over for Mirai to use herself.

"Overall, considering your perception, I don't think you'll have any trouble. Practice this a few times, then we'll move on to teach ya the shunshin. That'll give ya a lot of skills to work on, and make you more versatile than just hand to hand combat," Sanoke instructs. By then, he takes a seat, and gives a watchful eye to carefully guide the Hyuuga through her training regiment. 

As a D-ranked technique, it definitely wouldn't take too long to get a grasp of. Mastery? Well that was an entirely different monster.* - Fri Oct  9 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) smiled. Mirai was getting good, and fast at that. 

"Alright! I'll teach ya the next jutsu, okay? It's called shunshin. Once more, your eyes will be able to help you since it can view my chakra system was it's going to work," Sanoke remarks. Already, his speed was vast, and could often be confused with Shunshin itself. But that was far from the case.

Both hands come together, forming a single seal.

As that happens, chakra is being built up along his system. "Y'see, for this jutsu to work, you need to build up a mass of chakra. Enough to account for your entire body. Have the energy feed into your cells, and they'll use that power to increase their level of efficiency. It's that simple," he notes. This was just a D-rank technique, after all. Of course, there was downsides. 

Before even explaining such, Sanoke activates the jutsu, and kicks off the ground. Due to his own natural speed, and skill in the jutsu, his body appears to quite literally be teleporting. In no time, he ends up towards Mirai's rear -- appearing a tad bit sick or dizzy. "Get it? As you release the chakra, your body is to move in real time, giving you added speed. Although. . .if you'ren ot good and try to use it repeatily, you'll just make yourself sick. It's possible to gain enough skill to make this no longer an issue, though. . ."

That settled, he moves away, giving the beaut more than enough room to work on the jutsu for her own time.* - Fri Oct  9 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Being careful, he goes to form a Kage Bunshin.

A single seal is declared, crating a doppleganger that rushes on over to the gates. Hopefully this was no trap.* - Fri Oct  9 08:09:48 2015

"In the meantime. . That technique! Help me, help me, help me, pleasse!" He says, rushing on over to Kirie, and grabbing onto one of her legs. Of course, his senses were trained for any chakra outpours.

"Yo, yo. Morning sunshine. Y'heard what happened in Kumo? That dude, Kensho went off, and wrecked so maannny people! It was crazy," the turtle summoner declared, making small talk. His cranium shifts on over to the right, taking note of Gadkin's arrival.

A wave is given to the stranger.

"Yo, yo. A tourist I take it? Welcome to the village hidden in the sand---" He pauses, thinking on the comment. Why the hell was this called a Hidden Village if it was so out in the open? That said, assuming Gadkin had responded, his view is tilted back to Lera, awaiting to see her response.

"-- Oh yeah, he died too, though."* - Fri Oct  9 12:09:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blinks. So they were playing that game?

"Hng! So what is she doing? This is either ot keep me at bay, or to have me rush in mindlessly into an attack. . . Either way, this shit has to be destroyed. . ." the former chunnin muttered, while wearing a smile. To think, this was the same weakling he had encountered years ago in Kirigakure, one that didn't have much jutsu to claim as her own.

Regardless, as she developed, so did the hermit.

He wastes no time, retrieving a set of scrolls, and whipping it forward. "I shouldn't need to call Ganba for this. . . that's for sure. Even if his ability to dig would be so valuable right now. . . I'll just blow it all up. . ." With chakra being applied, the scroll's seal is unleashed. Dozens upon dozens of explosive mines were being expelled out. They'd crash against the surface of the Corridor, releasing explosive-natured chakra. Due to the clusters that made up the 'Explosion Mine', and the sheer abundance, there was a clear chance of the wall actually faultering.

As they stacked up, the earthly produced technique would begin to crackle before a decently whole had been produced. Inadvertently, a mine or two manages to slip in, perhaps endangering Lera herself? "C'mon! Get outta there!"* - Fri Oct  9 12:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Boom! Boom! 

That was that, even as the Earthen Dome wasn't completely destroyed, it had served it's purpose -- that was to get Lera the heck out. Taking advantage of his doujutsu, a quick glance is given through, and due to his ability to detect chakra, his visage of Lera is a lot more clear than she'd be left to believe.

". . Underground. . . Hopefully she doesn't go too far, that way I can still keep track of her. . -- And got to watch out for the Head Hunter, since that combination is so damn obvious," the warrior declared to himself with a giddy grin. This brought back memories, she had tried to use that same tactic years prior. It didnt' work then, and it definitely won't work now.

It's by this point that the teen regrets not working on his Doton affinity more closely. If he had, he could bring the battle to her. Two hands come together, prepping chakra for the next course of action.* - Fri Oct  9 12:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blinks. 

"Shadow Clone jutsu, such a nifty technique," Sanoke remarks. Of course, he wasn't all too alarmed. Even as they were made, each clone was significantly weaker than the actual user, much to Sanoke's delight.

Although, he too knew the technique, and held knowledge to assist in him taking advantage of their multiplying effect. 

"Let's make this into a clone war then!" Both hands press together, allowing three Kage Bunshins to pop up, bring Sanoke's own numbering to four in total. It was true, the clones spawned weren't as power as the actual shinobi. . . Yet that wasn't the point. Indeed, with each clone spawned, they inherited all of the warrior's supplies -- even his scrolls. Which were equipped with various weapons.

"Fuuinjutsu Style! All Out Weapon Barrage!" No time is wasted at all. Luckily, this is a spar, so no lethal weapons are actually used. Instead, as the clones press forward, whipping out yet another scroll, hunddreds of dulled, wooden ninja tools are being shot out. Despite there being no chance of lethal impaling, each were equipped with specialized tags, just incase this girl sought to use one of those nifty ass defensive doton techniques.

"In before going under the ground again. . "* - Fri Oct  9 13:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: chew on that... - Fri Oct  9 13:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||All according to the plan. 

"Wind. . Called it," he says, knowing that the best way to deal with an onslaught of weapons was to just blow it away. Sadly, none of this meant anytthing to the experiennced shinobi. As the gale pushes forward, his hands frantically weave through five seals and presses against the atmosphere. A plume of smoke clouds the area, and in no time, a  giant turtle had been conjured.

You know the one! Ganba!

Due to his weight and durability, most of the assault proves to be futile. Hidden within his protective shell and infront of Sanoke, each of the blows are absorbed. From the mud river, up to the Vaccum Spheres -- which could be lethal, mind you. Frowning, the hermit is a bit ticked. "Geez. . . To use a jutsu like that in a spar?!" Of course, the two -- meaning Sanoke and Ganba -- require very little talking to work in sync.

Without a word, Ganba's shell is flooded with chakra. "Roll out!" It's sitting upright, and speeding ahead at immense speed, aiming to ram right through the ensemble of clones. Using this as cover, the former chunnin launches a simple tag to ignite the flammable gas prematurely. Yes, Sanoke was familiar with the skill.

All the same, his body kicks off the ground, moving at breakneck speed. The path? Lera. Assuming capability of getting close, he launches a fierce haymaker right towards her mouth, hoping to send her body flying.* - Fri Oct  9 13:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Good. Most of those pesky clones had been dealt with.

Ganba's maw is shifted towards Lera, his cheeks puffing up in preparation for a Teppodama. Meanwhile, Sanoke is hot in pursuit, his body easily able to speed up the mountaintops, chasing after the girl. 

Yet there was something wrong. 

After pausing, he looks on curiously. "Uh. . ? Are ya done fighting? Things were just getting exciting," the boy complains.* - Fri Oct  9 13:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ehhh...I'm not feeling it. I don't think i could beat you without killing you - Fri Oct  9 13:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Her chakra is getting low too. She won't be able to maintain that flight for that long. - Fri Oct  9 13:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: I'm still at 70% ho -omit- - Fri Oct  9 13:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Tch. i mean, if I didn't know better, I'd say you were! How dare ya using such a lethal technique in a spar? - Fri Oct  9 13:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I only use those techniques if I'm sure the person I'm fighting can handle it - Fri Oct  9 13:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And you did. - Fri Oct  9 13:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Besides, I have way more lethal techniques than that. - Fri Oct  9 13:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeah right. - Fri Oct  9 13:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No really, Imagine everything in that area on fire. - Fri Oct  9 13:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm? What jutsu would that be? - Fri Oct  9 13:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I combine my jutsu remember? - Fri Oct  9 13:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Wind and Fire is quite potent ya know. - Fri Oct  9 13:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh. Fire and Wind, eh. - Fri Oct  9 13:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Especially when you have a lot of clones using them all at once - Fri Oct  9 13:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Your clones. - Fri Oct  9 13:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Are weaker than the original. - Fri Oct  9 13:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yep I know. - Fri Oct  9 13:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Would be better to just learn how to use jutsus quickly on your own. - Fri Oct  9 13:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But the overall combination of multiple Fire and Wind jutsu - Fri Oct  9 13:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Is powerful - Fri Oct  9 13:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Otherwise I'd just counter with Suiton. - Fri Oct  9 13:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Also. - Fri Oct  9 13:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blinks.

He's mildly impressed, although moreso with himself. The girl had a lot more resources to learn from than him, yet Sanoke still remained competitive. "Damn, you know a lot of shit. I saw Old Man HAssan use that," he replies, looking the girl up and down.

"Although I don't forsee it doin' ya anygood. Unless you work on your taijutsu," he replies casually. Even then,Sanoke was very envious, and it partially showed. "Geez. I need to learn some badass shit, though."* - Fri Oct  9 13:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Wonder if that can get through Ganba's defenses. - Fri Oct  9 13:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Dunno. - Fri Oct  9 13:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Pretty sure he wouldn't apreciate it if we tried though right? - Fri Oct  9 13:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) |The turtle shakes his head.

"It can't. You need higher level shit than that to mess with me, a true boss of Kame Cove," he boasts, while lazily sitting on the floor.* - Fri Oct  9 13:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: .... - Fri Oct  9 13:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *shrug* - Fri Oct  9 13:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, I'm not a taijutsu specialist. - Fri Oct  9 13:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But I probably will practice that at some point. - Fri Oct  9 13:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Good fight, though. You've definitely gotten stronger. - Fri Oct  9 13:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Not strong enough yet. - Fri Oct  9 13:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: And what is strong enough? - Fri Oct  9 13:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nothing - Fri Oct  9 13:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: What. . ? - Fri Oct  9 13:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nothing is strong enough - Fri Oct  9 13:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The moment you tell yourself your strong, you stop getting stronger. Right? - Fri Oct  9 13:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Not really. I think I'm pretty strong, doesn't stop me from tryin' to get better. - Fri Oct  9 13:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *shrug* Welp, theres always someone better. - Fri Oct  9 13:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: True that. - Fri Oct  9 13:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Anyway. - Fri Oct  9 13:43:28 2015
