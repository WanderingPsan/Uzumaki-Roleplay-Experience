<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: More chakra, Bigger breath, hold it, let them mingle, then let it all out at once! - Mon Nov  9 11:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Two people want to teach me how to use swords, that lady wants to teach me how to use a fan...I don't know who else. - Mon Nov  9 11:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: An unpopular one would be Shurikenjutsu. - Mon Nov  9 11:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: It could work well in tandem with your medical knowledge. - Mon Nov  9 11:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: What is that? - Mon Nov  9 11:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Weaponry. - Mon Nov  9 11:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Hm... - Mon Nov  9 11:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: So ...weapons that aren't swords? - Mon Nov  9 11:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Throwing weapons. The basic types being Shurikens, Kunai, and Senbons. - Mon Nov  9 11:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: That sounds like the most boring of all the shinobi professions. - Mon Nov  9 11:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: I told ya it was unpopular. - Mon Nov  9 11:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Why suggest it then? - Mon Nov  9 11:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: I got some cool ideas for it though. -- Because it can potentially be very powerful. - Mon Nov  9 11:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: For example. In the body, along side Tenketsu, there are pressure points. - Mon Nov  9 11:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: With enough precision, if you strike one, you can be pretty lethal to an opponent. - Mon Nov  9 11:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Plus. I got some cool ideas, I'll probably never get around to developing it, though. - Mon Nov  9 11:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: One of my best Fuuinjutsu techniques can be described as Shurikenjutsu too. - Mon Nov  9 11:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: What is a Tenketsu? - Mon Nov  9 11:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: A Tenketsu is. . . Uh. Well, along your body there's an invisible pathway of chakra. It's what lets your energy spread along to every inch of your body. - Mon Nov  9 11:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: On the pathway, there are needle-sized nodes or ciruits. - Mon Nov  9 11:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Oh... but how would attacking that physically do anything? - Mon Nov  9 11:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Basically, its what allows you to release your chakra. - Mon Nov  9 11:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: I made the comparison between Tenketsu and pressure points because -- Well. Tenketsu are metaphysical. - Mon Nov  9 11:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Pressure points are physical. - Mon Nov  9 11:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I understand the pressure points of course. - Mon Nov  9 11:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I'm a nurse after all. - Mon Nov  9 11:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Right. So then you'd know the potential value to being able to target them. But other than Shurikenjutsu. . .Uh. - Mon Nov  9 11:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: I'd say Genjutsu, but that sucks as a main form of fighting. - Mon Nov  9 11:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...no I won't use genjutsu. - Mon Nov  9 11:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I've....seen the effects it has long term on people. - Mon Nov  9 11:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Hrm. Well that's all the forms. Genjutsu, Taijutsu, Kenjutsu, and Elemental Ninjutsu. - Mon Nov  9 11:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Well. . the main common forms. There are a bunch of non-elemental techniques, but not many people know or use them. Things like my hair attacks. - Mon Nov  9 11:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Long term effects on the -mind-...the worst way to kill a person....without killing them. - Mon Nov  9 11:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Oh yeah. But those types of genjutsu users are rare. - Mon Nov  9 11:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: It just...isn't what I want to use. - Mon Nov  9 11:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Yeah. Not my cop of tea either. - Mon Nov  9 11:41:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: T-Thanks Marrisa. - Mon Nov  9 11:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Hrm, I dunno. I think every shinobi could benefit from being able to use their element properly. Maybe that? - Mon Nov  9 11:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: The registration for becoming a shinobi had me take a test. They said I could possibly use wind. - Mon Nov  9 11:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Wind. That's a very powerful element. Mayhaps you should take Marissa up on her offer. - Mon Nov  9 11:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Is it? - Mon Nov  9 11:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: On a side note, Lera would also be a good pick. - Mon Nov  9 11:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Mhm. It's versatile and offensively potent. - Mon Nov  9 11:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Learning how to use swords from her? - Mon Nov  9 11:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: What -- She didn't offer to show ya how to use a War Fan? - Mon Nov  9 11:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...she uses a fan too - Mon Nov  9 11:48:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Is it rare for her to be happy? - Mon Nov  9 11:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Hrm? She's usually chipper, yeah. Even with all the bad things that happens to her. - Mon Nov  9 11:52:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Men speaking to women, or women speaking to men is easier. It's easier because the chance that the other sex doesn't like the opposite sex is extremely slim. - Mon Nov  9 12:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: For a girl to go after a girl, or a male after a male... - Mon Nov  9 12:04:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Anyhow. - Mon Nov  9 12:06:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: She went out of her way to say 'they' instead of him. When she had been using the male pronoun the sentence before. - Mon Nov  9 12:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...I'm talking alot. - Mon Nov  9 12:09:10 2015

"It makes my head hurt sometimes."* - Mon Nov  9 12:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Yeah.....straight women do that. - Mon Nov  9 12:41:36 2015

A hand tosses on over to Hanae. "Sorry! We can go do a little training I guess."* - Mon Nov  9 12:59:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: As she is wearing masculine clothes, after all. - Mon Nov  9 13:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yes, Baka Sanoke. - Mon Nov  9 13:01:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) is smacked ontop of the head.

Beth holds superhuman strength for the occasion. He's sent skidding along the sand!* - Mon Nov  9 13:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Urgh.  . . - Mon Nov  9 13:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) wakes up after being knocked silly.

"Oi. . . That shell is doing you good. . I dunno how it made your arm so strong." A hand idly rubs his head.* - Mon Nov  9 13:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: This shell is nothing to me now. - Mon Nov  9 13:04:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: That was rude. - Mon Nov  9 13:05:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Any how off to create a new jutsu. - Mon Nov  9 13:06:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: I'll catch you later I guess. - Mon Nov  9 13:12:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Damn, blown off for jutsu. - Mon Nov  9 13:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) give the peace sign.

"It was talking to ya."

He grabs Hanae by the arm, and shunshins off. * - Mon Nov  9 13:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'll show ya my original technique after this too. - Mon Nov  9 13:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods.

"I got a fiance, actually."* - Mon Nov  9 13:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Oh wow. - Mon Nov  9 13:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Congrats. - Mon Nov  9 13:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Who is the lucky lady? - Mon Nov  9 13:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Mirai. - Mon Nov  9 13:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You've met her. - Mon Nov  9 13:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Is she the one that called me a bitch during our spar? - Mon Nov  9 13:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Mhm. White hair, big breasts. - Mon Nov  9 13:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Yeah she must be a handful. - Mon Nov  9 13:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Mhm. I love her anyway, though. - Mon Nov  9 13:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Indeed love is powerful force. - Mon Nov  9 13:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: -snickers- - Mon Nov  9 13:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Is she a freak in the sheets hmmm? - Mon Nov  9 13:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) scratches his nose awkwardly, cheeks growing red.

"Uhm. The. . . technique?"* - Mon Nov  9 13:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Don't side my question.  - Mon Nov  9 13:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: side step* - Mon Nov  9 13:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Then again your face tells it all. - Mon Nov  9 13:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: -laughs- - Mon Nov  9 13:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shakes off the flustered feeling.

He enters a kneel shortly after, eager to see what Hanae had planned. Of course, given Sanoke's special ability, he could still clearly see any build up or flow of chakra.

"Well. . . That was the big technique ya wanted to show off? Sounds cool. But you're talking like it isn't complete."* - Mon Nov  9 13:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) could clearly see the massive build up of chakra. His arms remained folded, but Sanoke makes no moves.

"This is taking sooo looonngg. . . "* - Mon Nov  9 13:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He doesn't take notice of the attempt to link.

Although, more likely than not, it would probably prove unsucessful. "C'mon, Hanae! I don't got all day!" He taps a foot impatiently against the ground as there seemed to be a whole lot of nothing. Aggitation was evident -- After all, she had promised a new technique to be shown. Yet for all that was apparent, nothing new had been discovered.* - Mon Nov  9 14:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) remained waiting with anticipation. Sadly, seconds crept up, developing into minutes. And as time continued to gon on, it become increasingly clear that Beth was unable to completely perform the technique she sought to develop.

Blood even trickled from her nose, no doubt due to the stress.

At once, Sanoke kicks off, cutting the distance between the two. "Sensei! Are you okay?"* - Mon Nov  9 14:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: reading now - Mon Nov  9 14:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) exhales with relief.

"Goood! Want to see my next jutsu now?"* - Mon Nov  9 14:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Yeah. - Mon Nov  9 14:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Show me what you can do. - Mon Nov  9 14:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gains a silly grin.

He loved to show off, especially to those that could be trusted. "Ninja Art: Lion's Hair Technique!" Sanoke yells out, his hands fumbling through some seals immediately. Upon reaching a second, the jutsu is activated, causing a mass of chakra to swell up along his hair. After all was said and done, the Yang Release is enacted, prompting sudden growth in hair folicles.

It stretched out, enough to make the teen's hair mimic a Super Saiyan Three.

No doubt, Hanae would be able to sense the massive gathering of energy and the assortment of multi-tasks that made this possible. Simultaneously, he also forces the hardness to be induced before sending the hair flying forward. It aims to wrap around Beth's form, keeping her bond -- playfully. "Whatcha think. . ?"* - Mon Nov  9 14:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) released her. 

He wears a giant smile. "Finally! Someone that finds my jutsu cool!"* - Mon Nov  9 14:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's versatile too. The strength that this can hit with is amazing. - Mon Nov  9 14:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: I pretty sure ti is. - Mon Nov  9 14:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Seeing they the amount of chakra put in it. - Mon Nov  9 14:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It can crush boulders and shit, hah! I'm hyped. This is. . Um. My second original creation. - Mon Nov  9 14:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: I never eally seen something like that. - Mon Nov  9 14:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Took me about two months to craft. - Mon Nov  9 14:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Nice. - Mon Nov  9 14:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Wow. - Mon Nov  9 14:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Yet you still call me sensei. - Mon Nov  9 14:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You are! You taught me all I know about genjutsu. - Mon Nov  9 14:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: -smiles- - Mon Nov  9 14:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Suna must be greatful to have you by there side. - Mon Nov  9 14:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: <*Rubs his head*> I guess so. <*Is having a hard time not feeling big-headed.*> - Mon Nov  9 15:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: That's cool. - Mon Nov  9 15:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: I even got a few new jutsu not of my creation but new. - Mon Nov  9 15:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) swipes his nose.

"Yeah. I got more stuck in the ol' noggin too-- Huh? Like what?"* - Mon Nov  9 15:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Well a sum of it. Is lets you suppress your chakra. - Mon Nov  9 15:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh neat.  - Mon Nov  9 15:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Yeah - Mon Nov  9 15:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Also. - Mon Nov  9 15:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: -grits her teeth- - Mon Nov  9 15:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) falls over in surprise.

Prior to this, he remained in anticipation -- only for the reveal to be a less than satisfactory turtle. 

"Oi! Sensei! I think you'd have something cool to show me. . "* - Mon Nov  9 15:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: -laughs- - Mon Nov  9 15:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Sorry, sorry..Well. - Mon Nov  9 15:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Keep working at it! If you get good, maybe you'll be able to get specialized summons. - Mon Nov  9 15:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I don't know -all- the turtles in Kame Cove. But I know there's one that's poisonous. - Mon Nov  9 15:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: That could work well with you. - Mon Nov  9 15:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Yeah. - Mon Nov  9 15:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Maybe I can show you something cool. - Mon Nov  9 15:35:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: So you live on the streets? - Mon Nov  9 18:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kikumi(Kawaiimanyu) says: Kinda. I live everywhere where I wanna live. Just like a cat.  - Mon Nov  9 18:36:35 2015

He must harrass.* - Tue Nov 10 02:28:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: ??? - Tue Nov 10 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) seems oddly composed despite the fast-paced, highly destructive battle.

Casually, he gives a glance before turning ahead. "Geez. Kids nowadays are super strong, huh?"* - Tue Nov 10 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: That doesn't look normal... - Tue Nov 10 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gives a glance to the two towards his side.

"Hrm? You're. . actually making physical contact with someone, Mizora?! This is progress."* - Tue Nov 10 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blurts out beyond the fire!

"You need some help stopping him, kiddo?!'* - Tue Nov 10 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: I got it! - Tue Nov 10 03:52:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blinks. He again finds confusion in the anger.

What was women with being so fickle? "What? I was just congratulating her. She's usually shy and stuff. Mizora's my bud, she knows I didn't mean anything offensive," he replies blankly.* - Tue Nov 10 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: Go Funa Shuriken! - Tue Nov 10 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Because thats what it was in canon - Tue Nov 10 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looked ahead. He couldn't quite see all of the action, but it was fairly obvious that things were getting out of hand. Exercising his innate skill, Sanoke steps onto the wall and simply speeds on over the fire --- Nevermind, there is no fire.

Instead, the boy is just. . like there. His hand is grasping a scroll, and a finger pressing against it. Upon the release, a gathering of cloth comes rushing out, intent on wrapping around the rampaging monster. If struck, it was certain to begin binding movement and restricting the usage of chakra. 

"Geez."* - Tue Nov 10 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) takes notice of Mizora unnecessarily stepping in.

He speeds, his body practically slidding across the ground. A hand whips, stopping just short of Mizora's stomach -- gesturing for her to stop. "It's cool. That should keep him bound. It's not like regular clothes."* - Tue Nov 10 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) also tricked the binding with a seal.

"When he's calmed down, apply chakra and the binding will release itself."* - Tue Nov 10 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Good fight, though. - Tue Nov 10 04:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: How old are you two? - Tue Nov 10 04:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Well. . ?! - Tue Nov 10 04:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh. He's knocked out. - Tue Nov 10 04:39:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) scratches his neck.

"Wow. Looked like it. Oh well, would have been cool. Do you have anything -like- a Demon in you?"* - Tue Nov 10 04:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: OOoh! Well, uhm. You need to learn how to control that. No offense but. .  - Tue Nov 10 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You were crazy as hell. It'll be hard for you to spar since you're nearly impossible to put down. - Tue Nov 10 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Well.  . without fatally injuring. - Tue Nov 10 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . .It isn't controllable. - Tue Nov 10 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Well of course it isn't. And it'll never be if you got that mindset. - Tue Nov 10 04:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Tue Nov 10 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: Stupid man. . .talking about pointless things when I'm sitting here in pain. - Tue Nov 10 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) seems oblivious to such.

"Huh. . ?"* - Tue Nov 10 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gives a glance up and down.

"Oh! I figured you could endure that. Huh. . . -- Mizora. Can you go see if there's a medic around? I'll carry this dude to a hospital." 

Sanoke moves, grabbing and tossing the male over his shoulder.* - Tue Nov 10 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: There may not be any.. I haven't seen any medics today. - Tue Nov 10 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: God why couldn't I have unleashed it on this guy. - Tue Nov 10 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Really? I'll look around. - Tue Nov 10 05:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gives a thumbs up.

"Hrm? No problem, man! Always here to help." He remains oblivious to whatever pain Aza may be experienced.

Cue shunshinning off at breakneck speeds. The hospital wasn't far from here anyway. * - Tue Nov 10 05:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) leaves in bed after checking in.

"Alright. I'll see if I can get someone to help you!"* - Tue Nov 10 05:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh god, another battle? - Tue Nov 10 05:03:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You have to be able to last thirty seconds <3 rounds> without being tripped up. - Tue Nov 10 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) thinks: That got a reaction out of this. - Tue Nov 10 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Then we can spar for real. - Tue Nov 10 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Not being tripped up? Doesn't sound too hard. - Tue Nov 10 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods.

Seconds later, Sanoke sprung into action. His body breaks off into a breakneck speeds. Being nothing more than a blur, the former chunnin hopefully takes advantage of the sudden velocity, sticking out a feet to strike at Daiki's ankles. Assuming that the traveler was incapable of percieving the motion, he'd find his center of balance pretty much being stripped from him.

"Hyah!"* - Tue Nov 10 10:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: (17 attack speed - Tue Nov 10 10:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) doesn't really stop.

The first set goes through, but all the same, Sanoke is continuing with the revolution. A whisk of wind surrounded his form as he easily completes the first of many rotations. Once more? There goes that same kick from before, targetting a familiar area. Regardless of the Ninken being noticed, the teen had no intent on stopping.

"I mean, ya already lost, you know?" taunted the summoner.

Although, he'd not feel completely accomplished until the youngster had been thoroughly outclassed. Perhaps then that would eliminate any desire to spar?* - Tue Nov 10 10:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Tsk.. - Tue Nov 10 10:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) casually raises back into the air. He sees the dog being released, but doesn't visibly acknowledge it's presence.

Dust flowed into the air, prompting his hand to wave, forcing a disperse. "Not bad. But no, we won't spar. Since it wouldn't be a real spar. Maybe if it was earlier I'd be willing to do it?" the teen replied in a gently manner. He didn't exactly want to hurt Daiki's feelings. But it was apparent, the difference in their ability was clear as night and day.* - Tue Nov 10 10:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: I'll see you around.. - Tue Nov 10 10:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) sat along the ground, indian style as per usual. It was his special method of practicing his ninjutsu, and further pushing his skills towards a higher level of mastery. With each passing day, the boy knew that the time would come when he'd need to wage combat, thoroughly unleashing his rage onto his opponents. And on that day, it was clear that refinement of skills was to be necessary.

Starting off, the boy goes about, working on the refinement of his latest technique. One of his main original creations.

After doing the alloted seals, the two differing energies swirling inside his belly melded into one. The process of kneading his chakra was something Sanoke had grown accustomed too,allowing him to retain a calmed facial expression. it was almost as if he was providing or giving no effort at all whatsoever. From this, the plain chakra moved along the pathways, subsequently landing itself forward and seeping through the tenketsu closest to the scalp.

As a result, the vibrant, spiritual releases is able to meld with the hair folicles. As usual, Sanoke ensures that this particularly chakra has a bias towards Yang Release -- the embodiment of the physical side of chakra. As physical energy is what essentially allowed the average bodily functions, such as you moving your arms, having a beating heart, and even blinking, it served to reason that manipulating such could go as far as to effect growth. Precisely, that very factor was tampered with.

The metabolism inside his body is heightened, eventually forcing the snowy locks of his hair to spontaneously grow, wavering in the wide. It extends, while also being hardened given the inversed manipulation of the expansion. Due to the condensation, Sanoke's locks gain the same hardness or density of steel. Having placed all the parts together, the crafty youth sends the strranges of head forward, far enough to reach the rock towards the west.

It slams harsh, sending thunderous shockwaves. The ground crumbled, and from the momentum, the sand parted, tumbling along the scenery. Dust rose in the aftermath as the chipped off, harden earth that embodied the boulder proceeded to roll on down. On repeat, the he continued with the expedition, no doubt ensure to go step by step in a slowed fashion. Obviously, in battle the jutsu would be more easily employed. But for the exercise? The would-be Hermit took things slow, much like a champion weightlifter would do to get the body thoroughly used to the day-to-day actions the user expected.


Towards the end, he's partially sweatied, with a scroll being unraveled along the ground. The man was a workhorse, and as one training came to an end, he was already starting with the next. Droplets of salty liquid plopped from his pores and often times cascaded onto the thick sheets below, much to Sano's chargin. Nevertheless, with chakra charged finger tips, he's inscribing a seal, working on his formula as it pertained to the almighty Root Sealing.

Presumably, not a lot of attention iss being spent on the horizon.* - Tue Nov 10 11:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Like a blow torched, his fingers remained covered in 'blue fire'. Although, close examination would revealed the 'fire' to be nothing more than average-day chakra. Clearly, an exceptionally compacted or condensated, as it was visible to the naked eye. With nonchalance, his wrists contorted, allowing for an assortment of shapes to be performed along the way.

"Practicing my jutsus. I have to be ready for the Private Exams. I want to take them by the end of the month."* - Tue Nov 10 11:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Like for Jounin or something? - Tue Nov 10 11:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: That's right. A very tough exam needed to become a 'Gezo Private' or whatever. - Tue Nov 10 11:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm, why do you want to be a Private? - Tue Nov 10 11:46:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I can't exactly go back on my promise, now can I? - Tue Nov 10 11:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gives a mutual blink, as if mimicking Kiyoko's astonishment or confusion.

"What is. . ?"* - Tue Nov 10 11:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Taking a giant test for a rank to save someone's life. - Tue Nov 10 11:51:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: She came back on her own. But they were still trying to kill her. - Tue Nov 10 12:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: And yeah. Her name is Mizora. - Tue Nov 10 12:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Huh.... - Tue Nov 10 12:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Interesting. - Tue Nov 10 12:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: She is a strange girl. - Tue Nov 10 12:25:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well... as much as you've seen me you know how gentle I can be. - Tue Nov 10 12:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Mhm. But she's getting better, so that's good. Hopefully I don't have to put my neck out for her again. - Tue Nov 10 12:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Why did she leave anyhow? - Tue Nov 10 12:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Man. I don't even know. - Tue Nov 10 12:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Sorry, I won't pry. Do you want me to leave you to your training? - Tue Nov 10 12:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Nah. It's cool. Although you'll probably be bored. - Tue Nov 10 12:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I have a book to read if I get bored. - Tue Nov 10 12:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Lera helped me decide what I should do for my fighting style, after the things you had told me. - Tue Nov 10 12:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: What did you decide? - Tue Nov 10 12:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Some time or swordsmanship with using wind on the weapon. - Tue Nov 10 12:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: So kenjutsu amplified by Chakra Flow. That's how hard actually. If you go that route, derive from the basic technique to make more advanced CHakra Flows. - Tue Nov 10 12:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Huh? I didn't understand those last two things you said. - Tue Nov 10 12:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) picks up a Kunai.

"Chakra flow. . "

He sends a stream of energy around the blade. At first, a light blue tint is evident, before it spontaneously shifts into a general layering of air currents. The gales force the wind to whistle.

"This is an example of chakra flow. Using your chakra to enhance the strength of your weapons."* - Tue Nov 10 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's extremely basic.  - Tue Nov 10 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...I know what chakra flow is... I don't understand what you -said-. - Tue Nov 10 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Derive it. - Tue Nov 10 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: This is just scratching the surface. - Tue Nov 10 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Far more powerful and proficient chakra flow techniques can be made. - Tue Nov 10 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Such as this. - Tue Nov 10 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) proceeds with the same process.

Instead, however, on this attempt, there's a much wider viel of FUuton chakra. It covers a shuriken, and greatly expands it's width or range of attack. Sanoke doesn't even bother throwing it, as the weapon is casually lifted via mind power.

"Such as this. And even then, this is barely more advanced."* - Tue Nov 10 12:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Huh... - Tue Nov 10 12:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: That really does look like what I want to do. - Tue Nov 10 12:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What kind of sword do you think I should use? - Tue Nov 10 12:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Can't ever go wrong with a Katana. I'd suggest a Zanbatou, but you look too weak to carry one. - Tue Nov 10 12:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...Lera is fucking ... three inches shorter than me. - Tue Nov 10 12:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Tiny little ...shower door breaking ---nope don't think about that. - Tue Nov 10 12:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: She probably cheats. - Tue Nov 10 12:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: With her Doton release. - Tue Nov 10 12:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods.

"Very strategic," Sanoke notes with persistant nods of agreement. Cue pause. . 

"Buuut. Zanbatous are so much more cooler. And way stronger. You oughta consider it. Not that you can't just use both."* - Tue Nov 10 12:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Is there a place I can see all the types of swords I might be able to use? - Tue Nov 10 12:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Surely there is more than just katana's and zanbatous. - Tue Nov 10 12:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Uh. I'd hit the local weapons shop. East of here? Outside of those three, I only know of. . . - Tue Nov 10 12:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Uh. A Tanto. And Wakizashi. - Tue Nov 10 12:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Maybe the library would be better. - Tue Nov 10 12:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Or that. - Tue Nov 10 12:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'll have to check it out. - Tue Nov 10 12:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: How would I get a weapon if they don't have it at the shop? - Tue Nov 10 12:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'unno. Pray that you run into a blacksmith that does custom orders? - Tue Nov 10 12:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm.... okay. - Tue Nov 10 12:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You think that the Kazekage would be able to help? I mean when he has time. - Tue Nov 10 12:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh. You could also try to put in an order. - Tue Nov 10 12:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: With the Gezo. - Tue Nov 10 12:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh? - Tue Nov 10 12:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: How do I do that? - Tue Nov 10 12:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeah. They're expensive as hell, though. Just speak to Hassan, he's a Sergeant. - Tue Nov 10 12:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Alright. - Tue Nov 10 12:52:16 2015
