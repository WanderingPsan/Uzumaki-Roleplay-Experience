And so the bloodshed continued for months on end, with both opposing parties clawing tooth and nail.

As expected, the gargantuan county of Sunagakure was a force to be reckoned with -- repeatily being capable  of penetrating through the isolated mountainous kingdom, and recking havoc. But alas, nothing would come from it. . .

No victory, no surrender -- just more and more violence. 

Both sides suffered signifcant losses, albeit Kumogakure takes more of the damage both population wise and interms of infrastucture. Some may see this as a lost? But in actuality, the unwilling to compromise wears Sunagakure -- and Sanoke -- thinned. Indeed, through all of this, the Interim Kazekage can't help to realize the senseless violence and deaths coming just because people refused to converse with one another civilly.

Thus, a message is delivered, directly to the Raikage.

"This is pointless. If you wish to end this, let's meet and hash out the problems like grown men. No need to have more men and women die over something as simple as land. We'll meet in a neutral point."* - Wed Dec  9 02:41:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

Once in the grass village, Sanoke meets up, seemingly have no entourage of his own. Naturally, it remained to be seen if this was the actual Kazekage or not -- but that mattered little.

"Alright. We both coulda done shit much better. For example, rather than declaring yourself 'solo', why not send an ambassador? Likewise. . i was a bit mis-informed of the terms, and acted brashly to keep Sunagakure's populace from panicking from apparent insubordination. For that? I'm sorry." 

In no time, after some long winded talk, a treaty drawn up by his intelligent assistant. It's goes over simple trade agreements, mostly revolving around the important of argicultural goods from Kumo, in exchange from fine metals delivered solely by Sunagakure's various mines. Cue another bunch of unnecessary information.

The sheet is pushed forward. "Sound good? I've signed. All you need to do a well, then we both can go our seperate ways."Assuming Eiyu complies, the Kazekage portion of the treaty is de-summoned, and his frame disappears in a plum of smoke.

He looks stressed, annoyed, and depressed all the same.

"Alright. . .The last few months have been hectic. And despite the war, Sunagakure has remained prosperous. But. . . For some reason, I don't feel content. In fact, I feel guilty -- I played a huge role in the violence, and in the end, it was all for nothing. I didn't keep the land Hassan worked to obtain, and quite frankly, i'm compromising my own way of life to do some silly job. ."

He held his baby in hand, looking towards her pensively all the same.

Oddly, Sanoke lacked his usual Kage outfit, given the nature of the announcement. "For a time. . I figured I was best to lead Sunagakure. But it's clear -- doing that isn't in my DNA. I've held onto the interim role for far too long, and now it's time for Sunagkaure to gain a new Kazekage. I hereby retirefrom my duties! Forgive me if this displeases anyone. And if it makes people happy? Then all the better."

Short and sweet. His clothes were hung up in the Kage Manor, ready to be dry cleaned utilized by the next leader.* - Wed Dec  9 03:41:26 2015
