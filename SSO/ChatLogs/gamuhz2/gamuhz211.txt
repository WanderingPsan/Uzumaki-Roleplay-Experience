<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) rolls his eyes. One part of him is thoroughly amused over Mirai being angry about an honest mistake. The other, however, remains cautious. It -was- his duty to act as a protector, after all.

An arm moves as usual, and rests onto Mirai's adjacent shoulder.

"Mistakes, happen. No need to hold a grudge," Sanoke notes in an apologetic fashion. "I still did my best once I realized you were in actual danger."* - Mon Oct  5 09:01:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) abruptly moves, sweeping Mirai up in a bridal fashion.

He gives a glance on over to Kilm. "Catch ya later?" Clearly the two had plans.* - Mon Oct  5 10:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Mon Oct  5 10:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Have fun. - Mon Oct  5 10:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) || As usual, Sanoke exercises extreme speed, his body blurring along the area. It's a good thing that Mirai no doubt is comfortable with moving at this rate, lest she suffer from motion sickness. Upon reaching the designated area, he takes a slower approach. "Here at last. . .They say this place is one of the hottest spots in the Wind Country -- pun intended," he jokes, since y'know. . . desert -hot springs.- 

The door is kicked open, prompting Sanoke to move on in. 

The insides of the spring prove to be warm in nature, although it's a different types of warm. Inside the building, the atmosphere is a bit moist, and coupled with the temperature, it's ap leasant sensation. Movig ahead, the two eventually arive at the check-in station, where the Hokuma is at last settled down onto her feet.

Sanoke taps the desk, getting the clerk's attention. "Hi. Uh, me and my girlfriend here wants to give this place a try. What services do you offer?" His eyes wandered as the question is given. That's right, this placed offer a lot more than just a hot pool.

The woman goes on and on, mentioning a series of different services. They ranged from: massages, mud baths, acupuncture, yoga -- y'know, the whole nine yards. He looks ahead, curious as to what Mirai thought on this all. "Whatcha wanna do?"* - Mon Oct  5 10:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) leans in a tad to be in better position to hear Mirai's instruction. As usual, he's a tad bit nervous due to the Hokuma's forwardness. With rosey cheeks, he nods while mentally aiming to calm his nerves. Upon looking ahead, Sanoke steps forward, and rests his arms along the clerk's desk. "Yeah. . . We'd like to go to the hotsprings."

"Oh. You're lucky, today we're having a discount to attract more customers, since y'know. . . all the refugees. Half off if you come with two more," the clerk explains with a smile. By then, the prices is given. Normal pricing was ten-grand each, yet with half off, they'd only have to pay five thousands. Regardless, this was well within Sanoke's budget to afford. Upon forking over the cash, a key is given to each of the passengers.

Keys to the locker room, mind you. Due to the high pricing, the spa typically gave each customer a free set of bikinis and trousers, along with fresh towels. As the two were together, Sanoke leads her off, entering the locker room himself. It's pretty cozy, and and empty. Four lockers are on both ends of the wall, one for the male gender, the other for female. Along with this, there's a shower head, just incase you'd want to rinse off.

"Alright. . .Let's get ready, I guess. "

He exhales, releasing additional nerves, and eventually moving to get into his own set of clothes. He isn't anything to sneeze at, sporting an average, yet partially athletic build. The turtle shell is -finally- taken off, perhaps for the first time in weeks -- he literally slept with that thing on at times. Once the swimming trunks are in place, he peers on towards the exit, and already vision is partially clouded by the amassment of steam. When they called this area the hot springs, they weren't kidding. 

Just taking a few paces ahead allowed him to feel the soothing warmth. Eyes shift on back over to Mirai. "Ya ready?"* - Mon Oct  5 10:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) continued to glance as Mirai slipped into the inadvertantly skimpy bikini. His cheeks flare up even further, and his breathing rate takes a stark incline out of nervousness. Nevertheless, -he- had been the one to suggest they come here, and wasn't exactly going to chicken out.

Keeping his body in check, Sanoke smoothly enters the hot springs water. Even before entering, the heated mist presses against his form, relaxing every muscle in his body, and placing him in a state of ease. Before long, a foot presses into the water, followed by the other. In no time, his body is submerged within the hot springs. Swaying along the water, he -- nervous as can be -- moves ahead, closing in Mirai. After all, they had come here to spend time together.

For a few moments, he was tight-lipped, before at last speaking up. "So. . This is nice, right? Chilling in the water. . It's like washing away all my stress or worries."* - Mon Oct  5 11:29:29 2015

"Why? You did great. That guy was a special Jounin," he grunts. He still felt a tad guilty, even if his actions had been done absentmindedly. Regardless, there was no excuse, for the mission, Sanoke had been the leader and he nearly let his teammate get stabbed to death.* - Mon Oct  5 11:37:10 2015

Guess he figured you were just bein' a bitch to me or something. I'll explain it to him when I see him next. But man. . .  That dude is -hard- to find," Sanoke admits with mild confusion, Koji tended to disappear without a word.

His eye glance around, and in a childish fashion, his hands play within the water, swaying it to and fro.* - Mon Oct  5 11:49:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) scratches his head, still a tad bit nervous. Notably, he looks at Mirai's face, and utilizes the mist to avoid taking a gander at her body. From start to finish, Sanoke's face holds a bit of pinkness -- But hey, it's far better than when the two first met. Normally, nose bleeds would have been induced just by being close to a woman wearing such a skimpy bikini. It showed how comfortable the Sage-inTraining was becoming.

"Thanks. . . I got a question. What made you take interest in me? Not gonna lie, but I kinda lied about being the 'Panty King' in Kirigakure. I kinda was just a guy in the crowd."* - Mon Oct  5 12:21:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Well. - Tue Oct  6 04:05:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods. He was mildly intrigued by the battle.

"Cool shit. I fought a guy that can do what you do -- But not nearly at that level," Sanoke notes.* - Tue Oct  6 05:07:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Shit. - Tue Oct  6 05:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I need to find him. First gonna beat 'im, then gonna make him. - Tue Oct  6 05:29:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) forms a seal. His body disappears in a plume of smoke. He was a real ninja.* - Tue Oct  6 05:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) arrives in a plume of smoke. "Wow. I was gonna spar ya too."* - Tue Oct  6 05:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: Gotcha'. - Tue Oct  6 05:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) speeds into the area.

"Yo, yo. We can tango if you want. Also was gonna bug ya to help me with some Doton. I need to figure out how to use that damn element," he commetns casually. Even before an answer is given, Sanoke is contemplating, does he or does he not take off that damn turtle shell?* - Tue Oct  6 06:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: This guy always pops up out of no where! - Tue Oct  6 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blinks as he scratches his head awkwardly. Sure, Sanoke had a tendacy of just speeding ahead unnanounced, but the reaction was far from anticipated. "Oh hey. .  The neglected little girl. Ya seen your old man around?"* - Tue Oct  6 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) just randomly decided to battle him. . .Due to noticing Yan's nature. He liked to battle, thus a spar would likely butter him up to assist in Sanoke's elemental traning. And anyone who knew Sanoke could tell he was an imbecile in regards to performing nature types.

"That's cool. But about that earth trainin', though. I'm struggling hard. I assume you'd ask for a trade, but like. . . I only use Fuuinjutsu, and summoning techniques."* - Tue Oct  6 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: How good are you with Fuuinjutsu? - Tue Oct  6 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Eh. I've gotten as far as the Lotus Seal. - Tue Oct  6 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Dunno' what that is but it sounds cool. - Tue Oct  6 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: So I can set traps. But I can't take away chakra, or restrict movements. - Tue Oct  6 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'll teach you earth release if you teach me the basics of sealing techniques. - Tue Oct  6 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh, that's easy. Alright. - Tue Oct  6 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Later though. - Tue Oct  6 06:36:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And Izanami, it was fun sparring you. - Tue Oct  6 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You're becoming an awesome ninja, even at such a young age. - Tue Oct  6 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You roll so quickly! - Tue Oct  6 06:37:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: About half as good as me, when I was your age. - Tue Oct  6 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: *stares* - Tue Oct  6 06:47:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Ninjas should be quiet. - Tue Oct  6 06:58:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I dunno. I used to play ninja tag when I was a kid. - Tue Oct  6 07:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Maybe enjoy some time at a restaurant. Y'know, other junk. Being a ninja is important, don't get me wrong. - Tue Oct  6 07:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: So if you ever find a body with only sekelton or whatever.  - Tue Oct  6 08:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: You can see if it was a female or male. - Tue Oct  6 08:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Easier to identify. - Tue Oct  6 08:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) poofs into the area. He glances ahead.

"Geez. You've been at this forever."* - Tue Oct  6 09:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) yawns. "I mean, if you're tired. . .Just go to sleep. There's probably a genjutsu for that, or some pills,"the ex-shinobi says in response. He didn't really see the purpose of depriving one's self of sleep, nor did he find any reason in Jiki's training regiment. 'Course, Sanoke hardly knew the guy, and thus had no insight on what made the dude tick.

"I'm pretty sure if you go too long without sleep, you die."* - Tue Oct  6 09:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Maybe i'd be back with Jak, Adhara, Kastya, Amu, Kronos, Seto, Savae...Izashim..So many.. - Tue Oct  6 09:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) tilts his head. Why did people always laugh at his commentary?

"I wasn't jokin', y'know. There is totally a jutsu that can make you go to sleep if you want. Not sleeping isn't healthy, I'm surprised your body has adapted enough to be able to manage functionin'. . . But whatever. So, what's up? You're training like ya just got your ass kicked. From what these guys tell me, you easily dominated every opponent today," Sanoke noted with a grin. He held particular intrigue, and actually debated on challenging Tetsumi -- but .. . It was pretty late to be fighting.* - Tue Oct  6 09:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||"I'd challenge ya myself, but I don't like to get sands in my pants. If they weren't a challenge, maybe ya should try to battle that Hassan guy. That's pretty much the only one in the village I can assume is really, really strong," the turtle hermit replies nonchalantly. 'Course, he still remained confident in his ability to at least be some competition to Tetsumi should the two ever comes to blow.

The teen paces back and forth, pondering on the previous mention of insomnia. . . Why didn't this guy sleep?

"Ergh. Anywho, I know the advice probably doesn't mean much coming from me. But, yeah it's important to train hard -- I do it almost constantly," he says, motioning to the shell on his back.

"But you shouldn't do it out of angst. My master told me that power often can make good men. . . cruel, y'know? Having strength is an important aspect to life, but if you pursue it with negative feelings, it'll turn you into a monster. A demon even," Sanoke lectures -- although all of his words were stolen straight from his mentor.* - Tue Oct  6 09:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) rises a fist in approval. "That's something to work for. World peace! -- I mean, that's never going to happen, but it's a noble goal," the realist replies. The world wasn't peaceful for one simple reason -- People were different. And different people tended to have issues understanding one another. "And I duno, I'm faster than most even when weighed down. We need to test it someday, to see if I can outrun or evade your sands--"

Then he heard the repetition.

'Demon.' 'Demon.' 'Demon'

"Uh. . Yeah, that's what I said man. You okay there? You sould like you got some inner demons to say," the teen comments-- and what selective words he choose. Little did Sanoke know, the comment could easily be taken literally rather than figuratively. His tone is calmed through it all, and he seems to speak with some spirit, even as Tetsumi seems to be going through some shit.

* - Tue Oct  6 10:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) stares on blankly. He wore a face that pretty much said this. . 'This guy. .  is crazy as hell'

"Uhm. . .We all got that metaphorical Tanuki that likes to bug us. You'll be fine," he says, refusing to believe that there was a literal Tanuki inside of Tetsumi's body. He waves the boy off before muttering something about the sun's heat forcing hallucinations.* - Tue Oct  6 10:38:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Do I sell jutsu scrolls...? - Tue Oct  6 19:00:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Didn't know people did that... - Tue Oct  6 19:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I don't have much need for money anyways; I have enough to be comfortable. - Tue Oct  6 19:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Some do. I wouldn't but I like to take advantage when other people do. - Tue Oct  6 19:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yo, Yan . . . I think we can make a good deal if you follow me . . . I've considered that offer. - Tue Oct  6 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Want to discuss it privately. - Tue Oct  6 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Sure, sure. - Tue Oct  6 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) scratches his head. "Gah. . .Doton users. I've seen many in my days, they either abuse the ability to hide underground or exploit their Doton Clones. . " He murmured. If you battled one user of the earth affinity, you had battled them all -- at least from Sanoke'sbias perception. Without another word, the shinobi kicks off his feet, allowing full speed to be amassed near instantly. Indeed, right from the offset, it was as if the Turtle Summoner had obtained full velocity. . . Funny how someone that summoned such a slow creature could be anything but.

His frame moved in a zig-zag, allowing his movements to be even harder to be tracked. Assuming he's close enough? A quick cross-chop is delivered, aiming to slam right into Tetsu's trapezius! "Hyah! Taijutsu, the basic ninja art! All shinobi should excel in this as well as their actual area of expertise!" Indeed, everyone needed some good taijutsu, no?* - Tue Oct  6 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Wonder how this clone is going to be used. - Tue Oct  6 19:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: (Hrm. can reach 21.6 damaee total. Holding back to gauge how you respond - Tue Oct  6 19:05:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: In a world of shinobi, strangers always ignore common sense and try to touch you randomly. I think I will lose my mind some day. - Tue Oct  6 19:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Boom! Nice hit -- although hardly Sanoke's full power. "Uh. . ? You okay--" No time to question Tetsu on his conditioning. As the clone lunged forward, the summoner's body tensed up. Once more, his momentum had picked up on a moment's notice, allowing his body to sway and force the incoming body to miss it's mark. The process showed off one thing, Sanoke wasn't particularly a one trick pony. His reaction time, and attention to detail was something to be commended, considering the amount of time put into refining it.

Assuming success,  he skids away. 

"Geez. . . You're still banged up? Why spar if you aren't one-hundred percent," the ex-shinobi notes.* - Tue Oct  6 19:14:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) bits down on his thumb, drawing blood. Swiftly, his hands move through five seals themselves, and press out into the atmosphere. Casually, a sealing glyph unwinds, creating a plume of smoke to summon an entity.

"Summoning Technique! Turtle Shell Defense!" He roars -- Of course, he wasn't at that level yet. Instead of doing a cool ass defensive summon, Sanoke inadvertently summons his personal creature. A giant, human-sized beast. It's sturdy shell stays put, forcing his boney-armor and rigid hide to absorb the brunt of the damage. Sanoke, of course, remained unarmed.

". . .Whoops. This is what i get for trying to be flashy. . ." the former chunnin stated meekly.

Ganba, as you can imagine, is anything but amused. "Oi. . .Did you really just summon me to be a damn meat shield? I oughta shellshock your ass. . ."* - Tue Oct  6 19:26:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Wanna bet I can damage him? - Tue Oct  6 19:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Depends. How much you betting, and what do you deem 'damage'? - Tue Oct  6 19:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Burns. - Tue Oct  6 19:42:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Why did you burn yourself? - Tue Oct  6 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: He's clumsy. - Tue Oct  6 19:44:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Since your turtle is already burned . . . How about I shock him hard instead? - Tue Oct  6 19:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I mean. Just 'cause he's super tolerant to damage doesn't mean he won't feel or be effected. I don't take losing bets. - Tue Oct  6 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He has to take noticeable damage for me to win. - Tue Oct  6 19:45:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looked towards Ganba.

The turtle simply lays down. . . "I'mma pass. I'm going back home," He mutters. Poof! At once, his body disperses.

"And there ya have it. Such a lazy pet."* - Tue Oct  6 19:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . Is it too late now? - Tue Oct  6 19:46:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: <*Fidgets glasses*> I wonder when they're going to come attack. I'unno. . . Some weird group I've heard rumors about. - Tue Oct  6 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shrugs. He takes a seat in the sand.

"I dunno. I wouldn't doubt it, he was being pretty angsty before leaving. I'm not too worried, though," Sanoke replies casually.Of course, he had seen the extent of Ichiro's ability, and while no weakness was evident, the teen could make an assumption. All physically dominant people fell into the same trap or had the same weakness.* - Tue Oct  6 19:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Eh, nothing really. He's just strong physically. - Tue Oct  6 19:57:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: No, as I said before, I got what I wanted out of it. There was no need to continue. - Tue Oct  6 20:38:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) glances ahead to the man staring at him.

"What up?"* - Tue Oct  6 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daishou(Simple.Sloth) says: U-uh. - Tue Oct  6 20:52:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Daishou(Simple.Sloth) says: Am I in Sunagakure? - Tue Oct  6 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looks around. "You mean the village hidden in the sand?" He stares blankly at the sand.

"Nope!" Sanoke replies with a coy smile, clearly joking.* - Tue Oct  6 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) scratches his head.

"Wait! This is Sunagakure, guy. .  Geez. Don't be so dense," Sanoke cries out with a facepalm. Was this dude for real?* - Tue Oct  6 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) kicks off the ground, exercising his athleticism to close the distance between the two in no time. 

"You ain't too bright, are you? Where you coming from anyway?" the former shinobi questions, curious as to how Daishou could have gotten lost so many times. It was kind of hard to miss Sunagakure.* - Tue Oct  6 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmph. Anyone else up for a spar? - Tue Oct  6 21:05:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: And yeah, if you're a shinobi of a village, you shouldstay in one place. - Tue Oct  6 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daishou(Simple.Sloth) says: How come? - Tue Oct  6 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Rules and regulations, my boy. - Tue Oct  6 21:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Well. Unless you're a special shinobi like me. - Tue Oct  6 21:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) flicks his nose as he felt quite good about the special deal he had.

"Then you got benefits."* - Tue Oct  6 21:17:00 2015
