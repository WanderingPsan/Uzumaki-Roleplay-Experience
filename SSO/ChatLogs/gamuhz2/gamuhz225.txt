"So. . . You ever learned that high-speeds technique? Shunshin," Sanoke replies casually. One arm moves over, resting on the Hokuma's shoulder.  The other? Has a scroll in hand, assisting the chunnin in his pursuit of proficiency in genjutsu. Gotta have that versatility.* - Tue Oct 20 16:55:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) cue sweeping her up as per usual.

His body breaks off into a streak, being displaced several meters towards the south. In no time, they're reaching the designated training field.* - Tue Oct 20 17:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Once in the area, Sanoke promptly begins with the tutelage of the jutsu.

His hands come together, forming a single seal -- the Ram. "Alright. This jutsu is simple in the fact that you just have to build up a mass of chakra to accounts for your entire body. Flow the energy, guide it into your cells, and use that additional power as fuel. With the added fuel, in unison with the chakra'a stimulation, you kick off the ground, and perform a high-spirited sprint to your desired location," Sanoke explains, forming the seal casually.

His body is nearly untrace-able, allowing for fast-paced transportation, one that could easily be confused with simple teleportation. In no time, he was by Mirai's side, his body shaking a tad due to the unsettling feeling that came with utilizing shunshin.

"As a note. . .It takes a lot of time and effort. If you want to be speedy gonzalez, you'll have to master the jutsu, and make sure your body gets fully used to the sensation. Otherwise, you'll be making yourself feel sick."

Aka. Get Shunshin perk, nub.* - Tue Oct 20 17:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||In his downtime, Sanoke resumed with his pursuit of mastery in terms of the various illusions taught to him over the last month or so. Relentless, the boy was seeking to gain a higher level of skill, to better be capable of taking on opponents that seemed to lack the capacity to defend against mentally-based assaults.

For today, his attention seems to be placed moreso on the ability to craft false fire.

As commonly seem, this was an illusion meant to give the appearance that a massive sphere of flames descending from the skies. As if god himself had sought to smite humanity, and rid the universe of their evils. Of course, this went far moret han simply spawning a giant flaming sphere of death -- which most people likely would have a hard time believing. Nay, you had to properly paint the illusion, from head to toe.

The fire had to -feel- real, and it also had to  interact with the environment in a realistic, and convincing fashion. Taking initiative, Sanoke presses both fingers together, spawning a single shadow clone that sits ahead. "Prepared for action, boss!" the doppleganger declared. Wasting little time, the hermit begins with the short string of handsigns, each one send a light wave or emanation of chakra that invades the clone's cerebral nervous system.

Immediately, the illusion is spawned, albeit with a significant twist.

On inception, the ground bursted into flames, giving the impression that the shinobi had used a commonly known Katon ability, Running Fire. The sickly inferno was swift in it's approach, entrapping the opponent, eliminating any potential for fleeing, at least from the ground. 

Of course, there were still some clear issues as the flames appeared partially synthethic. In addition to this, the heat waves that exudd from the fire's form were lukewarm, rather than being scorching in temperature. Clearly, Sanoke had a long way to go, nevertheless, the jutsu had served it's purpose. Now would just require additional repetition.* - Tue Oct 20 17:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||As the training is undergone, he looks over, gauging Mirai's own level of skill with the jutsu.

Of course, due to his doujutsu being active at almost all time, he's able to get a proper read on her chakra system. "There ya go! I taught you that new move. Now you just have to master or refine it, and you should be fine."* - Tue Oct 20 17:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sounds like a lot of work. - Tue Oct 20 17:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: That's what being a shinobi is. - Tue Oct 20 17:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I mean, don't ya wanna be strong? - Tue Oct 20 17:41:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Nothing. - Tue Oct 20 17:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: And why is that? - Tue Oct 20 17:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Cause just no. - Tue Oct 20 17:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh. Wanna see my new technique? - Tue Oct 20 17:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: sure. - Tue Oct 20 17:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) loved to show off.

His hands come together, rubbing one another in a devious, mosquito-like fashion. From this, chakra in the onside is bubbling, and gain being kneaded into larger, more usuable clumps. An arrogant smile, one that tip-toes on the lines of devious and smugness, creeps onto the young lad's face. It takes a few moments, however, for the build up of enegy to actually be significant enough. And had Mirai been paying attention with her byakugan, she'd be able to note the unique way in which the power had been built up or manifested.

It was freely slushing around, seeming being a lot more relaxed and reserved than most chakra build up-- which was notoriously used for devestating ninjutsu.

After the alloted time, Sanoke's right hand is lifted up, soon having a viel of energy surrounding it's form. It's warm to the touch, soothing to anyone that ever came in contact with it. Upon pressing a hand onto Mirai's shoulder, the energy zaps away from the warrior's body, and implants itself onto the Hokuma's own chakra reserves, replenishing whatever energy had been losted in the beginning of the training session.

"Chakra Transfer. . .  complete! . . Badass, right?"* - Tue Oct 20 17:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: It's okay! - Tue Oct 20 17:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Okay. . ? I mean. It isn't the greatest of techniques, but it's definitely unique. - Tue Oct 20 17:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Like I said it's okay. - Tue Oct 20 17:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Tch. . . Whatever. That's what ya always say. - Tue Oct 20 17:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: That says a lot about your techniques. - Tue Oct 20 17:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Wow! I have some cool stuff! You're just hard to impress. - Tue Oct 20 17:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Randomly, he decides to resume with his training, this time with the Doton affinity. It was a skill that Sanoke was eager to gain proficiency with -- mainly because the technique could be deemed as 'glamarous' or 'cool' even. 

At least from his own perspective.

Quickly, the shinobi forms a single seal, allowing for a mass of mud to be expunged from his maw. Naturally, the earthly liquid had been developed solely from chakra itself, making it completely and utterly a chakra based substance, It falls onto the ground, floowing along the landscape and thus terraforming Sunagakure's conditions to be in line with the needed required for the next jutsu.

Swiftly, Sanoke moves ahead, forming a small string of handsigns, and thus forcing the earth to be manipulated. The mud shakes, ripples going along it's form briefly, before eventually it begins to rise. Initially, a giant sphere is developed, but like a fine artist, Sanoke moves ahead, beginning to craft a more detailed shaping or imagery. In no time at all, the once rudimentary sphere was morphed, gaining the likeness of a stereotypical dragon head -- it's maw opened agape.

From this, the boy can move on, developing the 'ammo' that made this jutsu so fierce. On the inside, countless bowling ball-esque projectiles are being pooled togethjer, each one laying in wait before alas. . . Sanoke takes off. With a singel thought, the Dragon Head is ignited, the mud on the exterior being used as a catalyst to send the proper projectives up ahead, each one crashing harshly against the ground.

"Elemental techniques are a pain to use."* - Tue Oct 20 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Given enough time, the shinobi's earth training would resume.

For the next hour or so, Sanoke was hard at work, refining his ability to not only build up Doton-natured energy, but also draw it out in a timely fashion. His hands were pressed together, almost as if he was praying.

From this seal, the Doton chakra is more easily manipulated, and thus galloons gush from his body and slam onto the ground below. It's a thorough process, and with close examination, even those without special eyes could see his pure energy seeping into the flooring itself, and dazzling the area. In no time, the floor was thoroughly overwhelmed, ingrained with Sanoke's chakra -- as the process was needed to be done for most DOton techniques.

Such as the nature of earth release. The user simply had to plant their might within the inanimate subject -- the hard part came with the discreet and often precise manipulation required for hte various ninjutsu. On this occasion, it seemedh is eyes were set on manipulating the ground to form massive slabs of rocks, that would serve as imprisonment for most parties. Of course, the only weak point was ironically the ground itself, as anyone with the required skill could easily dig through.

Like with the previous expedition,. the floor shook and the sand grains clumped, forming sturdy rocks. Without question, SAnoke's cognitive force was going forward, blaring on all cylinders and forcibly commanding the rocks to spawn forward. As mother nature proved to  be, the sequence is anything but a trivial or easy one, despite the teen's consistent and often restless training session. Elemental techniques -really- weren't his forte.

In no time, however, the sand stones formed from below finally pierce through the ground, at last meeting the grace of Gaia's breath. It continued to move, posessing quite a bit of fluidity, before eventually the two portions meet, forming a perfect dome. This was perhaps the first time in forever that Sanoke had been enabled to use the jutsu flawless.

Although, there was still a lot of room for improvement. The dome, despite being fully formed, was only enough to house three people -- which was a far cry to what accomplished Doton elementalists could accomplish. ". . Hng.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Considering the downtime, Sanoke takes a seat, nonchalantly blocking off the entrances. His eyes remain upon the hectic scene ahead, as both fairly powerful Fuuton specialists displayed their vast level of skill.

"Nifty skills," the teen remarked.

Meanwhile, he opts to spend sometimes, working on his own ninjutsu -- these being the various genjutsu techniques, and Yang-released based skills that the male had managed to come upon. Being a shinobi and traveler had many perks, after all. In no time at all, with no handseals even being required, the male's chakra system is activated, with the bulk of the energy flowing to his locks of hair.

For those that hadn't yet noticed, Sanoke had spent the better part of the last month working on his hair length, so that jutsu would be that much more potent. After all, it wasn't exactly like it's B-ranked counterpart, where you could eventually be able to summon an inhumane amount of hair to attack from range. Indeed, unfortunately for Sano, the jutsu was restricted to close to mid range. 

As the chakra flows, the his energy eventually infuses itself within the locks of hair, allowing the fibers within to be stricken and thus more durable. What more, as his energy was now a part of the hair itself, Sanoke is enabled to control the motions with simple thoughts. The long locks of hair find themselves wrapping about his own form, but in the end, it dissipates.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: -omit- - Wed Oct 21 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Once Mirai had been set down, Sanoke listened dilligently, his mind taking in all of the required information or words that had been granted to him.

A smile is sprouted, as the Hokuma put on her best impression of a drill sergeant. Despite the change in tone, and volume of her voice, there wasn't a second that went by that made Sanoke legitimately believe that Mirai was in charge. Hell, he's unable to even get through the entire lecture without releasing an unrestrained giggle.

"Hahaha! This is amazing. You should act like this more often," Sanoke replies, greatly appreciating this version of Mirai -- the one that seemed more playful. Regardless, her playfulness didn't detract from the very valuable information that the young Hokuma seemed to be able to grant forward.

The taijutsu skill, of course, seemed relatively simply. And as a genetic freak, it definitely wasn't anything that was going to be beyond Sanoke's skill to mimic. Getting into a crouch, the boy first observes as Mirai kicks into the air, her body doing several revolutions, each at a fast pace. Like a sponge, his mind absorbed the proper information, and committed each of the motion to memory. With a cocky grin, Sanoke blurts out, his body fidgeting and blaring to go. "This isn't too hard! Watch me!"

And thus, the boy is off, his tense muscles quickly allowing his body to repel. One leg is pressed out, while the other remained the tethered to the ground, being his one pillar of balance. Speedily, Sanoke goes around, repeatily rotating, enoguh that his body dissolves into a simple whisk of blue and white -- Sadly, the teen grows a bit -too- arrogant and thus loses his balance. At once, with the lack of fortitude, the teen crashes hard onto the floor, kicking dust into the area, and leaving a body-shaped depression along the floor.

Red-faced from embarrassment, Sanoke quickly arises, a hand pressing through is elongated head of hair. "Haha! Let's keep this again. . "

Once more, Sano's mind flashed, going through the two differing processes. The first was just a high kick. . . A feint even, and thus most of the focus would have to be the secondary strike -- Y'know, the one that actually mattered.

Those thoughts in mind, the warrior begins with a rotation again, sending a sloppy high kick, before his body continued in stride. Going along with the secondary revolution, a low, sweeping kick is delivered, potentially where his opponent's ankles were going to be placed.

"That oughta do the trick! -- Whatcha think, Mirai?"* - Wed Oct 21 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blink and shakes off the excessive sand f4rom his frame.

"Hrm. . ? What faceplant? None of that ever happened. If you saw anything weird, it might have just been a genjutsu," He says with a straight face, denying any acknowledgement of his failure.

A hand waves right infront of Mirai's face, as she's seemed to have gone unresponsive.

"-- Anywho. How are you and Madelyn? Didn't know you were into the crazies."* - Wed Oct 21 04:59:31 2015

"Err. Right. . . Didn't know you liked the 'Misunderstood' types," Sanoke remarks with air quotations, making light of Tetsumi's excuses. 

"What's your favorite quality so far?--" He gives a glance to Mirai now.

". . .Uh. For what?"* - Wed Oct 21 05:04:38 2015

A foot stomps against the ground, forcing the sand to clump together and form a rock. It speeds up, landing in amidst Sanoke's palms. "Doton release is pretty versatile as it simply is the manipulation of the earth itself. Several properties can be changed -- From the hardness, thickness, density, weight, and compactness. The easiest to effect is the last, which is is basically what seperates a rock from dirt."

The rock is tossed forward, with the intent of having Shin catch it.

"Take that! What I want you to do is focus chakra around your hands, and pour it into the rock. The goal? To reduce it from that state to a pile of sand grains. To assist, get into the state of mind of a 'rock.' Rigid, sturdy. . . unwilling to be overpowered. Get it?"* - Thu Oct 22 03:03:53 2015
