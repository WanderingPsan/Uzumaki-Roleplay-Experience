<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) begins to count backwards on his fingers.

"THe year 395." He exhales as there was trouble recalling the events that led to his 'story' beginning.

"Y'see. I was traveling with my parents, who work as archelogists. They're the one that really put in that desire for me to see what he world had to offer, to explore. . Adventure. On one particular expedition, I encountered Kirigakure shinobi. They were on a mission, retrieving some stolen items. And man. . the powers, they were badass--- " He pauses for a bit, as his fascination is suddenly put on pause.

A blank gaze shoots forward.

"Uh. Wait, did you want my personal story?"* - Wed Nov 11 10:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Int he year 395...I was still an active duty Jounin Commander for Kirigakure. - Wed Nov 11 11:00:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) perks a brow as the woman seems genuinely interesting.

"Y'see. . . As I watched, I grew more and more fascinated. One thing leads to another, and I'm allowed to head into Kirigakure to begin my training. . ." He seems to generalize a bit in this portion, not really disclosing the ultimate source of his capitvation.

"Nevertheless. . . I was prodigous! It only took me six short years to graduate, at the tender age of thirteen. . . Or well, almost fourteen," he replies honestly, wearing an arrogant grin. 

"The beginning of journey wasn't easy. I would get beaten up a lot, mainly cause I would be given missions to spar people way stronger than me. But one day, luck shined upon me! I was the beach, enjoying the scenery, when I took notice of some green thing in the water. It wasn't too far, but it was clearly struggled, held in bondage to the seafloor. Turns out, it was a turtle. But not just a regular one. . ." He nods, pausing to build up the necessary drama.

"Due to my selfless act, I was granted a sheet of paper, with five seals. As I did it, I found myself transported to a strange land. An island, one with a mix of different environments. Lush hot springs, and grand palaces. THere's even a volcano and desert- -Nevertheless. It was here that I gained my affinity for Turtle Summons and proceeded with my secondary path. . "

He can feel the conversatio nwearing on.

"Regardless, I'll generalize.  From there, I shortly met various people that shaped my view on life. One being a yellow catman, another being some angry water man, and a third being my teacher. The Mizukage, Noriko. She was a big influence on my life, even if I didn't always agree with her complacency. I made a lot of friends during the time. . "

After yet another pause, Sanoke wraps it all up. "More or less, however. As I continued my career, I saw that my dream of being Mizukage -- yeah, I wanted to be one at one point -- wasn't really correspondant with my new view on life. So, I retired as a shinobi and proceeded to travel for a time. Even as the war waged on. Long story short, I've settled here for a while."* - Wed Nov 11 11:17:07 2015

"Mizora has been good as of late. I think Marissa is still holding a grudge, since she had been trying to kill her just a few days ago. That is until Istepped in and stopped her," Sanoke replies, stark in his defense of the Hokuma. He falls silent afterwards, as the situation was best dealt with by the Hokuma head.

Instead, the male looks to Paine and speaks gently. 

"And yes. I made the comparison because Lord Hassan once accepted that woman as a shinobi. .. despite her clear homocidal tendacies. Now? She's a rogue wanted by the village for murder. I don't want to see a repeat."* - Thu Nov 12 04:49:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) kept his hands in his pockets, both shaded-eyes trained onto Paine all through her breakdown.

For a moment, Sanoke is simply speechless. As the woman approaches the door, that's when the boy finally speaks up. As per usual, his body flickered in and out of view, only to reappear right by the quiet woman's frame. 

"Paine. . . I take it you knew both of them. I don't knwo what you're going to do, but don't do anything wreckless. If you're going to go confront anyone, you don't want to do it alone," the teen lectures, obviously a bit concerned about what the Dissida would do next. 'Course, this gave tons of other ideas.* - Thu Nov 12 05:33:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) sighs.

He folds his arms, before stepping to the side.

"I'll let you do what got to do. Can you do me a favor, though?" He bites on his thumb, drawing blood. Five seals later, and a small snapping turtle is spawned. It's no more than two inches. 

"I call him chibi. Keep him in your pocket? Given the size, and weakness, it doesn't take energy to keep him on for long." If you looked close, you'd notice a strange tint around the turtle's eyes, as it was an extension of Sanoke's. . . strange powers. Very clearly, the boy could see through the specimen's eyes.* - Thu Nov 12 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) exhales as Paine departs.

He turns to Mirai, aggitation evident. "What a pain. Seems I missed a lot of action today, so my bad. Want to like go get some missions and train?"* - Thu Nov 12 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Of course. - Thu Nov 12 06:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: That would be perfect. - Thu Nov 12 06:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) appears.

"Evening. You got any missions you could toss our way?"* - Thu Nov 12 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Yeah I do. - Thu Nov 12 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Sweet. - Thu Nov 12 06:05:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Also. I'm taking Mirai on the mission with me. That's okay? - Thu Nov 12 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'll consider it. <@Rias> - Thu Nov 12 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Can I go? - Thu Nov 12 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's an in-village mission. But sure. - Thu Nov 12 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: That's fine. - Thu Nov 12 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Yay. - Thu Nov 12 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yay~  - Thu Nov 12 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Let's head to the housing plaza. - Thu Nov 12 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||And now it was a party of three.

Considering -- Nope. Now back to a party of two. Once more, Sanoke scooped Mirai on up. His body flicked out of view due to the usage of shunshin. In no time, they would arrive towards the housing distract, which was placed just south of the village's square.

"Alright. We got stuck with. . . tourist duty. I'm sure you got good's people skills, right? Yeah, you do," the teen responds without even waiting for an answer. In time, both would arrive at a large-ish sand Hotel. At the front? Two middle-aged individuals remained in wait. Both had freckles and wrinkly skin, and were a tad bit chubby. THe clothes worn suggested wealth.

Lastly, one was female, another was male -- perhaps from marriage.

"Hiya. Mirai and I. . . Are supposed to be your guides for today! No worries, so long as we're here, everything should go smoothly. Where would you like to go see first? The famed 'Hungry Ant'? Sunagakure has a lot to offer," the energetic shinobi explains. He motions to Mirai, giving her time to do her thing.* - Thu Nov 12 06:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nodded. He gave a friendly wave, in hopes of making the guests feel a bit more welcomed. "--Yeah! The Hungry Ant is great. I go there a lot, especically when Mirai is too busy to cook or something," the teen declared. Of course, without further ado, the 'mission' was to begin. 

"We'll start there. Next, you can take them to where you want to, Mirai."

Along the way, Sanoke is pretty chatty, his hands motioning to all of the main areas of Sunagakure. It was al ot to cover. Hell, the boy even got off topic and described many of the neighboring houses -- as in homes of people that the elderly people knew nothing of. Yes, he was that airheaded at times. Going further, he acted as somewhat of a butler.

The woman, red-haired and freckled, demanded that he hold an umbrella. The umbrella of white as snow, and seemed to be fitted to block all of the sunrays. Thus, Sanoke obliged, ensuring that the woman wouldn't even succumb to the often cruel nature of the desert's climate. "Bah. . . Beautiful place. But the heat is killer. . . " the gent responded. 

After twenty minutes of walking, much longer than Sano usually traveled, the foursome had arrived. It's there that they can enter the cozy restaurant known as the 'Hungry Ant.' Bein a gentlemen, the Turtle Summoner is swift to order the finest meal the restaurant could offer, in addition to a round of sake. It was a pretty hefty price, but does the trick more or less. After an hour or so of hanging there, all would move to exit.

"Alright, Mirai. You got any place you want to show them or what?"* - Thu Nov 12 07:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||And that was pretty much it.

After afew more minutes of traveling, Sanoke/Mirai escort the duo back to their hotel. They seemed to have gotten a decent impression of the village overall. Once the door closed, he turned, scooping the Hokuma on up.

"Sorry we couldn't do another mission. Lord Hassan wants me to be in shape for conquering the Private Exams."

Quickly, they'd practically teleport out of the area. Once the square, she's settled down once more, allowing them to approach the Kazekage.* - Thu Nov 12 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) suddenly re-appears.

"The deed is done."* - Thu Nov 12 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Good work. - Thu Nov 12 07:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Also. No need to worry, I'm going to try and do the exam at the end of the month. <*as in on friday*> - Thu Nov 12 07:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Incase you figured I was procrasinating. - Thu Nov 12 07:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Anywho. What wanna do now, Mirai? - Thu Nov 12 07:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Anything. - Thu Nov 12 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: Let's find that woman. - Thu Nov 12 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: We can try to find her so I can get some training finally. - Thu Nov 12 07:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: M'kay. - Thu Nov 12 07:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) speeds on off.* - Thu Nov 12 07:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . .In before she went outside the village. Let's stop by that guy's place first. - Thu Nov 12 07:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: She's probably with that dude again. Hng, the girl is going to get herself killed. - Thu Nov 12 07:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I agree. - Thu Nov 12 07:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: She wants to be with him though. - Thu Nov 12 07:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Goin to look outside the village really fast. - Thu Nov 12 07:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sure. - Thu Nov 12 07:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Huh. . Got nothing. - Thu Nov 12 07:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I don't see anything either. - Thu Nov 12 07:54:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: What are the private exams Sanoke? - Thu Nov 12 07:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: She's not here either. - Thu Nov 12 07:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Can't find her. Maybe some other time./ - Thu Nov 12 07:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: If anything, I'll put in a word with Zenaki. - Thu Nov 12 07:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Mmm. - Thu Nov 12 07:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: As for the private exams.. - Thu Nov 12 07:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's basically being a 'Jounin' in the world Empire. - Thu Nov 12 07:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: Sounds cool! - Thu Nov 12 07:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Mhm. But it's dangerous. I only agreed to do it to save your cousin. - Thu Nov 12 07:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'll have to be in tip-top shape to prove vicorious. To put into perspective. - Thu Nov 12 07:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Even Marissa nearly died. She lost an arm. - Thu Nov 12 07:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: She's weak. - Thu Nov 12 07:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Weaker than me, maybe. But that just goes to show, I have to be prepared. - Thu Nov 12 08:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Mhmm. - Thu Nov 12 08:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Well since she isn't around what do you wish to do? - Thu Nov 12 08:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'unno. Want me to oversee your hair binding training? I think you can get the hang of it pretty quick. Then I'll teach ya the stronger variant. - Thu Nov 12 08:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sounds good. - Thu Nov 12 08:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Can we do that at home though? - Thu Nov 12 08:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: That works. - Thu Nov 12 08:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Hrm. - Thu Nov 12 08:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: This is much better. - Thu Nov 12 08:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: So what am I doing wrong? - Thu Nov 12 08:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) flicks back to the crib.

He goes to take a seat on the top of the couch, while pondering just how to aid Mirai in her ascent in the Hair Binding Technique.

"Uh. Well, chakra is part of your mind's consciousness. For this technique in particular, you have to be in a free state of mind. The Yang Release chakra, which I know you're good at, is supposed to be free flowing. . . but also precise What I'm saying, don't over-think or focus."

After that brief tidbit. 

"Under that that, you have to make sure you're targeting the right areas. Don't think about just wrapping chakra around your hair. Wrap it INSIDE. . . Make the energy flowing and your hair cells become one."* - Thu Nov 12 08:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) rubbed his chin as he observed the Hokuma work diligently in her pursuit of the skill. 

And honestly? She had done well. At least much better than Sanoke could do when he had first learnned the skill from Kirie. Nevertheless, there was still room for improvement. Just from a glance, which was aided by the male's ability to see chakra with his doujutsu, all of the clear issues could be determined or read.

"Better! A lot better. . . From what I could gather, you know what I meant. But you're still having trouble putting my tutelage into action. I got an idea," he replies. Quickly, both of his legs come up, allowing the warrior to obtain a level of 'zen.' Oddly, even as Sanoke is on the ledge of the couch, his balance is never compromised, nor does it seem wavering in the least. "Follow my lead."

Once Mirai had done such, the teaching continued.

"What I want you to do now is stop getting ahead of yourself. Take it one step at a time. . . Listen to my voice, and go through the sequence." On the inside, the lad's chakra grew more active or potent. It eventually slithers along the highway known as his chakra circulatory system. Even particle seeps through those tenketsus and make way towards the hair folicles.

"This process should be a breeze. . .Gently force out your chakra. Once you've made a connect with the hair, rather than trying to go around and wrap items. . . Just make sure you can manipulate your hair how you like. Make it gain a level of elasticity. . . and just work on wavering it from side to side. Sort of how my old friend used to do, it made her look like she was possessed."

Without further ado, Sanoke does just that. Even if his hair was shorter, it could still be manipulated all the same. In time, each strand gained a life of it's own, and it wavered from side to side, like he was a descendent of Medusa. "If you can do this freely, you should be good to go around wrapping people up."* - Thu Nov 12 08:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) just sat there.

He wore a smile, presuming that Mirai had taken his critique in stride. As per usual, his Rinnegan-cladded eyes can easily red the chakras. "Good. . you're getting really good at this so far. I might be willing to teac--" He stops short, as Mirai's lengthy hair comes shooting out.

It comes, wrapping about his mouth and limbs, binding movement and of course making it so that he couldn't speak. 

Naturally, while Sanoke was -far- from afraid for his life, he's a tad bit nervous. "Did I piss her off by accident again?" The bone-headed adolescent thought to himself with nervous laughter.  --And just as quickly as the jutsu had been employed, the grip was released. 

"Oi. I'm sorry. Mind letting me go? I think for now, you can just do some solo practice, I'll keep an eye and interject when I see fit. If you keep this up, I'm sure you can begin training for the Wild Lion Maw's jutsu by the end of the day."* - Thu Nov 12 09:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Can we take a break though Sanoke? - Thu Nov 12 09:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods. He breaks the meditative stance and goes to stand.

"Sure, sure. You're doing great, though."* - Thu Nov 12 09:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Mhmm. - Thu Nov 12 09:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Thank you. - Thu Nov 12 09:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I'm afraid for you. - Thu Nov 12 09:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Those exams seem very tough. - Thu Nov 12 09:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looked serious for a moment. His solemn gaze making it clear that the gravity or seriousness of those exams were understood.

Then. . . that facial expression melts away all together. It's replaced with a jovial smile, but one that also expressed arrogance.

"Thanks for the concern. I think I should do well. . . Well enough not to die or be seriously injured, I hope. I picked up a few new tricks. For one, I can absorb ninjutsu now."* - Thu Nov 12 09:20:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods. He goes, scooping her up as per usual and moves to exit. 

"To the square?"* - Thu Nov 12 09:55:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) sets down.

"Eh. I mean moreso for my physical training. To know true strength, your mind, spirit, AND body has to be in tip-top shape."* - Thu Nov 12 10:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
Suddenly, the hairs speed on out.

Naturally, considering his Lightning quick reflex he was more than capable of evading. But there's a feelnig in the back of his head that suggests Mirai wouldn't actually go through with the act. After all, she hadn't even given a warning nor asked for permission.

Boy was he wrong.

Each limb is grasped and held in bondage, the grip tightening by the second. "Uh--" Before Sanoke can even reply, the empowered strands of hair shoot forward. They're powerful, enough to send even the near-adult frame of his flying through the air. His body flips on about, acrobatically through the air. As nature would have it, friction dictates a descent. And thus, Sanoke is soon speeding on down.

There's a look of astonishment, as he certainly didnt' expect Mirai to be -that- profession, at least not from the start. Nevertheless, the landingt is stuck given the former Chunnin's experience as a shinobi. With ease, a foot plants onto the ground, and the sand quivers about in recoil. "--Warn me next time, geez. . ." the teenager declared in a shakingly nervous tone. His heart was accelerate, beating so hard that you could practically hear the vibrations along his flesh.

At least not, there was a state of alertness.

Being too chill to decline, Sanoke is again launched into the air. It was a repeated process, one that seemed to gon endlessly. Towards the end, the boy lands again, this time being a tadbit dizzy. There's a smidget of green attached to his skin, suggesting motion sickness. Was he going to hurl?* - Thu Nov 12 10:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: That was fun wasn't it? - Thu Nov 12 10:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shakes his head weakly.

He takes a few moments, leaning against the wall to recover. As the time ticked on, the green-ness of subsides.  "Made me a little squeasy, but it was fun, yeah. -- Are ya done training already?"* - Thu Nov 12 10:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Shut up. - Thu Nov 12 10:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Ok i'm ready to go home. - Thu Nov 12 10:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

Oh, so she wasn't done.

Quickly, he'd proceed to work along her side. His body descended onto all four. For a few minutes, the Sennin-in-training proceeded to go about a round or two or push-ups. Each one was comprised of a lot of reps.

Once done, Sanoke breaks off into cardio, running in a circular fashion. His heart was pumping a bit heavier than normal, working hard to produce and circulate the required nutrition to keep his body in working condition. Once Mirai had finished, so does he. "Roger! You got a lot more stamina than I had anticipated."

Oddly enough, it didn't look like he's even broken a sweat. He moves, sweeping the woman in the usual fashion before marching on home.* - Thu Nov 12 10:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: What do you want to do now? - Thu Nov 12 10:40:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I'm not cooking for you. - Thu Nov 12 10:40:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) scratches his head.

"Alright. This time. But tomorrow, though."

He forms a seal, pushes out a clone. It runs a few errands, gaining a boatload of food and carting it back.* - Thu Nov 12 10:43:24 2015

"It never comes up."* - Thu Nov 12 10:47:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He turns about face and descends into a crouch. His observant eyes scan the nature of the seal. 

Eventually, it seemed to have just been a spawned to seal off chakra.

"Uh. Give me a second, I'm going to have to. . . put together a plan to work on it."* - Fri Nov 13 03:20:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) sighs. After repeated examinations, Sanoke  proceeds to work on undoing the seal.

Casually, he summons a set of ink and brushes. A lengthy process is taken to scribble various seals or glyphs along Shira's body. Before long, the deed is done, prompting the Fuuinjutsu specialist to form a single seal. His chakra pumps, activating the sealing glyph formulated, which subsequently goes to counteract Fujitora's.

In no time, the effects of the seals would be weaken. At least enough for chakra to be somewhat activated. Shira would find his overall reserves a bit weaker, but generally was fine. The child would be able to perform, with mild discomfort.* - Fri Nov 13 03:29:29 2015
