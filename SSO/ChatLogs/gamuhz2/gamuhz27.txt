<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shrugs. It was work, I guess.

He begins to head off, only to stop while granting Bryson a puzzled gaze. "Uh. . .I dunno. I guess that means uh, you help your fellow man or something?"* - Wed Sep 30 03:27:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yourself? - Wed Sep 30 20:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: The same, anyway. - Wed Sep 30 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Could we talk somewhere else for a moment? - Wed Sep 30 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shifts his eyes from side to side. 

He had to be extra careful. "Uh, sure. I'll lead. But keep your distance."* - Wed Sep 30 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Of course. - Wed Sep 30 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Lead the way. - Wed Sep 30 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Alright. What up? - Wed Sep 30 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: We both know it's about the eyes. - Wed Sep 30 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I want to share what I know with you, and then ask you somethings. - Wed Sep 30 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods. A beauty of having these eyes made it so that it was easily identifable to tell when someone else had the doujutsu or not -- thus, there ran no risk of being fooled with a henge. 

"Yeah. This shit is a pain, don't tell anyone I got it 'course. Gonna hide my shit," Sanoke says with a slight chuckle. "What you wanna ask and share?"* - Wed Sep 30 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) smiles.

"For a second, my ninja instincts were kickin' in. Figured you were like some henge to come lure me away. A ninja always gotta be prepared, ya feel me?" Sanoke replies in a lighthearted fashion, although he was quite clearly serious. 

"My master told me. . . once. Great power is often known to make good men cruel. Y'never know, you feel me?"* - Wed Sep 30 21:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: He talks a bit weird but okay. - Wed Sep 30 21:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I can understand that, or rather I have seen that happen before. - Wed Sep 30 21:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Anyway, I want to ask if you've met others with these eyes. - Wed Sep 30 21:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I've met another besides you who told me about two more, however one of them is missing. - Wed Sep 30 21:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I don't know about the last one though. - Wed Sep 30 21:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Huh? Nope. - Wed Sep 30 21:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I literally just got this before I came to Suna. - Wed Sep 30 21:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm, I see. - Wed Sep 30 21:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: How do you feel when you see these eyes of mine? - Wed Sep 30 21:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Anger, anything else? - Wed Sep 30 21:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . . Uh. - Wed Sep 30 21:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) scratches his nose.

"Not going to lie. There's a part of me that kinda is like. . Hrm. 'Take his eyes! THe precious!!!'" Sanoke admits, immitating Smeagol from the Lord of the Rings.

"That's why I know, what my master told me about power is real. I won't let it consume me."* - Wed Sep 30 21:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I see, Suitengu felt anger and you have desire. - Wed Sep 30 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I'd have to say mine was nowhere anything like that. .  At first. - Wed Sep 30 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I simply felt like it was an instinct to look at the eyes, but now with this bounty. - Wed Sep 30 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I don't want innocent people to bear the burden. - Wed Sep 30 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So like you I have the feeling of taking other eyes in a safe way. So that those innocent people don't have to die. - Wed Sep 30 21:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: That's very noble, good on ya. - Wed Sep 30 21:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Thank you, however. .  It's not like I know a medic who can do something so hard. - Wed Sep 30 21:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: And I don't know if the others involved would like to lose their eyes in exchange for safety. - Wed Sep 30 21:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I mean honestly it's something that will never work. - Wed Sep 30 21:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: If I ask you to give your eyes up so that you'll be safe. .  Would you do it? I don't think so. - Wed Sep 30 21:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: No wayyy! - Wed Sep 30 21:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'll be fine. - Wed Sep 30 21:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I thought so. - Wed Sep 30 21:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Of course I don't intend to fight over it. - Wed Sep 30 21:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I don't want either of us to get hurt. - Wed Sep 30 21:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Phew. That's cool. - Wed Sep 30 21:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Plus I'm not strong either, so I'm sure I'd get my ass handed to me anyway. - Wed Sep 30 21:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: How do you know? I might be a weakling/ - Wed Sep 30 21:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I just know that I'm not strong, honestly. - Wed Sep 30 21:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Also, what I do know is this. - Wed Sep 30 21:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: There's a way to progress these eyes. - Wed Sep 30 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: As you know there's one ring. - Wed Sep 30 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . .? - Wed Sep 30 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: However a boy named Suitengu has two. - Wed Sep 30 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: He told me he got it by eating lots of honey buns, obviously hiding the truth. - Wed Sep 30 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm? - Wed Sep 30 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: C'mon. It's obviously based on instincts. - Wed Sep 30 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: And then there's a person named Edge who wants to bring us all together and do research. - Wed Sep 30 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Instincts? - Wed Sep 30 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: What do you mean? - Wed Sep 30 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: The eyes are a special power. . . But only a portion of the special power. - Wed Sep 30 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's likely this instinct is just a way to make the power become whole. - Wed Sep 30 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) frowns at the thought.

He already knew what just one ring had done to his psyche. "I don't think I want to see what happens if someone can complete the rest."* - Wed Sep 30 21:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm, that might be possible. - Wed Sep 30 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So you mean. .  The instinct of me looking at the eyes, you wanting the eyes and Suitengu being angry at the eyes. - Wed Sep 30 21:29:48 2015

And the time had finally come to complete the mission. 

A smile on his face, Sanoke speeds on down towards the south -- where the bulk of the construction had been occuring. Likely in attempts to speedily have this colosseum up in running condition. For the onlookers? They'd see nothing short of a streak or blur comprised of blue and white colorations.

After a quick jog down, the teen finally arrives at the base of the construction. All around, there were citizens and legitimate contractors working to bring the dream to life. The grin on Sano's face widened, due to the realization that the entire village was mirroring this high level of work ethic.

"Well then. . .I guess sitting back and admiring won't get me my three thousand Yen. I do need to get some money. . . to get more supplies for my fuuinjutsu. And. . ! I got the perfect jutsu for the job," the former chunnin said with a simper. His fingers press together, forming the unique seal required in releasing all shadow clone-based techniques. Overall, the male's chakra is immediately activated. Uniquely, unlike most jutsu, this skill targeted each particle of chakra in his very being.

The large mass is split off into four seperate portions, allowing Sanoke to be effectively made into five. His overall stamina reveroirs also are broken into fraction.Thankfully, as a genetic freak, the chunnin was still in relatively decent condition. "Sanoke Sasaki at your service!" he says with a beam towards the chief of the operation. "I was told to come help ya. It looks like you guys need a shinobi to speed this shit up. Right?"

"Yeah, yeah. Right now, we're finishing up this room here. It'll be where most of our civilians come to mingle and wait for the battles to be announced. Likewise, they'll also be able to purchase foods and drinks. We can handle the floor, and the layout is already made. We just need these tiles to be set on the roof," the helmet wearing contractor ordered out. His finger pointed ahead, directing Sanoke perfectly to the area that would require the most work. "Roger!" Without another thought, his body blurred away, along with three others doppleganger. 

The fourth and final? Had moved to gather the needed supplies, along with a item that could drag the tools up to the skies. "Alright guys! I want you all to split up evenly. Some will be tasked with spreading the cement-like thing. . . Uh, and the others will be placing tiles." By now, the clone that had remained behind does the necessary movements to have all the provisions provided. Swiftly, they're moving at work.

At first, a sticky, glue-like mixture is glazed around thoroughly on the roof's exterior. It's a thorough process, and one that's done swiftly, so that the five-some wouldn't run the risk of letting the mixture grow dry. If that happened, they'd have to break the now stone-like glazing apart, and start anew. And no one. . . I mean -no one- wanted to do that at all. Following closely behind them is the next set of clones.

They carry around a stack of tiles, each one made of finely crafted, glassy material.It's shiny, and clean enough to view your own reflection. They move with a bit more care than the aforementioned group, making sure to measure their placement cautiously so that the styling remained symmetrical. For the next half hour or so, the grouping of clones continue to work ahead, making sure that the roof is properly decorated. Before long, they're finished, however, and thus descend back to the floor.

On landing, each of the fakes are dispersed, allowing the actual Sanoke a far larger pool of energy to work with. Even then, he's still a tad bit exhausted, evident by his hunching over. . . "I think that should do it, boss. Make sure to vouch for to this Hassan guy, so I can get my cash . . "the teen bellows. Then the chief contractor just raises a brow, mystified. Before the teen knew it, a broom was thrusted into his chest.

". . .Clean up time. You did good, but make sure your mess is gone."

For the next hour or so, Sanoke obliges, although with hesistance. He  -- with irritation -- sweeps up and mops the floor that had grown stained with the sticky liquid from before. Some portions were tried, but many parts were still wet. After working hard enough, it seems the flooring had grown spot-less, prompting the obnoxious simp to speed ahead.

Via use of Shunshin, he exits the premisis, eventually going straight to the local plaza.* - Thu Oct  1 03:04:19 2015
