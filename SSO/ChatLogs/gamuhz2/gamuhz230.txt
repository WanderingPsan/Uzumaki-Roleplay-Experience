<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looks ahead to eye the giant spider.

His optics open wide, in shock -- but there isn't actually any legitimate fear. The lack of trepidation isn't to be taken as braveness. Rather, Sanoke was just that ignorant. He saw the giant creature as yet another beast, and everyone knew that beasts would always succumb to men.

"Huh. . . This is crazy."* - Sun Oct 25 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
What a bother. 

Unwilling to actually go tossed with that behemoth in hand to hand combat,Sanoke does what he does best. . . Keep at range, and flank the target into submission. Thankfully, it doesn't take much time at all for the former chunnin to spring into action. After doing a slight pivot, his body does a semi-circle sprint along the landscape, intent on getting ttowards the giant Spider's rear. 

Once in place, a short string of hand signs are completed, each one manipulating or shifting his chakra into the proper shaping.

Along with this, all is seamlessly transformed into the Doton natured affinity. Every inch of chakra floods onto the ground, invisible to the naked eye, despite the condensed concentration.  Thus, the ground rumbles, before massive, four-feet boulders are being ripped from the ground up. The sand literally clumped together during the elevation to spontaneously create the harden earth. As you would expect, each of the projectiles sling ahead, slamming against the Spider's hindlegs -- hopeful to deal damage that would prove effective in slowing it.* - Sun Oct 25 21:18:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Things went from bad to worse.

His ninjutsu seemed genuinely ineffective, and given that was Sanoke's best method of combat. . . Things weren't looking good at all. The second webs proceeded to be fired away, the boy sprints off, his boding being very bit as fast as the last time. Amidst the way, Nina's tiny body is picked up and suddenly displaced.

Theycome to a stop towards the north.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||And thus, the young Shinobi begins with the long, arduous process of increasing his knowledge over an abundance of elemental ninjutsu. For today? It seemed to geared around primarily Doton-based ninjutsu.

Thankfully, it seems that his teacher had chosen kindly and had not picked a ranking that was far beyond Sanoke's capacity.

It was dubbed D-ranked, and with that, the boy began reading. Overall, the application of the ninjutsu was easy -- based on what had been explained. It wa a technique that Hiding Like a Mole as a catalyst. Once underground, the shinobi would be tasked with manipulating the earth underneath their opponent's feat. Once a good enough hold had been conjured, the ground up ahead was next to be shifted.

All in all, the basic Doton technique was meant to craft a trench so that you could pull your opponent in, and thus keep them bound. Simple in reading, and hopefully simple in practice. Giving it a try, Sanoke's body is covered in an invisible viel of Doton chakra. In this state, he's more than capable of digging through the ground and tunneling around. 

Easily, the floor shifts, and two arms spike up, grasping at the would-be area of the ankles. Alas, it was hard to really practice a jutsu when you didn't quite have a partner to work on.* - Mon Oct 26 16:37:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Sanoke remained sitting along the ground, his legs folded ontop of one another. Diligently, his eyes scan the paper, picking up a wealth of knowledge. Overall, it taught another basic, yet severely powerful elemental technique. A skill dubbed Earth Stone and Bamboo Shoot.

Considering Sanoke's recent growth, and ability to utilize elemental ninjutsu in a competent manner, the boy doesn't typically have a hard time in understanding what the jutsu scroll was depicting. For the next hour or so, you would take notice of the teen reading each different letter the scroll had to offer. His mind absorbed the information, almost like a sponge.

Given enough reading, the would-be hermit arises,and aims to try the jutsu out for himself.

"Alright. . .This is just like my other techniques, but with an emphasis on shape manipulation. The objective is to form sharpened spikes that sit ontop of pillars. . .From there, I control the earth again, forming them to jut out to attack my opponent. .  Easy enough."

Throughout the personal pep talk, Sanoke was competent in his gathering of chakra. A size-able quantity is developed or kneaded through all this time, before at last, he presses both palms against the ground. The floor shook and grunted, as it usually did, before eventually two very powerful pillars erupted through the skies, enough to potentially penetrate an opponent. Sadly, it expends more chakra then he'd like, prompting a premature recess.* - Mon Oct 26 19:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Finally, after some downtime, he proceeds to work on the basics of the Almighty Chakra flow. With all of the studying Sanoke had done in the past, it's clear that he's glazed off the topic of 'Chakra Flow' at some point in time. Indeed, the process of flowing chakra into a material or object to empower it. It's been done in many different capacities over the centuries, with some even using basic chakra and manipulating the shape in order to make lethal weapons into absolutely constructions of death.

However, in the teen's constant studies, it's clear that the best application of the concept comes when you attach an elemental affinity into the mix. From the five basic elemental flows, each had to be done differently based on that particular element's special properties. For Raiton, you had to ensure that yourflow was vibrating at a specific frequency. For Fuuton, there had to be two speedy, closely knitted opposing currents running along the edge of your blades in order to sharpen it.

And of course, for Doton, you merely had to effect the atoms just as you would common earth. In this occasion, you were hardened or compacting the atomic particleswith your own chakra, and thus making for a harder, much more damaging weapon. Wasting little time, Sano proceeded to grab along the hilt of his tanto, pouring out a thick stream of pure-hearted chakra. 

It seeps over the metal weapon slowly, like a bottle of molasses. Once thoroughly wrapping around the matter, the chakra glowed bright, illuminating and pulsating like a light saber. He'd grunt, pushing the bulk of his focus into ensuring that the 'chakra flow' had been done properly. Unlike most who tackled on the usage of this ninjutsu, however. . .Sanoke was actually pretty experienced with the Doton element in general.

Given his restless pursuit, in the end, about half of the chakra that's been discharged find a home within the atoms of the tanto itself. Using it's earthly properties, the weapon briefly takes on a darkened tint or coloration -- signalling that the deed had been done. 

With an exhale, the jutsu is released.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods.

"Of course!" He had spent sometime within the Turtle Oasis to search or locate a shell that would suit Hiroshi's physique. Having done such, the male presses his hand against the ground, casually summoning a medium-sized shell. It was thicker and a bit more dense than even Sanoke's, as he could tell that Hiroshi was a bit more physically powerful.* - Mon Oct 26 20:34:20 2015

A glance is given upward, right towards the sun that released heavy rays onto the atmosphere. "God damn! You're sweaty already. . .Ya sure you don't want to take a lighter set?" Sanoke asks with a legitimate, wide-spreadsmirk. 

His hand pressed against his side, conjuring up a simple fan and a bottle of water. Damn. . . That ninja conveniently carries anything he'd need. It's tossed ahead for Hideo's own use.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: alright..  - Tue Oct 27 00:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) 's hand moves fast as fuck to snatch that leaf!

The comment or instructions really seemed trivial. Thinking nothing of it,  Sanoke blankets the leaf with both hands. And while Marissa had remained somewhat vague on the elemental release itself -- the boy had thankfully recalled a large amount of information from his private studies. "Alright. . . All elemental releases are either conjuring up the elemental substance, or manipulating a pre-existing source. Luckily, with Fuuton air is always around me. . . " the turtle summoner stated in a quiet fashion. 

His mind vividly drifts back to the countless nights in which he had gone to sleep researching all of the interesting tidbits or theories revolving about the manipulation of chakra. It was a strange fascination, all with one goal -- that was to become of the strongest shinobi in the generation. And by that point, to also gather enough strength to be given the title 'Mizukage.' Sadly, things changed, but with enough luck, the teenager held a fresh memory as his mind tended to absorb information like his life depended on it. Indeed, despite Sanoke's childlike and dimwitted demeanor, he was quite intelligent.

Wasting no time, the boy's chakra is churning on the inside. It flows in a rapid, unruly fashion -- crashing against the folds of cells or organic tissue that lined along his stomach and protected the rest of his body. His eyes fell shut, as he knew one thing from meditation -- getting away from worldly distractions, even something as simple as the viewing of the sand around him -- would greatly aid in all things spiritual. Which this certainly was. . . considering it employed usage of your spiritual energy to command the elements themselves.  Before long, there was a thick and steady stream of chakra ready to be poured out.

It runs along the chakra high-way, this being the chakra pathways that hosted the countless 'nodes' or 'points' in which this powerful energy could be released. As they travel, each particle eventually reaches the palm area, and seeps out from the aforementioned nodes. The chakra is as thick as it had been when once developed, and thus was viewable to the naked eye. For reference, his energy was much like normal, non-corrupted beings -- Azure tinted, and healthily pulsating. He hums, as the warm feeling briefly interacts with his body before landing along the leaf. "Keep. . at it. . "

And all the easy work had been done. . . 

From both hands, the process was being done simultaneously blanketing or enveloping that some, thin leaf. "Alright. . .Now I manipulate the air waves around the leaf. . . My chakra is to become one with the oxygen itself.  That way, I can bend it to my will. . ." Sanoke muttered. His eyes remained closed for the process, the lids fidgeted and his face scrunched up. It was hard -not- to begin 'Hrnng'-ing like a fucking Yoshi, but the teen manages. Eventually, after fifteen or so minutes of constant effort, the air finally grows cooperative. "Alright. . .! Now lets go. . "

In no time, the air currents are halved into two. Each one flowing in the opposing direction. It was this! This was what the basic principle of Fuuton was all about, manipulating air in a multitude of ways simultaneous. As such, considering the rapid movements, the momentum is enough to work at the leaf, tearing at the rigid cells that this vegetation possessed. It wasn't going to be an easy thing at all. In fact, Sanoke spawned sweat along his forehead,  and his breath grew a bit heavy -- but the boy never once contemplated giving up. "C'mon. . C'mon. . . " Sanoke urges himself, but to no avail. By then, there was slight tearage occuring within the centre of the leaf-- akin to fabric that's been stretched far beyond it's thresh hold.

Like the little engine that could, Sanoke perservered and kept going with undying persistance. Given enough of his hard work, the currents gained in strength and ferociosity. It doesn't take -too- long for a powerful enough current to ascend into the needed levels. Thus, the leaf finally is cut in half mostly, with the last tethered portions being at the end. The entire sequence took a grand total of. . . fifty-minutes, before Sanoke had delivered the severed object towards Marissa's optics. "There. . ."* - Tue Oct 27 00:40:06 2015

Sanoke muttered, eying the detailed explanation that were given with the assortment of information that had been produced. It detailed the ranking, which was C, along with the other crucial info that came with learning jutsu. One in particular that caught Sanoke's attention was the portion dealing with 'Hand Signs.'

The special part? It required absolutely none. All in all, the jutsu was done simply via the clap of a hand, which wasn't too insane consideirng the simple yet powerful nature of the jutsu. Starting off, he's beginning with the practice while simultaneously reading over the wealth of information.  A substantial congregation of energy surges within his belly, gaining a larger level of condensation and generally growing more powerful or potent than ever before.

This was going to be a sequence that was ever-repeating, sure enough. Without another thought, Sanoke takes a single step forward, pressing his hands together with a loud clap. That single forces the tenketsu to activate in a peculiar way because. . . Naruto Logic! By then, teh chakra is flushing out and attacking the air ways directly, enough to produce a lukewarm gush of wind. It wasn't straightforward nor uniform -- as the technique commanded.

By then, you'd know the drill. Once Sanoke had started with something, he would never stop until ready. Brusquely, he resumes with the endless repetition, each time given life to a more precise execution, or one closer to the 'finished product.' GIven that he was no genius, or prodigy, Sanoke eventually manages to produce a singular, uniformed gust, the likes of which could improve a weapon's strength.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Given some rest, Sanoke continued with his tireless, boring act of learning several ninjutsu. It wasn't something that could really be done overnight, and thus. . . . All of these descriptions detail a lengthy and tiring training montage over some obscure week or two.

In this time, he proceeded with the next, offensive competent technique -- the Air bullets. The scroll, this time around, was far more refin ed and detailed, which is why Sanoke was now eager to begin. It revolved about shape manipulation more or less and forming several different projectiles.

He huffs, forming the 'Bird' handsign, and of course allowing the energies that flowed within to begin building up. Once a large quantity is built up, his Fuuton-based energies move ahead, lodging within the lung-pipes.  As it sits there, the air molecules within his body are literally being shifted into miniture spheres. It's a difficult task, and given that he lacked the natural ability or talent in the element';s release.

As usual, the first attempts are difficult. Instea,d he works his way on up, even using a balloon for practicing purposes. Using the elastic toy, Sanoke practices the art of releasing his ninjutsu by first exercising the proficiency in which he could build up the Fuuton chakra as well as rotating it. The goal? To fill the balloon to max capacity. . .And keep it -just- from combusting. From there, he simply sent it in a circular spiral, and kept the energy containe enough that it didn't explode.

With that eventually mastered, Sanoke effortessly is enabled to send a volley of Fuuton blasts.* - Tue Oct 27 07:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||And in this fast-paced weeks, Sanoke kept at his processes and working to refine his ability in the Fuuton affinity overall. Like usual, it seemd that his teachers would have him work on the elemental abbility of Chakra Flow.

Going over the plan and the scroll, the process is a generally simple one. Working with the information given, he grasps the hilt of his Tanto and generally begins to smother with his spiritual energy. Just as with the training with Doton Chakra Flow, his chakra floods ahead, wrapping along the surface and illuminating the object like a light saber.

He doesn't stop there. Once the energy had been firmly in place, he goes ahead, shifting it into the elemental affinity of Wind. Easily, this is done by attacking the air particles just ahead of the Tanto and taking ahold of the air currents. Two opposing currents are conjured within a span of a few millimeters of one another. That closeness is honestly what keeps the technique held together to be frank.

As a regular human, SAnoke visibly struggles with performing the jutsu properly. It takes several repetitive tries, but in the end the would-be Sage is victorious. Testing the weapon out, the former Kirigakure shinobi takes a step forward, and swipes down, cutting effortlessly through a nearby tree.* - Tue Oct 27 07:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||By then, two weeks had passed since Sanoke had embarked on his journey to get a basic understanding of the assortment of Air skills. Marissa had given a tall-task, but as usual, the boy wasn't going to back down from a challenge or even a difficult task. Thankfully, the skill in question was actually related to the previous technique learned as it expanded upon the 'Chakra Flow' ability entirely. In fact, you could see it as a specialized application of the Chakra Flow ability, considering it took that and expanded it further.

Abrief moment is taken to read the scroll which grants a large sum of information. 

'The Rotating Shuriken technique is a skill meant to bridge the gap between ninjutsu and shurikenjutsu. Essentially, your chakra is to wrap around each edge of your weapon, and grant it with a layering of Fuuton chakra. To be more specific, this means you're supposed to generate a visible current that would thus grant you the ability to control and manipulate the weapon. It's useful for catching your enemy off guard,' the scroll depicts. 

Of course, right after, there is an indepth diagram that placed towards the bottom,  greatly adding in Sanoke's understanding. It shows precisely the quantity and the detailed manner in which you're supposed to flow your chakra. Upon reaching the edge of the blades, it shows that a shinobi is subsequently able to use their control of the chakra and manipulate a Shuriken.

After reading, SAnoke quickly gets into work. For this? He's actually quite skillful given the simple nature. A single, five-inched shuriken is taken within the centre of his palm, and of course chakra speeds over it. With little effort, he manipulates the air currents, forming a visible. . . Thick covering of wind that wraps around the metallic surface. Before long, he sends or tosses the bladed weapon ahead, and with that he proceeds with the practicing.

With little effort, the shuriken is sent in all types of different angles.  After doing a complete rotation, it comes back, landing snuggly between his finger tips. . One more jutsu was left.* - Tue Oct 27 08:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Then came the final and arguably most powerful ninjutsu!

The 'Great Breakthough' technique. Given the nature of the technique and the wide range in which it covered, and the immense power that -needed- to be put forth. . . This was going to be something that Sano visibly struggled with.

From start to finish, he's having trouble making heads or tails of the ninjutsu. The scroll didn't have that much information to offer either, given that it simply depicted a shinobi releasing a large mass of chakra towards a given area. With that said, talk was cheap -- Action is what reallyt spoke.

Taking a step forward, his hands blurred through the assortment of hand signs, each one manipulating or sending his tenketsu different signals. Having completed all six,the boy is ready. Steadily through the stream, chakra was already being funneled about, and sent into the atmosphere. From there, it spreads and sulk, reaching the bulk of the boy's range of vision. He huffs. . . his body shaking from the strain that had been induced from working with such a vast quantity.

"Alright. . . Keep it. . "

A shaded gaze is dropped back onto the scroll, and from that glance, he's able to further immerse himself in the training. For the first attempt? There's clear failure. But as time progressed, he's able to keep the outpour of energy more stabalized, and of course is enabled to gain more bang for his buck. On wht could be the two-hundredth attempt -- which occurs over the course of two weeks, he's actually able to get somewhere.

At once, the chakra fuses with the air molecules directly.  And steadily, more and more chakra is pumped out. At the same time, there's a massive current of wind that suddenly springs forward, pushing back everything in sight,. The collision or force is enough to even send boulders flying back in recoil. . . Albeit, Sanoke isn't really able to keep the sequence up for much time. After completing this, he falls to a single knee, gasping for air.* - Tue Oct 27 08:42:14 2015
