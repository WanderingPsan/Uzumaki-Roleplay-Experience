<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) yawns. 

Casually, he goes about teaching Shin another basic technique, and honestly. . . It was a surprise this was ranked so highly.

"For this jutus, hiding like a mole, you'll use properties I've already taught ya. Basically, after building up an appropriate amount of chakra, you flow it onto the ground. Your energy is to bind with the sand particles, and break it down to a powder form, forcing the earth to be loosen. Once you can do that, use your doton nature to help displace or relocate the powder sand, enabling you to dig real fast! . . . Kinda like a Mole. Get it?"

Sanoke proclaims. 

He casually presses against the ground and digs right on through, his body re-emerging several feet south.* - Fri Oct 23 19:25:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) takes a quick first wstep, chakra funneling around his frame. Once in distance, a hand presses against the ground, allowing the outpour of energy that again reducet he sand into a powdery state. Loosening up the ground, Sanoke is easily able to pull the young shinobi up.  "-- Geez. How'd ya manage that? I didn't even instruct you to revert the ground to it'[s previous state," the Doton instructor replies with a hearty chuckle.* - Fri Oct 23 19:37:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blinks.

Assuming he doesn't take notice of anything weird chakra-wise, the shinobi moves to high-five Saeza. "What's up. . ?"* - Fri Oct 23 20:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) apparently has his glasses taken.

Quickly, he keeps his eyes closed, and rushes backward.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) is hit in the head cause he didn't have his eyes open.

Briefly, the shinobi moves to grab te items off the ground, opening his eyes for just a bit. Had she been paying attention, she'd take notice of the purple coloration of his schelera. 

The sun glasses are back in no time. "Tch. Not cool."* - Fri Oct 23 20:30:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) was very protective of MAdelyn, as that could potentially be his family member in the future.

"Nah. You take a step back too, Madelyn. If this guy got a problem, he can go through me," Sanoke replies. He takes a step forward, using his forearm to gesture Madelyn's back. A hand bites against his thumb, and without a single thought, blood is drawn.

Effortlessly, in five seals, chakra funnels out, forming a glyph that spawns his almighty summoning -- Ganba. Standing ontop, the boy granted a fierce glare -- completely losing his typically childlike persona. 

A Kunai had been grasped, clearly ready to go.* - Fri Oct 23 20:39:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||--And suddenly, blindness!

The eye contact serves as a catalyst for the strange genjutsu, enough that it can penetrate through Sanoke's defenses, and induce temporary blindness. Regardless of the strange state, the male made sure not to sure any distress or panic -- he was still in control.

". . .Why the fuck didja call me out here, Sano? I'm gettin' tired of you bringing me out when we're not going to fight," Ganba, the turtle, complains. He's laying down somewhat lazily.

"---Neat technique. If you stop being so quick to fight, maybe you could be a cool ally," the summoner declared, his tone losing the sternness and reverting back to his usual carefree nature.* - Fri Oct 23 20:49:16 2015

"Alright. And man, I've been meaning to spar you some time. I wonder how well I'd do against someone of your strength. You're like a Jounin, right?" He says with a shrug. A glance is given around, and figuring that it was getting too crowded.

"Anywho. . Gonna step away--" Cue speeding off towards the west.* - Sat Oct 24 00:14:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Oooh. Badass. - Sat Oct 24 01:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) grinned as the shell finally came off.

It slammed onto the ground harshly, forcing the floor to shake and for dust to fly up briefly. "I ain't going to lie! I'm honestly a little shocked you managed to last this long with that heavy ass turtle shell! I had anticipated that you'd give up prematurely. . . After all, not many people can endure the weight for entire days. Good on ya. . . But lets. . . Start this!"

He jogs in place, loosening up the muscles and getting each cell of blood flowing. Clearly, Sanoke was eaager to begin -- and once Beth had seemed ready, off the boy was. His speed was surreal, making it different for most to track his movements, as the second was in one place, his body was going to be displaced to an entirely different location.

Utilizing this overwhelming velocity, Sanoke would aim to land right behind Beth's rear. Breaking into a sprint, a rotating kick is delivered, with the intent on slamming right on the woman's ankles and send her landing onto the floor.* - Sat Oct 24 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: . - Sat Oct 24 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) chuckled wildly as the kick does it's job, sending Beth right onto the floor.

Quickly, he does a few flips, landing paces away from the kunoichi. Hopefully this would have given her some much needed breathing room.

"Don't be so discouraged! I'm sure you got some tricks up your sleeves too, right? I really doubt that you haven't gotten faster. You practically lived with that shell on your back! C'mon! Keep going!" Sanoke shouted in encouragement. He had no intent on letting this spar end prematurely after all.* - Sat Oct 24 01:45:23 2015
