<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) grabs.

He builds up chakra and disappears in a plume of smoke.* - Fri Nov 20 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) settled the medic down upon the sand.

Once done, he skips backward, gaining much needed distance or space. His glasses are readjusted to ensure his eyes remained concealed. "Alright. . .Give me your best shot. Even if I know that jutsu isn't particularly powerful," Sanoke replies. He kneels, a hand stretched out.* - Fri Nov 20 16:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: its fine - Fri Nov 20 17:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
He stayed put, his Rinnegan flaring to read the chakra. It wasn't hard to understand the sequence that was being done. "Alright. . .this is the build up of chakra. . . Now steady yourself, and be ready," Sanoke murmured to himself. He was practically his own coach, given that there wasn't really anyone of a high enough level to be a true guide or teacher.

In no time, the chakra from Kiyoko's body rushed ahead, fusing with the wind and giving life to the ninjutsu. Before long, Kiyoko's will is applied, forcing the currents to twist and speed forward to his form. Naturally, he could read the flow of chakra as his doujutsu enabled such.

His body was brimming wht anticipation, each muscle tense and prepared. At last, both palms shoot ahead, forcing the first of his Rinnegan's prowess to be released. "Alright. . .Here goes nothing! Hopefully I don't end up getting my ass kicked over this!" This was perhaps the first time Sanoke had been tasked with using his specialized ability in actual combat. . so being nervous was to be expected.

It was like watching a movie in slow motion by now. The momentum from the wind forced an un-natural gale to sweep through the area. The sand grains below shook in opposition, some even fleeing away from the scene. Still, despite some jitters, the teen remained put, a fierce glare being worn as testiment to his determination.

Abruptly, a translucent veil of chakra shot from his form, forming an orb about his body. The palms were at the forefront, and just as the twirling tornado came his way, each particle of chakra could itself being sapped. It was as if the ninjutsu had ran into a vaccum or blackhole, that devoured any and every source of chakra insight. 

". . C'mon . . .C'mon! Keep it steady!" Due to Sanoke's inexperienced, the process is far from perfect. His body shook and the wind itself quivered before being assimiliated into the former shinobi's body. After a total of three seconds, all of the chakra from before had been naturally dissipated and now lingered within Sano's own body. After all was said and done, the boy exhaled, clearly content.

"That was harder than expected. . "

Indeed it was. Despite his skill in Fuuinjutsu, it wasn't often that he'd be tasked with perform such a complex technique on the fly. Sanoke remained in the same stance, with his palms held out, and feet firmly set onto the floor. "Again?"* - Fri Nov 20 17:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: After the chuunin exams. - Fri Nov 20 17:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Part 1 begins today. - Fri Nov 20 17:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gained confidence from the first successful use. His eyes flared with a unique fire, his soul burning with anticipation! "Alright. . .Let's try this again! Don't be afraid to use more powerful, if that's not your full strength!" Sanoke urged with some excitement.

Once more, his eyes kept track of all the processes that occured. From the handseals formation, to the build-up of chakra internally. In no time, it was clear that she was inducing the potent nature type of Fuuton, as Kiyoko's energy seemed to cascade from her form and into air. Just as with the last, the adrenaline flowing through Sanoke's body practically allowed him to view everything in slow motion.

The hairs on his body stood up, particularly once the wind was being blown forward in a twisting fashion. "Alright. . .!"

Bracing himself, the teen was vigilant his palms already placed into the proper position to go after the attack. Before long, the basic Fuuton technique had reached it's destination. But fortunately, not all was going to go to plan, saving the boy from being potentially harmed. On impact, the elemental technique found itself literally being devoured.

Almost as like being thrown into a distortion in place, just as quickly as the chakra had been formed. . . it was being depleted. Naturally, Sanoke was wearing that same protection from before -- this being a giant dome of translucent chakra. The highest bit of concentration  was clearly near the palms, which is where the focal point of the technique was demanded to be. 

With each passing second, the jutsu begins to dissipate further, before being nothing more than a mere after thought. Had Kiyoko been sensing? She could likely determine the nature or origin of the fantastic skill. Indeed, with each application of the special technique, Sanoke's eyes flared with chakra. In addition, the strange feeling in Sano's energy that could be detected before? It grew more potent.

That said, despite the absorbtion process being slower, he still showed visible difficulties. His body stepped back almost on reflex, as if the momentum from the initial blow had already carried over, despite the technique itself being reduced to nothingness.

"Phew. . . Again."* - Fri Nov 20 17:44:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: You guys. . .have fun or what not. - Fri Nov 20 17:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) chuckled a bit lightly to himself at Kiyoko's response. "Hah! Did I say something wrong?" He asks honestly, unsure if his comments had once more inadvertantly enraged someone. Sanoke had a knack for doing so.

'Course, before a response could be given, the training had resumed, with the woman again flicking her wrists and conjuring up a powerful gust of wind. This doesn't come as a surprise, however, so the teenager is more than prepared to tackle the next threat. Through this all, Sanoke was making sure to analyze not only Kiyoko's own outpour of energy, but also his own technical works.

This is what training was. To become proficient with any technique, be it ninjutsu, genjutsu, or taijutsu. . . One had to remain mindful to detail, or at least hold great attention to it. It was like working on a metaphysical muscle. Sure enough, repetition was key, but doing the process mindlessly never helped anyone. 

Thus, in the last few sequences, Sanoke's attention is half-way shifted to how precisely the Fuuinjutsu-esque technique had been formed. In the last few attempts, the spherical outpour of energy that served a dome around his body had been partially sporadic. Anyone who knew -anything- about Fuuinjutsu could tell you one thing. If your seal was uneven or unstable, you're going to have a hard time.

As such, despite the incoming tornado or spinning gust, the male ensures that his body retains a state of calmness. This was pretty hard, as he wasn't quite use to abusing his 'gift' in simple spars, nor was his exited jitters doing him any favors. In spite of the issues, Sanoke manages to bring down his level of excitement just a tad-- and in the knick of time.

The second the ninjutus is within striking distance, chakra pulsates from his body. Naturally, the translucent, cyan tinted dome speeds up from every point of his body, serving as a shield. The second the Godly Wind comes in contact, the same process repeats itself. With ease this time, all of the energy is assimilat3ed right into the warrior's body.

On this occasion, it takes about a second max. In addition,. his body is completely stationary, showing an alarming rate of growth in terms of proficiency. "Phew. . .Alright. Want to take a break?"* - Fri Nov 20 17:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Nifty technique, though. - Fri Nov 20 18:02:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You just saw me use my one and only offensive attack. - Fri Nov 20 18:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh. . Hrm. I guess that makes sense. And you don't have your weapon yet either. - Fri Nov 20 18:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Nope. - Fri Nov 20 18:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'm not about ranks anyway. - Fri Nov 20 18:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Makes sense, I guess. It's not like being a chunnin will suddenly make you any more or less important as a medic. - Fri Nov 20 18:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Aren't ya like in charge of the hospital anyhow? - Fri Nov 20 18:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yes, I am. - Fri Nov 20 18:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I would only raise myself in rank if it was necessary for security clearance. - Fri Nov 20 18:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Mmm. . .You probably won't even need to take some exam. He'll probably just promote you. - Fri Nov 20 18:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mhm. - Fri Nov 20 18:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Anywho. What's up now? Kinda done training for the day. - Fri Nov 20 18:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mn... what do you want to do? I didn't even get tired from that. I need Lera to teach me more techniques. - Fri Nov 20 18:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You're lucky to have Lera, y'know. She taught me how to use Doton. On a side note. . Uh. I'm unsure. - Fri Nov 20 18:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: What do you usually do? - Fri Nov 20 18:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Uh... well I mean I usually go around helping people... but Aza just walked off, Akira had a session earlier... no one's hurt.... - Fri Nov 20 18:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And I know I'm lucky.~ - Fri Nov 20 18:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) flicks out of view. He stops by Kiyoko's side, while throwing an arm over her shoulder. 

His other hand moves, flicking the woman in the forehead. "Lame. Ya gotta live a little. Life isn't all about servicing other people. I mean. . " He scratches his head, seemingly now having trouble conveying his thoughts.

"Not that it's bad to help other people or anything."* - Fri Nov 20 18:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
"Well find time for yourself! I'm sure you got like. . a thousand employees," he remarks with mild amusement. The entertainment mainly coming from how jumpy Kiyoko proved to be. Hadn't she gotten used to this by now?

"I remember seeing some green haired chick lounging around at the hospital."* - Fri Nov 20 18:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh, you probably don't know her. And that's good, I'd hate for you to just be some workhorse all day. I've known people like that, and they're never happy/ - Fri Nov 20 18:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: But I'm happy, Sanoke-san. - Fri Nov 20 18:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Good. Anywho, probably going to see what's going on in the square. - Fri Nov 20 18:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Want a lift? - Fri Nov 20 18:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah...why not... - Fri Nov 20 18:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: *Sigh* - Fri Nov 20 18:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) walks infront and kneels.

"Secretly, you like being carried around, don't you? I know Mirai loves it."* - Fri Nov 20 18:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...it makes me sick but I am trying to get used to it. - Fri Nov 20 18:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh! I mean, I could go slower. I use shunshin off the time. Hop on. - Fri Nov 20 18:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) 's arms wrap about her thighs. Quickly, he begins to sprint, opting to use only his normal speed. It's still pretty swift, but at the very least, KIyoko would probably be able to comfortably perceive the movements.

Very little obstacles seem to slow Sanoke down, as he casually runs up the mountain's wall and scales it.

Onward to the square they went!* - Fri Nov 20 18:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Huh? - Fri Nov 20 18:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
A dust cloud could be seen building up in the distance as his feet repeatily pushed off the ground.

In no time, the spec that was observed gradually grew in size, revealing Sanoke's approach. He's beelining right to Lera, his foot slamming against the ground to force friction. Sand goes flying in sporadic directions, perhaps running the risk of getting onto those infront.

"Lera! What's up."* - Fri Nov 20 18:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) is carrying of course. * - Fri Nov 20 18:44:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gives a glance to Kiyoko. . .He couldn't quite make out what she said.

"Huh. . Hey, I think she's dizzy again. You want to hold onto her?"* - Fri Nov 20 18:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: I'm not a freakin baby. - Fri Nov 20 18:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) turns around and gives Lera an opening to take her.

"Hrm. . . How many of you guys are fighting in the chunnins anyway?"* - Fri Nov 20 18:47:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Maybe it would help me gain more control of it that way. - Fri Nov 20 19:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Easy enough. - Fri Nov 20 19:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) does so. He's a good safe distance away. His arms fold in anticipation. Just how powerful had Lera's chakra become?* - Fri Nov 20 19:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) was -very- intelligent, thus Lera's desire to bring him to assist was a pretty good call. His rinnegan was active at all times, allowing him to read the chakra being flowed perfectly.

For just a moment, he's taken back, impressed by how powerful and vast Lera's chakra had become. "Wow! You got a lot of energy. . . It's like you have an endless wealth of power! I haven't seen this much chakra. . . well since Tetsumi hulked out and used his sand thing. You should figure out how to use all of that added energy to make your ninjutsu more powerful," Sanoke remarked with dialating eyes. Sure enough, Lera still likely lagged behind him in strength..

But her sheer physical capabilities instantly caught the teen's attention. He wears a giant smile before turning back ahead over the earthen walls. 

With just that view, Sanoke is able to read the wealth of elements being poured in. . . Three different in particular. All of the different pools of chakra fused together into one. It was like watching a cake being baked, and this part was pretty much Lera being a 'chef' and pooling all of the ingredients together. What occured next was really. . . out of this world, prompting an excited roar.

"WOAH! I didn't know you had any special kekkei genkais, Lera!" 

Instead, each naturally fused, forming a golden sphere of energy. Considering it's complexed nature, it gained all of the destructive capabilities of the parents elements, and pretty much fused it into one. Naturally, given the properties of the previous trio, Sanoke could read just how destructive and versatile this had become.

"--- But you can't control it, that's for sure! Brace yourself!" It isn't long before the psuedo-kekkei tota combusts, destroying each layer of rock. His heart is racing, but thankfully all seems to end well. . .

There's a lull in conversation now as Lera inquires what had been seen.

"Pretty neat trick is what I saw. You fused together three natures, and basically used that fusion to amplify their usually destructive power. It was pretty damn powerful. Usually, your chakra just strikes cells, but this one was so powerful and precise that it went to attack individual atoms themselves. . . At least from what I could gather. The rock formation that was protecting us wasn't really -chipped- off. . Rather, you just automatically reduced it to dust."* - Fri Nov 20 20:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Atoms? I got that feeling as well, good it was confirmed... - Fri Nov 20 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: But as you say, I can't control it. - Fri Nov 20 20:12:35 2015

"Sounds gruesome. Neat ass trick, though. . .And with your reserves, the high amount of chakra shouldn't hurt you too bad."* - Fri Nov 20 20:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: To be honest. I haven't use anything in a long time that even scratched the surface... - Fri Nov 20 20:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Its partly thanks to my buddy here, practicing with him somehow increased my reserves. - Fri Nov 20 20:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Well obviously. . You got at least. . seven times my chakra. - Fri Nov 20 20:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: That much? - Fri Nov 20 20:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeah. - Fri Nov 20 20:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Huh. - Fri Nov 20 20:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: That's some bullshit high chakra. And all of this time.. - Fri Nov 20 20:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I thought I was some stamina beast. Well. . by stamina, I mean total energy. - Fri Nov 20 20:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Not just physical. - Fri Nov 20 20:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I dunno...I've always had high chakra. - Fri Nov 20 20:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Its just gotten higher as I've trained... - Fri Nov 20 20:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: So..any suggestions? - Fri Nov 20 20:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I want to improve the control of this new element. - Fri Nov 20 20:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm. . . - Fri Nov 20 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You could use Kage Bunshin to help you. Since you're all connected, you can work together for a single jutsu. - Fri Nov 20 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Have one around for each of the elements. - Fri Nov 20 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Then you'll be the forth pushing it all together, and forming the jutsu. - Fri Nov 20 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I've already tried that - Fri Nov 20 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Thats how I got injured. - Fri Nov 20 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: My clones can't hold the same amount of power as I can - Fri Nov 20 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Huh? You tried three in particular?  - Fri Nov 20 20:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: No...I did try it with two, - Fri Nov 20 20:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: But the strain of using three...it might be too much. - Fri Nov 20 20:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: My stamina reserves aren't that great. - Fri Nov 20 20:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: <*Scratches head*> Y'sure? It's not like each one would be doing all the processes themselves. They'd just be breaking the parts down for you. But if not that. . Hrm. . .Let me think. - Fri Nov 20 20:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) paces back and forth.* - Fri Nov 20 20:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I'm close...so close. - Fri Nov 20 20:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Its not just stability either. - Fri Nov 20 20:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Uh. Rather than fusing it all at once, take it slow. Have your three nature typesflowing ontop of one another.. - Fri Nov 20 20:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Its the containment side of it as well. The explosions are big, if I use it in battle i'd probably kill myself. - Fri Nov 20 20:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . Yuck. That's not a good thing. Hrm.. - Fri Nov 20 20:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: This is hard! I can't think of any chakra control exercises that would fit either. - Fri Nov 20 20:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: So hrm. . Building up the chakra and melding the three nature types isn't an issue. - Fri Nov 20 20:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's you shaping or keeping it contained.. - Fri Nov 20 20:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I've tried continuously 'flexing' the element. - Fri Nov 20 20:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: To sort of...I don't know...treat it like a muscle. - Fri Nov 20 20:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: As you flex, it gains strength right? - Fri Nov 20 20:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: That's right. Your soul is like a muscle. - Fri Nov 20 20:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: So the more I practice with smaller amounts. The better I get at larger amounts - Fri Nov 20 20:26:14 2015
