<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Such began his travels along the land of Wind. As a traveler, Sanoke wasn't exactlly adversed to leaving the protection of the Village hiiden among the Sand. Infact, he -relished- such, considering his attachment to a certain little Hokuma made it nearly impossible to travel and adventure as much as intended. 

"Finally. . .! Anywho, I'll catch up with you in a while, Kilm. Gotta go get my supplies. " If you paid close attention, you could easily see that Sanoke sported numerous, different scrolls on his side. Considering the constant battles that he had to endure, and the dependency of Fuuinjutsu as a whole, the boy often found himself exhausting his own resources. Thankfully, it paid to be rich as fuck. In short order, as his body blurs out of view, the shinobi would have paid ab rief visit to the local shops.

It's there that a multitude of devices or items are purchased. In ten minutes flat, Sanoke is fully stocked, and had sealed each of his weapons and food into said scroll. Thus, it takes just a few short seconds to speed along the landscape of Sunagakure, and thus be alongside Kilm's own frame, walking along. There's a backpack worn, and as usual, the boy sports his characteristic turtle shell, weighing himself done, and serving as a training device even as they sought to complete the mission.

The sun would rise, and slowly, the two set off. As usual, the energetic, and seemingly restless warrior moved ahead of the pack, taking advantage of his sensory abillity to detect any traps or other discrepancies. The day goes on, and seems longer than usual. . . But alas, the sun is setting.

As they travel for days on end, it seems the duo moved beyond the Land of Widn at last, and finally land within the different, neighboring coutry. The land of Lakes, and as expected, it was literally filled from head to toe in lakes. The landscape's beauty is dazzling, nearly forcing Sanoke's mouth to salivate. "Wooow! This is beautiful. . . -- " It's then that he notices Kilm moving ahead. Quickly, Sanoke follows behind, until they reach the designated area.* - Fri Oct 16 21:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Right. - Fri Oct 16 21:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Let's decide how we approach this. - Fri Oct 16 21:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Should I take the dictator on by myself? - Fri Oct 16 21:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Or first the army and then him? - Fri Oct 16 21:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Uh. You can take the dictator, don't really care. - Fri Oct 16 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'll distract the army? - Fri Oct 16 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We need to kill the army too. - Fri Oct 16 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Distract them till the dictator is dead and then take them out as well. - Fri Oct 16 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Sounds good? - Fri Oct 16 21:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Indeed. - Fri Oct 16 21:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Fri Oct 16 21:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Let's begin then. - Fri Oct 16 21:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) yawned.

He cared very little about actually having the shine, considering this dictator was a no-named, fodder. Taking Kilm's advice, Sanoke remained to the back, allowing the experienced elementalist to run the show. Just as the black-haired, elementalist is rushing about , the turtle sage comes from the rear, backing him up. With a single sign, the scrolls on his right side are ignited, and begin to vomit out the rest of it's contents. Dozens upon dozens of explosive mines are raining down from the air, crashing onto the surface world below. With each collision, the explosive chakra sealed within are unleashed, assault hordes of warriors.

In no time, the attention is shifted away from protector the castle of manor. Nay. . . Now? They had to focus on remaining alive. Even if he wasn't a big name, Sanoke wasn't any thing to be trifled with. They'd find that the explosive mines being utilized on this day were far superior to the regular explosive tags that most shinobi were probably accustomed too by now.

":Ah! Ahh! We're under attack!" Various men shouted, screaming like common school girls. And as they did? His body literally begins to blur, Sanoke's body that is. It was untraceable, at least not unless you held extraordinary sensory abilities. Considering the rate of velocity, he's free to dive right into the enemy's lines. It was like a phantom had appeared, and randomly smacks around the various troops that dared to stay in a stationary position. The rate of velocity, along with his impressive strengths/taijutsu skills forces many of the grunts to be sent flying.

For the next ten minutes, that's all Sanoke does, and it works well to keep the group distracted. Of course, things were going to get old fast. After the alloted time, he leaps into the air, making his presence known to the hordes of enemy shinobi to the ground. Foolish? MAybe, as it prompts a unified attack from all of those in the areas. But justas the kunai and fireballs were being sent, Sanoke is capable of ifnishing the last of the five seals and summon his companion. The famed turtle, and one of the more significant entities of the 'Turtle Oasis'. . .

Mr. Ganba!

The massive reptilian is spawned out of nowhere, with his bulky frame taking on the majority of the blows. Swiftly, the chunnin presses against the specimen's frame, prompting it to harden it's shell and gain weights. Like a freakin' bomb, it crashes, releasing a massive shockwave, andsending horde of the grunts flying in the opposing directions. They wer losing. . . Losing -bad-. Yet, despite how skilled Sanoke remained, he couldn;t quite win alone. E+As Ganba rolled on out, many are crushed.

Thankfully, by the end, Kilm had finished the deed, considering the ample distraction induced by Sanoke himself. Incombination, the duo take out the rest of the troops -- about ten more in general. Notably, despite Sanoke's odd mannerisms in fighting, not a single warrior that faced him had been killed. Some severely injured, yes. .. But not a soul having their life stripped from them. With this, the teen begins walking off, or rather. . . Having his turtle walk off with his legs folded over it.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) smiles brightly. 

He really loved to show off. Chakra funnels to his eyes, prompting another one of the Rinnegan's powers to be utilized. His right hand is held forward, and before long, black, sturdy objects come rushing through. Chakra receivers.

WIth her byakugan, Mirai would likely be able to tell one thing -- this substance was chakra conductive, and worked in conjunction with Sanoke's chakra. "I can do some neat stuff with it. Like if I poke someone, it'll block off their chakra."* - Sat Oct 17 01:20:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) eagerly nods.

You can tell just by the way he stood, he was estatic from the praise. His body oozed with arrogance, and excitement heavily, so much that it practically manifested into a tangible aura. In no time, the Black Receivers are dissipiated, evaporating into nothingness, just as swiftly as they had been spawned. "Yeah. It's pretty nifty. I haven't fully explored what I can do with these bad boys,"  Sanoke brags.

His arm is tossed right back on over the woman's shoulders.

"Anywho. Let's go do something? I'm hungry. Plus I wanna teach you a new technique -- two actually. Shunshin, and 'Wire Bind'. My teacher told me not to show anyone the latter. ..  and. . " Briefly, Sanoke loses his usually cheerful expression, and wears a look of subtle sadness. His mind drifts for a few moments, recalling the wonderful adventures he had in Kumogakure, alongside his teach in Fuuinjutsu -- the Mizukage, Noriko.

"But she isn't here anymore. So I guess it won't be too bad to show you one of my more reliable techniques. Whatcha think?" He asks, referencing the suggestions put forth just a few moments prior.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||What a time to enter the square. . .

He turns, taking notice of an angry mob? It was likely that Necromancer causing more trouble, just as Bryson had warned him. 

Already without his shell, Sanoke is at full capacity. At breakneck speeds, he's blurring around the landscape, closing the distance between him, and the general shinobi in no time. A single seal is spawned, crafting a slew of shadow clones.

Three in specific. One dives through the air, aiming to kick the male right in the face. "Shell Shocking kick!" Another clone simply moves at the ground level, ready to react should Mokutsu not relent in his utilization of Kagemane.

At last, the real Sanoke is rushing ahead, stopping just behind Mizora, although keeping tabs on the Nara as well. One sentence is provided. . . Yet it's the wisest the village has ever seen.

The clones disperse, returning much needed chakra to Sanoke's frame. He gives a gaze to Mizora and Susumu.

"Oi. Dark Magic man -- stop fuckin' spamming that jutsu. What possessed ya to use it on the tourist?" 

"And Mizora. What did you see?"* - Sat Oct 17 02:57:29 2015

"Damn. . . This chick is spicy," he muttered, clearly thinking aloud. 

"Anywho. I need to get this guy checked up on. Apparently got attacked? I need to investigate why he was attacked, though," the ex-chunnin replies. He gestures to Susumu all the same,  hopefully convincing Zenaki to do her healing magic.

A brief glance is given to Mizora. "Any clue why he did it?"* - Sat Oct 17 03:03:28 2015
