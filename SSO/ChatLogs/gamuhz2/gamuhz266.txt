<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods.

Apparently, his children were out, this time in strollers.

He tosses some cash over to Chikyu for the job well done. A glance falls on over to Babi. Quickly, Sanoke kneeled, unsure how to tackle the issue. A bottle is summoned forth, and held forward.

"Uh. . Want your bottle?" Cue prodding the child on the mouth with it.* - Tue Dec  8 05:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Trilliam(ZaVante) says: Oh wow look at the little ankle biters. - Tue Dec  8 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) exhales with content.

The bottle seemed to have done it's part, pacifying his distraught daughter. "Geez. . . She was just hungry. -- Oh, hi Chikyu! This is mine and Mirai's. A cutie ain't she--"

Then his son work. Casually, Sanoke moved to grab ahold of the child and lift him upward. "Hello, young Taku! Who's a good boy? Want to play?" He looks up to the skies, contemplating tossing the youngin' upward. Luckily, the Kazekage thinks against it, as this was a newborn.* - Tue Dec  8 05:17:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) grinned.

Taku was so chill. . He allows the young child to remain snug inside his hands. Eventually, the babble is brought to the Kazekage's chest and held there to rest against. The gathering of saliva didn't at all seem to harrass him much, even as it soaked up against his shirt.

"Yuck. . "

The teen turns, while still wearing a grin. "Say hello to your little sister."* - Tue Dec  8 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Same. - Tue Dec  8 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
A hand moves to grab Taku's arm. Casually, it moves to the child's arm, forcing a 'wave'. 

"See? Your brother is saying 'Hi!' Talk to him."* - Tue Dec  8 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Playin' with my baby. - Tue Dec  8 05:43:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) kneels.

He wasn't going to let his youngin' crawl around on the hot floor. Quickly, with a single hand, the young gal is clutched, and placed along his arms as well-- opposite of Taku.

"Hi, hi."* - Tue Dec  8 05:48:09 2015

A note is drafted up by his assisant. He doesn't care if Rias follows it exactly, but the point is to be made.

'Sunagakure nor Konohagakure will tolerate the slander given from the leadership in the Cloud Village. The current establishment is now, and will continue to be a vassal state of Sunagakure. After years of pouring in labor, we won't allow such insubordination. As such, one last plea for peace is given. Raikage -- stand down, or suffer. Any likeminded individual is urged to -- alongside their leader -- leave the village and start anew. But the land itself remains owned by Sunagakure."* - Tue Dec  8 07:04:57 2015

The british were coming.

Swarming in from the east, a storm of troops marched along the mountainous terrain. Many were along the ground, searching for any deterring traps in the approach. And others? Took the the skies.

Regardless, things were fixing to get hectic. The Kumogakure loyalists would find that the troops stationed here by Sunagakure also began to prepare themselves, each linking up communication systems and getting into strategic positioning.

"Lord Kazekage makes one demand. To cease with the act --- If you want to be independent, get off Sunagakure land. Make your own place from scratch. Please, don't let it come to this."* - Tue Dec  8 08:45:39 2015

Naturally. . Sunagakure wasn't exactly going to take this sitting down.

Being the land of wind, they exercise their Fuuton prowess, each one going a long way to dispelling the bulk of the explosions and traps. Likewise, members of the Hokuma clan are utilized, taking advantage of their enhanced visions to weed out any traps.

It would be different to get anything past them.'

Essentially, Sunagakure kept with the pressure.

Guns were blazing , elemental attacks coming from different squadrants, each one in unified groups, fitted with sensors. In this condition, it'd be less possible to attack Sunagakure warriors in packs.
