<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You can make the first move. - Sun Dec  6 08:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) wasn't even going to play with here!

In response to the same tactic, Sanoke's had quickly fumble through a series of handseals. Each one is done speedily, and is formated with perfection. On the last, the male exhales, allowing a gallon of chakra to speed into the air, and manipulate the current.

"Wind Style. . ! Great Breakthough manuever!" The gust builds up, forming an effective beam of wind. The strength was more than capable of dispersing the smoke, clones, and even Momura herself -- had she not taken the grounds as per the usual strategy!* - Sun Dec  6 09:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) had clearly seen this coming.

As the wind does it thing, his senses keened in, taking note of Momura's emerged from below. Quickly, Sanoke speeds on back, biting down on his thumb to showcase a truly marvelous technique!

"Just for you, okay? I'm going to show you my new technique!"

As the blood is drawn from the nibble, the shinobi's hand diligently goes through the all-too-familiar summoning handseals. The mitten presses against the air, allowing a thick, rapidly advanced sealing formula to overcome the area. In time, smoke erupts, allowing the area to be hidden for just a moment. 

Each bit of chakra that had been released first rain through Sanoke's genetic structure amidst the blood. Once the connection had been established, the vast quantity of chakra manuevered in order to manipulate the space-time continuum. Easily, portal is ripped open, conjuring up the gargantuan beast. . .Lord Gantora!

Abruptly, Sanoke was now positioned ontop of the gigantic chelonian, his size so great that it rivaled even the Kazekage mansion. Even asthe summoner was ontop, the beast fell a few feet from the skies, roughly slamming onto the desert floor. Given the massive weight, shockwaves fall over the ground, sending the entire area in a frenzy.

From there. . .Sano just sat ontop of the reptilian's head, a dumb smile being worn. 

Fiercely, Ganatora looked, examining the terrain as if in search of an imminent threat. "Sano-boooy! Why'd you bring me here of all places?! You know I freaking hate the desert climate! There had been better a damn good reason, or damn good fight. . Or. . Or...

"Take it easssy, pleeeasse! I wanted to shjow off to Momura for a second. Do you think you could fight that red-haired girl for me? Hahah."

The Boss Turtle says nothing,  and simply grunts with displeased.

Sanoke's cerulean gaze drifts back onto the ground, eying the apparently endowed teenaged girl. "Hey! This guy here is my minion! If you can't handle him, you can't handle me, okay? So give it your all!"* - Sun Dec  6 09:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: u - Sun Dec  6 09:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: I'll just have to skip over chuunin rank and became instant jounin to beat kinami.. - Sun Dec  6 09:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: Obviously. - Sun Dec  6 09:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
Blink, blink.

Ganatora  was baffled. He stared incredulously, in disbelief of what was happening. "Sano. . . This little human girl. . Is she real? She's. . Trying to slam me!" 

One of the turtle's 'hands' manuevered, prepared to grasp or summon the Shell-based sword he always carried. . But thought against it. Was going to such extremes really necessary for an opponent of this calibar. Quickly, Ganatora's appendage swiped forward, aiming to grab ahold of the teen.

Given the sheer size and speed, the movement builds up quite the draft. It's fierce enough to send the sand particles below shifting, almost as if a natural occurence. The path was right towards Momura.

And if capable of doing such? She's being lifted up.Apparently by the bra strap, considering the girl had no shirt on for some reason. For now. . Ganatora is just lifting her upward in a gradual, leisurely fashion.

"Is this really. . the threat?"* - Sun Dec  6 09:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: I shouldn't bother taking out Ganba. - Sun Dec  6 09:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
Ganatora huffed with annoyance as Momura slipped on through is grasp. She tumbled along the ground -- giving the ample time for a decision to be made. Obviously, the turtle could have easily used his Katana to slice the girl into next week.

But this time, simpler measures were going to be taken.

Indeed, Momura's swift speeds enable her to close the distance in little time. But all the same, chakra is being built up simultaneously with the velocity from the young kunoichi. On instinct, his mouth is puffed up, as the chakra inside his body produces a vast amount of water. 

One blow clocks Ganatora on the head--- and with that, his cranium shifts. A large sphere of water fliesforward, it's size correspondant with the Turtle's head, and of course the water coming directly from it's gullet. The point? To wear Momura out with concussive damage, and to know her right out of the skies. . . 

"Suiton Style. . . Teppodama!" Seemingly, being a giant, un-movable wall wasn't it's only perk. Mr.Tora was quite proficient with elemental releases as well!* - Sun Dec  6 09:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
"Sano. . This chick ain't half bad! Hang on! We're going for a ride now!"

At his behet, the Kazekage activated the suimen ability, tethered his body onto the giant monstrosity's frame. Despite being a giant turtle, Ganatora held some quickness to his body, and of course could just as easily react to Momura's repeated assaults.

The gargantuan specimen immediately stood on hind legs for the briefly of moments, while conjuring up his shell-based Katana. It was boney, and matched the design of the massive, brown colored shell that he wore on his back for protection. It swipes through the air, aiming to slam the blunt end against momura's back, hopefully keeping her at bay, and away from striking his relatively undurable body.

Hit or miss, Ganatora continued with the assault, once more building up the necessary chakra. . and literally slamming his maws onto the sandy surface. This time, the mass of energy built was based on Doton nature, which quite literally invaded the earth to rip it asunder. THe floor shock rapidly, and the ground itself was beginning to give up, threatening to swallow the genin up, if not just partially.

"---Geez! Don't you think you're going a little hard? Just grab her up!"* - Sun Dec  6 09:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
The showmanship thoroughly impressed Ganatora, and it showed!

As Momura ninja'd off the blade, the weapon is quickly released, being pressed into the ground. "Oi. . THis girl got spunk. I should capture her first, before things get hasty!"

WIth controlled strength, the beast does a simple cross chop, although it moves with great ferociosity. The goal being to hammer along and send Momura flying right back onto the flooring, hopefully leaving her dazed and susceptible to being grasped again.

"Wow! Are you really having trouble with my light weight, Gana??"* - Sun Dec  6 10:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
Boom!

Second blow! A green hand swiftly moves to grab ahold of Momura once more, this time by the bra strap. Assuming she hadn't wiggled away, the woman is casually lifted through the skies, and gradually is being brought on over to Sanoke.

"Well, well, well! Have you had enough? I have more jutsus, but I don't want to overwhelm you!" The teen taunted. He current laid on the turtle's shell now that it had settled down. His gaze wasn't even focused on momura for the time being -- that's how cocky Sanoke was.* - Sun Dec  6 10:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

Snap!

He instinctively looks up, his face flushes red! Blood flowed across his body, mostly to his nether region, and gradually to hise nose. On cue, Sanoke's hand rose, aiming to hide the shameful facial expressions. 

In the heighten state, Sanoke has a bit of trouble evading the sudden blow, particularly as Momura's melons bounce up and down. At the last second, the male pivots, but his struck on the ribs partially -- but just that is e4nough to signal the end of the battle. His body goes skidding across the reptilian, and before long, Sanoke is on a downward path to the sandy floor.

". . The. . No. . --Gah! Why? Good thing this is in private. . " he muttered to himself in shame, his ribs aching.* - Sun Dec  6 10:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) 's body twitches upon landing onto the ground.

Ganatora looks on with a shaking head. . 

"Please don't tell me you really fell for the attack because she lost her shirt? Sanoke! Your mind isn't as strong as I thought. . "

Given enough time, the Kage is able to rise to a single knee-- his face still flushed in red, and keeping it's direction towards the ground. "Nooo. I-It's good. Um. .  Just put some clothes back on, please!"* - Sun Dec  6 10:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

The turtle was numb to it all. He was a 'Boss' and had very little care for the lavacious values of the human world. "I'm going to get goin' . . . You weren't so bad yourself, lass."

Once Momura had decided, he disperses randomly, returning back to the massive island in the middle of nowhere. Sanoke still looked downward while breathing, hoping to calm his nerves -- and they were certainly reverting back to normal.* - Sun Dec  6 10:31:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I want to do several missions. - Sun Dec  6 11:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Same here! - Sun Dec  6 11:07:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I can give a simple mission to help strengthen the lower ranked shinobi. Head to the academy's ground and give a less on taijutsu and kenjutsu. Essentially, I want you and Chikyu to give a mock battle. A-K-A, spar. - Sun Dec  6 11:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Simple, yes? - Sun Dec  6 11:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sounds simple enough. - Sun Dec  6 11:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Once that's done, I have another task to be completed. - Sun Dec  6 11:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: This one being a little more serious. - Sun Dec  6 11:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'm going to gather up the paper work for the next mission.  - Sun Dec  6 11:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) forms a clone.

"But I also wanna see your teaching skills." The doppleganger steps off, read to follow the women to the academy's grounds.* - Sun Dec  6 11:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Come to the mansion once you've done the lesson. - Sun Dec  6 11:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
For a moment, attention is primarily on the Hokuma, who seemed to be briefly day dreaming -- her gaze or facial expression suggesting high quantity of lust.

The Kazekage clone slipped into the room, his appearance being that of a commoner as to avoid drawintg the attention of the crowd. Once in place, Sanoke casually leans against the wall, his eyes following both Chikyu and Mirai as the two moved right into positioning.  

"Good. They're both being friendly and nice. I hope they can dazzle the next crop of shinobi. We have powerful elementalists, would be nice to have some new kenjutsu-ists and maybe some close-ranged specialist that don't rely on chakra gates," he muttered to himself. That aside, Sanoke was essentially a student, and learning from the duo that were now the center of attention.


* - Sun Dec  6 11:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looked on with clear approval. The tag team of Mirai and Chikyu was proving to be an advantagous one, was the two seemed to expertly guide the class in the beginnings of hand to hand combat. "These two work well off of one another. I think I should keep having them paired together in missions. . .THey've yet to fail me. . " Sanoke thought to himself, a smile worn through the lengthy explanation. 

The excitement provided by the rag-tag group of rookie genins was astonishing, and it showed that they truely were engaged in the task at hand, much to the leader's delight. Other than that, he was as quiet as a mouth, both eyes and ears attentive to the details or information his companions could provide. Who knows, maybe even -he- could learn a thing or two from the young women.

Meanwhile, at the mansion, the real Sanoke is still gatheringt an assortment of papers and pulling the information together. . .An investigation was other way, but even then. . the evidence needed to be in place so that a real hypothesis could have been developed. Only then could he send a team to look for clues and perhaps uncover just why things were going awry in Northern Sunagakure -- a notoriously rich location, where the wealthy lived lavishly and tourists primarily explored.

"This is a bother. ."* - Sun Dec  6 12:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) was still captivated by the duo's presentation.

They had a certain charm or charisma to the instructions. . A quality that made it imperative that anyone in the room provide the duo with the utmost attention. By then, the cloned and henged Sanoke was resting his elbow on the table, giving leverage for his hand to keep his head up.

Like a zombie, the male looked forward, nodding and jotting down mental notes for the presentation. ". . Man. I'd consider making those two in charge of the academy's procedure. . Maybe education in general-- Nah, I'm jumping the gun. . " Still, he was very impressed thus far. Then came the prizes. Amusingly, Mirai does her best impression of the Oprah Winfrey, granting each of the hopeful shinobi with training equipment and weapons to aid in their craft.

"Cool move. And finally. . we get to the battling!"* - Sun Dec  6 12:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) rubs his hands like birdman.

"Finally. . . the main event! Let's see how they do it? Hopefully they're not crazy enough to fight one another seriously," he comments to himself a bit too loudly. It prompts some of the children to look at him strangely.* - Sun Dec  6 12:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
Sitting within the fcrowd, Sanoke looks inbetween the two powerful close-ranged kunoichi demonstrated what they had to offer. He raises a brow, wondering why Mirai didn't opt to demonstrate her potent, and highly efficient Gentle Fist stancing. 

Instead, the bodacious woman had leapt through the skies, sending a thunderous kick in direction to Chikyu. It wasn't the most efficient or even deadly, but it got the point across. No matter how simple the jutsu was, it still required great conditioning and flexibility to pull off -- two aspects that were highly sought after for taijutsu-based shinobi.

Likewise, it seems Chikyu was getting into the mix as well, just as Sanoke had bargined. "Dodged. . Just like I expected! Alright, now show 'em a little swordplay!" he mentally coached as the Tanto is grasped and routinely slashed through the air to display the advantages, which wer more than just being able to cut right through an opponent. The range was a nifty boost.

And just at the mansion, Sanoke completes the task. "Alright. . should be ready later."* - Sun Dec  6 13:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) (*Chikyu Kasanari began to smile, as she finally had a lay back fight with someone. Neither of themselves pushing too hard, it was just to demonstrate their current abilities. The clashing of iron was heard, as the large blade and the smaller kunai clashed several times. The kick was a nice change of pace hitting Chikyu in the stomach, which she mentally noted would be far worse if Mirai wasn't taking this all too seriously. She smile back and return with her own assaulty, quickly returning to clashing with Mirai's kunai.

However, she would stop during one of her strikes. She turn around planting the tanto on the ground. She then throw one swift kick at Mirai, almost like it was a serious hit. Only to pull it back, she then shoot another leg returning the strike to her stomach to one towards Mirai. Of course, she was holding back as well. Just, her merely returning the favor.*)* - Sun Dec  6 13:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) had been a busy bee.

He casually moves through the sheets of papers which formed stacks. His desk was absolutely flooded, with assistants moving in and out, each person relaying information to feed Sanoke additional information regarding a concerning case..

"Oi. -- Glad you guys finished up with your lesson at the academy this quickly. I got an assignment that needs to be covered. . This one being an internal affair. Given that this is a domestic issue, I have the force on the task, but these are hardly my best men. Mirai, given that you're the second in command, you'll be heading the mission. Take Chikyu with you, the briefing is as followed--"

Then came Lera, coincidentally stepping through the door. Sanoke nodded, figuring this to be divine intervention.

"Lera is joining as back up. I expect the three of you to work as a team, and for you all to respect the leader's decisions. . That said. . .I'll go over the dilemma," the Kazekage continued after some stammering. His eyes fall onto the sheets again, clearly conveying some concern. It wasn't often that Sanoke grew un-nerved or nervous. A hand wavered, dismissing his assistants for the time being.

"In the course of a week, we've gotten a total of fourty-eight missing person reports. All seem to target a specific area, Northern Sunagakure, an area notorious for the rich or wealthy. The latest victims is of the Hotomi clan, a family that produces many great chefs. I want you to three to go down to the neighbor and give a glance around. . See if you find any clues, and interview the family to get their story."

Detailed information is provide further within the scroll. It was mostly need-to-know info, being the specific address, the family's name and member listing, and of course the names of all the individuals that had gone missing thus far.* - Sun Dec  6 14:15:02 2015

"Beats me. It's be a re-occuring issue. So I need you all to go take a look."* - Sun Dec  6 14:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright. - Sun Dec  6 14:18:27 2015

Assuming the trio went to the right neighborhood, they;d be greeting by magnificient, silver gates. Each exit/entrance is heavily guarded with Kunai turrets, and several guardsmen patrolling the area.

Indeed, this was a gated community, making the crime rate even more startling and fear-inspiring. 

"Hault!" the lead guard shouted, a hand drawing at a Katana for good measure. Clearly, he was at edge, for good reason given how dangerous the streets had become as of late. No doubt, the trio would have to certify their authority to obtain entrance.

Meanwhile, if you looked beyond the gates, the community was well-kempt. Literring was apparently non-existent in this ecosystem. Even in this hellish desert, some areas possessed fine grass, and even public fountains to add to the aesthetic beauty. The sun practically shined brighter here, painting an illusion of joy. . . A sick illusion, given the dark history the sector of Sunagakure possessed.* - Sun Dec  6 14:47:28 2015

The Kazekage was no idiot. He had sent word beforehand, alerting the guards of his arriving shinobi. After taking time to validate Mirai's claim, the lead guardmen motions for the warriors ontop of the gate to pull the lever. 

With the item stroked, the silver bars would lift up, allowing for a swift and casual entrance should the kunoichi decide to take it. "My apologies, ladies. . .Times have been rough. We have to be on alert, even if you all seem harmless enough. . " As the trio undoubtably moved in, they'd be at a metaphorical cross words.

Naturally, the most pressing priority would be to beeline to the Hitomi household for questioning. But other than that. . . Would they go to examine the locals? Would anyone go scouting for potential clues? There were many options to take, and so little time.* - Sun Dec  6 15:10:30 2015

The clones spawned by Lera quickly scowl the fine land, going from door to door. In the beginning, none of the dopplegangers were getting any luck. Persistance is key, however. And without enough perserverence, some of the Leras were actually meeting friends or family of the previous victims.

"No. . .He was an old man coming here to enjoy his r-retirement. . Sunagakure was supposed to be the safest village in the world," a teary-eyed widow proclaims, her voice cracking from start to finish. She'd collapse into a puddle of sobbing, un able to continue go on with the questioning.

Most of the answers correlated with the above example. . But not -all- of the victims seemed to be unrelated. Indeed, with enough asking around, Lera would find that some of the deceased were in fact collegues -- many of which had traveled to Sunagakure together in the re-emergence of the Sand Village's relevance. Albeit, save for those connections, not much else is offered.

Names are given for Lera to write down if she so chooses, but that's all she's getting. Perhaps this is good information for later dates?* - Sun Dec  6 15:30:59 2015

The Hitomi clan was coincidentally one of the more prominent family within the entire district. This fact is made obvious given by how nice and large the housing proved to be, fitted with a giant garden out front just beyond the lawn. -- A casual garden in Sunagakure, mind you. Nevermind the backyard..

Knock. Knock. Knock.

It takes no more than three tries until the door is quickly addressed. A tan skinned, fourty-something year old man approached. His furry bear was graying, showcasing the wear and tear of time as it worked against his weakening body. ". . Ah-- No need for introductions. You all are the Sunagakure shinobi sent to investigate. . .Yes? Come. . Come, I will summon you an audience."

The trio were naturally allowed into the estate. The exterior wasn't simply for show. Upon stepping in, they could see just how well-off the Hitomo clan proved to be -- considering the marble floor and furniture, and chandelleires that were positioned on the high roofs. In no time, the immediate family is huddled up in the living room.

A mother, three children, and of course grieving aunts/uncles. The first two children were in the middle of their teens respectively. One a freckle-faced blonde, Rika, and the other a blue-haired deliquient, Taku. The last was a young child, being more than the age of six. Lily, she held brunnette and clearly was the one most significant effected by the situation.

While everyone looked solemn, Lily was -devestated-. Her gaze remained to the grund, and the youth's facial featrues were essentially stuck in a state of permanent sorrow. Each inch of skin was scrunched up, and salty liquid drenched her flesh from start to finish. "D-daddy. . ." She says with a sniff, snot running down her nose.* - Sun Dec  6 15:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: So it was the father... - Sun Dec  6 15:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
The youngest of the Hitomi clan shook her head. . .

She was still distaught. For the days preceding this, Lily had taken a vow of general silence as the situation had left her too traumatize to actually engage in actual social acts. 

After repeated head shakes, the kid manages to squeak out a single sentence. "H-He. . Took daddy. .  The dark man. ." The rest of the members seemed significantly surprised, moreso that Lily actually managed to speak up. Some swallowed their spit, gulping out of simple nervousness, others gave confused looks to one another.

Eventually, the mother speaks up, taking the initiative. "Indeed. . We had an intruder the other day. Apparently. . . The scoundrel made off with my husband. I don't know why we were targeted. . Perhaps out of money?"

At this, Lily begins to shiver, once more preparing to have a nervous breakdown as she had done before. ". .Lily dear. .?"* - Sun Dec  6 16:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Lily..hm - Sun Dec  6 16:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
The woman (mom)'s eyes narrow. It could mean anything, from being suspicious, nervous or downright offended.

"He was the head chef-- What are you getting at? I had nothing to do with his kidnapping if -thats- what you mean," she'd say, immediately becoming defensive. Her features tightened, showcasing rage or anger.

For now, the others simply sat around, looking as the questioning began. They weren't going to speak much unless addressed. "Mom. . You can relax," the two teen children said in unison as they knew how hot-headed their mother could get. In the meantime, Lily simply kept her gaze down, although Lera's kind words does work to calm her spirit just a tad..

"No. . . Yo--" She stops short, figuring it best not to denounce any attempts at uncovering the truth.* - Sun Dec  6 16:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Oddly suspicious... - Sun Dec  6 16:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
"I was in my room, sleeping like a normal person should. I had finished working at our restaurant a while before, so I was tired as hell. I heard a disturbance, however in the kitchen. That's where I think the nabbing happened."

Considering the question had been delivered to everyone in the room, the rest of the family chips in.

"We were at our home, in bed resting as well," the aunts/uncles stated, seemingly truthful in their questioning.

"I was in the bathroom doing my hair, and putting together my clothes for the morning. . " the teenaged daughter replies, giving her allibi. Her mouth opened for a second, as if prepared to give another statement -- but stops and glances away.

"Hrm? I was chillin' in the entertainment room, listening to some music. That's about it. . " finally uttered the teen.

Lily says nothing and just stares pensively to the ground, her lips quivering. Clearly, she knew something -- but opted to remain quiet.* - Sun Dec  6 16:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: ... - Sun Dec  6 16:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: What time did you hear the noise? - Sun Dec  6 16:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
The mother nodded along.

"Of course you can. . -- I'd say around eleven? Twelve even?" There's still a snide, offended tone in her voice.

The family murmurs among one another, before Lily finally breaks. Indeed, quite a bit of attention had been casted her way, forcing the young girl to feebly give a response. Try as she might, it was hard to contain the emotion. . 

"He came. . .to save me. . . "

That's all the girl could utter for now, before falling to her knees and fighting the urge to break out into hysterical tears! It was hard to keep composure when you were under belief that your father's kidnapping was essentially your own fault.

The stunned look on the face of other family members suggest that this is new information.* - Sun Dec  6 16:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) whispers: Is it the fact the mother heard the noise, while the kid was playing music?) - Sun Dec  6 16:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
Rapidly, she shook her head.

"Dad. . come save me from the dark thing. . ." Lily replies in a low, whimpering voice. More tears roll down her face. 

"My fault. . I was in kitchen. . steal cookies. ." the youth continued, sniffling and wiping away the excessive snot that trailed from her nose.* - Sun Dec  6 16:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Thank god she understood that... - Sun Dec  6 17:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
Finally, the teen speaks up. . She rubs the back of her neck sheepishly. 

"I. . . Um. . Don't look at me crazy. Just that -- I don't know if it was related. . But before all of this happen. Over the last day or two, I could -swear- we were being watched. I don't know if it was hallucinations. . Or annything, but I'd get strange chills like. . I don't know," she didn't speak very articulately, as expected of a pampered teenager that never would need an education in her life.

From there, everyone in the household continued to chatter among themselves, discussing the strangeness that began to occur around the city as of late.

At this point, there likely wasn't going to be any more significant information to obtain, at least not if they kept asking the same style of questions. The only' question' that remained now. . .

What would Team Sunagakure do in response to this all?* - Sun Dec  6 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: If thats true...then their might be people still watching the household. If they got the wrong mark, they might come back for the child. - Sun Dec  6 17:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
They all unanimously shook their head.'

"Not that we know of.."* - Sun Dec  6 17:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: Use your eyes... - Sun Dec  6 17:11:40 2015

The all-seeing Byakugan!

Definitive information wasn't quite going to be detected. However, as she activated her telescopic vision and gave the entire area a scan. . There may have been something amiss.

For the -briestest- of moments, the Hokuma would have seen a transparent, humanoid shape. It was practically looking right into her eyes -- before just vanishing. Naturally, this could easilly be deemed a hallucination or just paranoia. Once that happened, no other traces of any potential foreign force was available.

How would the group react?* - Sun Dec  6 17:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Oh my god! - Sun Dec  6 17:17:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

And so the hours go on. . 

Odd, that the family returned at such late hours. . . Something was fishy. 

Regardless, the group would be staking out there for hours. And four the next three? Nothing happened. Certainly, their minds would begin growing numb out of the boredom..

Until that same figure from before re-appeared. His body was swift, and floated around like a ghastly spirit. In no time, utilizing a strange ninjutsu, the creature's frame literally phases through the walls, allowing his transparent body to enter the infrastructure unalarmed, and undettered.

Of course, the only person with a prayer of actively sensing or detect was the Hokuma given her special eyes. 

From the figure's body? More and more copies split off, and thus the dopplegangers rushed ahead, eagerly checking the home. His steps were muffled, and hard to detect. . .and slowly, it's creeping along. . . stepping just behind the false 'Lily' -- the one that was clearly Lera shifted via Henge.

". . . "
". . ."

Abruptly, taking advantage of the presumed ignorance, the 'apparition' swiped, aiming to strike the Kage Bunshin right on the neck for a quick disperse. His nostril flared, taking a good whiff of the energy that bursted into the area. "Bait. . I should have known, this person didn't possess the same signature. . . The others are surely faked as well. These shinobi will learn. . . They shouldn't bait predators that they no ability to control. . "* - Sun Dec  6 17:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Shit.. - Sun Dec  6 17:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Stay alert... - Sun Dec  6 17:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

And of course. . .The secondary house had been tracked as well.

The enemy held ties in the village, eyes and ears were all about. . The attack on the original was simply a precaution to ensure that the objective was completely entirely. . There was to be no margin for error.

In the same eery fashion, Lera's home was infiltrated, with the ghastly figures again breaching the walls, literally phasing through. On this? A chilling sensation filled the air, enough that the heat from one's natural breath could likely spawn vapor. 

-- And seconds later, screams could be heard. . Most notably from the teenaged siblings.

"THE DARK THING!" Lily called out! In a strange twist, a single entity had managed to penetrate the defensive measures. For some odd reason, the youngest had been able to detect his approach, and thus move diligently out of the way.

The other two? Not so lucky. His sharp claws were already around their throat, pinning the two onto the flooring. The entity's energy immediaely fluxuate, enough that a trained sensor could pick up the faintest trail. 

'For what reason?' You may ask. And it was simple. The life was quite literally being drained from the two teens, their physical energy rapidly being sapped from their bodies. Both of the teens' body fidgets, as if in a seizure while the demonic presence gave a nasty grin to the young girl, and her adult peers. 

"These two are first. . I'd suppose. .  The little girl comes shortly after. Tamoko. . Is such a screw up, he never can complete his job neatly. I wonder why he hasn't returned yet. . "* - Sun Dec  6 17:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

With each second passing, the teens were slowly having the energy sucked out of their body-- and minor cuts being impaled through the cells. Their skin reacted poorly, becoming slightly discolored due to the lack of physical energy ---

Until Lera's Bunshins sprung into action.

But they were just that, Bunshins. The Rotating Shurikens remain a credible threat, enough that one manages to strike the figure as he's partially caught off guard. But like a phantom, the ghastly presence would flicker, near invisible smog/smoke being secrated with every significant step. Rather than flee the scene, the criminal swooshes to the center of the room.

His hands press together briefly, allowing for the kneading of chakra like any good shinobi. "Otherwordly Art: . . .Spiritual Oppression!" 

From this, a massive wave of energy spreads out from all directions. It was reminiscient to the Hyuuga clan'sOne Body Blow. . .yet far more wide-spread, and concussive while also obtaining draining ability. Everyone in the room is thrown back, and presumably any clone is dispersed. 

Conveniently, Lily is tossed towards the wall near the exit, right next to Lera.* - Sun Dec  6 18:09:42 2015

Boom!

The Air Palm comes out of nowhere, disrupting one of the unique clones that had been spawned. In no time, its body was being dematerialized. Unlike with a traditional clone, no combustion occurs, quite literally particles of energys seem to cascade from it's form, and seems to be swallowedu p by space.

. . Swoosh.

The wind currents shift, denoting the arrival of more -- four clones in total. 

". . Women are to be seen, not heard. . Did you not know this? Terrorizing children is not my hobby-- simply a task. And for interfering, you will be eliminated. . . Unlike my collegue, I very rarely live loose ends. Prepare yourselves. .  " Finally, the effective 'ghost' spoke. His voice was deep, booming and articulate. Despite sounding like the very incarnation of satan, you could tell this was a very learned man.

A fleeting glance falls over to Chikyu, prompting a snide grin.

In total, all of the clones would hold their right hand out, allowing for the build up of chakra. It was akin to the average medical healing. . But naturally worked in reverse. Speedily, the foursome moved ahead, all intent on thrusting a single palm towards Mirai in order to decay flesh, painfully I might add.* - Sun Dec  6 18:22:30 2015

Lera to the rescue! She was fairly powerful, but not even she could fail this crook in one blow.

His body contorted, doing all sorts of odd manuevers to evade being completely penetrated. Sadly, the specimen is far from perfect, and thus is partially damaged by the high leveled assault. A bullet strikes along his right shoulder, forcing blood to plaster onto the pavement.

A fleeting glance falls onto Lily -- each feature from the invisible man's face being clearly available to her. "Tata. . " 

Realizing the futility in continuing the mission in this state, the specimen speeds forward. In his haste, the elder brother is grasped, chakra enveloping the male's body. Assuming this state, both would lose some tangibility in a way, given that they could not phase through physical objects with ease. Had Lera not been capable of stopping the kidnapping attempt, both of the males would no longer be in the room.

Was a chase in the works?

Regardless, even with one working arm, the Ghastly Figure can still competently use an array of jutsus, all in quick succession. Just to be a sneak (and in hope that his evasion/retreat was distraction enough) a lesser 'Shadow' clone was spawned and set underneath the flooring. 

Samehade certainly could detect the specimen as well. In that scenerio, Lera would casually be alerted to the bunshin's attempt at snatching at Lily's legs for one last hope of stealing the child away.* - Sun Dec  6 18:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
The clones were outnumbered, and quite literally outgunned.

In the ensuing chaos, Chikyu's might in conjunction with Mirai's own abundance of Kage Bunshin can quell the bulk of the threat. Even as the foursome of clones flailed their hands to decay flesh, most of the strikes were evaded--- thanks in part to the Kunoichis' impeccable ability.

And yet, in the end only one remained, evading and existing solely off of pure luck. As each of the previous clones dispersed, the one remaining gained additional vigor and overall strength.

The invisible was slowly wearing off, revealing a figure cladded in back, with a mask based on demonic culture. There was a horn designed on top, and massive fanged teeths protruded from the front. "Bah. . I shouldn't be surprised. . Sloppy work forces the attention of the government. However. .  I will leave you with this to serve as a reminder and a warning. . " His voice showcases fatigue.

Both of his demon claws press together, building up a wealth of chakra for a single, wide-speaded attack. Purple, metaphysically based snakes rush from the creature's maw, enough to cover a large chunk of the kitchen area. The goal was simple, to engulf both of the young shinobi. If struck? They'd feel the unsettling sensation of their body's energy literally being assimilated. 

However, the man in question suffered from low energy reservoirs and wanted to issue a warning. If struck, they'd find themselves not quite being on the brink of death, but completely exhaust. Mild burns also were going to be left along their flesh.

As the technique flies and completes itself, the clone begins to fizzle out of this plane of existence. "Don't allow me to see your faces in a future encounter. . It won't be pretty."* - Sun Dec  6 18:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

On Lera's end-- the attack is a mild success. Lily's small frame was being pulled into the ground, only for the travel to be ended prematurely by the samehade blow.

On a side note, the teen boy was gone! Likely to be killed.

The family just looked on solemnly, as they had lost yet another member of the family to the same crooked warrior. . Or what they perceived as the same warrior.* - Sun Dec  6 18:49:48 2015

The sword slash only partially aids in Chikyu's defense.

The snake would would split apart, some of it's mass being reduced and dissipating. Sadly, the sheer quantity was a bit to abundant to just slash away, as it was coming from multiple directions.

Regardless, the attack does it's thing and the clone presumably disperses.

----
On Lera's end, the family just continues to stare on solemn, most fighting back the urge to not immediately panic at another member being stolen from them. "When does it end. . ?"

In the end, there was no attacks scheduled for the rest of the night. The group could simply rest, scout the area for clues, or regroup.* - Sun Dec  6 19:00:54 2015

By some stroke of luck. . a traveler uncovers the husband's body -- the person named 'Himura.'

No one moves it, instead the actual police force is called to examine. This occurs about an hour or two after the big fight, giving the trio ample time to regrup.

In essence, once they had arrived on the scene, they'd note Himura's body leaning againt a tree. A trail of blood was layered coming from the east, suggesting he had dragged or crawled. 

In addition, a half written note was seen on his person.

"Lily. . . Rika. . Taku. . Rose-- Get out. . They'll come for. The--" then the note mysterious is cut off. OoooooOOOooooo. Shame, the old man couldn't write faster. Clearly, he knows -- or knew -- what's up.* - Sun Dec  6 19:15:24 2015
