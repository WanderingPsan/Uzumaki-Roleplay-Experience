<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: nothing... - Sun Oct 18 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) yawns. He's a bit disorientated.

"Anywho. . .Going to get some shut eye. How long you plan to be up?" He asks, clearly nodding off on occasions.* - Sun Oct 18 07:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Hopefully this blows over by the time we wake up. - Sun Oct 18 07:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: i'll be asleep afterwards... - Sun Oct 18 07:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) lifts up and sets in bed.

"You can do whatever you need to do here, I guess."

He's closing his eyes, and falling into slumber. Risky? Probably. But he didn't really believe Mirai to be able to act on her threats.* - Sun Oct 18 07:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Last thing -- You should change hair styles. - Sun Oct 18 07:26:43 2015

He goes home to sleep now.* - Sun Oct 18 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Well no..I shouldn't say that. - Sun Oct 18 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I am looking for the same thing. What have you learned from traveling? - Sun Oct 18 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I've learned that not everyone has the same mindset.  - Sun Oct 18 07:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's going to be a difficult thing to achieve, but I believe it's possible. - Sun Oct 18 07:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: ...Should I stop letting people know I'm a murderer who enjoys spilling guts? - Sun Oct 18 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: There are alot of evil people....The world is based around fighting and killing. I mean, as much as I want peace, I've killed and even vowed to kill certain men. Is it evil to kill?---In your opinion? - Sun Oct 18 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: omit - Sun Oct 18 07:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't believe in murder. All lives are valuable. I understand that people feel the need that they must kill, but my journey is to change the way people think. Too many people view themselves as tools, which is a reason why we fight for our lives. - Sun Oct 18 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Is murdering and killing the same thing? - Sun Oct 18 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So to answer your question, I don't believe it to be 'evil' as evil is a relative word. There's no good or evil, just those with an open mind and those who refuse to think in a new way. - Sun Oct 18 07:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Taking the life of an individual is all the same. I've yet to take a life, and I hope that I don't have to. I've been told that such a day will happen, but I really wish one won't arise. - Sun Oct 18 07:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I can't agree with you there. We both are looking for peace in the world though...I don't see it happening without certain people dying. - Sun Oct 18 07:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I am willing to die in order to achieve peace..But I'm not here to die  without a fight. You will find a man one day that cannot be changed, and is destined to be killed or continue killing. - Sun Oct 18 07:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You will realize at that point, this world can't be so innocent....It will never be so innocent. - Sun Oct 18 07:39:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Everything that I've been taught as been towards promoting the message of peace.  - Sun Oct 18 07:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, we take two paths towards the same goal. Maybe we will achieve it together, through different means. There are many ways to take down a beast. - Sun Oct 18 07:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Perhaps.. - Sun Oct 18 07:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: What is your image of peace? What defines it for you? - Sun Oct 18 07:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: When good men do not die needlessly... - Sun Oct 18 07:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I guess mine is from personal experiences. But my brother was murdered in cold blood and so was my closest friend. - Sun Oct 18 07:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And those men who killed him are the men I have vowed to kill. They are everyting that is wrong with the ninja world. We have a few like that in the village and I wish to change them for the better...From my experience, it's more probable that I'll have to kill them. - Sun Oct 18 07:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see. So your 'peace' is one where your loved ones don't die through the actions of other men? - Sun Oct 18 07:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I guess if you want to put it that way. I don't like to see people suffer and I do not like antagonism. When I see it, I want to kill it. If you let it grow, it becomes harder to kill...Kind of sick but it's true. - Sun Oct 18 07:46:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Ah, a path of revenge..Revenge is akin to a flame. It burns anything and everything around you. However, lif used and directed properly, the flame can have pupose. - Sun Oct 18 07:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And I do have purpose. - Sun Oct 18 07:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'm sure you do, but it's the flame of revenge that should be directed to a positive outlook.  - Sun Oct 18 07:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: This is the only outlook I see. It's what I've lived. - Sun Oct 18 07:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You'll see others eventually.  My only advice to you about revenge is, don't let it swallow you up. - Sun Oct 18 07:53:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see. I suppose if I was brought up with a different point of view, I may have been the same.  To me, my ideal sense of peace is unity.  A world where everyone has reached a geniuine understanding of one and another, and are able to solve things through words and words a lone.  If I can even get an individual to see the world through such lens, it would make me happy. - Sun Oct 18 07:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I would be happy. - Sun Oct 18 07:59:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He listened in carefully, eager to advice his skillset and thus add yet another nifty genjutsu to his growing skill.

Listening carefully, he allows the genjutsu to be placed onto his frame, immediately warping the region to the caster's ideals. Like paint being melted, the world was slowly beginning to be shifted, the ground in particular. Dazzled, Sanoke just looked on, wearing a giant grin on his face.

In no time, he glances downward, eying the sand itself, as it seemed to have garnered a change in consistency. Indeed, no longer was the sand sturdy, and well equipped to walk on. Instead, it had now become somewhat liquidy, and thus prompted Sanoke to feel as if he was sinking. As the process ran it's course, there were shivers literally running along the former chunnin's mind. Was this the true extent on a genjutsu's ability?

It was unlike anything the teen had ever seen -- even as he knew that an illusion was in place. .. It felt. . . It felt some real. "Amazing. . . Terrifying even! To have a genjutsu that can effect so many senses at once. . . And to only be C-ranked. . . Remarkable," the turtle summoner says, praising Shin for his clear skill in the art of illusions. By now, the male was perhaps the greatest practitioner of the art that Sanoke had ever the fortune of laying eyes on.

In a perfect world, the teacher would have gone through intense detail, describing and explaining the jutsu's inner workings from start to finish -- and certainly, Shin did.

Even if not, Sanoke's deduction abilities were on point, able to dissect and analyze even the most obscure of details. Sadly, he wasn't quite confident in his own ability to break via cognitive force. Thus, the clone's that nearby promptly slashes at his leg, producing a superficial wound meant to shock him out. Light blood trickles, but that doesn't seem to hinder Sanoke too greatly. Mentally exhausted, the chunnin moved, mimicking each of the handseals performed, and hopefully goes to replicate the genjutsu itself.

"Alright. . To do this, I have to effect the sense of sight, and feeling. Perhaps even sound. .  Let me try . . " With the seal in place, the summoner's chakra is able to easily pierce through the skies, and invade Shin's mind. It strikes the chakra circulatory system, and hopefully carries Sanoke's will in a smooth, effective manner.

Unfortunately, while a genius to some, Sanoke was -far- from a prodigy. The genjutsu, while in play, was far from complete. The ground quaked, forcing the victim to feel as if the world was undergoing a slight tremor. Then alas. . . sandy broke down into a liquidy consistentcy, and thus could be dubbed 'quicksand.' Although, the overall appearance was cartoonish, and not believeable. In addition to this, Shin would find himself remaining in place, due to the inexperience.* - Sun Oct 18 16:59:18 2015

A scroll is suddenly sprouted, with Sanoke eventually moving to scribble down some information. It was the basic or general info that you would expect.\

First and foremost, the ranking and naming of the jutsu is provided. Once that had been completed, the chunnin begins to write the beginning of the information for the scroll, conveying the detailed process that came with performing the mid-level ninjutsu.

Overall, it goes over the basic principle of earth release, while applying these principles to the jutsu itself. The scroll depicts how much chakra is to be poured out -- Along with how the energy is to be manipulated. Typically, it just shows that the ground must be broken down via Doton-natured energy  to be soft enough. Along with this, your doton release is to aid in your hands digging through the ground.

The amount is proportion with how large your body is, so that the hole can be large enough to dig through. Finally, it gives tidbits of using the earth to sense along the ground to uncover potential obstacles above the surface, or even underneath you. * - Sun Oct 18 18:10:08 2015

"-- Wooah! Your arm got even more fat.  - -I get it now, your jutsu is to make yourself more fat and big. Why do you always have it on, then? You don't need to be fat all the time," Sanoke speaks honestly, fully under the belief that Daiki was only fat. . Due to a constantly active jutsu.

Nevertheless, once the akimichi is making is getting dangerously close, the teen goes Rock Lee mode. His body breaks into a blur, and aims to move along in a semi-circle, effectively moving to the otherside of the landscape. Of course, his eyes remained mindful for any swings, just incase he needed to evade.* - Sun Oct 18 18:47:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) scratches his nose as the spikes suddenly speed from the ground.

"Huh? Apologize for what? He is pretty fat man," the chunnin stated bluntly -- his voice whimisical, and lacking any animosity. For all intents and purposes, it would have appeared as if Sanoke was seriously just commenting -- which he was.

Nonchalantly, a wave is given to Saeza, although visage of the akimichi is never removed. "S'up, Saeza."* - Sun Oct 18 18:56:12 2015

The first comes flying in through the skies -- at an exceptionally fast pace. 

Sadly, he remained too perceptive, and nimble at that. On cue, seconds for the strike can even come close, Sanoke's frame becomes nothing more than a whisk. Blurring a few feets ahead, the male eventually is standing ontop of Daiki's enlarged fist with a giant, childish smile.

"Too slooww. Man. . . You're so violent, though. I just called you fat. . Not like I called you ugly or something."* - Sun Oct 18 19:07:18 2015

"Man. You're so angsty. Look, if it makes you stop being so angry. . .I guess you're not fat? You're real slender. Like one of those lingerie models. . ?" the snow-haired speedster stated, his voice devoid of any sarcasm.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I wanted to get a meeting with Edge myself. - Sun Oct 18 19:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: However, he wanted me to bring you to him. To which I didn't do. - Sun Oct 18 19:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: His assistant however, she is very well equipped in Genjutsu. - Sun Oct 18 19:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: She uses her breasts as a trigger for one of the genjutsu. I saw through it with my sharingan, but I of course...Was careless. - Sun Oct 18 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Tits. . A man's greatest weakness./ - Sun Oct 18 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'm pretty resistant to genjutsu, though. - Sun Oct 18 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS! - Sun Oct 18 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Good...Good. - Sun Oct 18 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: However.. - Sun Oct 18 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I must show you something.....Greater...My eyes have seen a lot Sanoke. - Sun Oct 18 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm? - Sun Oct 18 19:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Speak of the devil

Immediately, a wind storm picks up, running along the area, and kick starting a large gust of wind. It's a powerful current, enough to flutter loose clothings, and honestly force Sanoke to provide conscious effort in order to remain in a stationary positioning.

Defensively, he takes steps back, wondering if it had been Hideki that spawned the changes.

An omnious chill runs along his spine. "Huh. . . I got a bad feeling about this. I'm going to go give a look around the village for a bit. Mainly because. . . this shit is too convenient. Hit me -- Wwait. What have your eyes seen before I go?"* - Sun Oct 18 19:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Being placed into genjutsu wasn't exactly on Sanoke's agenda.

"Hrm. . . Alright. A bit cautious, you know. Even if you coulda already tried to get me in a genjutsu, going to be safe. So I'll drop a clone real fast -- Or I can use a summoning," he replies, pressing his finger togethers. Assuming Hideki complies or agrees, a single doppleganger is manifested and makes his approach towards the Uchiha, arms folded.

"Alright. Let's do this."* - Sun Oct 18 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Right. - Sun Oct 18 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Eye contact is established

The direct eye contact allows the chakra fuming within Hideki's empowered eyes to flow elegantly, entering Sanoke Clone's own system of chakra. As a clone, it remained a bit more resistant to genjutsu than usual -- yet the illusion still plays through, without any interference or error. Mesmorized, the doppleganger is practically transfered into an entirely new world or dimension, one set in the past of the current continent. 

No longer were the floors sandy and filled with dried grain. Instead, he now was settled in an environment covered or overwhelmed with lush grasses, and lightly colored asphalts.

To his right, a snake-like woman existed, her form curved. . . But oddly scaled all the same. Her mouth remained open agaped, and crudely, snakes seemed to be slither from the depths of her mouth. It gave the surreal apperaance that her body was actually a bottomless pit, able to store thousands of reptilians for use in battle. "Is this. . Some sort of. . . summoning-based technique? Maybe that's what gramps was talkin'---" Then Erebus is noted.

Thesimple sight of the Jashinist makes Sanoke's skin crawl. There weren't many people in the world that the former chunnin hated  -- Yet Erebus had made that very exclusive list. The man was a sadist, and took pleasure on making those around him feel insignifcant. The sight forces Sano's face to scrunch up, and his teeth to clench.

Oh how badly he wanted to scream and shot. . To attack even. Yet it would have all been for nothing. This was nothing more than an illusion after all.

Thankfully, before things went from bad to worse, the situation is flipped. In time, the lad -- still in a ghastly form -- is following along Lyala and Hideki ,as they rush. The main point of scene that catches his eyes, however, seems to be the massive Sand Raccoon that exists towards the south. From the massive size, to the flawless manipulation of sand. "He's like Tetsumi. . But on a mass--"

---

"Yo. Why are you showing me this? The Sand Raccoon is dangerous, but we don't know where it is, though."* - Sun Oct 18 20:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) remained captivated by the changes in sceneries.

While intrigue, he's mindful of remaining quiet, both optics eagerly taking in the wealth of information. To the carcass of Ushinawa . . . To even Seisuke taking the corpse, and making off god knows where. Mouth agape, Sanoke really wants to speak, but opts to keep his trap shut, at least until the scene had been concluded.

". . .What is the meaning of this. . .? He's has quite the life. . But I don't get his purpose. . .Why is he showing me all of these past experiences?"* - Sun Oct 18 20:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: I showed you this... - Sun Oct 18 20:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: To tell you that I have a power that the Gezo is afraid of. - Sun Oct 18 20:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: Your eyes aswell, they may be afraid of those. - Sun Oct 18 20:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods. At last, his clone disperses, sending all of the information forward.

"Ah. . So that's why you approached me. Well I'm willing to help with the take down of Gezo. Just need some good plans. . Plus, I'll need time to activate the powers of these eyes. It's pretty difficult,"Sanoke admits.* - Sun Oct 18 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I'll work on the plans. Good day, Sanoke. Stay safe. - Sun Oct 18 20:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) forms a seal.

Chakra builds up, allowing his frame to accelerate and disappear in a plume of smoke.* - Sun Oct 18 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) suddenly appears.

"What's up, peeps."* - Sun Oct 18 20:48:00 2015
