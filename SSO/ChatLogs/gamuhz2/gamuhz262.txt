<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) kneeled and pressed his hand against the ground.

A machine filled with four different balls is released. He presses a button, forcing each of the circular objects to roll out!

"As a note, the high-point woman, Izanami scores a by for the first round! Moving on, the battles are as followed! MOMURA. . . .Versus. .. HIDEOOO!"

"Following up, Ai will take on Kinamiiiii!!" It was funny how luckily the randomizing of the generator had occured. Momura and Hideo were effectively going to be fighting one more battle than the others, and given that they were at the bottom of the pack, this was a good thing.* - Sat Dec  5 01:27:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) does a spin. His body breaks off into a streak or blur, and as it settles, he's ther right in his ref suit.

"Haha! Alright, I'll do the play by play announcements!"

Abruptly, music begins to play. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG_dA32oH44

'Now I fight so har', motherfuckas wanna fine me! But first ninjas gonna find me! What fifty grand bounty to me, motherfucka' can you please remind me?! Ball so hard, that shit cray--" Then the sound system breaks off to the charismatic voice of Sanoke as the music plays.

A speaker system is conveniently in place. "First up. . We got the baddest woman in the south! The woman with a plan, 'cause all her fist do is SLAM! KI-NAM-MIIIII! " Sanoke roars, taking a deep breath right after. "HASSSAANN! The taijutsu tween!"

His nicknaming could use some working.

"And her opponent! The feminine fighter! The most adorable male you'll ever find! Her skills so potent, it just makes you wanna say. . 'AY!' RYUTOUUUUUU!" He pauses again, taking a deep breath to continue. "AIIIIIII! The paper goddess! THis is fixing to be a good match, folks. Can the underdog, Kinami come up with an upset?!"* - Sat Dec  5 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gasps!

"And folks, the battle has taken a turn for the worse! The Paper Princess has taken to the skies, using her strange paper-based ninjutsu to levitate! This isn't good, as Kinami is close-ranged opponent!"

He barked out along the speakers!

"--And Kinami evades! Several paper-based shurikens are launched ahead, but to no avail! -- And what more, it seems Hassan's spirit lives in. The young kunoichi is taking this without a fight! In comes a trio of shurikens herself!" Sanoke roared, filled with excitement over the endeavor.

He smiled, giving a glance over the terrain. All that could be hoped, would Kinami work intelligently?"* - Sat Dec  5 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Already. . This isn't looking good for either party.. - Sat Dec  5 02:35:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) continued commenting.

The battle was getting his blood flowing! "So far, Ai is running the show! As to be expected for someone that can manipulate techniques with just thoughts!" Sanoke bragged excitedly. His rinnegan-cladded eyes, and sensing abilities still were closely kept on the situation, easily reading the chakra flowage of both participants.

"---OH MY GOOD! CLEVER! THE PAPER SHURIKENS WERE SIMPLY A TRICK! THE TRUE GOAL PROVED TO BE THE DISPERSAL OF ADDITIONAL PAPER SHEETS!" the announcer blurted out, damn near dropping one of his drink onto the speakers.

"AND NOW KINAMI IS ON THE MOVE! I can hardly even keep up with this woman's level of speed! She's a literal blur! Can Ai even perceive these movements?" He laughed heartily right after, clearly having the time of his life -- it was always good to see a typical budokai!* - Sat Dec  5 03:17:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) and apparently, shit was getting crazy. "A meteor. . This isn't good! The chunnin exams are cancelled! Everyone in the village take cover!"

Luckily, the P.A. system was nearby, conveying the red-alert to the entire village. Without a second thought, Sanoke manueverd, preparing to evacuate.

He grabs whoever he can via hairbinding technique, and shunshins off. 

Once in a safe distance, one his reptilian companions to prepare a reverse summoning if the going got tough..* - Sat Dec  5 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

Apparently there was no actual. . .meteor?

Regardless, the battle waged on for a lengthy period of time, prompting Sanoke to step in. "Okay! I've seen enough! Despite her best attempts, it'd seem that Kinami isn't quite capable of being the victor! I'll call the match. . !"

He flicks to the center of the ring, mic in hand. 

"AND THE WINNEEERR! THE PAPER PRINCE! RYOUTTUUUU. . . . AIIIIIII! Let's give both of these shinobis a round of applause! The next match will commence as scheduled. Momura versus Hideo! If Izanami fails to show, then the winner will gain a by and go straight to the final showdhown!"* - Sat Dec  5 04:00:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) begins to count down.

"Thirty seconds. . "

Time ticks on, and before long, Sanoke is reaching the end of the countdown. "Ten. . . Nine. . . Eight. . . Seven. .  Six. . . Five. . Four. .  Three. . . Two. . One! And time is up! Momura wins by default. It's a shame, given how powerful the other contentents were! As a result, it appears that the final match will be none other than Ai versus. . . Momura. Although, Ai continuing to fight by now is no longer necessary. "

He signs, pondering what to do. 

Eventually, it's clear that the exam has run it's course. "In anycase, I'll allow Momura and Kinami to showcase their skill later against one another in a private expedition. For now, the final portion is adjourned." Since fuck waiting for the others.* - Sat Dec  5 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: A-Ai huh.. - Sat Dec  5 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-Alright! - Sat Dec  5 04:17:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
And that put the chunnin exams to an end. . .

Despite being uneventful given how many people failed to show up. Eventually, he calls for a meeting to honor those who had apparently earned enough marks to be deemed chunnin-- and really for now, that's just Ai.

"The exams will end prematurely. For now, only one person has proven their worth for being ranked up!" In no time, Sanoke is at the front.

"As such, I want you all to give an applause!" A hand flicks forward, spawning a chunnin flak Jacket in no time. "Come and take your prize!" By now, a mass of NPCs had arrived to honor the rank-up. Shame the other person promised for chunnin hadn't shown.* - Sat Dec  5 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: I-I see how it is. - Sat Dec  5 04:22:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
The vest is handed over.

Immediately, the NPCs that came to honor Ai clapped, each one releasing a thunderous roar. "And that concludes this year's exams. Even without any examination, it's possible to progress beyond genin."

Of course, with that, Sanoke orders all of the shinobi to exit and do their job. Maybe next year would be more exciting.* - Sat Dec  5 04:41:10 2015

The guy seemed to be a threat.

When in doubt? Attack. Whether or not Sanoke's allies would back him up or not, the shinobi didn't truly care. The second Zhen turned about face, the Kazekage moved to his ace move.

Three seals are woven through effortlessly, and with that comes an exertion of chakra. Already, he's running along the way, to ensure that there was no blockage of space. Immediately, his hair follicles are fed additional energy, manipulating the metabolism of the body's growth, and forcing thick strands of hair to shoot forward. The goal? To wrap around the presumed threat.

Going off of this, as the attack flies away, Sanoke is reaching for a scroll in preperation for his next attack. * - Sat Dec  5 07:08:48 2015

The one-body blow impressively, and certainly could get through the initial beginnings of the Hair Bindage. But alas, there was no one conceive-ably possible that the jutsu wasn't going to account for the sheer mass. As Zhen escaped, he found Sanoke's hair in hot pursuit!

"Neat technique. . .! But you'd do well to stop moving," Sanoke barked out- - giving only a moment to stop.

Had Zhen continued with his brisk movements, the hand that was reaching from the scroll before complete it's transaction full circle. The object is unraveled, and on cue with the lotus sealing, the contents are released. Just as with Kaiko's assault, more weapons rush. Mainly shurikens and the likes -- but laced through it all also included various explosive mines, intent on igniting once in contact with the 'villain!"* - Sat Dec  5 07:31:50 2015

The explosive notes are triggered, sending a shockwave.

It served as a proper distraction, no doubt leaving Zhen riddled in burns, and of course sending his body off course. As such? Sanoke is free to complete the binding -- no doubt leaving the Hyuuga complete stunned and entrapped.

"I got it, Lera!"

It's at this point the shinobi's trade attributes are put into work. His body literally flicks in and out of view, speeding along and cutting the distance between himself and Zhen effortlessly. From the warrior's paw, a chakra receiver is produced, this time a bit more modified and thinner -- but all destructive the same. In one seamless move, the weapon is stabbed forward, aiming to catch Zhen on the thigh.

As that area is pierced, the chakra reservoir from was effectively stripped. He had no way to access. "Phew. . .THat should handle the issue!"* - Sat Dec  5 07:51:28 2015

It's a simple mission. "Festival is coming now that the chunnin exams are finished. I might actually invite other villages for this. Anywho, I just need you to take this to a printer and mass produce them. Then just direct my people to place them around the village. You can determine where if you want," Sanoke replies with a smile -- and he's caught off guard by the question.

"Um. Dunno, we're both usually busy. We can after your mission?"* - Sat Dec  5 09:12:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nodded along as Mirai gave her opinion.

"Yeah, worth a try. I'm hoping this can help get everyone back on the same page. It's good that the world is finally back at peace," Sanoke remarked. With that, he allows the woman to be off. Surprisingly, Mirai wasn't exactly going to gone for long.

In a few minutes, his fiance had returned -- this time taking a seat on his lap. An arm moved to secure a position around her waist, keeping her in place. "Back so soon?"* - Sat Dec  5 09:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: And yes, Kaiko. . ? I'll refer Ai to you. She's a chunnin now. - Sat Dec  5 09:37:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Seems complex. - Sat Dec  5 09:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shook his head.

"Very basic. Basically. . I'm programming chakra. It's like -- Errhh. . .Hard to explain," the interim leader says. His free hand rose to his head, giving a firm rub as the idea of explaining complex fuuinjutsu to a novice was irritating.

"Okay! Maybe it's a little hard. Anywho, you said you wanted more?"

Sanoke's claw moved away from his head, and landed on a favored body part -- Mirai's bosom. All-too-casually, even while in a public domain, he gives a tight squeeze and gestures to the mansion with his head.* - Sat Dec  5 10:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) 's ears twitched at the comment. In no real time, Mirai was strolling over to the manor. Naturally, Sanoke was eager to follow behind. He leapt from the bench and shuffled right behind, a sly smirk apparent.

"Is has been a while, I guess. This should be good." Purposely, he remains a few paces behind the Hokuma, his shaded gaze moving around every inch of her body, admiring the shapely curves she had been blessed with. After a few seconds, both would have made it to the manor. With a single had gesture, each of the NPC employees were ordered out -- sent home early for the day, with pay.

Sanoke turns, and works on the locks, preparing to shut the place down if not opposed by Mirai. Regardless, the kage turns, a predatory gaze now settling onto the teen again. She was looking chunkier for sure, for obvious reasons, but the added thickness was welcomed. 

In the blink of an eye, Sanoke closed the distance, and placed a hand onto the woman's waist line. Eagerly, he's unfastened the skirt worn to get to goods. His body pressed against her own, allowing the build up of heat to emanate onto her flesh. Naturally, she could feel the elevation along Sanoke's member.* - Sat Dec  5 10:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) thinks: Oh shit! If I keep this up i'm not going to get any presents for christmas. - Sat Dec  5 10:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
It didn't take him long to get down to business. Nimbly, his fingers worked along water latch, button, or zipper held the cloth together. With ferociousness, the skirt is being pulled down, no doubt revealing Mirai's curved lower body.

The sight was pure eye candy, and prompted the Kage's mouth to open a tad, almost agape. His tongue subtly was out, lulling around like a dog in heat--- But before he could move his grubby hands further, hand cuffs had been taken out.

Click! Clack!

With ease, they snap around his wrists, leaving his hands in partial bondage. This was new, garnering a  low chuckle from the victim. In most cases, he'd be worried. "Um. . This is new," the teen remarked. He didn't know what she had planned from there.* - Sat Dec  5 10:37:00 2015

Anywho. . .Eh. I guess I can tussle with you for a bit," the Kazekage retorts. A wooden tanto is abruptly spawned in hand.* - Sat Dec  5 20:58:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||The tanto is gripped tightly. In addition, Sanoke falls into a crouch, garnering an intense defensive stance. His gaze was unwavering, reading each detail of the rapid movement pattern. The observation grants the Kage with the innate ability to better prepare for the assault--

Then comes the sweeping kick.

He does a light jump, lifting his legs to evade the kick all together. At the same time, Sanoke's tanto whips forward, the wooden structure aiming to strike Momura on the shoulder, riddling it with pain! "Hyah!" Hit or miss, the teen quickly sets a foot onto the ground, and pivots back, keeping much needed distance. 

"Not bad. You're stronger than me when I was your age, for sure."* - Sat Dec  5 21:12:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) giggled.

The smoke bomb was clever, and it legitimately impressed him that momura was actually using tools to enhance her chances. "Good! A true ninja knows how to use their resources to the fullest!  Of course. . .this isn't good enough. ."

Easily, as a trained shinobi and kage-leveled talent, Sanoke knew fully how to see through a basic Bunshin. His ears could keen in on the environment, and what more, the rinnegan sported allowed this to clearly be determined as a low-leveled cloning skill.

Still, the male moved and pivoted out of harms way, allowing the assortment of strikes to miss their mark. Simultaneously with such, Sanoke's wooden blade slashes, elegantly moving to tag the trio in tandem via one fell swoop. His movements are graceful, making it clear that the male was indeed proficient even in close-ranged combat. . Albeit, that aspect of his skill wasn't boasted much given how many close-ranged specialists there were.* - Sat Dec  5 21:34:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) continued to smirk.

Just like that, Momura had burrowed onto the ground, while oddly using no chakra whatsoever. For a moment, Sanoke remains in place -- until the red-headed woman had finally leapt on up. The sand crumbled, prompting his ears to twitch.

In no time, his body flicks out of view. 

While in positioning, the wooden tanto swipes, intent on slamming behind Momura's knee caps, this time with considerably more force. Of course, his frame had evaded the grappling all together. . The boy was stupendously nimble.* - Sat Dec  5 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: You have this Momura! - Sat Dec  5 21:54:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
The Tanto is grasped, although it's no skin off his bone.

With a sly smirk, the male speedily ducks down, allowing Momura's strike to miss it's mark complete -- Could this man even be touched?!

Seamlessly, as the attack misses, a leg comes upward. It aims to kick Momura right in the stomach, this time with enough force to potentially send her propelling upward. "Dynamic kick!"* - Sat Dec  5 21:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Don't worry Sanoke, momura's got those magic fingers - Sat Dec  5 22:01:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) frowns.

The kick didn't land as he had anticipated., but it still did it' trick. Naturally, it seems Momura wasn't quite done! Just as with the last, the all-too-agile shinobi evaded the punch -- But what was this?!

Two of the kunoichi's fingers were pressed together, and pushing ahead. 

"No! Not thatm ove. . The move known to destroy any man!" Quickly, the Kaze shifts backwards, forming a single seal. As such, chakra is poured into the wires hidden along his sleeves, ninja wire slither out. Each strand, about five in total, try to wrap around Momu's body and restrain her.* - Sat Dec  5 22:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: 9riven - Sat Dec  5 22:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
The build up of chakra is detected given Sanoke's sensory abilities. 

"-- she can use that technique without any handseals?" It doesn't take long for the chakra to produce watermelon seeds, each one being fired with great velocity and forcing the male to abandon his positioning.  A quick barrel roll is performed, and amidst the rotation, a single seal is spawned.

Doton chakra is brought onto the field, flooding the ground itself.

The sand is broken down into small molecules, and spawns mud -- thick, creamy and brown,.From the consistency, a trio of Doton clones are spawned, each one staring ahead with menacing gazes. "You ain't too bad, you know? You versus Kinami might be a fun 'bout," SAnoke compliments.

In that instance, the trio steps forward, performing another technique in unison. with another 'snake' handseal being proclaimed. Three seperate streams leap forward, aiming to engulf and pusdh the Kunoichi back. Meanwhile, Sanoke is weaving through another set of seals once more.* - Sat Dec  5 22:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
Due to barrel rolling, he'd have let go of the wires. SHe'd be free now, of course.* - Sat Dec  5 22:20:09 2015
