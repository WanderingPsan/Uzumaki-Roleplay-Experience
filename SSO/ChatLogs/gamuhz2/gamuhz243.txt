<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: The Hair Binding. - Sun Nov 15 23:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) held back the urge to break into laughter at the sight of Mirai's embarrassment.

"Err, it's--" Sanoke proceeded to speak sheepishly, until the empowered strands of hair had taken life. Speedily, they rush to wrap around the would-be Sage's form, constricting his movements. Before another utterance could be completed, their lips pressed together, sending his mind swirling.

The pigmentations of his cheeks suddenly gained a deep, red hued. His heart rate picked up as well. But all the same, just as swift as Mirai had wrapped the hair around Sanoke's body, she had tossed and released him. Oddly enough, the teen seems a bit too caught up in the smooch to truly care too much.

At once, his body speedily re-assumed the previous position, right infront of the the youthful Hokuma. "That was great! Anywho, judging from that, I'm certain now. You'll be able to learn my new technique. It took me about one month to create, and another month to master. Let's see how well you can get it." Without another moment to waste, the shinobi sat along the empty plain, his legs folded ontop of the other.

"Activate your Byakugan to view my flow."* - Sun Nov 15 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||From there, the chakra manuevered from his tummy and guided itself along his chakra pathway. Just as with the predecessor technique, a thick amassment of chakra found it's way towards the cranium, just beneath the scalp.

For sure, Mirai probably would recognize the similarities between this sequence and the ones involved in the 'Hair Binding Technique.' "Alright, with this technique, you're going to exercise your manipulatiuon of Yang Release a tadbit more. Fuse the chakra into your hair, and this time don't even worry about focusing on movements."

And just like that, Sanoke had proven successful with the endeavor. Due to Mirai's doujutsu, she'd notice a thick vieling or aura of chi that surrounded the shinobi's fur. It was particularly thick andcondensed -- as this was necessary for the processes that was to come next. From this, the former Chunnin is enabled to provide the excessive energy to expand the body's normal functions beyond the normal limits.

Indeed, each process took some sort of physical energy -- even something as trivial as growing hair. With the metabolism kicked into overdrive just beneath the scalp,. Mirai would take notice of Sano's hair sudddenly elongating. It stretched, manuevering in a downward path along his back. This was perhaps the most tiring of all of the sequences, and through it all, the teacher made sure to give articulate and detailed explanations.

"You get what I'm doing? Yang Release is the aspect of chakra meant to represent physical energy. Day to day tasks. . such as breathing, your heart beating, and even your hair growing is a byproduct of your physical energy. Thus, the point is to guide chakra onto not only your hair, but your scalp. Use  the excessive energy to speed up the normal processes to force your hair to grow longer. . "

And this was just a single step to the technique. Did Mizora have it in her to do it?* - Mon Nov 16 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||With an observant, doujutsu-cladded eyes. With these qualities, he reads and deciphers just where Mirai was going wrong, and where she was going right. Unsurprisingly, the intelligent Hokuma showcases a degree of talent, even going as far as to get the majority of the sequence down without any coaching. Nevetheless, Sanoke still felt it necessary to guide his student, his soothing words serving as method to aid in understanding.

With a wide smile, he looks on as the hair follicles eventually begin to react in accordance to the Yang Release. At first, the process seems to be slowed. But as expected, the growth soon expanded, flowing uncontrollably and expanding Mirai's beautiful locks of hair. It gushed, stretching down her back, and wildly settling over her shoulder.

'Course, the process probably wasn't as swift as you expect, no doubt taking at least half an hour. -- Still, the growth rate was something to be proud of. "Wow! . . You're a fast learner, you know. In anycase,  now that you got this part down, we'll move onto the second and -third- part." The teen speaks with energy as usual, he shows legitimate excitement as the Hokuma seemed to steadily be progressing with her skillset. In no time, he had no doubt that she'd soon be able to match even his own might.

The chakra that currently was in place soon shifts, and now independently targets the make-up of his hair cells. They're pressed together, each strand gaining some density or condensation. Basically, the shaping and composition was being manipulated to force the hair to grow more thick. In no time, the durability of the hair had grown to be much like that of common steel -- making it ideal for striking.

"Get what I did there? I basically just made my hair grow in a specific way -- clumped together, while expanding it's overall mass. The manipulation ensures that it gains some hardness. Since this is the hardest part, if you can do that, you should be fine. But regardless, shortly after that, you just use your connection to the hair and send it forward to attack-slash-grapple."

Once more, Sanoke is swift to demonstrate the technique by sending a thick gathering of fur forward, slamming against mountain. Quakes run along the mountainous top, forcing rocky debris to fall onto the floor;* - Mon Nov 16 01:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||And just like that, Mirai had duplicated his technique with surprising effectiveness.

That said, Sanoke visibly smiles at the compliment. "Good work. In anycase. . Yeah, let's move back into town. We've been at this for hours." Without further ado, he moves to sweep Mirai up bridal style, and teleports out of view. * - Mon Nov 16 02:02:01 2015

He stares forward. "Hi."* - Mon Nov 16 19:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) scratches his head with a cheeky smile.

"Uh. . No need to be so startled. And yeah, name's Sano. I used to be a shinobi here."* - Mon Nov 16 19:51:15 2015

"ORTHO! I've been looking for him. Hrm . ."* - Mon Nov 16 19:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I wanna kick his ass, yeah. - Mon Nov 16 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Wh-what!? You're willing to help us!? - Mon Nov 16 19:54:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) seemed a bit taken by the surprise.

He steps back, an amused grin springing onto life. "Wow! You don't even know if I'm strong enough! No need to thank me, it's my duty. Just hope I don't run into some of my other enemies."* - Mon Nov 16 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Any idea when he'll attack? Hell. . - Mon Nov 16 19:58:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeah. I just need to know when the punk is. - Mon Nov 16 19:59:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: .....Y-..How?! - Mon Nov 16 20:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) stomach growls.

"Mmm. . I wonder if that'll be bad, though. I mean, he's just an animal. . right?"* - Mon Nov 16 20:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shook his head.

"Nah, it's good-- But I'll show ya how I'll do it! . . Uh. . Do you have a big target for me to use?" He looks around frantically in hopes of discovering an item that could be used to demonstrate his own power.* - Mon Nov 16 20:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shrugs. "That works. .  . Beyond!"

Chakra is built up internally. It proves to be a sufficiently condensed quantity, and before long, Sanoke's had presses against the ground. From the earth, several thick and elongaged pillars rise, speeding around in an arc-ing fashion. No doubt, their size proved great -- enough to threaten even a giant creature such as Manda.

"'Course, I could always use my other technique! It's good for large opponents, where I could just crush them. . Uh basically, just imagine me being able to send out rope that tightens around my opponent and squeezes them to death."* - Mon Nov 16 20:09:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: And you're just hanging in Suna. - Mon Nov 16 20:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) narrowed his eyes back! 

Of course, it's far less intimidating. "You had a responsibility to your village. . But eh, I'm one to talk I suppose. But I'll right my wrongs."* - Mon Nov 16 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: And that's good. But you can do more. For example, tracking down the man that killed Kirie.  . . And Violet. . . And about one-hundred Kirigakure shinobi. - Mon Nov 16 20:47:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: And then also protected the village and made his apology to 'us'. - Mon Nov 16 20:55:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: And assisted in fending of the beast-- three days ago. - Mon Nov 16 20:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Wait, not even a week. It happened two days ago. He just came and attacked everything. - Mon Nov 16 20:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: So even if he has helped. . He's also came andslaughtered hundreds mindlessly. - Mon Nov 16 20:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) points a finger towards Kana.

"I don't get it. . Do you have like a crush on him or something? You're not making any sense."* - Mon Nov 16 20:57:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: A Jounin. - Mon Nov 16 20:59:31 2015

Turtles were cooler. 

Still, the strange manipulation of the summoning creature garners much of Sanoke's intention. Like a child discovering one of life's mysteries, his eyes remained wide open, observing the ampibian and it's scroll.

"Uh. . The hell was that all about?"* - Mon Nov 16 21:31:56 2015

A small turtle is conjured after five seals. It's relatively palm-sized, and easily portable. 

"I should get to heading back. You can speak to this turtle and he'll relay messages for me. Also, take this bird too. Just incase you'll need it. We'll stay in touch, yes?" Sanoke replies. He holds his fist out for a bump, but thinks against it. In a world where Fuuinjutsu users can paralyze with a touch, he's particular cautious of how can make physical contact.* - Mon Nov 16 21:40:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) goes to unsheath his Tanto. It pretty much always was hugging either his back, or in rare cases, his thigh. The friction between the weapon and it's sheath prompts a chafing sound effect, as if two blades were clashing.

"Uh? Meaning I'mma beat up the guy that keeps bullying Kirigakure. Anywho, your go Mitsunara."* - Mon Nov 16 21:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? So I get the first step, huh..? - Mon Nov 16 21:59:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nodded at Mitsunara's question. He preferred to give his opponents the first move, as the best offense was a great defense. . . Naturally, this was the philosophy a turtle-minded warrior preached.

Even if his skillset contradicted the very specimens that he summoned.

Easily, he's capable of tracking the Swordswoman movements. The moment her arm whopped forward, so did Sanoke's. Little did she know, during his time in Kirigakure, the shinobi had been extensively trained in the art of Tanto combat. With equal grace, the metal swayed through the skies, meeting the initial blow.

The collision sparks some electricity to flow from the opposing weapons. It was going to be a test of strength, as Sano sought to push back or parry. "Not bad. . You're pretty handy with a sword, you know."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) wore a simper through this all. His eyes gleamed with some intrigued -- a rare trait. It wasn't often that an opponent could actually catch Sanoke's attention, he notorious had a short attention span.

Regardless, just as Mitsunara makes her move,she'd find that the warrior she combated against was no slouch.

The tanto was inevitably parried -- BUT. . . As Mitsunara's right hand came in, the shinobi's mitts moved to greet it. Assuming success, he'd grasps around her limb, using that grip to hold her in place. Speedily, his body brooke off into a spin -- so fast that wind currents were visibly being built up. It was like a human-made cyclone had been sprotued from nowhere.

Yet. . . It served a purpose.

Just as the first revolution is being delivered, a single, swift kick is sent ahead. It targets her lower body, the back of the knees in effort to compromise the woman's balance. 

In the event that hadn't worked? Then Mitsunara's strike likely would go through. But it'd catch nothing but wind. Like a phantom, first Sanoke was in one place. . . then he had suddenly moved. The rate of velocity obtained could perhaps fool those with less than adequate perception to assume that his legs weren't even moving, but rather. . . the shinobi was just sliding along the ground* - Mon Nov 16 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||The famed Beheading technique!

There's a grin that comes to life as Sanoke stays put, his eyes following the brutish woman as she angrily comes on over. 

"It wouldn't be that much of an issue if you could strike fast. Speed means nothing, if your mind can't even process the danger before it strikes," the shinobi lectures. The blow is winded back, and just before it can be launched or make contact, a single seal is formed.

Swoosh!

Mitsunara again would be unable to strike anything save for the sand that now cascaded onto the floor in Sanoke's disappearance. Where was he? Tothe south, now sitting idly ontop of the cliff. The grin from before only widens.* - Mon Nov 16 22:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) tilts his head in confusion.

"Yo! You don't even know Suimen? I could teach sometime. . "

With that, Sanoke kicked off the ground, his body practically teleporting back to ground level. He honestly hadn't a clue that Mitsunara couldn't do the trick. 

The tanto is still held strong. "Anywho, you're pretty strong. Want me to start fighting a bit more serious?"* - Mon Nov 16 22:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

The Tanto is taken and thrown down, it's sharpness enabling the weapon to pierce through the ground. It stuck there now, sheathed firmly into the earth and leaving Sanoke enabled to work with ninjutsu.

--- Of course, naturally Sanoke is capable of reading her dark energies as it swirled in preparation for the technique. Still. . 

He's more than pleasantly surprised once the technique was being sprung to life. Sadly, despite her grand plan, it wasn't going to be effective. Like an advanced AI, his body responded damn near instantly, moving just a step beyond reach. It was likely a frustrating endeavor for Mitsunara, as no matter what she shot ahead, nothing was quite working.

"Ninja Art. . . Mud River!" At once, his cheecks puffed up, filled to the brink with muddy residue. Without wasting any time, the contents are soon dispelled, releasing a basic outpour of earth, intent on slamming onto Mitsunara's body and keeping her at bay. 'Course, it was a basic technique and probably wouldn't hurt too much.* - Mon Nov 16 22:44:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||A nifty technique.

Sadly, it'd fail to catch Sanoke off guard, given his ability to see a build up of chakra. Once more, his body gained momentum on the fly, responding just as quickly as the blade could develop or grow. Naturally, it was as if he was literally gliding or sliding rather than moving his feet. The dude was a genetic monster.

Once more, the teen moved out of range -- and just barely, due to arrogance. Although, Mitsunara had managed to spawn an incision along the teen's clothing. 

The first blow had missed, yes. . Thus, Sanoke moves to try something different, and more difficult to use. Given his fast-paced style of combat, the warrior almost always used techniques that required no seals, or very little. In this case, one the 'Bird Handsign;' is produced.

With a quick inhale and exhale, the wind within his diaphragm had been manipulated spawning about a dozen of base-balled sized spheres. They rush through the skies, crashing against Mitsunara's form and hopefully sending her back in recoil.

"Oi! That's a nifty ass technique. Hell, I've often thought about making similar techniques. . . If I couldn't see the build up of your chakra, you may have been able to land a nice hit."* - Mon Nov 16 23:09:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ponders on the next course of action. .

"Hrm. . You ain't too bad, though. You could have gotten me if not for my condition," Sanoke muses with a smile. 

"You just might be able to beat me if you train hard for a month or two!" Without another word or moment pause, he again presses forward. .  And just like the other techniques, a single seal is formulated to allow for the proper build up of chakra. Seamlessly, thje tenketsu along his forearms are activated, allowing the wires commonly hidden underneath his sleeves to be utilized.

Like slithering snakes, the metal strings shoot ahead, in large number as well. Easily eight or more strands for each arm. 

As they worm through the skies, it's clear that the destination is towards Mitsunara. The simple ninjutsu seek hold the girl in bondage. Some going to the legs, while the other seek to wrap about the arm. Each string seems to move fairly quickly as well, thanks to the Fuuinjutsu specialist's impeccable chakra control!

"Let's see how she does. . "* - Mon Nov 16 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shifts his eyes from side to side. His cheeks flared for a moment as she made mention of Mirai.

Just for a moment, Sanoke is flustered, granting Mitsunara the opportunity to regain composure.

'Course, shortly after, Sano sprung back into action. His body moved  in a zig-zag, each movement a mere blur and containing enough velocity to kick up dust or sand along the way. Literally, the male was like a force of nature closing in on the ambitious swords woman.

And once close enough? He sends a side-kick, fully intent on keeping Mitsunara on her toes in on the defensive. Regardless, the results mattered little as this was a mere set up. At once, his hand grasped onto a scroll, and released the contents. 

A swirl of cloth moves forward while simultaneously being funneled with Sanoke's chakra. The intent? To wrap about Mitsunara's body once more and constrict her completely, even that even usage of chakra probably wouldn't be a threat. "Clothes Binding Technique!"* - Mon Nov 16 23:33:58 2015

The cloth wraps about Mitsunara's. It moves and moves, up until every ounce of Mitsunara's body was bound, save for her head. Once more, as she comments, there's a smidget of red spawning onto Sanoke's cheeks.

His hands are held up defensively as the claims are denied.

"No . ! I just have a lot of sealing techniques. . -- Anywho! I can help you with the Suimen technique. . " He says in hope of changing the subject.* - Mon Nov 16 23:43:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looks around. . He internally debates.

"Alright. . Well. . Let me dig up a trench." His hand draws some blood, allowing for the summoning technique to be produced. A giant, six-foot tall turtle (on all fours) was conjured from out of nowhere.

"Hey! Can you dig up a muddy trench? Fill it with water and earth. As you do that. . I'm going to get Mitsunara here acquainted to the basics."

He walks on over to the wall and sticks a foot up. "Alright, it's really simple. What you're doing here is applying your chakras onto the bottom of your feat. The goal? Is to create an adhesive effect. The chakra is supposed to pretty much grab onto whatever surface you want. . . Naturally, the more stable the surface, the easier. For now, we'll start with solid."

A foot presses against the earthly wall. Once done, the other follows shortly after. Sanoke stands upright with ease.

"The hard part is getting just the right quantity. Too much? Boom, crack forms and you bounce off. Too little, then you just slide off onto the ground. Both aren't the desired effects."* - Tue Nov 17 00:05:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||The task of building a house! It was a daunting one, considering Sanoke was a shinobi -- not a contractor. Regardless, the shinobi headed on off to the mission's site. It's in a poorer area of the rich Sunagakure. The housing in all directions seem to be ran-down given the oldness.

IUpon moving on over, some chematics are given. Luck shone onto Sano's life, since it was clear he wasn't going to have to build the houses from the ground up. Instead, all he'd have to do was work on repairs and aid in revitalizing the shoddy infrastructure. With a giddy smile, his fingers pressed together, allowing for a massive build up of chakra. In no time, it split off into five, putting the grand total of all the Sanokes at six.

They all move in a blur, hastily grabbing an assortment of tools or materials. Each one meant to aid in the reconstruction, or re-inforcement of the broken builds. Some held hammers, other held dry rock, some even had paint. Naturally, those with the hammers and wood moved to get to work, as the house first had to be certainly re-inforced to remai nstanding. As this all went on, Sanoke stood back, holding the drawings and barking out orders.

Meanwhile, two of the clones had moved onto the outside with a paint brush and canteens of paint evident. Wasting no time, after the paint is soaked onto the brush, their wrists lash up and down, forcing the paint to be plastered onto the walls. It's a skyblue tint, clashing against the normal designs of most Sunagakure housings. But going with tradiitonal colors were boring. . ! "Good work, everyone. .  Keep at it!"

For the next twenty fives minutes or so, each dopplegangers worked tirelessly. They were enabled to so for one good reason -- Sanoke's inhuman levels of stamina. Naturally, he could go on for entire minutes without showing any sign of fatigue, be it via physical energies, or just plain muscle fatigue. Of course, they weren't alone in the endeavor. In the mission, several other workers were on the scene to aid in the shinobi's lack of technical, archtectual knowledge.

They gawked much of the time, surprised by the human's extraordinary vigor. Once done, a tired Sanoke heads on off, ready to reap the reward. His body still hardly showed any signs of tiredness. "Done, Lord Hassan!"* - Tue Nov 17 02:10:08 2015
