<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) takes that scroll.

He opens it away from his face. Once it's proven to not be riddled with traps, Sanoke gives a gander. A wide smile is swift to creep on his face. "Sweet. Thanks!" A thumbs up is given, and he goes to smack the girl on the bum -- playfully.

"Back that up."

With a whistle, the snow-haired shinobi turns towards the west and proceeds off to begin with his travels.* - Mon Sep 21 16:30:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) managed to strike.

That said, the shinobi continues onward to begin with his hermit training.* - Mon Sep 21 16:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) sees a messenger bird in the sky. He quickly goes to catch it.* - Mon Sep 21 21:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
The trip began.

Being tied down to a village was quite simply against the philosophy that had been instilled within Sanoke's cranium. Or well, at least from what he perceived. Genbi -- the reptilian instructor -- had made it clear that a true sage held no bias, and acted simply on what they perceived. Thus, being part of a shinobi village would inheritly go against the teachings. After all, should he observe another 'Tethys' or 'Smoke Release' ruthlessly going for murder, he'd have to certainly take action.

Noriko was a friend, for sure. . . But what was rigght was right, and was wrong was wrong.

The shinobi's feet drags along the ground. Minutes eventually progressed into hours, and after several hours the sun was setting. He settles at nearby tree and begins to lean against the wooden bark. A hand presses against his teeth, and after a brief bite -- blood trickles. Wasting little time, Sanoke is quick to induce five seperate seals. 

A hand presses against the flooring, andb efore long, a massive turtle had been spawned. It's size is enough to rival Sanoke's own height -- even as it remained on it's hindlegs. "Ganba. I want you to walk my ass as I sleep tonight. Got me?--"

"Hmph. . . What are you doing out here anyway? I guess you're taking the old man's advice, and moving away from the shinobi system. Shit, you must really be taking this sage shit serious. I'm pretty proud," the elderly turtle declared with a huff. A smirk is worn afterwards, and as per usual, Ganba's lazy demeanor takes to the forefront. He lowers his frame and proceeds to half-snooze, although remaining well aware of the surrounding.

Meanwhile, as the massive turtle watches his back, Sanoke pulls out hte scroll, reading the beginning of the infamous 'Shadow Clone' technique. It was B-ranked, thus making this the most significant, offensive technique the former chunnin hadi n his repetoire. 

With a flutter, the scroll is being unwinded, and his eyes going through the contents. While high-ranked, the jutsu was still straight forward. To do so? Required an impeccable amount of control.

All in all, you split your energy in accordance to the number of clones you had activated. It was for this reason that manipulating more than five grew bothersome. That said, for the next hour or so, Sanoke studied hard, taking in every single finer bit of detail. And after the alloted time? The teen stands and press his two fingers together.

His eyes are shut, allowing each second of attention to be divided solely onto the act of manipulating his chakra. Energy churns on the inside, and before long, a plume of smoke shrouds his figure. . .It's steady, briefly making it impossible to really discern or take note of what was going on.  However, on the inside, there appeared to be a large amount of activity going on.

Each particle of Sanoke's chakra quivered as it's communed into two different pools. After splitting off, he aims to systematically pour his energy out from his skin, and thus form a seperate body. It's a technique that utilizes not only Yang Release, but yin. The former release was to breath in life, and thus create a doppleganger. While the latter simply granted the appearance, and gave your clone the consciousness.

Boom!'

An explosion occurs, forcing the area to be shrouded in a gust. And as it ended? A successful shadow clone had been spawned.
* - Tue Sep 22 00:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) had returned to the village prematurely.

Simply because the other nations around the world seemed to be experiencing a period of inactivity. A single clone would have leapt over onto the area, observing all the battle that currently went on. 

Why use clones?

Simple to gain experience with it. After observing for a few moments, it's forced to disperse. Meanwhile, Sanoke himself continued to leap about the village, searching for someone to harrass or generally observe.* - Tue Sep 22 01:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You should go get checked on. Taking those two attacks head-on can't feel that great. - Tue Sep 22 03:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Im fine... I have a medic at home if I need one... - Tue Sep 22 03:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm sure you are. - Tue Sep 22 03:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shook his head, whistling.

"You fired at full power?"* - Tue Sep 22 03:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: That ain't smart. - Tue Sep 22 03:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shook his head. He'd descend down from the mountain tops.

"Still ain't smart. Unless this chick over here drinks lots of milk. Coulda broke a rib," the summoner declared casually. A thumbs up is given towards Violet -- even if she had been the loser, at least from Sanoke's perspective.

"You did pretty good. But you need to work on your speed. Or add some range to your game," the former chunnin compliments. Immediately after, his gaze falls back onto Yan. "You did pretty good too. Although your battle plan is pretty straight forward. Although effective nonetheless."* - Tue Sep 22 03:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It's effective, that's for sure. - Tue Sep 22 03:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shrugs.

"Guess you're right. Still think you oughta get your speed up," Sanoke says in a light-hearted fashion. No other commentary is provided, as it was clear that Violet was in dire need of sleep. With a slight pivot, the shinobi instead speeds on over towards the grasslands, stopping just west of Yan's current location. His overall velocity makes his movement essentially a blur -- at least for those that hadn't bothered to work on their perception. 

"So. Sunagakure-- You guys ever gonna go back?" The ex-shinobi murmurs. A hand rises, dusting some sand off his shirt.

"Was about to go there. But then. . Uhm. I got some dark chills. I figured going there would either be boring as hell, or would get me killed. Either way, wasn't an outcome I'd want," the teen speaks, essentially babbling on and on about his travels -- which were on recess for the moment.* - Tue Sep 22 03:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
He really only moves that quick randomly due to impatience. 

"I see. . .I see. Hrm, have you tried like talking to him? Maybe the guy just needs a hug or something," Sanoke states with a slight laugh -- although he was deadass serious. In his experience, people often did extreme things based on emotional or mental distress. Thus, why not reason with the poor soul?

"If not that. I'm surprised Kirigakure ain't all over that. I'm ready for the world to be back at peace. Then maybe I can find some fun when I'm out there, feeling the wind go through my hair. And watching the s--- superb shinobi or citizens go about their day," he articulates, this time with a sigh. His last outing wasn't an all too intriguing one clearly.* - Tue Sep 22 03:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) leaned in a bit, eyes narrowed to accurately comprehend Yan's facial expressions.

From the looks of things, the boy's comments seemed to be authentic-- as Sunagakure -did- appear to have a metaphorical dark cloud over it. Just getting close to that forsaken village had left Sanoke unsettled, to the point where he was unable to even sleep while within range of the dastardly deserts. "Geez. Is that right. . ." Is all the teen could spit out upon seeing Yan's resolve and his angst. There's an awkward pause or silence for a few moments before eventually, the nonchalant warrior speaks up once more.

"Well then. Why is it that you seem to be the only one that gives a damn? He seems like a pretty bad dude. You'd think so many more would be up in arms."* - Tue Sep 22 04:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: There are others...Flexus will be there the moment we take Sand back. He's my comrade. - Tue Sep 22 04:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And Tetsumi.... - Tue Sep 22 04:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh, good to hear. Figured you were alone, since I ain't ever hear of this Edge dude. - Tue Sep 22 04:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Even if I am alone...it won't change anything. - Tue Sep 22 04:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I have my brother's spirit and signature techniques to aid me. - Tue Sep 22 04:06:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gives a nod.

His thumb juts right on up, and a toothy grin is granted. "That's good. You got spunk, I like it. . . I'm sure you'll be able to beat the dude around when you get around to it. Just 'cause of the attitude."

He nods again, comfirming the belief. Of course, Sanoke could be dead wrong. Lets just hope he isn't.* - Tue Sep 22 04:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looked up into the sky as he mused over thoughts. After some time, the teen adamantly shakes his head.

"Kirigakure got some of the strongest shinobi I've ever seen. Mmm. . .If I would have to guess another area I'd have to say. . .Kumogakure. Although, they aren't as good as mist ninjas," Sanoke declared in an uncertain tone. Despite there not being many prominent or well known warriors (read: PCs). . . certainly, the village hidden in the clouds had someone worth while, no?* - Tue Sep 22 04:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) takes a step forward to shake Yan's hand-- but stops halfway there.

Every real ninja knows not to touch people you don't know. "Name's Sanoke. Nice meeting ya." Instead, he just waves.* - Tue Sep 22 04:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Well I have Katon. - Tue Sep 22 18:02:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Haven't seen you in forever. - Tue Sep 22 18:09:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blinks.

"What the. . . Are you feeling okay?" He immediately sprints off, circling around Mitsuru's frame. Certainly, this wasn't the same grouch he had known all these years.* - Tue Sep 22 18:10:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: What kind of non-elemental? - Tue Sep 22 18:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) was still mildly confused. After a few pokes, he backs up. . . the mystified expression making it all too clear how he was feeling.

"Uh. I'm fine, I guess. Wow, this feels weird. I'm too used to you being a grinch," the teen replies upon backing up.* - Tue Sep 22 18:13:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Flamethrower. - Tue Sep 22 18:15:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Is it a good jutsu? - Tue Sep 22 18:16:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shrugs.

"Just been traveling around. Shinobi life ain't for me," he says with a shrug. Indeed, it wasn't as if Sanoke had just fallen off the face of the planet during the war. He had simply taken on a new philosophy in life -- one that didn't involve the often ruthless life of being a shinobi.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Come at me. - Tue Sep 22 21:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) takes a step back.

His fingers press against one another, prompting the chakra in his belly to begin working overtime. It forms a massive viel of energy around his form, which eventually splits off.

Poof!

Smoke momentarily clouds the area and as it dissipates, a second version of Sanoke exists. It's strapped with as many tags and explosions as he was -- making fuuinjutsu specialist's threat even more potent. ". . .Damn. This clone jutsu might be more useful than I thought. I just realized they copy my weapons too. And my chakra is correspondant. . . so if I cna place a seal-- Oh yeah." All of these comments are simple thoughts as the teen strategized against the apparent Mizukage.

The clone that was formed goes through a string of seals, prompting 'Bunshins' to cloud the area.* - Tue Sep 22 22:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
"Let the games begin."

Quickly, his feet kicks off the ground, allowing for sudden acceleration. Blurring, both of the clones moved in different locations -- one coming from the east, while the other came from the west.

They held tags in hand for a familiar technique that Koeki was likely quite aware of by now.

Meanwhile, the actual Bunshins, y'know the E-ranked techniques, moved in from ahead simultaneously. Why? All to be a legitimate distraction. Once close, both Sanokes deliver right handed cross-chops. Admist the blow, they seek to slap the tag against Koeki's body. One towards the back, the other towards the bum. Two areas he hoped would be annoying to reach for.

"Hyah!"* - Tue Sep 22 22:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
That attack speed though.

Sanoke was swift -- yet his perception and attention to detail left much to be desired. The blow would have landed without difficulty, prompting the clone to be dispersed.

"Shiiit. Maybe I've been slacking too hard. ..!" 

Yelled the youth as the winds blow him back. As he's being flung away, although not too far. As his feet inevitably skids back, the boy's hand falls onto his mouth and his bitten. Quickly, a string of handsigns again are woven through and pressed against the ground. . .

Pooof!

More smoke that inevitably clears. As it dissipates, a massive reptilian stood in the way. Ganba. "Right. Let's do this, Gan-Gan." No time is wasted, and without a word, the turtle chews buffs, allowing water to speed from it's maw. The target? The Mizukage herself.* - Tue Sep 22 22:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
"Alright. . . Let's try this again. Shadow Clone. . . JUTSU!"

He was a regular ass, Naruto!

A clone again spawns, and this time, it seeks to get a bit more active. Two short seals are strung through, allowing the wires in Sanoke's sleeves to be activated. Quickly, like malicious snakes, the multitude of wires move ahead, aiming to wrap around and constrict Koeki's body.

Meanwhile? The actual Sanoke got into the fray via usage of his 'safety scrolls.'

Indeed, upon release, various tools come flying out, although none being lethal. Wooden, dulled Kunai come rocketing out, many of which held small bundles of  -weakened- tags. Hit or miss, these concussive spheres unleash their might, holding enough force to disorientate or at least throw the Mizukage''s off course. And obviously, considering the woman's increased skill, Sanoke is speeding back, in hopes that his advantage in velocity would keep the herculean woman off his ass.

". . .Shit. Good going kid. . . Let's try this again. . ." Chakra is gearing along Ganba's frame all the way, preparing his Turtle-like anatomy for something great. Although, in the meantime, he simply unleashes a giant water bullet to add insult to injury.* - Tue Sep 22 22:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
The wires were likely broken with little struggle. And considering the fact that a Kage Bunshin only took a seal, Koeki expertly would have been able to get out of harm's way. 

The explosions sitll go off, but sadly.. That doesn't particularly stop Ganba's involvement. Regardless of her acrobatic measures, there was still now a massive, body-sized teppodama coming right for her body. Of course, considering the nature of this battle, it had no lethal intent -- but wouldstill hurt.

"Shiiiit. This chick is pretty good, Sano. -- But I'm better, let's rock!" The turtle was clearly getting riled up, and additional chakra continuing to build up. How would Koeki respond?

Meanwhile, Sanoke had descended in to a crouch, and his hands scramble for additional scrolls.* - Tue Sep 22 22:40:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Got things to do. - Wed Sep 23 01:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) was boredo ut of his mind. Before arriving at the area, his hands came together, forming a singular seal. Shortly after, a clone spawns and runs underneath the water. 

"Hrm. . .I'm bored. I think I'mma just go harrass some people for sport. . ." And so he does. The doppleganger continues to move underneath the water. Swiftly, the real Sanoke speeds ahead, waving towards Kirie.

"S'up. . . Whatcha doing?"* - Wed Sep 23 01:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
"Uh. Nice voice. . . I figured i'd see you doing something though, since you kinda said. 'Got things to do,'" the teen joked with a smirk.

As he small talks, the clone however, is hard at work to aid in the mischevious endeavors. Its hands come together, forming seals, while focus is geared towards the bridge.

"So. .. Uh. . . What do you even do around here? I recall seeing you in Kirigakrue before, but then I went back on my trip. Considering there ain't nothing else to do. I figure I can see what you'd do for fun around here. ."* - Wed Sep 23 01:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
The mist only serve as an advantage to Sanoke's mischevious exploits. As the viel comes over, that's when the clone makes his move. Underneath the surface of the water, two seals are woven through.

"Neat. That jutsu is useful as hell. Although, it's also annoying as can be. I hate when people use that shit against me," the teen muses, still keeping the small talk going in effort to have Kirie's attention diverted. And it was at this point. . . he struck!

The clone finishes the last seal, and prompts wires to bring from it'[s body. Considering the jutsu gave the user complete control, the  wires easily curve along the bridge. One contact, they seek to constrict around Kirie's body, potentially cutting through some clothes -- but never striking flesh. On success, the Shadow Clone has her pulled inward towards the oceanic body of water!* - Wed Sep 23 02:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
Boom!

As she's being pulled, Sanoke stifles a chuckle. The clone was -really- succeeding in it's work. Although, considering he had lacked the forethought to actuall henge, it disperses shortly afterwards. Nevertheless, Kirie had been pulled in, and was wrapped in wires -- which were easily removable since the shadow clones had ceased it's ninjutsu.

"Ha-- K-Kirie? Hah-- Kirie, you okay?!" It's hard to contain the laughter, but inbetween chortles, Sanoke actually sounds concerned.* - Wed Sep 23 02:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) rubs his head.

"Laughing? Well. . . It was pretty funny, y'know. You kinda tripped after you formed that mist. I didn't know Kirigakure no Jutsu made your sense of balance decline, or lose your friction -- hahaha," he busts out laughing again, estatic that the prank had gone on without a hitch. 

Of course, this was a bold-faced lie. Sanoke new precisely what had happened. A hand extends forward, as if offering to aid Kirie in rising up.  "You okay, though? Should be more careful."* - Wed Sep 23 02:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
"Huh? I'm just laughin' cause it's funn--" and then the hair is manipulated.

"Hair ninjutsu. . . Yang release to breath life into your hair. It can even change the properties of it-- that's pretty badass," the shinobi muttered, already deducing or making a guess of how the jutsu worked. However, marveling at the rare technique would only lead to pain or constrictiion. On cue, his body pivots, allowing his body to speedily move in an arc.

His range of speed was enough to be a simple blur to most, or well at least those without trained perceptions. 

Assuming the ability to evade, his body would be over the water, although this several feet away from Kirie herself. "Hey. No need to get antsy-- it ain't my fault that you tripped, haha," the boy still seems charmed by girl's previous fall. That he of course forced.* - Wed Sep 23 03:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) is caught in that event. * - Wed Sep 23 03:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
Yikes!

This was becoming an issue! His body was steadily growing more restrained. As Kirie moved to lift him upward, Sanoke's frame fidgeted about,as if to weasal in some breathing room. Ontop of this, chakra flares along the body, to force one of his scrolls to activate -- as that was the trigger. To come in contact with his chakra.

Assuming success, the contents are released.

Thankfully, they aren't particularly lethal. Weapons come spiralling out, along with light tags -- which ignite to release a decent explosion that hopefully handlest he hair, or at least distracts Kirie long enough for him to break free.

Success or not, assuming he was unable to actual pry free, the teen continued to play possum. "I didn't do nothhiinng."* - Wed Sep 23 03:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
His suimen activates quickly, allowing his body to stay above the surface.

"Hhahaha! You had me scared for a second. For a minute, I almost thought you were really going to own me. . . for you tripping. . " Sanoke says meekly, still apparently adamant in his act. 

After sometime, he relents, however.

"Ergh. . Alright. I ain't gonna lie. That was me that pulled you in. I had a Shadow Clone creep under ya, and pull you into the water. Just to see how you would react. I found that pretty fun," the oft mischevious and playful teen declared with a cheeky grin. This was how he had fun. Well. . . This was one of the many ways Sanoke sought to entertain himself. The others shall not be spoken of.

"That Hair Technique is pretty cool, though."* - Wed Sep 23 03:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: . .. Uh. Are they sparring in a place like this? - Wed Sep 23 17:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) just stood along the wall via Suimen.

He looks downward. "Hey, uh. you guys oughta move it towards the east. There's a better place to battle."* - Wed Sep 23 17:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) scratches his head upon observing the hax usage of Kage Bunshin. 

"She split her chakra into thirteen parts. Damn. . .She isn't even breaking a sweat," Sanoke murmured, clearly impressed at the ANBU Agent's apparently ludicrous level of energy. 'Course, this went by the assumption that Shadow Clone followed canon logic.* - Wed Sep 23 17:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: 9smh - Wed Sep 23 17:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) was genuinely amused.

The display of power was impressive to say the least -- well, at least as it pertained to Fuuton skills. As the battle comes to an end, Sanoke simply claps, giving the two combatants props for their skill.

"Not bad. But, I think you guys oughta not. . . Do this in the middle of the road next time."* - Wed Sep 23 18:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: Used half of my chakra... - Wed Sep 23 18:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Dot, dot, dot. - Wed Sep 23 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: So. .. How 'bout that Kirigakure, guys? Anythin' been happenin' lately? - Wed Sep 23 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) thinks: Where is the damn hair stylist. - Wed Sep 23 18:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looks ahead.

That shunshin, though. Quickly, he follows suit, utilizing his own impressive speeds to not only match the Agent's movements -- but even exceeding it. After coming to a skidding stop, the former shinobi just looks on.

This could get super interesting.* - Wed Sep 23 18:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Are they going to battle? - Wed Sep 23 18:14:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) unseals something from a scroll.

It's a razor. 'What's up? I can tape you up if you want."* - Wed Sep 23 18:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Maybe even a fresh fade. - Wed Sep 23 18:17:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shook his head. The items are re-sealed.

"Tch. Suit yourself. All the guys I give haricuts too tell me the ladies be all over them," the traveler said with a snicker.* - Wed Sep 23 18:23:08 2015
