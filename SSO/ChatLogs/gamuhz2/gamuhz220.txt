<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) hadn't even lost! He just wanted to think of a way to giev Mirai some self esteem.

As usual, considering he hadn't a thing to do and legitimately enjoyed the Hokuma's company, Sanoke would have followed the two onto the training area-- Hell, he even carried the former. Once in position, he takes a seat along the heated sand, and allow both eyes to fall onto their forms. For a moment, the boy is well within the belief that they were about to 'bond' the good ol' fashioned, shinobi-inspired way. By having an intense spar.

Yet color him surprised when it seemed that the second-in command of the Hokuma family actually sought to get to know her cousin. There's a brief smile worn, but it fades swiftly. Wordlessly, Sanoke looked on, just as curious with the answer as Mirai was.* - Fri Oct 16 03:44:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: A sleep? - Fri Oct 16 07:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||In time, he was ready to go back to training fully.

Given the amount of time spent towards mastering his first path, being capable of now returning to another caste of ninjutsu was a welcomed changed. Eagerly, Sanoke is back at the outskirts, and once in a secluded area, he's hard at work, building up chakra around his very core. Particles of energy are clumping ontop of one another, and there's a very significant rise in terms of the boy's chakra levels or potency. Even while his overall reservoirs were the same, the quality and strength was growing rapidly, making it clear that the level of technique that Sanokesought to utilize was of a relative high level.

"Alright. . . Back to the old grinnd. My Doton Release needs a -lot- of work. . . I can't let that aspect of my skillset lag behind. . . All facets of Sanoke's skillset must be up to par. I have to be ready, just incase those strange men ever come for me," the chunnin muttered to himself.

Even as the village experienced a period of piece or inactivity, his heart was racing, overwhelmed with excitement, fear -- and anxiousness. These were the feelings that compelled him to train, and beckoned for him to take on the call of achieving true strength. Wasting no time, a single seal is conjured, b uilding up the prerequisite for his technique. By now, there's a clear veil of chakra around his body, hugging onto his frame as if it served as life support. Yet. . . This wasn't the case, rather. . . The clear visualization of his internal energies was a simply result of the high level of concentration, making his power more pronounced and noticeable.

From this, Sanoke'schi flows onto the floor, implanting his will into the Earth for the elemental technique. Using pure cognitive or will power, the earth's simple nature begins to transform, as the floor is literally terraform. The dried grains of sands are practically mixing in with the moisture that lingered in the air. From this strange mixture or solution, there's a change in consistency, one's that a bit more liquidy and less. . . sturdy. It's mud. The mud river technique, and from this, a wave of sickly mud flows covering the training area.

Time and time again, the process repeats, as the borderline jounin worked to ensure that he'd be capable of truly reaching the condition for the higher-ranked technique. ..  Mud Dragon Bomb! Indeed, in five minutes flat, the ground is completely and utterly covered in the aforementioned mud, giving an avenue for Sanoke to continue in his training. 

With an exhale, all the worries and distractions exit his body. His mind is being cleared, devoid of any thoughts -- Yes, even of his friends, family, and lover. None are on his mind, considering the best way to gain experience was not just to have practice. . . But 'perfect practice.' To truly developed, you needed to pay attention to detail, rather than completely mindless repetition. It was this way of thinking that would ineviitably allow you to see your flaws, be it on the technical side of the jutsu casting, or even the mental. Nevertheless, he's as focused as can be.

Thankfully, the jutsu only requires three seals. Each one that's woven through is enought to develop his potent chakra even further, and knead it in just the right, precise fashion that's required complete the difficult sequences for the Dragon Bomb. Unlike before, his flow is a bit more tamed, mostly because Sanoke's chakra reserves weren't too powerful, unlike his potent stamina levels.

From the gushing chi, the ground again is terraformed or manipulated to the user's liking. On this case, it goes through an assortment of different processes, each one imperative to the proper casting of the ninjutsu, as taught by Lera. First, the muddy consistency is taken advantage of, allowing for an easier process of shape manipulation. By now, the boy was more than just a little bit familiar with the jutsu, thus he doesn't struggle as intensely as when the technique was first gifted to him.

The mud would rise, initially clumping together in the form of a giant sphere, or a 'Mud Boulder.' The size rivals Sanoke's general height, and there were ripples running along the surface, making it appear more like a glass of water on a shaky table. However, the odd ripples was simply due to the chunnin's rawness when it came to elemental releases. with shaking arms, Sanoke continued to impose his will, forming the spherical shaped mud ball to begin being transformed into a Dragon's Maw or head.


And it was doing just that. In no time at all, the mud begins to thin out and press outward. Slowly, the excessive quantity is being stripped down, and in time, a generally shaped Dragon Head is developed -- albeit. . . there was still a lot of work to be done. Regardless, the shaping of the construction is just the first part. It opens up the avenue needed to further develop his ability with the jutsu. On cue, the dragon's maw is used as a 'suction' or 'medium' in order to draw out additional mud.

The second more ammo is being pulled inward, Sanoke multi-tasks, allowing the muddy dragon to be manipulated and take on the shape of gigantic cannonball-esque items. As one is finally formed, the boy's cognitive ability, or will, is again put into play. The construction is commanded forward, and flies through the Dragon's mouth on cue. It's a significantly powerful release, and as the projectile crashes into the wall, there's a giant crack running along the frame. 

Of course, the simpleton that observed would call this a success. 'Course, there were still many issues. Moreso the fact that Sanoke still had to work on sending one 'Bullet' at a time. And of course, at mastery, he should be able to fire them in rapid succession.* - Fri Oct 16 16:37:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh. I just need some battle experience. You can use your full power, I'll mix it up with close-quarter-combat. - Fri Oct 16 17:24:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: You can begin... - Fri Oct 16 17:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) chuckles.

"Alright. I know you're a speedster, so I'll have to try and keep my distance. Not going to lie, your swordsmanship might give be trouble in terms of reaction," Sanoke admits. Wasting no time, his chakra is built up, all in the form of a single seal. "Let's get this started."

He takes a quicjk step back, giving the much needed distance in order to enact his plan. Chakra funnels from his core, and on the sixth seal, the jutsu is finally activated. THe ground shakes, giving a brief tremor, before alas, rocks are being flung -- many of which were pretty thick. Of course, given the nature of the spar, and Sanoke's good guy persona, he never once dares to actually attack with lethal intent.

Nevertheless, dozen of stones fly through the skies, aiming to attack Saeza's lower body, while also keeping her at bay. Sure, even if she was speedy and dexterous, it would take a considerable amount of effort to avoid and continue in stride seamlessly, no? "Alright! Boom! Let's see ya handle this!"* - Fri Oct 16 17:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He blinks, grinning from ear to ear all the same. "Wooow! So it's like that? Just completely and utterly make my Earth attack insignficant?Tch, I'll get ya," Sanoke stated, his tone whimiscial, thus suggesting that he honestly didn't care at all. Or rather. . . Didn't take offense. He certainly cared enough to aim and defend himself against the speedy, vampire-kunoichi.

The defensive measures against his attack was impressive, to say the least. . . Although, he blames it moreso on his inexperiece with teh elemental release, as opposed to Saeza's meager skill in chakra flowing!

Regardless, just as she's closing in, Sanoke's taking counter measures himself. From out of nowhere, appendages sproute along his shoulders, crafting four additional new arms. Each of them are capable of grasping a weapon in record time -- One taking a tanto, while the other three simply had Kunai to aid in defensive.  Thus, the foursome move to clash against Saeza, even if she held superior sword play. As a note, none were lethal shots.

As this weapons, the true Sanoke is backtracking again, forming a single seal this time. On cue, the ground terraforms, spawning mud -- which subsequently goes to rush ahead, dosing Saeza completely in the substance. While it may not have been offensive potent in terms of damaging, the momentum was sure to send any able-bodied shinobi skidding back. Who knows, perhaps it being used in unison with the assemble of Kunai and Tanto would prove to be advantagous.

* - Fri Oct 16 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Boom!

The mud lands, perhaps serving as a perfect avenue to gain some breathing room. And in that second? Sanoke took off. It was surreal, even by shinobi standards. In an instant, his speed reached maximum acceleration -- 0 to 100  real quick.

At this point, it was as if he had utilized shunshin, but that was far from the case. Instead, his body blurs in a semi-circular fashion, moving towards the south and a ways away from the speeding Kenjutsu specialist. Assuming success, friction forces his body to come to a hault, hopefully with a considerable amount of distance away from the vamparic warrior. 

"Not going to lie. You're damn good with that sword! You're going to need to teach me a thing or two about swordplay in the future," the teen stated, his tone cheerful and full of wonder as per usual. Despite his tone, however, the battle is taken with the utmost seriousness. From start to finish, he's examining the woman's form, looking for any signs of weakness or flaw within her battle stance. 

Wasting no time, he descends into a slight crouch and releases a singular scroll. Chakra funnels along it's frame, forcing the seal written upon it before hand to activate. In no time, speedy bombs are being rolled along the ground, their strength held back considerably as a result of this being a friendly spar. As they roll, it seems the path was in line to be in Saeza's direction. Upon even getting close, the 'bombs' or 'mines' combust, releasing it's explosive nature.

Taking advantage of such, a single seal forms, prompting wires to speed from underneath the shinobi's sleeve, in efforts to capture the vampire by the legs.* - Fri Oct 16 18:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Was that all she wrote? The wires continue to speed out, decidedly wrapping around Saeza's arms and legs, keeping her bond.

"Geez. . .You lost to such a low-leveled technique? Geez. . ." Sanoke complains, as the adrenaline rush from before was subsequently setting. He had hoped he'd be able to get more out of the training.* - Fri Oct 16 18:37:26 2015
