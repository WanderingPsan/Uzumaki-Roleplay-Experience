<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He takes a step to the side. 

A hand clamps down, grabbing the woman by the ankles. Once a grip was firmly established, Sanoke gets around to spinning, taking Momura for a thorough ride!

"Hey! You're pretty good, you know?" He said towards the now spinning female. After a revolution or two, the grip is relinquished, allowing her to go coursing through the air.

"And s'up, Fuji. How goes life? I saw your wife earlier. And man. . . she really let herself go."* - Sat Nov  7 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shook his head.

The attack could have been potentially fatal. Sanoke knew damn well that his body wasn't exactly the most durable-- and thus, he makes no effort to endure or take. Instead, he times the blow just right.

As it's coming in, his frame pivots out. Simultaneously with the evasion, a kick is delivered right towards her ass -- it'd hurt. "No! You have to earn your hit! -- And wow, Fuji. Congrats, I didn't know she was pregnant!"* - Sat Nov  7 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: I-If hanai were here..H-He'd probably h-hurt this guy..a-alot.. - Sat Nov  7 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) visibly blushes upon seeing the sight.

A hand rises, covering his nose and hiding the flustered features. "G-gah. Good thing Mirai isn't here-- Bulllets!" For just a second, his un-nerved nature seemed to have been a distraction. Thankfully, responding to a crisis was Sanoke's expertise. A kunai comes, swiping at a bullet, while his body again blurred frm the scene.

"Phew. . that was close."* - Sat Nov  7 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: Y-You're f-fast.. - Sat Nov  7 03:20:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) flicks his nose.

"Haha, yeah. Not many people can land a hit on me."* - Sat Nov  7 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: To really endanger me. You need fast hands, or the ability to send area-of-effects. - Sat Nov  7 03:22:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) proceeded off, until he heard Momura's commentary.

A sly smirk develops, as the girl took the bait.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) takes a step back.

The second Rikuna is within distance, Sanoke's body blurs, running literal circles around the Inuzuka. On the second rrevolution, he swipes his palm towards the left, aiming to land a cross chop along the ribs.

It was significantly powerful, given Sanoke's trained ability in taijutsu. With ease, the attack held potential to literally send Rikuna flying back in recoil. And clearly, this wasn't a physical power house being dealt with.* - Sat Nov  7 04:28:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||And shit is suddenly getting real for no reason.

Rather than sitting around like a bum, Sanoke sprung into action. His body was literally flickering in and out, and on the last, he had handed just east of Marissa. Speedily, his body twirls, sending a kick onto Marissa's shin as she's distracted attacking Mizora.

Hit or miss, the shinobi moves onto the next course of action.

Taking a hand onto his scroll and unleashing it's contents. Cloth shoots outward, and if struck, Marissa would be restrained. "Guys. . Guys! Let's take it easy! We don't have to be so violent all the time, you know? So what's going on?"* - Sat Nov  7 09:16:48 2015

Of course, as she's partially revealed, Sanoke forms yet another handsign, this time sending a swirl of Wires forward, wrapping about her frame.

From there, the rest is uprooted -- that is if Yan doesn't try to cockblock.

"Uh. . .What's up? -- Oh God. What did she do?" the teen stated with a frown. He had no intent on seeing this become Bloody Sand.* - Sat Nov  7 09:40:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) approached Hassan from the side, entering a kneel.

"I can understand. . . that Mizora has probably done some bone-headed things. But right now, even before I've wed -- she is family. I'll take punishment to atone for her sins!" He declares, before quieting.

For the initial comment, Sanoke's gaze remained onto the floor.

Once speaking up again, the teen looked ahead. "In addition. . . There is a tattoo on her neck -- I can tell just from looking, it's meant to seal speech. Concerning information. . . as there must be a reason her speech is sealed, yes? One that may be relevant to Suna." He tries to reason with the natural militaristic mind that Hassan possessed. If he didn't care out of human goodness, maybe he'd care if there was some information to be earned.* - Sat Nov  7 09:50:56 2015

He claps his hands together, forming or summoning an ink bottle and ink brush. It's set onto the table, before eventually being dabbed with with the brush -- the edge absorbing Ink like a sponge. Upon gathering enough of the contents, Sanoke moves to work on the seal. He even removed some article of clothing if necessary, but kept Mizora generally decent.

His wrists lashed up and down, jotting several, elongated seals onto her flesh. It stretched a good distance, before eventually being dried. Upon crafting the counter seal -- which was only formed after a thorough examination of the Root Sealing.

He understood where Hassan came from. There wasn't a doubt in his mind -- Hassan had some kindness. But to be a true leader, a true -kage- required that one lose a smidget of their humanity.

Reflecting on this, the teen nodded again. Sanoke understood all too well -- as it was this ideology that forced him to abandon desire to be Mizukage.

"Alright. . is that all of the information you have to share?" Assuming yes, he turns with a disappointed, yet sympathetic gaze.* - Sat Nov  7 10:54:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) sighs.

"It's okay that you're sorry, but you have to be more careful. You understand the responsibility you have for your village. That said. . . apology accepted," Sanoke replies. Yes, he wasn't a total kid all the time.

Quickly, his attention shifts back onto Kana-- surprised. 

"YO! You can summon a turtle of that calibar that fast? It took me like two months to get that good. It was at that point when Genbi taught me to summon Ganba."* - Sat Nov  7 11:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gives a wave to Mizora.

"Be safe. And don't act like a stranger," he says with a thumbs up. "Someday, you might be calling me cousin," Sanoke replies, reminding her of the fact that  he intended to marry into the family.

After a brief snicker, his eyes fall back onto Kana. The smile dulls, soon after developing into a smug quality to it.

"Tch. I mean, yeah you're smart. But don't get cocky!" He pokes the red-head right on the forehead.* - Sat Nov  7 11:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods.

"Right. Unfortunately for ya, I've been neglectant of my training, heh. But I can still help you develop further. Want to see my next summon?" He asks in a teasing form.* - Sat Nov  7 11:32:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: No. - Sat Nov  7 11:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) cups hands together.

"C'mon. Y'know you want to."* - Sat Nov  7 11:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: No. - Sat Nov  7 11:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Fine. Guess ya don't wanna see it. - Sat Nov  7 11:48:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Fine. - Sat Nov  7 11:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) thinks: Guess I'll go find Tetsumi. - Sat Nov  7 11:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) folded his arms.

"Come back to me when you want to cooperate!" Hmph. The nerve of that girl, not cheering him on. With that, he poofs off.* - Sat Nov  7 11:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ceases his Shunshin.

"Hahaa! Finally, I knew you'd crack, heh," Sanoke declared proudly. The wind swayed omniously, forcing his clothes and hair to sway. It was if he was about to partake in deadly combat, with his most hated rival. But alas. . . this was just training, yo.

He pulls out a thumb, and bites it. Easily, it breaks through skin, drawing the necessary blood required as a sacrifice. After going through five seals, he presses a hand onto the ground.

"I call forth the King of Beasts! LOOORRRDD! GANNNNBAAA!" Immediately, blackened sealing formulas rushed along the surface. It stretched a good seven feet from across the area, until reaching it's end point. From there, a plume of smoke erupts. The eruption so powerful that it sprouted yet another gust, one so fierce that it even caused the grainy sand to spin over in recoil.

But at last, as it cleared, Sanoke stood ontop of a rock-like entity.No, this was a shell! At the bottom, a giant, 6'5 turtle -- this being while on all fours -- laid on the floor. "Geez. . .It's been a while since ya had to summon me, Sano. What gives?"
* - Sat Nov  7 12:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: So . . ? - Sat Nov  7 12:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looked down towards Ganba.

"Hrm? Oh! Hi! I'm sorry I haven't spoken to you in a lot. But I want to teach this girl--"

"Okay. Ya borin' me now," the reptilian replies sharply. He settles down, closing his eyes to get some snooze. 

"Alright! To do this is simple. I'm going to give you a vial of Ganba's blood. The process is just you getting to be familiarized with Ganba's genetic code, and him getting a feel for your chakra. Once done, you'll have to focus on building up a large enough gathering of energy and inducing the jutsu, while searching out specifically for Ganba," Sanoke notes.

A hand is held out, forcing the scroll to be summoned. It's a tool that was esspecially defined or refined for the purpose. "And this will be your tool -- so that you'll have a good enough benchmark.  Ignore most of what I said, I just want you to focus or learn how to build up the desired energy without exhausting yourself, and focusing it towards one area of space. "

As the scroll is unwinded, you'd see nothing but a wide, blank page. It had range of two feet from all direction. Eventually, the scroll is settled onto the floor. "The 'scroll' works by specifically being sensitive to your chakra. I've had it rigged with Fuuinto to react accordingly. What you want to do is gather a condense or compact amount of energy, and release it from the center of your palm. Make sure your hand remains firmly onto the sheet. Anywho. . . As you do that, a blacken seal will appear and stretch out in accordance to how much energy you can successfully pool into one, uniformed or specific area. The better you are, the further and fast the seal spreads."

Simple instructions, yeah?* - Sat Nov  7 12:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: . . . . - Sat Nov  7 12:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: What? - Sat Nov  7 12:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) poofs into the area.

"Lera. What's up?"* - Sat Nov  7 12:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hey Sanoke. - Sat Nov  7 12:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I haven't seen you in a while... - Sat Nov  7 12:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gives a glance to Kiyoko. A brief wave is given, before attention falls back onto Lera.

"I heard what happened. Is it true the feller behind all the chaos was killed?"* - Sat Nov  7 13:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ortho...no he is alive... - Sat Nov  7 13:01:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I survived it seems...because he had a change of heart... - Sat Nov  7 13:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . A change of heart? So there's good in him. - Sat Nov  7 13:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) clenches his fist.

"But. . Violet. . . Kirie. . ."* - Sat Nov  7 13:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: They were my friends. - Sat Nov  7 13:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ....Yes I know. - Sat Nov  7 13:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) pats on the shoulder.

"But no worries. I'll find him in time. And he'll have to answer for his crimes," Sanoke declared with a nod.* - Sat Nov  7 13:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: How are things back in Kiri now? - Sat Nov  7 13:03:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: --New? What. . . - Sat Nov  7 13:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And besides Ortho's attempt on my life, no. - Sat Nov  7 13:04:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Something to investigate. I'll do something about it. I get the feeling if I go to Kiri bluntly, I'll be  attacked. - Sat Nov  7 13:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No, I don't think so. - Sat Nov  7 13:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Things are quite stable now. - Sat Nov  7 13:05:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: All of that just went over my head. - Sat Nov  7 13:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm as well as I can be. - Sat Nov  7 13:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm, well alright. Stick around Suna a little longer. Things need to settle down in this world first. - Sat Nov  7 13:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shifts gaze to Kiyoko.

"And who is this? Your sister or something?"* - Sat Nov  7 13:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm? No, just someone I met recently. - Sat Nov  7 13:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) extends a hand -- then stops.

"Oh. Ninja Protocol. I never shake the hands of strangers, ever since Irealize people could place seals on you via touch," he admits.

Instead, Sanoke twirls to be front and center. 

"Name's Sanoke, though. Nice to meetcha."* - Sat Nov  7 13:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gives a gander to the headband.

"Oh, a Sunagakure shinobi. Neat. Ya just graduated?" -- He turns to give a glance to Ghost Kilm. Yes man, this was the eye of God. They could see into Limbo. ". . The hell . .. "

The male muttered to himself in disbelief. Eventually, Sanoke manages to convince himself that he's merely eaten a bad Mango or something.

"What type of shinobi are ya?"* - Sat Nov  7 13:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: This man. . Trying to gauge at my eyes? No. . Just paranoia. - Sat Nov  7 13:20:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: One is sometimes busy. The other wants to be -paid- to heal. - Sat Nov  7 13:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Uh. . What else. Um, another is plain not in the area. Bryson is pretty neat, though. But he isn't even a real medic, he's a priest. - Sat Nov  7 13:25:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shifts his gaze towards the side.

He looked uncomfortable for some reason. As Kilm tries to enter, he'd find that Sanoke can't be possessed.* - Sat Nov  7 13:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Eztra? - Sat Nov  7 13:27:40 2015

He does a hand motion, gesturing for the damn dead man to move.* - Sat Nov  7 13:29:23 2015
