Ceases with his seals abruptly after going with through a few.

"Hiding underground ain't going to help ya!"

The second she moved underground, Sanoke back to sprint up the wall! It didn't matter if you were underground if the opponent could simply get off the floor! He'd wait for her to re-emerged, and assuming she had, the warrior grasped a scroll.

He unleashes the seal, setting off traps to pepper the region with wooden and blunt weapons. They'd hurt for sure, if caught. Assuming things went according to plan, Sano plants a foot back onto the floor, a giant smile being worn. "You're pretty good, y'know?"* - Sat Dec  5 22:27:50 2015

Boom!

Right in the belly! The attack sends Sanoke's frame flying forward, crashing into the wall! 

Then. . . Poof! Smoke creeps up, revealing another version of the Kazekage. Mud splattered onto the wall's surface, making it evident that the ol' substitution had been employed.

Appearing outside of Mumura's peripherals, Sanoke and the two clones remaining each fire off yet another round of Mud Silhouette. They aim to paint whatever portions of the kunoichi's body was evident, and perhaps deal moderate concussive damage. It'd be enough to give minor sores at the most.

"Substitution! Bwahaha!"* - Sat Dec  5 22:32:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) wasn't exactly startled. 

Although, the fact that Momura could literally force the ground to tremor under the might of her foot was impressive to say the least.  Regardless, the terrain had been set, allowing for the usage of one of Sanoke's more potent skills.

Just as Momura moves, so does he. He forms three seals quickly, spawning a Dragon Maw from the muddy flooring. From it's gullet, various bowling ball-sized muddy cannons rush ahead, intent on keeping  the taijutsu specialist at bay. In addition, the clones got in on the mix as well, each one sending more muddy streams to hopefully force the woman into submission.

Given his clear superority, the mud bullets break through the shell with ease. 

Naturally, the clones shouted out, making it clear that Momura was trying the same ol' tired strategy of sneaking underneath the ground. Nevertheless, it goes all the same.

The second she crept out, Sanoke was already moving to evade. he haymaker misses -bad-, catching nothing but wind. At close range, a single seal isformed, and with that, a bombardment of wind bullets, each one dishing out vast concussive damage. The Doton clones chase after, and aim to tackle the woman amidst the process!

He applies the finishing touches, sending more wires to bind Momura while she was down. A foot light places onto her back or whatever, keeping the woman tethered to the floor.

Before long, Sanoke had finally found time to venture off into his office. Once in place, blood is drawn via a bite. He conjures up a reptilian beast, and gives the instructions to have himself reverse summoned.

In no time, Sanoke's body becomes enveloped in smog, hiding his figure and thus transferring his body along countless kilometers. As ti clears, he looks, admiring the beautiful terrain of the scenery. Indeed, the turtle oasis was quite pleasing to the eyes.Coincidentally, the boy had been spawned on the beach.

Waves flushed onto the land, displace lavender sand. 

"Wow! So. . I'm finally here! Didn't expect this place to be so empty, though. . ." A quick survey of the scenery showed that none of the Chelonian inhabitants had manuevered to partake in the luxurious or relaxing effects of the beach area. Regardless, Sano had come for a reason and began to speed off into the distance, his eyes moving in a swivel.

As with any villages or civilization, numerous buildings or huts surrounded the landscape. They were the perfect platform for the shinobi. Using the structures as a crutch, he's easily gliding through the skies, leaping from building to building in search of his turtle intructor. The centuries old, Mr. Genbi! It was a difficult task, but after half an hour of speeding around -- his velocity enough to kickstart violent gusts, and even through less creatures around -- the desired entity had been located!

Right in the hot springs, no less.

The small, two feet turtle sat along a steaming, bubbling pool of sacred water. His flippers were dipped in, and a smoking pipe was clung to his mouth. Casually, Genbi puffed out smoke, clearly enjoying the leisurely time. ". . Ah. . It feels good bein' able to finally relax. . .These young whippersnappers are such a hass--"

"HI! I CAME FOR TRAINING!" Sanoke proclaims, suddenly appearing out of the thinned air. Even as he traveled so swiftly, the male hardly took any time to apply friction in order to cease the momentum. Naturally, due to his loud-mouthed nature, his teacher was routinely startled, so much that the reptilian falls over into the steaming pool.

"YOUCH!" howled the elderly instructor as the heat boiled against his frame. Like a missile, he flings through the water and crashes against the wall, every inch of his body fidgeting around in pain.

"S-Sano. . .OI. . What's the matter with you? You nearly gave me a heart attack! What -- ANd where is your turtle shell, boy?" There's a low growl, before Genbi himself flickered, erasing any thought that him being a turtle meant a lack of velocity. A hand or flipper presed against the silver-haired Kage's back, and thus summoned an even heavier turtle shell! In recoil, Sanoke doubles over, clearly havintg trouble getting used to the immense weight.

"I-I came for training. . . I can summon Ganatora now!-- Even if I'm not that good. . ." 

A scoff is given, rebuffintg that claim. What mattered is whether or not Sanoke had mastered the jutsu -- at least in Genbi's eyes. It was the simple procedure of being a true sennin. To learn much of the mystical techniques that the cove held dear, one had to master their affinity with the turtle/tortoise kind. With a scrunitizing gaze, the elder speaks. "You've only gotten up to 'Boss Status'. And that's with you being with else for over half a decade! Sure, you've done well with the training and gotten considerably more strong. . . But it isn't enough. . "

"--However. Given how much good you've done, I'm welling to aid you in the progression of your summoning technique. It's necessary, wsince if you can't even mastery these principles, you'll never be able to draw out the necessary chakra and pin point it properly for space-time techniques, or even our special stances or power aiding manuevers."

Diligently, Sanoke took a seat within the hot springs -- which were Genbi's privatized areas. His legs folded against one another, and his mind managed to put the climate aside. Both eyes focused onto the elder turtle. "I understand! Can we practice with things that's not a summon, though?"

"Bah. . ALright. I'll teach you a 'Turtle Skin' technique. Or so it's nicknamed. It's a process that involves 'Yang CHakra' to manipulate your own body to harden the cell tissues. It's different from Doton release being that it's shifting the wall your body is composed -- naturally this takes a vast amount of chakra, and exhausts physical energy, but temporarily you'll be much more powerfull. . "

Cue the long-winded explanation of the jutsu. Given Sano's inexperience, he's not quite able to grasp the concepts of the jutsu even as the specifics are detailed. In the end, his chakra wanes and stamina is brought down to all-times lows. Figuring that enough time had been wasted, the duo subsequently make way to the special training cave.

In this area, time was again alter or at least the perception. In addition, one grew more easily capable of conjuring up the native animals or specimens. Using this advantage, chakra is gathered up, and repeatily used to manipulate the space time continuum. The air waves distort, and with the smoke, Ganatora is called ahead from his slumber. 

Lazily, the gigantic beast laid along the floor, already realizing that the sequence was all about. Still, Sanoke wasn't going to stop with a one and done. Already feeling the fatigue, Genbi is beckoned forward to transfer chakra, as well as provide specialized healing pills. THey were much like 'soldier pills' in a way, but the revitalization was a lot more potent, and lasted longer than usual.

And thus, for hours on end, the Kage continues with his training process. Each time, he focuses on applying less chakra for the same sequence or reward--- which was far more difficult than it seemed. His control naturally was being refined, but i nthe end, Sanoke still suffered on the beginning process, and that was just summoning or buildingu p the correct quantity of chakra from the beginning.

After this, the boy returns to the front, and gives farewell to the teacher. His body flickers back to the Kage Manor as the summoning is canceled.* - Sun Dec  6 03:07:44 2015

As a note, the area was terroformed just as with the last arena.

Albeit, no walls had been erected, just an empty  plain. Sand was of course on the floor, but it was mixed in with soil as well to grant Momura the abilit to use her ninjutsu. In addition, at the south and northern end of the arena, two wide and deep pools of liquids were left for those that practiced Suiton ninjutsu.

"C'mon Momura. . . Be resourceful!"

But sadly, it seems the battle was coming to a premature end. Both of the teen's body spinned around rapidly, and gravity dictated that they go on a spiral path to the floor.

"---Holy shit! Hideo can useFuuton?!" -- And just before that, the turtle shell fell off. The collision shook the ground to the very core, certainly garnering the attention of the stand-in Kazekage. He practically leaps off his damn ass due to the excitement boiling up within his shaking body.

"Folks! I think we got a fight on our hand! --I'm the one who gave him the turtle shell, mhm.."* - Sun Dec  6 06:28:16 2015

"They're taking it underground, haha! -- And from the looks of things, Izanami is lighting it up!

Despite the tough topics, the battle at hand was still -very- entertaining.

"I think Hiroshigot it! There's no way Izanami--"

Swoosh! Then comes the Fire Propulsion. With ease, the flames moves her small frame, sending it speeding to the left. Her form was practically unviewable as it whisked right through the skies and out of harm's way.

"Are they just warming up or something?. . " He pondered to himself.

"Hey, guys! Get serious!" the male declared excitedly as the battle ran it's course. It had everything thus far. . . From weapon'sclashing, to fierce elemental techniques being unleashed.

He was standing on his feet, hollering with clear excitement. Once more, Izanami's toddler form had zipped on through the skies, diligently moving in a blur to reach Hideo's rear. And in that instant, chakra flowed along her hand,illuminating the immediately area.

". . .Woah! A flam-- And Hideo goes to counter!--Then Izanami moves to counter the counter! Wow!"

So far, he's seen enough to be thoroughly impressed with both of the shinobis' battle tactics. Each movement was noted by Sanoke, and marked down for future reference. But all the same. . . something was bugging him.* - Sun Dec  6 07:17:45 2015
