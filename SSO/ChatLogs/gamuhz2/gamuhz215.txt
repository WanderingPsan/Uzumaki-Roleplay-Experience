<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) tilts his head.

"Not really. It's like the dude placed some curse on ya," Sanoke says jokingly.

"But it's good that you found love. Love is a powerful emotion, it can make you do amazing things," he replies with a simper. It was good to see that Lera had presumably moved beyond her sadness for Seisuke's demise.

"Anywho. Let's get to work."* - Sun Oct 11 09:01:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . .What? Sounds pretty high-leveled. - Sun Oct 11 09:03:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: <*Scratches his head*> I mean I'll try. Don't be disappointed if I can't do it. - Sun Oct 11 09:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Kay~ - Sun Oct 11 09:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) listened to the long-winded explanation that would have logically occured.

Chakra. . . Despite it's supernatural nature, had -some- form of logic. Everything done with it had a specific and precise process, believe it or not. It was for this reason that skills were often broken into rankings -- which was a rudimentary, often inaccurate system, mind you. Even if two things were dubbed 'A-ranked' one skill could certainly be more difficult to accomplish than the other.

This brings us to the latest point, the Doton-based technique dubbed 'Earth Style: Earth Dragon Bomb'. Considering Sanoke's nature as a rookie elementalist, it was clear to say that the boy was gonig to struggle mightily with reproducing the effects as demonstrated. At least as depicted by the accomplished elementalist in her own right -- Lera.  Thankfully, there weren't many seals to commit to memory.

Prior to actually working on the jutsu himself, Sanoke opts to make things easier for himself. Chakra rushes over the area, immediately producing mud along the typically driied terrain. Thick, slushy, earth-based materials runs over the land, and makes the environment suitable for the attempt at a B-ranked technique. .. Not that it'd ever be usable for combat until he was proficient enough with the elemental affinity itself. This was an aspect of ninjutsu that the Turtle Summoner clearly struggled with it, even as he was assisting by the reptilians themselves -- as they were creatures normally proficiency with Suiton and Doton.

Once the area had been conditioned, he begins with the formation the  of a trio of hand signs, Doton energy is built up at his core, and pumped on down towards his feet. It flows wildly, as the teen still held very little control over his nature-based chakras in general. Regardless, as it fell onto the ground, that's when Sanoke made his move. Staying true to the elemental affinity's nature, it goes to manipulate the ground itself. 

The muddy consistency takes form. The ground is shifting, gaining a more defined shape as the liquidy earth morphs. It slushes, releasing chafing sounds along the area, before eventually taking shape. The shaping in general was much like Lera's. . . Well, if you squinted real hard and turned your head to the side. Although, in general, it was about one-tenth the size, and looked like a blind five year old had managed to put this entire thing together.

Still working, Sanoke adds the second portion, which uses the mud source to sends spheres. Rather than cannonball-esque projectiles, bits of mud -- at about the size of a pebble -- comes trickling out. It doesn't go far, losing momentum after a meager nine inches. Defeated, the teen sits onto the mud.'

"This shit is hard. . "* - Sun Oct 11 09:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Sun Oct 11 09:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Keep going~ You'll get it. - Sun Oct 11 09:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) |He'd pick back up from the start. Chakra is swirling around his frame once more and being used to manipulate the earth around the area. By now, Sanoke wasn't even close enough to being capable of spawning earth from his chakra alone,. thus he's a bit dependent on being in the general vicinity.

The ground again quakes, and as a mud dragon is forming -- it dies swiftly, making his construction reverting back to formless mud. It crafts a slight hill, before the liquidy state forces the substance to spread out. Disappointed, Sanoke grunts, and repeats his training endlessly. On the twelvth attempt, the boy has had enough and opts to place the exercise on recess for the time being. 

"Oi. . Whatever. How did you and this Sumusu guy meet?"* - Sun Oct 11 09:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blinks.

He tilts his head, eying Jenna as she spoke. "Probably hearts. Like those animes an' shit," Sanoke says with a smile. He flashes a thumbs up, relieved that Lera had found a new boyfriend to show her love and affection too. Although, Susumu was a tad bit young.

After some thought, he'd scratch his head. .. pondering deeply on the fact.

"Eh. I'll look into it, I guess?"* - Sun Oct 11 10:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Sounds crazy. . .But eh. In the world of ninjutsu, might be true. - Sun Oct 11 10:05:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) was sitting along the ground, reading yet another of many jutsu scrolls.

The male had to develop an actual elemental game, simply because it appeared as if everyone else could do it. If he was going to achieve the dream and attain the status of sagehood, Sanoke was definitely going to require a vast skillset -- lest he be unable to use the teachings to the full capacity. Legs were crossed over one another, as it was a comfortable positioning to enter a state of focus.

Looking over the scroll, the boy goes to refine skill in a basic Doton technique -- Hiding Like a Mole. The bane of is existence, since people used it as if the technique could save them from anything.

Without any seals, his hands pressed against the ground, allowing a flow of chakra to creep downward. With this floor, his energy shifts into the nature type of earth, thus granting Sanoke with the innate ability to manipule the earth itself. The grains of sand, hot and brittle, began to move. Grinded together they were, producing a powder-like state, making it inevitably easier to navigate should the user decide to go underground. What more, Sanoke's chakra enabled him with the ability to dig at a heightened pace, as if he were more of a mole than actual human -- hence the obvious naming.

Through this all, both eyes shift on occasions back to a scroll as it was his guidance on the matter. After each look, the teen notably gets a bit further along with the jutsu, and seems to be more comfortable in performing it. "Hng. . . I hate doing elemental junk."

A gaze cants on over to the arriving youngster, Izanami. "What up, little one."* - Sun Oct 11 11:29:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) arrives on the scene.

He's prepared to really get to work as he hadb een neglecting trainign for the past few days. On cue, both fingers press together, spawning two difrerent shadow clones. The point? To aid in his training endeavors and accelerate the rate in which he could develop his skills.

The jutsu being focused on for the time being was no doubt the 'Hiding Like a Mole' ninjutsu. It was a skill Sanoke had every bit of intent on mastering as it served many strategical value, and could aid in escape or evasion in heated battle. Two 'Sanokes' lower down into a crouch, allowing their hands to find the hot, grainy floors of Sunagakure. 

The energy from his core or stomach pumps out shortly after, attacking the grainy nature of the earth. It's systematically breaking down the grain, reducing it to a powdery enough composition to aid in digging through. His energy was nothing to be trifled with, occasionally clumping up together and gaining enough potency to be visible to the naked eye. The sands continued to shake or move through the sequence as Sanoke practiced the first and perhaps most important portion of the C-ranked technique.

In time, enough of the ground had been assaulted to give the former chunnin an opening to stuff an entire arm into the ground. Briefly, his body propelled forward, practically diving through like the earth was a massive pool of water. Having seeped around, the boy exercises his true ability, allowing him to sense around the ground via magnetic sensing. 

After ten seconds flat, he'd return to the surface, observing Kilm as the male worked on his own art -- which was presumably the manipulation of clones. Clearly, they were of the Suiton nature type, thus garnered no real intrigue from Sanoke, a known Doton elementalist. The dastardly Sunagakure weather seems to have no real adversed effects on the Sasaki in general. He travels a lot, thus allowing him to be resistant to the changes in temperature.* - Sun Oct 11 12:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) was suddenly feeling a bit lazy. At times, the boy was filled with motivation and desire to go beyond his normal limits. . . Yet, time and tiem again, there proved to be occasions where Sanoke quite simply had no will or desire to go further. It was a profound portion of his personality, one that could often be confused with mood swings. Due to this nature, the teen was no stranger to being wacked by his master -- Mr. Genbi -- for his insolence. Thus, for sometime, he lingers around, his minding wandering in thought.

Several different topics are gone over. At some points, he ponders over what his family had been doing. On others? He's reiminsicing over the past, and praying to the gods that be that Noriko -- his mentor -- still lived, even if she was certainly in turmoil due the lost of all her family. 

Finally, the thoughts come full circle, and focuses in on his current love-interest. Mirai Hokuma. She was his drive at times, and thinking of her refills motivation. Getting back onto his feet, Sanoke's hand glazes with chakra strongly, enough to flare and grant a brief illumination over the area as the sun dimmed. He had to be strong, simply in preparation for when someone came to do him harm, if he wasn't equipped to defend himself, it could lead to heartache. But more importantly, he had to be strong enough to protect -her-, after all. . . This dangerous world of shinobi wasn't anything to take lightly.

Upon pressing the chakra cladded mit against the ground, it transforms into the elemental nature type of Doton. Casually, the grains are grinded up, reducing it to even softer sand and leaving him  in perfect condition. But. . .. Sanoke never stopped. Ceasing at that point would just encourage more complacency. What the teen needed now was to expand his horizon, and push his ability beyond what it had been before.

Thus, the chakra continues to leak out, covering a massive radius and eventually burrowing into the ground. Every inch of the radius, which was where the chakra had been siphoned too, is transformed and again, the boy leaps into the ground, swimming about with ease. Considering the recently gained sensory ability, Sanoke is more than able to keep track of the general area.

At last, he speeds on back up, allowing the dirt to cling to his frame. ". . .Alright. .. Keep at it." Again, the boy repeats the process, enduring long periods of repetition. Nevertheless, his mind never gave into the desire to rest up.* - Sun Oct 11 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I've mastered my mizu bunshin. - Sun Oct 11 12:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll go rest for a bit. - Sun Oct 11 12:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gives a glance to the training elementalist.  He can tell that Kilm seems to have much experience in nearly all of the five basic nature types. That fact was impressive, but even then. . . the boy's general ability left much to be desired. 

Those thoughts aside,  Sanoke is right back in the fray, working hard to unlock or at least refine mastery in his latest jutsu. Hiding like a mole. CHakra is flowing around his hand in abundance, building up strength and potency to work once more.

It was this endless repeating process that was going to feed his spirit the needed level of expertise to perform this jutsu with more efficiency while in battle. From his hands, the chakra begins to speed over and attack the surface of the ground itself. The sand is shifted into more sand, but on this occasion, it's powdery and much softer than normal. This release of chi eventually flows even further, wrapping about Sanoke's thin and athletic frame.

Due to the overflow, he's capable of digging a hole in an effective manner, on e that accomodates for the size of his frame. Digging like Timone from the Lion King, the speedster eventually crafts an elaborate tunnel. It goes from one end of the field all the way to the other, end. Towards the end, a lump can be seen developed around the ground, before sand eventually begins to slide down. Strangely, the lump is only expanding, up until Sanoke himself had sped out tthe ground.

He huffs, falling into a kneel shortly after, sweat finally beginning to manifest from his body. The jutsu likely had reached a state of 'mastery.' Although, everyone knew that mastering a technique didn't just take a few simple hours. It was something that took entire careers to achieve to true mastery.

Sitting now, Sanoke looks ahead.* - Sun Oct 11 13:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He honestly didn't know what was going on.

After sprinting back from his daily training session, Sanoke had eventually stopped at the local plaza. Since, y'know. . . This is where most of the people tended to sit around and mingle. In no time at all, taking notice of a new chance for adventure, he speeds off, jumping face first into the boat. After a few hours, the shinobi would have arrived in some strange island, where he eagerly lines up, curious to see if this Fujitora guy had anything cool to offer.

For the most part, Sanoke had truthfully expected this to be like the trivia, usual training sessions that had been held in the past. But it was far from the case. 

Speedily, once the instructions had been given, the snow-haired teen sprints off towards the east-- or so he thought. The island worked wonders, apparently manipulating one's perception, like the wellknown genjutsu, Sly Mind. Instead of moving right, he was going straight head, speeding northwards into the unknown. Despite his fast-paced movements, the boy is as observant as ever.

Due to being capable of seeing chakra, and his sight trained to bolster perception, it remained to be seen if anything on this strange island would pull a fast one on him.* - Sun Oct 11 13:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: roll - Sun Oct 11 13:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ran around in a legitimate circle. He took time to notice this before eventually coming to a stop on the sand. Kneeling, the shinobi can hardly believe his eyes. Had a genjutsu truthfully gotten beyond his watchful gaze?!

"C'mon, Sanoke! How could ya be such a bone head?" Taking a lesson from this, the shinobi forms five seals, eventually forcing out an ensemble of turtles -- four in specific. Three are held in place, while one is layered along the path again. "Alright, Gono. I want ya to stay here, if you even catch wind of me approaching, make sure to tell me to backtrack," the teen declared casually.

Two hands press together, forming the seal and building up enough chakra for a genjutsu release. Although, unbeknowst to the shinobi, this wasn't a genjutsu at all. Rather, it was just the strange effects of the island. 

Before long, the boy blurs off, heading in the same direction as the last. Every few meters, he's placing a turtle to aid in his travels. Hopefully this wasn't illegal, and hopefully. . the turtles weren't as foolish as to let him again fall victim to the island's strange effects on his sense of direction.* - Sun Oct 11 13:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) had advanced further at last.

It seemed his plans from before had worked effectively, as each time Sanoke was backtracking, there existed a reptilian to warn him away. Of course, the boy wasn't as foolish as to continue wasting chakra in order to keep up with his intelligent tactic. For now, he had to trust in his own natural instincts. 

Never once did the turtle sage ever cease in his sprints. Like a flash, his body was speeding on ahead, in hopes of catching up with his peer. Of course, at the rate this was going, doing so didn't seem to be an option. He needed to get an advantage somehow. . . Perhaps a short cut?* - Sun Oct 11 13:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) wasted no time whatsoever.

He hadn't even noticed that he was off course, and fully believed himself to be in the lead. "Tch. . . This is like taking candy from a baby," the boy said to himself with a grin. His head moved in a swivel, granting him with the ability to observe the details of the forest as he ventured along the thick woods, ones that seemed to have a giant tree every damn meter. It was this factor that made navigation all the more difficult. 

Once a clearing had been breached, the youthful and child-like warrior settled his visage onto a stone tablet. Curiosity was a big factor of Sanoke's nature. . . hopefully curiosity didn't kill the cat on this occasion. 

Blurring, he subsequently comes to a stop by the stone object and reaches to touch it. As it's brought up, his eyes scan the writing. . . but appear unable to truly decipher the code.  --- And suddenly, things were about to take an unorthodox and spooky change. 

The wind around the area gained power, prompting a thick and swift gale to come over the area. It sweeps, forcing the trees to sway and the leaves/rubble on the ground to crawl away from the site of the change. ". . . .!" It was like feeling a ghost aiming to take possession of his body. The feeling that suddenly spawned in the area was damp, and bone chilling. 

Sanoke's body rocked back and forth, and his breathing rate shifted. Even with the doujutsu of a god activated, there seemed to be no way possible to detect what was happening. . . 'A key. . .' the mysterious and perhaps provocative entity muttered out, before disappearing just as swift as it had developed. No longer did the boy feel restrained by some invisible demon. After pocketing the stone, he heads off.* - Sun Oct 11 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||What was once bad had now evolved into full blown terror.

The natural world itself gained life! Thankfully, he could see the dark energies surging through the veins themselves. "Shit. . . Maybe I should return this slab-- Naaah. This is treasure, with this, I'll definitely win this god damn tournament! Hehe," he says with a childish laugh, even while in the face of actual danger.

The second roots were being developed, the chunnin kicked off the ground, his speed enough to make himself appear as if he had been using shunshin no jutsu. It leaps ahead, beelining towards of the trees in hopes of activating his Suimen ability to stand upright. Assuming success, he's sprinting off, while hopefully avoiding capture from behind.* - Sun Oct 11 14:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||His leaping antics weren't quite good enough.

Two strands of root speed up, grabbing at his ankles and tossing him right into the skies. Things were getting hectic, that much was for sure. 

"Shit! Shit! Shit! Do I have-- Now's a time if ever!" the boy declared. His eyes flash for a few moments, forcing one of his genetic abilities to activate. From his shoulder, four arms spawn from out of nowhere, two for each side. They're moving to draw items from the scroll -- wind mills with tags attached to make for more deadly strikes.

They're tossed in hopes of cutting through the roots. Likewise, Tantos are drawn by the last two hands, and they're chopping away.

. . .Nevertheless, this leaves Sanoke's original set of appendages. Using one seal, the ground is being manipulated into mud to make his eventual collision less damaging, assuming the cutting endeavors had proved fruitless.* - Sun Oct 11 15:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: So I'd be. - Sun Oct 11 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Eureka!

Upon cutting away with his extra appendages, the shinobi does a flip, landing on the tree and making a quick escape along the woods. A slick smile is worn through this. "Hahaha! Fuck that, this stone is mine. The treasure will forever belong to me. . !"* - Sun Oct 11 15:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: This shit definitely changes a man. - Sun Oct 11 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) continued advancing like normal.* - Sun Oct 11 15:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) continued to move through the forest, sprinting at a ludicrously fast pace.

Admist his movements, a scorpion leaps from out of nowhere, stinging him in the stomach. The attack makes Sanoke cringe in pain, slowing him considerably. . . But the boy knew better than to slow down.

Clutching at his tummy, the boy isn't going to rest up.

"Hng!"* - Sun Oct 11 16:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||The sting isn't -that' bad. It provides constant discomfot.

Regardless, he isn't one to spend much time lingering. Forming a single seal, several clones are spawned -- four in particular. They move with great speed as Sanoke figures one thing. . .Five heads was better than one. 

The point? To gather intel on the nearby environment. Meanwhile, the boy is still jogging around, leaping from tree to tree.* - Sun Oct 11 16:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) continued with his sequence. 

Each of the five Sanokes are still moving around the area, in hopes of mappping it out and thus gaining a better idea of what to do or how to travel. Seconds eventually progress into minutes. By then, the Fuuinjutsu specialist's clones are going to grab a scroll to serve as a beacon -- in the event that they found something of use.* - Sun Oct 11 16:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
Over the course of two days, he and his clones still worked. He could work without rest for the most part, considering his inhuman levels of stamina. By then, the clones disperse and Sanoke speeds ahead.

There's still the wound of the scorpion, yet he can ignore the pain that still lingers even after these days.

While lost, Sanoke inadvertently travels ahead.* - Sun Oct 11 16:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||The boy still appears to be covering quite a bit of ground.

In no time at all, he had completely left behind the previous area and enters a new ecosystem. Still, all is well i nthe land of Sanoke -- apparently. Was he even close to reaching the destination?

"Shit. . How big is this forest?"* - Sun Oct 11 17:00:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) continues ahead. 

None of those changes were relevant to him considering he was so far away. Even as Sanoke changed lanes more often than a drunk driver, he was in the lead and winning without an issue.* - Sun Oct 11 17:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) moves in a circular path.

He's back where he started.* - Sun Oct 11 17:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) continued to move along the paths.

He's pretty content with his positioning, and thus takes the chance to rest.* - Sun Oct 11 18:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) continued to move through the forest. He had no qualms with how long it took, since the prize was presumably going to be worth it.* - Sun Oct 11 18:11:24 2015
