<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) wasn't playing any games. The second Paine stepped forward, Sanoke made his move. He's unrestricted, having not worn a single weighted item at all. THus, his body breaks off into a blur, allowing his frame to circle around the powerful Taijutsu opponent. 

The sheer velocity is enough to kickstart a miniture duststorm, one that inevitably moves around in the same motion that Sanoke had traveled. 

In no time at all, several revolutions had been perfored, until the boy was finally at the girl's right side. "Alright. . .Let's check your ability to react! Shell Shocking Punch!" The teen declared. His right hand speedily cocked back, before being launched ahead, all with the intent on ramming into the taijutsu specialist's ribs. It was risky, y'know. . . Fighting a close-ranged combatant in close-range. However, arrogance and confidence often compelled Sanoke to do some relatively questionable things.* - Sat Oct 31 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||She was relatively nimble, enough to react to Sanoke's own meager attacking prowess. 

Of course, he was no fool, and knew better than to let himself be captured, especially from the apparent power house that was Paine! Before the hand can be caught, Sanoke pulls back, speeding on out -- just out of range from the woman's iron cladded grasp. 

"Pretty good. . . Ican see why you gave that other dude so much trouble!" Sanoke remarked. Always on the move, his legs pivot, moving a diagonal fashion, running towards the west of Paine'scurrent location. With a single seal, a jutsu that he rarely utilized as of late is put into play -- the Wire Bind. Chakra visibly seeps from his forearms, and wraps along the iron irons that were hidden underneath his clothes.

They speed out, whirring through the air and hissing like snakes. The goal? To wrap along the woman's leg, perhaps making things a bit more difficult on her.* - Sat Oct 31 06:31:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Uses of tricks was his little name! . . .Sorta.

The spinning kick on behalf of Paine served as decent detriment or repellant to the incoming wires. Sadly, Sanoke held complete and utter control of the metallic weaponry, thus he can manipulate it further, even as the first kick had been performed. In no time, the ninja wires speed ahead, hoping to enforce that Paine keep up an ongoing flow of movement to avoid being attacked and restrained.

-- Assuming that's a success, the Chunnin does a short leap, propelling his body out of harm's way. 

". . .! Geez, she;'s deceptively strong, I can tell. . . ": the teen murmured to himself in mild distress. The current of wind that had been built up from the physical blow swept over the region, enough that Sanoke's nifty Turtle Trainee cloak fltutered back in recoil. Thinking on his feet, he opts to now attack at mid-range, knowing very well that he could risk being so close since being in hand to hand range wasn't exactly sucide.

With a single seal -- the Bird -- Chakra is manipulated on the insides of his lungs, shapening dozens of spherical, wind-based constructions. In no time, they're expunged, allowing a swift volley of concussive Air Bullets to sway through the atmosphere. On impact with the floor, or any physical object. a loud, thunderous reverbation was certain to echo along the land, -- Making it clear that the ninjutsu was nothing to trifle with.* - Sat Oct 31 06:52:09 2015

He flicks his gaze on over to Mirai -- but knows better than to ignore Paine.* - Sat Oct 31 06:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Impressive!

Yet Paine makes a clear error. Mostly in the fact that she reacts as if the Air Bullets would somehow cease in their floow. The speedy taijutsu specialist inevitably leaps into the air -- albeit, still being easily tracked by Sanoke and his refined perception.

Once more, it was the same ol' trick.

Both hands had come together, forming a pyramid-like shaping. After a brief inhale, the teen is casually expunging a series of condensed wind bullets again, this time moving in a much thicker quantity than beforehand. The goal? To keep the now airbourne woman at bay. Of course, Sanoke was holding back considerably -- as he had been since the beginning of the spar -- as there was no intent in actually leaving the girl broken.

Hit it orm iss, the attack doubles as a cover, allowing the swift warrior to skid towards the south. "Alright. . .Alright! That's good enough."* - Sat Oct 31 07:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looks on with some distress.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) folded his arms.

Shaded eyes keep a steady gaze onto the fast-paced combat. ". . .Geez. . . Hokuma are so deadly in close-ranged combat. To think. . .Both of them are pretty much newblood. Imagine when they've reached the level of experience as regular shinobi," Sanoke pondered to himself in both awe and envy -- A person like him would never be able to emulate this level of elegance, while maintaining such ferociosity.

Due to the nature of his doujutsu, the teen is unable to truthfully read both of the individual's chakra circulatory system, but just based on how their flow fluxuated -- It was obvious that the ethereal highway of energy was being manipulated.

"C'mon, Mirai! Work on attacking the shoulder or other joints! Limit his mobility!" He shouted in hopes of giving the woman some advice. Of course, Sanoke wasn't typically experienced in using the gentle fist, so his advice wasn't all to valuable.* - Sat Oct 31 08:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) could see it clearly.

A proud smirk etched it's way onto Sanoke's maw as he observed the previous Rookie -- Mirai -- Go toe to toe with what was the clan's head. Their hands continued to speedily dance through the air, striking the flesh and of course targetting the fragile tenketsus that were tethered to each living organism's body.

And one thing was apparent.

Mirai was getting the upperhand, slowly but steadily. "So she's come this far. . . C'mon! Put the finishing touches, you got this!"bellowed the energetic teen! Then shit got real.

Invisible to his gaze, it seemed Mirai had entered a no-fun zone. Indeed, each muscle in the chunnin's body tensed up, once Koji's stance shifted, and his comment had reached Sanoke's ear drums. ". . .! Eight Trigram. . .? Where have. . .--" Cue dramatic gasp. Briefly, his mind travels back into the past, recalling precisely when he had last seen the technique, which was evidently as Izutora was effortlessly dispatched.

Would Mirai be able to defend herself?* - Sat Oct 31 08:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Each hit came with an unreal level of speed -- almost faster than Sanoke could keep up with.

In an instant, he's moving, hoping to close the distance. . .But it's too late. By the time, the speedster had reached the area, the battle had come to an end. Luckily, no one had been harmed!

"Mirai. . .! -- Are you okay?" He looks her up and down, examining her form. Nothing popped out as out of place.* - Sat Oct 31 09:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Presuming she had been knocked out, he'd simply speed on in, carrying her in a bridal style as usual.

"Oi. . .Could have just taken the lost, Koji," Sanoke replies with a frown.  His ceruleans eyes trace over the defeated Hokuma's form.

"You did good, Mirai."* - Sat Oct 31 09:09:32 2015

"I'm not much of a killer anyone," he says. A hand swifftly difts towards his back, grasping ahold of his handy-dandy tanto. Swiftly, the warrior's body begins to take off, his body appearing to be nothing short of shunshin -- sometimes even teleportation to the naked eye. 

Amidst the speedy traveling, his hands flickered around, sending precise, timed strikes towards non-lethal areas. This being only for the stronger of the criminals, and more resilient. Given the gradual wearing down, he employs the patent use of his Wirebind, effectively restrainting his opponents without need of excessive force.* - Sun Nov  1 07:31:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) chills.

He waits for an opening.* - Sun Nov  1 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||And suddenly. . He has an opening.

Snickering with mischeviousness, Sanoke's hand tightens around the hilt of his Tanto. Like the flash, he speeds around, channeling chakra along the weapon simultaneously. In time, it finds itself being shifted, gaining the properties of wind and thus forming two opposing currents. Said currents are tightly held together, enough that it can drastically increase the weapon's sharp attributes.

Two swift slashes are performed. One tot he back of the beast's nape, and another just on his upperback. 

A hit and run at it's finest. Seconds later, the shinobi is displaced several paces towards the north.* - Sun Nov  1 08:14:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He's hand enough.

FOr the most part, Sanoke wasn't particularly a murderous or cruel person. However, Tribus ran the risk of nothing only endangering the Kazekage, but Tetsumi as well as the numerous other brave men and women that served Sunagakure.

Without another thought, chakra pulsed through his body and fell onto the ground. Thin, yet sharpened pillars spike up the ground, impaling or penetrating numerous parts of the beast's body. "Yuck. . . Did you really have to be so crude?" the teen muttered towards Hassan's shameless strikes.

"I'd use wirebind. But don't think it can hold him. On a side note. . . Tetsumi! Uh. . .What's wrong with your skin? It looks. . . very sandy."* - Sun Nov  1 10:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: If that can't take him out, I got another trick if you guys can hold him in place. - Sun Nov  1 10:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: It's due punishment. - Sun Nov  1 10:33:36 2015
