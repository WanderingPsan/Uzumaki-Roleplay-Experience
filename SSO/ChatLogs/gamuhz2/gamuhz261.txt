"Because. . She's my wife basically. If she doesn't want to share my DNA, that's her god-given right. I told you, she's very possessive of me," Sanoke retorts sheepishly. He averts his gaze, to avoid the bone-chilling glare.

"She can love you, for sure. But she -loves- me, it's why she acts so crazy. And it's why she could say 'no' so quickly."* - Fri Dec  4 04:26:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Eh. - Fri Dec  4 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: But yeah, sorry that things didn't work out. We're still friends, if that was ever in doubt. - Fri Dec  4 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You sure there's no way I can make you feel better? - Fri Dec  4 04:57:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I mean, I'd arrange for the three of us -- maybe four, if Lera wants in. But that'd hate you. - Fri Dec  4 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: We can -still- hang out, you know. - Fri Dec  4 05:07:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) exhales.

He was content, given that he was pretty fond of Kiyoko. "Good! So. . Um. . " the teen begins, scratching his head sheepishly. A hopeful gaze falls onto the medic's form once more. "Are we still good for the sweets?"* - Fri Dec  4 05:19:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Nooooo! Wow, I was really looking forward to that. You look like someone who is a great cook. - Fri Dec  4 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: -- And you put me between a rock in a hardplace. I get why she reacted like that. But that doesn't mean I didn't care or anything.. - Fri Dec  4 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Don't try to make me choose between one of my best friends, and my fiance. - Fri Dec  4 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: That isn't fair, you know that. - Fri Dec  4 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: See that's the thing. - Fri Dec  4 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: She makes you choose. - Fri Dec  4 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: That isn't what I was asking for. - Fri Dec  4 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I was asking for you to stand up for your friend even if it's your fiance saying terrible things, not allowing -anyone- you care about to be talked about that way. - Fri Dec  4 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I know you are a better person than this. - Fri Dec  4 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: That's the thing. For the moment, I -didn't- see anything wrong. She reserves that right, she and I are one. Maybe it was a bit harsh to say you weren't my bestfriend. - Fri Dec  4 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: But I get what she meant. - Fri Dec  4 05:25:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) sighs.

"This is like having a second wife. I'm wrong no matter what," he pondered to himself. 

"Alright then. We should totally hang later. Okay? I won't take no for an answer!"* - Fri Dec  4 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Okay. - Fri Dec  4 05:28:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) smiled brightly.

He gives a thumbs up. "Good! That's all I ask! Mmm, and if you ever think of something, I'll owe you a favor. Okay? Just don't get crazy."

After getting an answer, the male briskly walks off.* - Fri Dec  4 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Okay.... - Fri Dec  4 05:34:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's impractical, though. - Fri Dec  4 05:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: In a battle ground, that'd leave you open for assault. - Fri Dec  4 05:54:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gives a glance to Aoi, and practically gasps!

"Wow, you're very quiet, you know? And the last day or two have been quiet. But tomorrow, the final part of the chunnins begin. -- Why didn't you join, by the way? You may have done well."* - Fri Dec  4 06:15:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) tosses a scroll onto the floor.

It unseals a small boulder. One that was about three feet in diameter. THe stone didn't seem to be too sturdy, but no weak either.* - Fri Dec  4 06:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Punch....a rock? - Fri Dec  4 06:24:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) wore an incredulous, mystified gaze.

His eyes were formed into slits, and mouth formed into a giant O. . .

Shortly after, the Kazekage nervously chuckles, as if pretending he wasn't majorly disappointed. "Woah. . Um. Not bad? You got a lot of potential, I can smell it! You just lack the confidence to draw it out."

Nod, nod.* - Fri Dec  4 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I even think I saw the rock like crack! For a second.. - Fri Dec  4 06:29:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Uhmm....Maybe that girl would like a spar.... - Fri Dec  4 06:34:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's a little odd that you went into the profession, but you can't throw a punch. - Fri Dec  4 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh! And sure, we can tango. - Fri Dec  4 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Cool! A real challenge other than Kinami. - Fri Dec  4 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) forms a single seal. It's cross-like.

Smoke sprouts, and once it settles, a clone is spawned. "I doubt it'd be much of a challenge. Shadow Clone are weak."* - Fri Dec  4 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Y'know. It's very hard to get stronger if you refuse to spar. - Fri Dec  4 06:35:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Girl with the red-hair. What's your name? If you don't spar, how do you even practice your taijutsu? Punching rocks, and shadow sparring can't logically be good enough. - Fri Dec  4 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: I have methods, trust me. My name is Aoi. - Fri Dec  4 06:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looks pleasantly surprised.

"Oh! You use weights too?! Haha, not bad!"

And then Geo feels the need to immpress even more. Immediately, Clone-Noke catches wind of the taijutsu's specialist relatively meager levels of speed. But that wasn't what was paid attention to..

Given the Rinnegan eye, the  Kazekage was more than capable of detecting the activation of the first gate, which was exceptionally common in Sunagakure. Still, using his speed advantage, Sanoke pushes towards the right, just barely being out of range and evading the incoming grappling.

A hand claps together, producing chakra that speeds on into the air currents and manipulates it. With ease, a single uniformed gale sweeps through, aiming to keep Geo Dude at bay. Assuming success, the clone dances back with a smile.

"I dont' think my clone could win in taijutsu one on one."* - Fri Dec  4 06:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: And nice to meet ya, Aoi. - Fri Dec  4 06:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Nice to meet you as well. - Fri Dec  4 06:59:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
Despite being a mere clone, Sanoke #2 still held the advantage in terms of sheer agility. Alas, given how little Sanoke was trying, Geo likely was capable of resisting the bulk of the Gale's effects.

Still, just as Geo Dude is moving through the gale, the Kage Bunshin's hand clap back into a single seal. The almighty Bird handsign, a symbol notorious for it's utilization in Wind-based techniques.

With a quick inhale and exhale, the fuuinjutsu specialist is capable of release a volley of wind pellets. They each move in random directs, intent on disrupting Geo's approach, and perhaps giving Sanoke at least some breathing room. Had that not worked? The clone is struck along the knee and quickly disperses.

"Hng. I don't think my clone can beat ya. I'm strong, but not -that- strong!"* - Fri Dec  4 07:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: On a side note, Aoi. You should tr to talk to people more. It'll help you be less bored. - Fri Dec  4 07:17:45 2015

"The Daimyo as bugging me to watch his second wife's kids. Think you can baby sit them? They'll be pickedu p in like an hour."

A scroll is tossed to detail the mission. The children were in his manor.* - Fri Dec  4 07:19:28 2015

"I'm okay with taijutsu, of course. I mainly use tantos for close-ranged combat. But yes, my speciality is ninjutsu. Mainly with sealing techniques," Sanoke admits casually.

"You're pretty strong, though. You could have kicked a lot of ass in that chunnin exam."* - Fri Dec  4 07:24:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) wore a giant grin.

"Finally you're coming around! Alright, I'll start off with two shadow clones. Each one is weaker than me, so you should be fine. I practice kenjutsu too, so i'll be using a weapon," he replies casually. 

His fingers come together, spawning a cross-like seal. From the formation, chakra pumps from his core and splits off into two. As the smoke spawns, it settles, creatng two Kage bunshins. Each one summons a wooden tanto, while wearing that devious grin.

"I'll let ya make the first move."* - Fri Dec  4 09:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yo, Lera. Sup? - Fri Dec  4 09:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hey there. - Fri Dec  4 09:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) 's eyes dialated at the sight of another nifty stance.

This one was particularly different from the others, mostly due to the fact that it was a stance solely based on chakra release and control. "Interesting. . .I never thought I'd take notice of another taijutsu style that used chakra! Well, none other than the almighty Gentle Fist. . ." He compliments with a grin.

After shaking off the initial awes, the clones are commanded to step back, each descending into a crouch.

"You come at me and attack. I wonder how that stance of your's is going to work. Or well. . i can attack if you want. Sometimes the best offense is a great defense!"* - Fri Dec  4 09:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: I'm...a little scared. - Fri Dec  4 09:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Fear is nothing but a restraint. It's a psychological mindset that can hold you back! To truly be strong, you have to abandon your fear, and replace it with courage! - Fri Dec  4 09:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Right? Yeah, that's what he said. - Fri Dec  4 09:16:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
The clone purpose remains in place, as if unable to even perceive the immense speed in which Aoi moved. It doesn't take long for the speedster to crash in, sending a thunderous punch to his chest.

". . .!"

Immediately, Kage Bunshin Sanoke leapt backwards, leaving only one in existence. "G-Geez. .. the hell was that? It's a very difficult technique to avoid. Are you sure you're not strong?" the clone declared with excitement. 

It's tanto is gripped harder, each muscle in the bunshin's body strickening in anticipation. "C'mon. . Let's see if you can get me again. . "* - Fri Dec  4 09:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

The first clone struck gasped, before evaporating within a plum of smoke. It was then that the surviving bunshin grew more alert, gripping tightly at the Tanto.* - Fri Dec  4 09:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
The clone tilted his head with mild confusion.

"Is-- Wow, your stamina stinks. Was just that one move you could do?"

He shook his head, pitying the woman. A quick step is given, and once within the distance, the clone spins. His speed was fierce, enough to spawn a gale or current, and from the revolution comes a sweeping kick! If caught, Aoi ran the risk of being set to her bum, falling hard onto the sand.

"You got potential, like I said. But your physique needs work. . Or well, your physical ability. A taijutsu-ist's greatest weapon is having a powerful body. Without that, you'll never be able to compete with conventional ninjutsu."* - Fri Dec  4 09:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
The clone held a hand out.

"That one move was good. It's also interesting that you use chakra for your stance. . What was the reasoning for that, by the way? " He says while aiming to aid the kunoichi up.

"You got the make-up to be a good taijutsu fighter. You just need more drive. You can't let me out condition you. Every morning, get up and do fifty laps around the village! Things like that."* - Fri Dec  4 10:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
The clone is caught offguard, and punched right into the gut!

It disperses shortly after. 'Cheaap! But the point still stands, you need to work harder. Even if you're pretty strong enough as it is," Sanoke scolds. He expected the best out of all of his shinobi. Pacifist or not.* - Fri Dec  4 10:12:41 2015

"Alright, I got a decent mission. It doesn't really have a risk, but it could potentially develop to that," He says.

A hand is pressed onto the ground, summoning a scroll that had just been delivered to the mission check-in station. "An alert. A merchant was traveling along the desert, apparently their. . . caravan broke down? I want you all to follow this map and the instructions in the scroll to go retrieve the poor soul. Mirai here will be leading, since she can examine the area for any booby traps."

The scroll is handed on over to the Hokuma. 

"They're only about an hour  away. So shouldn't take long." That said, a single seal is formed, spawning three clones. The Kage Bunshins stay put in anticipation. "Alright, let's rock."* - Fri Dec  4 11:04:44 2015

The clones spreaded out evenly along the  field, each eyes staring narrowly onto the target. "Alright. . . Let's see what you got. don't hold back--"

Naturally, it seemed that Lera's clones were going to employ the same tactic that he naturally did. Bigger numbers meant bigger explosions, right? Regardless, Sanoke had little fear, given his excessive speed and ability to actually read chakra.

The sun glasses sported flared just a tad, glistening under the intense sunrays. The rinnegan eye is funneled chakra, activating one of the numerous paths. The trio of Sanokes before are suddenly overwhelmed with a layer of translucent chakra. It forms a spherical shape over each of the doppleganger's form, and of course the forefront or focal point of the chakra layering seemed to be around the palms.

This was in fact an advanced Fuuinjutsu-based skill. Each inch of the chakra vieling seemed to be evenly distributed in energy, thus making it perfectly capable of of eating any chakra. The onslaught of elemental techniques would eventually overwhelm the clones, but just as they reach the frontal region, each particle of elemental energy finds itself demateralizing. In no time, all sources of ethereal surges begin to flow inward.

Quite literally, Sanoke's clones were evenly devouring each inch. Due to his considerable level of skill with the advanced sealing tecnique, he's capable of doing such even while not entirely focused. Due to the absorbing nature, each clone finds themselves being more or less replenished to full strength. An intense vigor suddenly manifested within their cores.

Just as quickly as the explosion had been layered, it vanished, leaving the area uncompromised. Casually, the KAzekage waves. "Neat trick I got, right? I can nullify pretty much any ninjutsu."* - Fri Dec  4 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) stood around with a giant smirk.

The clones regathered around one another, each one gaining an grin proportionate to the level of excitement Sanoke spoked. "You're getting pretty strong. I think you'd be able to beat me one on one by now," the former chunnin, and current Kazekage complimented.

Still, he seems to lack any worry at all as elemental ninjutsu wasn't a legitimate threat to him -- at leastn ot straight forward. Again, the clones activate their rinnegan path. Chakra flares from the insides of their body, and goes to activate the strange technique granted by the doujutsu for one reason.

With a grunt, there's a thick viel of spiritual energy flooding from his form. Given how proficient Sanoke had grown from using this jutsu habitually, he's capable of seamlessly forming the spherical aura around his form. It's translucent, and sky blue, the tint partially obscuring his body. On this occasion, the teen grunted, showing just a tadbit of strain in the preparation.

His body shook, but after a second or two calmed down, as it became more and more acclimated to the stress of abusing the godly doujutsu. And just like before, each layer of chakra is evenly distributed along the shape. It allows for the perfect equilibrium as needed for any fuuinjutsu-based technique. The focal point of all the chakra casting is from the palms, which is where the bulk of the energy is indeed devoured.

Just like last time, the Katon and Fuuton unify, spawning a fire-based technique beyond that of anything Sanoke had ever seen! The light flare proudly from the chaotic inferno, enveloping the bulk of the region in blinding illumaination. Naturally, heat waves danced from the fire's form, scorching and dozing any object or sentient being briefly in a warm, almost uncomfortable sensation. ..  as if in warning of the impeding doom.

And honestly? The clones never sweated or showed an ounce of fear. The incoming barrage of elemental techniques find it self being casually devoured-- although it takes sometime given the sheer girth of magnitude. For a second, ti appeared as if the training area was prepared to be destroyed in one giant blaze of glory. But just as the explosion is fixing to go off, the release of energy falls towards one single area-- the epic center that was Sanoke's body.

"Nom, nom, nom, nom! Delicioso! I want more! Your energy is tasty!" the teen teased. Indeed, each and every last inch was completely nullified. But what more, the flow re-energized the clone, making them essentially capable of fighting for howeverl ong the opponent could sling ninjutsu.

"Let's keep going?"* - Fri Dec  4 12:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) 's excitement hitched up for just a moment. The massive, golden sphere of pure destruction seemed to be building up. But just as quickly as it had sprouted, the Dust Release technique dissipated back into nothingness, much to Sanoke's chargin.

"Wow. . .A technique of that calibar. I was aiming to test the limit of my jutsu. . . Oh well, maybe some other time! Did you ever think of a name for it?" He bantered idly, even as the clone was being put to use for other combinations.

While the actual Sanoke seemed relaxed, each clones were on high alert. Their muscles were strickened, retaining the proper mobility and energy to act on a moment. And before long, water is being poured along the ground -- artificial water, however. Liquid that was as well manipulated by chakra, and thus was suceptible to the absorbing effect.

Then came the electricity...

Bzzzpt!

"It's like you're pouring barbeque sauce on my chicken!"the lad blurts out with excitement. Today was more of the same routine. He practiced the process day in and day out. Thus, with no errors, energy is pumped from each inch of his body, and forming the perfect circular-based vortex of translucent chakra. It hugs onto the air, and braces itself for impact. 

This time, the palms from the clone's hands are pivoted towards the ground, thus making contact with the glazing of elemental energy. Just as the last repetitive time, the light from the electricity dazzle the training area, and even chars the floor. But all the same, once in distance, it's assimilated right into the clone's body, forcing a premature departure.

"Phew. . .I can feel your energy. These clones are really taking a lot out of ya, aren't they?"* - Fri Dec  4 12:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Eh. I still have more than half left ya know. - Fri Dec  4 12:53:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Anyways. Last one. I'll throw every element at you, see how you deal with that eh? - Fri Dec  4 12:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Pandora's Light? Laaammme. Should have went with my name-- - Fri Dec  4 13:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
As Lera's clones were being spawned, Sanoke goes to make a few more ofh is own to even the playing field. They each communed around one another like one big football team. In unison, the chakra flaredfrom the forms of each doppleganger, crafting a singular, yet giant sphere of translucent chakra.

This was the product of each of the clones working as a single organism.

The conglomerate of the five elemental techniques served to be another more than another appetite for the incredibly versatile rinnegan user. The chakra that siphoned onto the earth itself is absorbed before it can even manipulate the ground, nullifying the effects. In addition, the rest of the energy-based projectiles naturally are gobbled on up.

Towards the end, thekage disperse each of his clones, taking the added energy. "Geez! Your level of chakra is ridiculous, you know. If we kept this up, I'd have enough energy to run a marathon around Sunagakure like ten times in a row."* - Fri Dec  4 13:08:28 2015

As Trilliam stated. . .It -was- finally time.

Without a second thought, Sanoke moved to begin terraforming the area. On this very instance, the extent of the Kazekage's immense strength and versatility was finally being revealed. 

After biting down on this thumb, blown is drawn. The reddened nectar was the only ingredient required to induce the change. Thus, in no time, after five simple sequences, a sealing formula falls over the ground. It spreads, reaching a diameter of easily six feet across the boards, before combusting. In that shorten sequence, a massive, intelligent turtle is spawned, easily rivalling normal buildings -- a mansion even!

"Gana-sir! Can you help me change the ground? I want to fill the square with life. . Y'know. Actual soil, some grass patches, water. . . And of course, I want to erect a barrier for the exteriors to allow audiences to observe without fear of being struck down," the Kazekage stated sheepishly. For a moment, the chelonian's 'brows' furrowed, as he was offended that Sanoke actually saw it fit to call upon a boss turtle for such a trivial task.

Nevertheless, given the amount of respect the sennin-in-training had obtained from the Oasis, Ganatora begrudgingly obliges. With ease, chakra is being released from the reptilian's body, easily terraforming the entire area. Particles of sand are broken down in many places -- although most sporadic -- and manipulated into lavish soil. In addition, the outer region began to form numerous pillers, each rising about feet in height. This was to border the arena's exits.

In conjunction, Sanoke leapt off, working to aid in revitalizing the area. Instead, via application of Fuuinjutsu, more soil and even grass patches are assimilated onto the ground. Deep holes -- only in placed to be filled to form ponds -- also are thrown into the mix. The sequence is a lengthy process, taking roughly half anh our. . . But all same, the arena was finally complete.

Adding the finishing touches, Sanoke makes sure to place a glass 'barrier' to block off the audience's viewing point. The glass is fitted with a 'Five Sealing Barrier' formation, serving to protect it's frame from excessive damage. "Phew. . Thanks Mr. TOra!"
