"Oh, surprising really. It's a simple technique, but it helps a lot of if you can see or read someone's chakra signature," Sanoke explains. His right hand is gently pushed forward and held within the air, just away from Mirai's chest.

"Activate your Byakugan and take a look at my chakra, sense as well if you have the ability. What you're doing is building up a certain amount of chakra -- the quantity varying based on how skilled you are, and how much you want to replenish your ally. Once enough has been built up upon, you flow it into the person's body. . "

Immediately, chakra flares through his pores. Unlike most releases, this outburst wasn't exactly contained. It moved outward like suddenly, and flowed through the air like gaseous fumes. As the release continues, Sanoke gradually goes to flow his spiritual energies inward, seeping beyond the Hokuma's flesh and aiming to imbue itself within her own chakra reservoirs.

"This is where things get hard. Each person's chakra is subtly different, just like your cells are different from mines. What you're doing is manipulating. . .-- Or well, melding your energy into mine. . . By shifting the particles of the energy atomic-coly. Basically, you're trying to make both energies correspondant. The bigger the energy chunk, the harder to manipulate. Hell, if you're good enough, you make even be able to do it from a distance."

Of course, Sanoke wasn't that good just yet. By then, a hand pressed onto Mirai's flesh, giving her a massive chunk of chakra -- about ten percent of his overall reservoirs. She'd gain a coat or aura of energy, before it eventually faded onto her insides. 

Hopefully, she'd have been observing the technical processes with her Byakugan eye.* - Wed Nov 25 05:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Not hard. . Right? - Wed Nov 25 05:47:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) stayed put. The energy from Mirai's hand at last is built up and flowed into his body. A good chunk manages to meld into his own circulatory system -- but the most tends to find itself being un-used and withering into the the skies. Logically, this was as a result of inexperience with the ninjutsu.

Nevertheless, Mirai had worked admirably.

"You pick up techniques fast. Keep working on that, to build up how much energy you can send in one go. Combine that with your healing techniques, and you should make a kickass medic in the future."* - Wed Nov 25 06:22:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
Well this was certainly something unpleasant to wake up to.

The cries of innocent haunted Sanoke in his dreams, prompting the male to awaken -- body drenched in sweat, his breathing heavy and filled with subtle trepidation. With each second winding by, adrenaline pumped into the teen's body, his hands clenching into fists.

"This. . . No!" The warrior's mind raced, as he knew the true purpose of the chaos -- Edge's desire to bring pain and agony to the world, as well as to acquire Sanoke's own doujutsu. After suiting up, the warrior was sprinting along, his velocity leaving behind a dust cloud in his wake. Through the chaos, his Tanto slashed about repeatily, severing through several opponents, leaving them incapcitiated -- with very few being dead.

In no time, he's closing in the area, gaining a good view of Marissa and the battle that waged-- but he's still a ways away for now. "C'mon. . .You're strong, hold out until I can get there. . ."* - Thu Nov 26 00:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||And suddenly Sanoke was closing in.

His eyes dialate at the sight of the magnificient summoning -- the Rashomon Gates! Naturally, it obscures his vision just a tad, making it a bit difficult to view the targets at hand. 

Regardless. . .the devestation of the bout had been apparent. Bodies laid around the hot, desert floors, blood staining the sand grains. As badly as Sanoke wanted, he couldn't pause to grieve or reflect on the blood shed. Negative, he had to directly oppose Kuro's world view, and rush head first into damage.

"MARISSA! IS EVERYTHING OKAY?" The male howled. His body moved diagonally along the around, careful to avoid the mines or any traps that may have been layered along the floor. Amidst his nimble trek onto the field, gthe shinobi's hand wove through a small string of handseals -- his hair being overwhelmed with chakra along the way. Once an angle had been obtained, a very familiar technique is utilized to aid in his range attacking.

Giant strands of hair rush forward, intent on binding the duo of of Rymei and Edge, and subsequently crushing their bones. "Lion's Mane!"  the former Kirigakure shinobi thought in effort to quell the threat.* - Thu Nov 26 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Already - Thu Nov 26 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: ....Well. - Thu Nov 26 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I must say. - Thu Nov 26 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I did not expect your forces to be so strong. - Thu Nov 26 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shi(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Who will become the next villain - Thu Nov 26 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) kept his distance -- he knew the villain always have something planned.

". . Why?" A hand is held out, allowing Sanoke to summon a blacken chakra receiver from seemingly thin air. 

It's launched from the shinobi's form, and goes to fling forward. Just as the item is closing in, some of the hair binding Edge's form is revealed -- mostly around the rib -- allowing that area to be impaled, thus eliminating any chance of his manipulating chakra.

A nod is given to Marissa, as he knew -she- was the hero here, not him. . . As that's settled, Sanoke turns back to the villain that nearly brought Sunagakure to it's knees -- Taiga Edge. 

"I'm. . . Why did you do it? All of this intelligence, and power -- But you used it to hurt people? My master told me long ago, that there are two energies in the world that powers a being. Negative and positive. . . When you're blessed with chakra, you're given the option on either protecting the weak and the innocent, and becoming a warrior that's feared for being a destroyer and conquer. . ." He asks in a low and solemn tone, his frame still on alert.

"WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO KILL ALL OF THESE PEOPLE?" Sanoke suddenly yelled, water swelling up within his shaded eyes. His passion and disappointment was evident, it gained so much momentum that just for the moment, he had been able to resist the urge to gouge out Edge's rinnegan -- as the eyes naturally commanded bearers to do.* - Thu Nov 26 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: You cannot build without a foundation. To build, one must destroy. - Thu Nov 26 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: To destroy, one must have to have originally built. - Thu Nov 26 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: In order to build a proper world. . . .. - Thu Nov 26 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Destruction is necessary. - Thu Nov 26 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) couldn't believe. His face scrunched up, suggesting mild disgust. . .

"That's flawed ideology! Destroying only causes more chaos and violence. . You can just as easily build without breaking a village to it's knees. . . Nothing negative ever leads to a decent outcome -- Just more pain and heartache. I don't get you. . . What good would come from this? Sure, perhaps in the destruction, sure. . . Something new would be constructed, but it'd just breed more hatred and angst. . . " The teen replied in an unusually stern tone of voice.

He pauses, aiming to contemplate on Edge's train of thought. "And yes, I realize how bad Kirigakure has been -- and how questionable Hassan can be. But this isn't the answer! You could have tried to reason with the people, you can't FORCE people to accept your way. . ." With a shaking hand, yet another chakra receiver is spawned. It's held within the warrior's digits, and lined up, aiming right for where Edge's neck would be -- but not yet being thrown.

Make no mistake, as a shinobi, this certainly wouldn't be Sanoke's first kill, but it'd be the most significant one. But. . . For some reason, he couldn't quite pull the trigger yet. 

"It's a shame that you had this way of thinking. . .You could have done a lot of good in this world, maybe would have even made a decent opponent. But I suppose, just as I thought days ago -- some people can't be reasoned with. Do you have any last words or wishes? " He turns to Marissa, giving her yet another nod to prepare. . . to aid in the finish. He likely wouldn't stop her if she went to go for a kill shot now.* - Thu Nov 26 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: I'll come see you again. - Thu Nov 26 02:37:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shook his head.

Oh how quickly people assumed. "I'm sure you do think that my life has just been flower and sunshines. Before i became a shinobi, my life was hell. I became one so that I could gain bonds and actually be important to people -- and believe me, I've lost my fair share of friends and family. . ."

He exhales, almost getting lost in thought. "Lissa, Smith, Kohaku, Violet, Kirie, even my master, Noriko! But I never let the pain of loss steer me away. When they died, they didn't urge me to become some genocidal criminal! When they died, their will was transferred to me, and it's why I could ascend to the evel I am today. . ." 

Naturally, he's more than a bit intrigued in the concept of bringing back the dead.  -- If able, Sanoke could; right all of his wrongs, redeem each of the persons in life that he's failed. 

"Tell me the person's name. I'll see what I can do if what you say is true. . ." With that, he awaits an answer.* - Thu Nov 26 02:42:59 2015

"Neat. . ." Two fingers raise to his forehead, giving a salute. "As sad at it may be, you must answer for your crimes regardless. Marissa. . " He gives a nod, prompting her to do her Vaccum Sphere'd shenanigans.* - Thu Nov 26 02:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
And the deed was done. . He stoically observes the gruesome scene as each bullet tears through flesh, and ravishes Edge's fragile body. Quickly, his body blurs from view, re-appearing to the group of hardened warriors that had survived the war.

". . . Hey. Sorry I was late, guys. "

Indeed, Sanoke had been absence through most of the devestation, and only just arrived to aid Marissa in apprehending the fleeing assailants. The apology is again given, this time silently as the warrior's eyes glaze over the countless bodies that had piled up along the sandy region. 

Today was a blood day. Finally, eyes set onto Edge's corpse -- The primal feelings that were being held back before no longer could be contained. He was practically seeing a massive bullseye. Sweat piled up through his pours, and Sanoke's breathing grew more heavy. Was it finally time? * - Thu Nov 26 03:00:03 2015

He paces forward, before coming to an end by Edge's carcass. "So it's finally over. . Hrm? Been a crazy road."

Briefly, the warrior peered into the skies, reminiscing over the chaotic appearance of the doujutsu that initially spawned this conflict. The thoughts don't last too long, however, as there is a definitive task to be complete -- to acquire the sixth and final path, and complete the rinnegan.

The eyes are. . crudely plucked out and held towards his own face.

For the first time in months, Sanoke's shades are removed, revealing lavender scheleras, along with circular ripples running along the eye. Edge's own optical organs immediately light up, gaining a thick, almost blinding glow. In no time, the energy breaks apart, sending particles along the rinnegan weilder's face. 

Slowly but surely, the last and final ring was being added onto Sano's frame. It's a short process, and perhaps insignificant to those that observed -- But on the inside, he felt like an entirely new man. Power swelled up on his inside, as each branch of the divine doujutsu finally has a single home.* - Thu Nov 26 03:10:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) 's jaw practically dropped.

He could hardly perceive the movement of the sword strike, much less react in time to have a semblance of a chance to defend.

-- But those thoughts weren't exactly in Sanoke's mind. To attack now would be foolish, especially with an  opponent of this calibar. The sinister chakra or energy roamed through the air right before the viscious slash is delivered. Easily, Sanoke's apparently 'Divine' doujutsu could view the dastardly energy as it coursed through Marissa's form, vaporizing her on impact.

And rather than act heroic, he trembled.

Such overwhelming power, it was more frightening than exciting. "I. . . What level of strength is this. . . Are there really opponents of this calibar in the Gezo?" His breathing was heavy, it was as if the brief exertion of chakra from Shinigami's form had doubled as a restraining barrier. Still, his eyes could trace over the Deathbringer's uniform, falling onto the 'Field Commander Badge.' 

That insignia was committed to memory -- this wasn't going to be a day he'd soon forget.* - Thu Nov 26 04:06:36 2015
