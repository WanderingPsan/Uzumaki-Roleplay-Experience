<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Kenshin-sama taught me. - Wed Sep 23 22:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) yawns. He grabs at a scroll by his side.

"Ah. Seems legit. Alright, let's rock then. Your move."* - Wed Sep 23 22:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
"Nice! That's one of my favorite taijutsu skills to use!" The teen blurts out. 

It takes no time at all for him to kick into high gears. Immediately, his body is blurring, and moving in an arc to make the incoming flames miss their mark entirely. If able to get close? And it was very likely he was, the former shinobi starts off the battle with good ol' taijutsu.

His right hand quickly shoots ahead, aiming to jab the younger girl right on the check. This is followed by arm thrust to the neck. Each of these motions are exceptionally quick, enough to make even visage of his appendages difficult to perceive -- although definitely possible.

"But let's see how you can do when someoen is in your face."* - Wed Sep 23 22:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
Kicks off towards the right.

THe massive stream of inferno had rushed ahead, burning the landscape. Thankfully, Sanoke proved to be just at a tad too quick. As the flaming ninjutsu is moving ahead, a white and blue blur can be seen richocheting towards the right. Both feet plant against the ground, the friction enough to uproot grass and expose the dirt underneath.

"You ain't too bad, chick."

Meanwhile, his hands formed a single seal.

Chakra churns, inspiring the 'Yang Release' to be produced and crept out. It coils around the wires that almost always were hidden in Sanoke's sleeves. As they speed out, the metallic wires seem to be bent towards the user's will. With ease, he's changing the direction. Thus, four set of ninja wires are moving around Kohaku's body at different points.

Some to wrap around the legs, some around the arms, and the last set about the waist area.* - Wed Sep 23 22:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shook his head.

"Where is your resolve?! Geez. You gave up so easily. . . "* - Wed Sep 23 22:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm. - Wed Sep 23 22:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I can't do much in this bind though. - Wed Sep 23 22:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You coulda tried to react before being caught. - Wed Sep 23 22:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Geez. - Wed Sep 23 22:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I could have if I wanted to. - Wed Sep 23 22:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: But ehh. - Wed Sep 23 22:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Shall we have a redo? - Wed Sep 23 22:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Right. - Wed Sep 23 22:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mind taking these off? - Wed Sep 23 22:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) released the wires of course. They come back, hiding underneath his sleeves.* - Wed Sep 23 22:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Lemme rest, you to. - Wed Sep 23 22:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I'll try not to hold back as much this time. - Wed Sep 23 22:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I barely wasted any chakra. - Wed Sep 23 22:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Eh, same. - Wed Sep 23 22:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Well you're obviously rather strong. - Wed Sep 23 22:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: So I should show you a technique I just learned! - Wed Sep 23 22:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm?* - Wed Sep 23 22:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Are you prepared? - Wed Sep 23 22:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Always. - Wed Sep 23 22:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) 's grins widen.

"Oh? Shadow Clone jutsu? Haha. That's actually one of my favorites. I'm going to make one too. . .! Alright?"

Without even waiting for an answer, the shinobi's fingers press together, forcing the chakra that rested inside his body to begin developing. Like hot water, it proceeded to bubble, before seamlessly foaming out. THere's a clear veil of energy about his person, before. . . ! Poof! Smoke clouds the area.

Of course, this was the customary action of summoning a doppleganger. "Shadow Clone jutsu a success. My chakra and stamina isn't that good. . . So I'm only going to use this--" He can't even finish the sentence before several volleys of attacks are being hurled his way. Scrambling, the warrior proceeds to move about about the landscape, his frame again blurring. 

The clone moves alongside the real version, while whipping out a scroll. It releases a small torrent of water harvested via the oceans that surrounded Kirigakure. Of course, considering this was basic water, it likely lacked the ability to truthfully compete with an actual shinobi's attack. Thankfully, some of the Housenka manage to be doused, and generally, Sanoke and Sanoke #2 are in decent condition.

The grin from before begins to grow even more prevalant. "Hey. Want me to show you something cool?" He winks, certain that his next act would be enough to leave Kohaku's jaw dropping.* - Wed Sep 23 23:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
"Six. . More Shadow Clones? Hahah! It's a good thing you don't use ninjutsu that link up, and empower one another. Then I might have been in some real trouble," Sanoke taunts -- perhaps to light a fuel under her belly. 

Quickly, he bites on thus thumb, and forms five short hand signs. 

On the last, a black sealing formula runs along the ground -- simultaneous with the incoming Fireballs. 

Poof! And just like that, smoke had clouded the area for just a moment. It remained uncertain what had been occuring. "Ahhh! My body! I'm all on fire!" 

Then the smoke settle, and all the screaming is shown to be a hoax. Now? Stood a gargantuan turtle, Gana. His flesh is light blue, and his shell is a dark, lavender tint. He smirks, as the flames had managed to sing parts of his study frame. But overall, the reptilian remained unharmed. Rather than take advantage, however, Sanoke leaps ontop of the beast, and simple grins.

"Cool, ain't it?"* - Wed Sep 23 23:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
Ganba responds casually.

"Tch. . .Sano. Are ya really. . . calling me for -losers- like this chick? Don't make me laugh!" 

With little difficult, Suiton chakra builds up, before being secreted from his maw. The result? As the water flows, it takes shape into a massive stream that eventually forms into as wall. The construction holds two purposes. The first being the absorbtion of the flame techniques. However, if all went according to plan, the water walls would have effectively washed away the Kage Bunshins themselves.

Meanwhile, the clone from Sanoke that still exists, takes a scroll from it's thigh. Upon opening? Various small projectiles such as Shurikens, are being sent out. They move in a large pack, making complete evasion difficult. Hopefully, these would put a damper in Kohaku's plan to exploit the Shadow Clone technique.* - Wed Sep 23 23:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) yawn.

What was with the youngin's nowadays and abusing the mechanics of Shadow Clone? As the two massive spheres of flames came his way, Sanoke did the smart thing and took full advantage of his speed. Speedily, his body blurred out of view -- while also using the Goukakyuu as cover. Considering the size, it was very unlikely that Kohaku would ever be able to immediately register his location. 

As this happens, four more clones are spawned, many of which immediately move off. One is struck due to the incoming barrage of flames.

Thankfully, Kohaku simply didn't have the firepower to take out Ganba. "C'mon, kiddo! THis ain't enough! One thousand ants still ain't shit to a lion!" While yelling out, his appendages were tucked in, even his shell. CHakra flows along the boney construction, and before long, the turtle's shell is settled on the side. Like a wheel, it begins to spin, spiralling right on over to Kohaku and her trio of clone warriors.

Any flames that came his way were ignored, as none stood a chance against the might of a Kame Cove boss! "C'mon!"* - Wed Sep 23 23:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: stop saying fireballs - Wed Sep 23 23:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: He's low on chakra, Good. - Thu Sep 24 00:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
The turtle seems to care little.

He continues to roll about, and as the Goukakyuu came it's way? Easily Ganba rolls right through. His size and durability make it so that the reptilian doesn't even slow down. Hit or miss (although hopefully a hit_, the turtle is continuing  in stride. Considering the application of chakra, Ganba's speed exceeds the norm and goes to run along the various Housenkas that had spawned.

Upon reaching the Shadow Clones, his head dips out at last-- and another Water Wall is delivered, dealing with the bulk of the incoming fireballs.

Meanwhile, the clones get into the fray, each one as quick and agile as the original. As they move, their hands continue to swipe in a lightning quick motion in the assumption that they're able to get close enough. THe strikes don't seem to be geared towards any particular location-- just simple blows to get rid of pesky shadow clones.* - Thu Sep 24 00:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
Good effort-- and despite Sanoke showboating a tad,  Kohaku had legitimately forced him to use that amount of chakra.

Sadly, her efforts hadn't gone as planned. The second a seal is seen being formed, the dopplegangers that had moved ahead tense up.

And as flames are going about? Their bodies again speed out of harm's way. It would seem the shinobi was just as nimble, if not moreso than even Kohaku proved to be. By this point, it's clear that she's knocked unconscious. . . But did the clones remain?

Asusming they had, Ganba is quick to follow up. From his maw, a rapid fire of Teppodamas comes blaring out,  five in total, to get rid of those annoying ass shadow clones once and for all. "Not bad. . ." Cue the remaining clones looking about to make sure Sano wasn't being blindsided. * - Thu Sep 24 00:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: . . That eye technique. . It was interesting. - Thu Sep 24 00:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) moves close, and rests a hand against her eye.

"I should have it. . !"* - Thu Sep 24 00:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) takes some water. He tosses it onto Kohaku's face.

"Wake up. .!"* - Thu Sep 24 00:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
And cue an hour of downtime. He had pulled Kohaku a bit away from the water to ensure that she wouldn't accidentally roll over into the liquid. 

In the meantime, Sanoke had unsealed a burger, and he chomped viciously.

"This girl still out?"* - Thu Sep 24 00:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeah. Not gonna lie, though. - Thu Sep 24 00:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I held back. - Thu Sep 24 00:33:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gives a thumbs up and winks.

"Cool. Maybe then you'll be worthy to see my S-ranked technique."* - Thu Sep 24 00:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Ha. - Thu Sep 24 00:36:03 2015

"Sorry to hear. I know how you feel. . . Kinda. My family is never around. Still, even if your family is gone, and you're a shinobi. You still gotta live a little," Sanoke lectures. A life that focused on all work and no play was not a life worth living in his opinion.* - Thu Sep 24 00:46:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Watch me get stonger - Thu Sep 24 21:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) turns and casts a gaze onto Kohaku.

"I'm sure you will."

After commenting, he turns back to Fujitora. "C'mon. Show me some shit. I bet ya got like a technique that can seal someone into a tree. Probably S-rank."

And yes, his tone and mannerism is much like a child. No, a genin even-- bugging a higher-ranked shinobi to teach them skills likely beyond their capacity to learn.* - Thu Sep 24 22:01:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hmm. - Thu Sep 24 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) scratches his nose upon hearing Kirie's comment. Quickly, his visage falls onto Zenaki, and he gives the girl the ol' up and down.

"Eh. Six-point-five outta ten. Not bad," the lass comments, although he doesn't seem too impressed. Of course, following Fujitora would have been a trivia matter, but alass, Sanoke cared little.

"And Noriko ain't dead. You guys are so gullible."* - Thu Sep 24 22:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Hrm. . .If I wasn't such a fcoward. Would I stick my dick in her? - Thu Sep 24 22:06:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Not really. Easy to counter. - Thu Sep 24 22:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) thinks: A katana for quick, precise deaths to my enemies. Everything else for prolonged torture. - Thu Sep 24 22:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: And it wastes far too much energy. - Thu Sep 24 22:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I didn't quite expect you to summon a giant turtle. - Thu Sep 24 22:18:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: The key, is a fuinjutsu itself. - Fri Sep 25 05:08:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm.. - Fri Sep 25 05:14:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: THese ninjas annoy me. All they do is spar an' shit,. - Fri Sep 25 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) takes a big first step towards Suitengu and kneels.

"What up, little man? Why do I smell an aura of angst around you?"* - Fri Sep 25 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Fire against Fire...Hmm.. - Fri Sep 25 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shook his head as Suitengu remained unresponsive.

"Nonsense. Studying isn't fun. You're gonna make him a lame ass, like all of these other ninjas," the teen groans. Sanoke's hand comes up, pulling against his own cheeks. The flesh is pulled, distorting the former chunnin's face-- making various obscene and silly gestures.

"Radadadaa!Radada! D'oh. . .Fun-eh faces!" 

A good ol' clown routine. This would definitely make the kid smile, no?* - Fri Sep 25 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
Sanoke continued with the silly act.

His hand placements drifted, eventually one rests under his eye while the other moved towards the mouth. Calmly, the oft silly teenager pulled, allowing his bottom lip to be stretched in an elongated fashion. 

Likewise, the skin near the bottom of his eye also is pulled, allowing the pink-hued insides of his flesh to be observed. Finally, out came the tongue. It lashed up and down like a frog, though never comes close to compromising Suitengu's bubble of space. 

"Blarrrgghh! Wee-wooo! Wee--wooo! -- C'mon, laugh runt," the would-be Turtle Hermit demands, grinning shortly after as the strange routine legitimately brings him entertainment.* - Fri Sep 25 05:36:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: -omit btw- - Fri Sep 25 05:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) facepalms.

He falls on over onto his bag in an anime-esque fashion, completely defeated. 

"--What. What are you talking about woman?" He says, flicking his gaze onto Koeki. "All I gotta do is give this kid sweets?"a scroll is taken out, and held to Suitengu. "Hey. Pour your chakra into it. It'll give you something specially. ."

Assuming the boy had complied? He'd find several chocolate-ly treats speeding out, and smashing against his frame.* - Fri Sep 25 05:53:16 2015
