"S'up, peeps. The hero is back." He scratches his butt, while looking around the general area. "What's been happenin'?"* - Tue Sep 08 16:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) begins to walk off.* - Tue Sep 08 16:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
Both hands were intertwined within one another. It rests ontop of his head, and casually, the boy trekked down the road. Why? Simply because he was in need of some entertainment, and the village was boring as conceiveably possible. In the state of boredom, his eyes glanced towards the skies.

"I'm getting tired of bein' a shinobi, man. The sage told me, real hermits ain't tied down to a village. Real hermits observe tha world, and can make observation in an unbias, and unmoving manner. . . Err, somethin' like that," the boy thought to himself. Until. . . Thwap! His body crashes against the traveling Kirie, completely by accident. Considering the size-different, he hardly budges.

"O-Oi."* - Tue Sep 08 16:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
"Omf!" He grunts surprised. 

For a second, Sanoke is stunned, as Kirie falls back, and lands right on her butt. After catching wind of the act, his body flickers, and blurs away. Effortlessly, the scroll is caught before is comes in contact with the ground itself. Once more, his body blurs, and comes to a rest right infront of Kirie's frame. The scroll is handed forward with a smile.

"Sorry, lady. And nah, it's my fauilt too. Kiri really be bumming me out. I'm thinking about retiring as a shinobi," the teen declares in a hearty fashion. His mind seems to be made up. 

* - Tue Sep 08 17:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shrugged.

"Man. What am I really even accomplishin' here, you feel me? I talk to my mentor a lot. He trains me, and tells me a lot of things. The way of the 'Hermit' isn't to be involved too much in worldly affairs. . . You get me? I am a student of the turtles, and they're notoriously passive creatures. They simply fight if necessary. Whereas. . . Me being a shinobi means I have to fight even if I disagree with my village," he says casually. A hand extends himself, meeting with Kirie's own mit, and giving a gently shake.

"Name's Sanoke, though. But yeah. . . Don't look at me like a coward. I'd still be around Kirigakure occasionally. Y'know, to protect it and shit."* - Tue Sep 08 17:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods.

Without further ado, he bites on his thumb, and moves through five different set of seals. A hand presses against the ground, and before long, human-sized turtle is spawned. Calmly, Sanoke seems to rest ontop of its figure, while smirking at Kirie. The smile is very much confident. "Yep.Turtles, and a hermit is essentially the 'Turtle King'. A 'sage', even. That's what I'm striving for. This big guy right here says I got the potential for it too. Although. . . He wants me to adapt to the principle of the a 'hermit'," Sanoke declares with confidence. It's clear, he's quite proud of the summoning ability.

A hand pats against the hardened shell with a giant simper still itched on his features.

"And I want to protect the village. But eh. . I probably won't retire -yet.- Just considering it."* - Tue Sep 08 17:53:42 2015

"Naaah. Summoning niinjutsu. I can call upon creationsfrom like. . . Another dimension, heheh!" He says with glee. A thumb moves, swiping under his nose. "Although, I am pretty good at Fuuinjutsu. In anycase, though. Ain't ya gonna turn that mission in? I'm sure the old grouch is probably waiting," Sanoke murmurs. By now, he's laying on the giant creature, and allowing Ganba to literally be used as a bed.

". . .I know. . . yer lazy ass di'nt just summon me to lay on my back, and show off for some skinny human girl," Ganba muttered angrily. He lays on his tummy, and refuses to move.* - Tue Sep 08 18:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shook his head.

"I don't do elemental techniques.--" Watches as she walks off? He shrugs, and allows the turtle to walk his ass over.* - Tue Sep 08 18:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shook his head.

"I don't do elemental techniques. I only do taijutsu, summoning techniques, and sealin' things," Sanoke replies. Of course, he had always wanted to learn -some- elemental things. Just that. . .He had little talent for those types of ninjutsu.

Ganba is hardly amused by the reply. 

". . .Damn. I don't think I was talkin' to ya, slushy skin. I was talkin' to Mister 'Hermit' guy here--" 

"Haha. No need to be so aggressive. Ganba. . . She was-- I was --" Ganba interrupts once more. "Tryin' to show off. Fuck this, next time call me when you ain't treatin' me like a glorified pet." -- Then a plume of smoke comes. The abrasive reptilian had been forcibly desummoned to avoid unneeded animosity.

A hand sheepishly goes, rubbing his nape. "Hahaha. Uh, sorry 'bout."* - Tue Sep 08 18:35:31 2015

"Hrm? I'm intermediate. Since you're a shinobi, i could try to help you with the Lotus Seal --- But like. Not rightt now, I'm feeling pretty lazy (and tired IRL). Alright?" He runs a hand through his hair, and gestures for her to lead the way towards the north.

"It's basically going to be something that lets you set traps and junk," Sanoke mutters. * - Tue Sep 08 18:58:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shook his head.

"I mean. Err, you guys kinda just won the war. You should be happy. The big bad, Amegakure monster is done," he replies -- though briefly turns to face Yan.

"Nah. Elemental ninjutsu is for squares." said the jealous male that had little talent in the art.* - Mon Sep 21 02:57:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gives the nice guy pose.

His teeth sparkles in the light -- before he again turns to Yan. "A real ninja don't reveal his skills. At least that's what the old man told me," Sanoke replies as the pose falls off, and his smile recedes.* - Mon Sep 21 03:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) facepalms softly at the arrival of Erebus.

The man simply oozed with creeping intent. "Uh. You sure you okay with going to speak with this guy alone, Koeki?" Sanoke questions with slightly nervous chuckles.

A hand rubbed the back of his nape, and subsequently ran through his snow-colored hair. * - Mon Sep 21 03:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Yeah, it's fine Sanoke. - Mon Sep 21 03:10:04 2015

His body speeds away, landing a considerable distance into the west.* - Mon Sep 21 03:17:45 2015

"Someone is gonna suffocate soon. . "* - Mon Sep 21 16:04:54 2015
