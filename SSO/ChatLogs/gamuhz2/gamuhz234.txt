<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Mhmm... - Mon Nov  2 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: That's.. the reason why I can't sleep. - Mon Nov  2 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh! Makes sense. - Mon Nov  2 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Wow. So that meditating didn't help at all? - Mon Nov  2 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He nods, recalling the shift in Tetsumi's chakra during the incident. It was un-nerving to be completely honest. And clearly, there had been two different energy sources functioning in one physical body.

"So there's two Tetsumis. . Hrm! Just beat up the Sandy Tetsumi next time, if he's a problem. You can make him come out, can't ya?" Sanoke said in a nonchalant manner. Which was surprising, considering he had just seen the malicious chakra that swirled around in Tetsumi's insides.

--- Then came the summoning technique.

On cue, Sanoke can't help but to life. It was a -Raccoon- for god sake. "Hahaha! A raccoon! Haha, you're learning from a raccoon?" said the boy that often wore a giant turtle shell on his back.

He kneels, an d goes to prod the rodent on the forehead. "How strong are you, Mr. Raccoon?"* - Mon Nov  2 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) stifles a giggle.

As the raccoon airs his frustration, Sanoke looked on -- at first with confusion, then with clear amusement. Was this rodent serious? "Wow. I'm guessing you don't have one of the intelligent familiars? I thought it'd be able to talk like mine can," the warrior remarked. His index finger moves, and presses against the fury specimen's head.

He scratches back and forth.

"Want some food little guy? I got some garbage sealed up in a scroll.. Don't ask why," Sanoke continued with an awkward cough.

That said, the subject swiftly takes a change, and is redirected back to Tetsumi. "As for you! -- Good. Now ya just gotta master that dark chakra." That's what he called it, referencing the energy that had been granted due to his connection with the bijuu or chakra demon. "--Wait. . . I think Kilm summons raccoons too."* - Mon Nov  2 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) wasn't caught slipping.

Just as the raccoon leaps ahead, the warrior does a swift step to the side. No matter how trivial the action may have seemed, Sanoke moved with a level of grace unbefitting of the nonchalant and feeble act he usually held. It was almost as if his feet never touched the floor, as his body smoothly glided several paces towards the north, then east -- as he encircles the jinchuuriki.

"Your raccoon is pretty fiesty. He reminds me of Ganba's brother. Gonbi. Well. . . He's like fifty percent as fiesty."

Sanoke stated as per usual with a nod. Quickly, his facial features change, gaining a hint of curiosity. "Wait. If what I've been toldi s right. . . All summons have their own secret land. You ever been to the raccoon world? And if so, what is it like? Can I come too? I wonder if there would be any interesting fighters."

He asks in a tirelessly fashion, one question coming after the other. The prospect of there being another summoning land, much like the turtle oasis, was pretty enticing. Normally, Sanoke wasn't one for battling senselessly, but that's only because there were rarely opponents that intrigued him. "And I'm sure you'll be able to master the chakra thingy. Just gotta follow what you did before to gain a level of control."* - Mon Nov  2 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He continued to move around in circles.

A single seal is spawned, allowing for a doton clone to form. Casually, it seeps into the ground, using it's earthen natured chakra to follow and keep up with the rowdy Raccon. "Geez. . . This thing is too much. Take a time out. . ." Sano remarked casually. At once, two hands shoot out the ground, intent on pulling the raccoon, and capturing it underneath the surface.

Only his head would left above the dirt.

That settled, Sanoke shuffles on back with a yawn. "As for. . Letting you see. I'll need to check on that. They don't like to bring outsiders to the sacred land. But I'm kind of like a big deal, so I'll see what I can do. Oh. . . When we finally have our spar? Gonna go use that monster form? I think you'll need it," the teen stated confidently. Like stated before. . . He never showed interest in fighting na opponent, unless they showed intriguing skills.

And of course, with the display from the previous day, Tetsumi had certainly fit the description.* - Mon Nov  2 08:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Though... It'd probably be fun.. - Mon Nov  2 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Tetsumi Jiki thinks: Though... It'd probably be fun.. - Mon Nov  2 08:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) chips in a comment of his own, once the topic had remained about the summoning world. "Indeed. They don't want just anyone to see the sacred lands -- let alone touch the contract. I got enough flak for letting my teacher just make a connection. The leader gave me a lot of shit for it. Believe it or not, turtles are very prideful. Not to be confused with arrogance," Sanoke notes.

As the secondary comment is dished, he scratches his nose, amused by the claim.

"I dunno. I think you'd need it. I don't think your sand would be able to keep up with me otherwise," Sanoke remarks. Without warning, he goes to show off his speeds, which can be said to be one of the fastest in all the lands -- although there were a few that could feasibly rival, if not surpass. Indeed, it was as if Sanoke had been utilizing shunshin, considering the extreme velocity. Such momentum was built up on the fly scarily enough.

He moved in a circlar formation, running constantly about Tetsumi's frame. In this state, Sanoke's can't even be perceived. Rather, you would only be capable of determining or detecting simple colors, and that's only if your perception was high enough. It's speedy -- so much that a cloud of dust inevitably picks up along the pathway, arising and obscuring vision. 

Pretty much. . . He's Rock Lee-ing in this bitch.

Cue stopping after a laps. "See? I noted your fighting style before. You use sand -- or well, iron particles -- for both offense and defense. It's almost as if it has  mind if its own."

* - Mon Nov  2 09:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He releases a hearty chuckle, quite fond of his own speed.

"Yeah. How mis-leading, right? You'd expect a turtle summoner to be slow as hell. Albeit. . . turtles being slow is a common misconception. It's actually their cousin -- the tortoises -- that are slow as balls. Most turtles actually can be very fast, in short distances," Sanoke states, geek-ing out for just a moment.

"Although, the reason I won't spar you immediately is cause I need to finish working on my new jutsu. It'll be badass!" That stated, the chunnin twirls on over, and sits down.

"Really. . . -Really- badass." Yes, he's really egging on how awesome his technique will be,* - Mon Nov  2 09:53:55 2015
