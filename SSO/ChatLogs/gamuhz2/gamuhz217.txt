<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) sat along the floor, practicing the manipulation of his own elemental prowess. This facet or aspect of his skill was rapidly growing, much to Sanoke's delight. 

His body moved through a string of hand signs, allowing the proper or precise manipulation of his own Doton-natured chakra. As the flow of energy reaches it's max capacity or level of potency, two hands press against the floor, allowing his chakra to attack the earthly flooring directly. From this, Sanoke is enabled to manipulate the ground to his leisure.

Several clumps of sandstones together, and thus giving him the ability to toss rocks. . . almost with telepathy! They crash into the area ahead, each hit enough to leave miniture craters along the ground itself.* - Tue Oct 13 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blinks. 

Due to his training regiment, and often getting into a 'zone', Sanoke hadn't been able to notice Beth -- at least not until it was too late. Thankfully, the young male/female was capable of evading the incoming blow before she had been struck -- likely saving her from a load of pain. Leaping onto his feet, the boy jogs over, wearing an apologetic gaze, considering that he had almost knocked out the presumably woman into next week.

"Oi! My bad, man. -- Oh, it's the man I thought was a chick the other day. What's up?" Sanoke questioned with a grin, his tone as cheerful and happy-go-lucky as per usual. His hand would have extended for just a moment, gesturing for a handshake -- before being pulled back.

In the world of shinobi, you don't make unnecessary physical contact unless you can truthfully trust a person. It was how people could randomly die. . . due to the usage of fuuinjutsu, elemental tefchniques, or even poisons spawned by contact. "What brings ya all the way out here?"* - Tue Oct 13 03:24:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Anywho, as for me. As you can see, I'm working on my elemental ability. - Tue Oct 13 03:31:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Gotta round out my skillset. All I need right now is more Elemental techniques, some Shurikenjutus, and Genjutsu. - Tue Oct 13 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh? - Tue Oct 13 03:31:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: You see. - Tue Oct 13 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) was quite familiar with the technique.

It was one that Kirie was often prone to using, along with a slew of other elementalist. Rather than sitting around like an idiot, he leaps up briefly, and acctivates his Suimen ability. Chakra hugs the bottom of his feet, making it possible for the former chunnin to be capable of staying afloat, ontop of the sticky Syrup Trap -- thus keeping him from being bound to the surface. "Hah! I know this skill, my friend back in Kirigakure uses it all the time. . . Although, her's is a lot better. I can tell that elemental ninjutsu isn't exactly your forte," he notes in a blunt fashion, although with no intent on taking shots at Beth's own elemental prowess.

Arms folded, he looks the girl (who apparently was being made to be a boy) up and down. "Hrm. . . If you wanna learn some elemental techniques for water, I'm pretty sure there are a few people in Suna that can help you. That Kilm guy, and Yan are two options. Sadly, I can only use earth," the turtle summoner replies.* - Tue Oct 13 03:45:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) slides back, entering a rookie stance.

His eyes lock onto Beth's, and a cocky grin is worn. "I'll let ya commence."* - Tue Oct 13 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Idoes othe rguy hav eliek 5 of paths - Tue Oct 13 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Of course, he made no move as Beth formed that first seal.

Due to the nature of his doujutus, it was clear that she was using chakra for -something-. . . However, there's no real way to tell that this is a genjutsu. As intended, the wind blowing and the sand coming about the area serves as a decent distraction, making him unable to see the illusion pretty much spawn out of nowhere. In time, silhouettes formulated, before eventually being crafted into actual humanoid bodies.

By then, he had taken notice of Mirai's form. . . !

And she was laying on the floor, breathing a bit heavy. Several Kunai were lodged into her curved frame, and blood splattered onto the ground. This was one of Sanoke's great fears -- the fear of losing his loved one. His heart panged with guilt and grief, due to his body briefly registering these sights as actual realities. . . He was meant to be the Hyuuga;s protector after all.

Eventually, however. .. Give the familiarity with the genjutsu, and Sanoke's hand came together, releasing a surge of chakra that disrupt the flow. He's a bit mentally exhausted, and glares ahead.

"So genjutsu, huh. . ? Hah. Well you'll need to use stronger genjutsu than that to actually beat me. Let's get this started--" Without a word, he blurs ahead, and once in distance, gives a sweeping kick at the girl's ankles, hoping to trip her up into the sand. Assuming success, Sanoke back peddles, wearing a giddy grin. This was going to be too easy. .* - Tue Oct 13 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I was gonna rp doing somthing befure u moved js - Tue Oct 13 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) continued to move in stride. 

The shurikens come buzzing through the skies, prompting Sanoke to take out a KUnai. Rather than waste precious time stopping and evading, his hands swatted along, striking the metallic projectiles admist the air. Two or three are completely parried, giving Sanoke more than enough room to keep in his pursuit. Considering his vast level of speed, the boy is enabled to close the distance between the two in record time, albeit not as fast he'd like.

If capable of closing in? The teen again sends a sweeping kick right to Beth's ankles, all with the intent on knocking her over.

By now, he was expecting a genjutsu -- and inadvertently looks to her as the handseals are formed. Although. . . expecting a genjutsu and seeing through one was an entirely different animal. It remained to be seen just how creative the dark-skinned kunoichi could get with her illusions. Hopefully for her sake, she doesn't make it so clear obvious, considering the girl's ninjutsu/genjutsu prowess weren't all to strong to keep an opponent bound against their will.* - Tue Oct 13 04:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||As the kick is missed, Sanoke's hands are blurring to string together a short sequence of handsigns. "Katon release too. . ?! So she can use two different releases, noted," the boy deciphered. Just as the last seal is completed, his hand presses against the ground, unleashing a rush of chakra and a sealing formula along the surface.

It takes no time whatsoever, before a Turtle Had been conjured, with the intention of shielding him from what he believed to be fire! "Grand Turtle Summoning. . .! Ganba!" Of course, there ran the risk of this actually being another an illusion, and in that case, the reptilian that had been spawned would express the clear confusion. . . as Beth didn't really seem like much of a threat. Or well, at least not one that would warrant his beckoning or assistance in the battle.

Standing on top of the massive shell, the shinobi lookedd ahead with a grin. "Geez. . .You're pretty good, you know that? I expected this to be over long ago," the boy admits.* - Tue Oct 13 04:52:41 2015

One turtle is spawned. "Go tell Mirai to come here please. Koji needs her."* - Tue Oct 13 05:38:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Okay. . 

What? Immediately, Sanoke believes this to be a lethal attack -- at least from his perspective. "Woah. . ! What the--" As a shinobi, one didn't have the luxury of simply lingering in shock. Instead, he's swift to attack immediate action, the shell on his back disappearing in a plume of smoke. At a speed that likely equaled, or exceeded Saeza's, the turtle summoner makes a sprint ahead, hoping to potentially save Hiroshi -- from this apparent vampire.

If enabled to get close enough, a sweeping kick is sent right to the woman's knees, perhaps toppling her over, and sending her onto the ground. . . Well, if she didn't see it coming or evaded. "Woah! Geez, there's no reason to try and eat the guy just '[cause he such a boneheaded move!" Sanoke says, aiming to reason with the apparent cannibal.* - Tue Oct 13 05:57:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blinked as he took in all the factors.

Hiroshi didn't seem to be in pain -- rather, his face suggested a state of euphoria, much to Sanoke's apparent surprise. "Uh. . Right then. . . Why do you have that funny look on your face? You should be screaming or clutching at your neck in pain. . . --Ergh. . .Unless you're one of those freaks that get horny off of that. Yuck," he remarks, before shifting his gaze back onto Saeza, who now sat on the floor, tears streaming down her face.

"Uh. . .Why are you crying? And more importantly, the fuck is up with the vampire act? I get that he shouldn't have tried to kiss you. . . especially in a spar, but like. . .That ain't cool," the former chunnin remarked, his persona far too calm given the bizarre twist of events.* - Tue Oct 13 06:03:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gained a giant grin.

Oh man. . . He -loved- when people showed concussion. His thumb rises, allowing Sanoke to press his teeth against the flesh -- breaking through and drawing blood. Using this blood as a sacrifice, the shinobi's hand string through five short seals. Upon completion, a hand presses against the ground, prompting a strange sealing glyph to manifest. It's black, and appears to be made of an ethereal source -- although appears to look exactly like ink.

As it spreads, on the end-point, smoke combusts, clouding the region.

Then. . ? It clears. In no time at all, there's a giant, human-sized turtle.  He has light-blue skin, and a giant purple shell. EAsily, the turtle -- dubbed Ganba -- stands at about six feet.

And boy, he's fucking irritated. "Lord. . .Have. . . Mercy on your soul! Are you summoning me AGAIN. .  just to SHOW OFF? One day, I'm just going to stop letting you call me out, boy." His voice is deep, and somewhat thuggish, demanding attention. 

"Sorry. . Ganba. Y'know I like to shine."* - Tue Oct 13 06:43:37 2015

"Hahaha. No, I used summoning technique. It's a space-time ninjutsu that lets me summoning my own companions for battle. Believe it or not, this isn't even the best one. There's a turtle in Kame Cove that's like twice the size of a mansion. Hits like a brick."* - Tue Oct 13 06:46:11 2015

These two really knew how to make a guy feel special. . .Especially one with as big of an ego as Sanoke. To add emphasis to his ludicrous training regiment, Sanoke pulls at the latches along his shell, forcing the boney construction -- since a turtle shell was literally just it's bone structure growing on the outside -- to fall onto the ground. It does so with an impressive thud, the likes of which kicked up a mass of dirt, and formed a dust cloud. The ground itself trembled under the might.

Casually, Sanoke makes an approach, only coming to a stop once a meter or two ahead of the two genins. "Ready. . .? This is going to be a doozy. . "

Without waiting for an answer, his right leg twitches, pivoting towards the left. . . And just from that alone, momentum had been built. Sanoke's frame immediately dissolves into a streak of white and blue, his true form or body not logically being able to be viewed by those with lesser perception. The ground shifted, and the sand parted way, leaving nothing but a slurred foot print along the floor as a remainder of the male that once stood there motionlessly.

In time, he was moving in circles, easily running laps around the two at breakneck speeds. The sheer velocity builds up a nice viel of wind, the the gale proving enough to send the duo's hair swaying in recoil. As the boy continued to speed, dust particles again creep up. .  .
