He delivers two simple missions. The first being to tidy up a shop towards the north. The secondary mission was simply finding a lost Pig that currently ran around Sunagakure.

After the scrolls are deposited, a glance falls back onto the cloaked Karidu. Naturally, his eyes catches wind of all the anomalities that were visible due to the exertion of chakra. Of course, it wasn't the Kazekaeg's place to call this out. He simple stares to the figure as she walks before turning to face the crowd. .

". . .But yeah! You guys should be there? My favorite to win is. . .Hrm, Hideo!"

He calls out an assistant, who provides Sanoke with another mission. This was one a bit more high-leveled.

"Alright, Koji. I need you to go track down a hoodlum that's been vandalizing all of my shit. Mitsunara will be your back up. The point is to just capture and bring him into jail. Avoid harming if able," the Interim Kazekage instructs.

The enemy wouldn't be particularly strong. Although, his wide-ranged fuuton ninjutsu would make him more than capable of fighting two opponents.

"Was that like sarcastic? You should come. I'm hoping my guy Hideo can pull off an upset."* - Wed Dec  2 05:43:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) scratches his head awkwardly.

"Oh, uh. Just commentin'. I tried to make time is all, not that I mind that you have things to do," Sanoke retorts casually.* - Wed Dec  2 05:49:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) tilted his head to the side.

Slight confusion is available for a brief moment, but then shifts onto a more apologetic demeanor.

"Um.. . I'm sorry. I was just commenting is all."* - Wed Dec  2 05:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Whatever. - Wed Dec  2 05:51:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) does the usual flickering thing.

He throws an arm over Mirai's waistline.  "You can say it's nothing, but I can tell you're at edge. Uh, sorry if I came off rude before? Wasn't trying."* - Wed Dec  2 05:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I'm not at edge. - Wed Dec  2 05:54:59 2015

"B-but. . Ya just said there was noth-- Is there something?"* - Wed Dec  2 06:01:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I don't want one. - Wed Dec  2 06:09:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: ......... - Wed Dec  2 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Nevermind then. - Wed Dec  2 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . .You're killing me here! - Wed Dec  2 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I feel like i'm dying everyday. - Wed Dec  2 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: You don't see me complaining about it. - Wed Dec  2 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) frowns.

Mirai was being extremely depressing today -- so much that it was beginning to effect Sanoke. Still, the interim Kazekage was adamant on spending time with his wife-to-be. Speedily, he switches positions, standing towards the Hokuma's rear and placing two hands on her shoulder.

His hands kneads at the trapezus.

"You really seemed stressed. Is it because we haven't been intimate or something?"* - Wed Dec  2 06:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: No. - Wed Dec  2 06:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I just want you to treat me like your Fiance. - Wed Dec  2 06:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: What. . ? Is it cause I'm not romantic enough? - Wed Dec  2 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods.

"I'm sorry! I'll try to be better-- And yes, I know I say that a lot. But this time, I mean it." He continued to knead casually along her shoulders, in hopes of putting the woman at ease. Although, it was unlikely to work, it was worth a try to attempt, no?* - Wed Dec  2 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I don't believe you and at this point I don't know what to do. - Wed Dec  2 06:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I'm just ready to lay down and die. - Wed Dec  2 06:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) still wore that subtle frown. Mirai wasn't exactly making him feel like the best guy. His hands continued to knead, while moving down her form. Mind racing, Sanoke goes to try an old trick.

His digits find their way onto the Hokuma's derriere, giving tight squeezes relentlessly. 

"Maybe it's cause I haven't shown her enough affection? Last time, she was pretty happy for like a day and a half," the simpleminded teen pondered to himself, quite desperate in his attempt to appease the often unruly or aggitated Hyuuga.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) scoops her up as per usual.

His spirits were clearly being lifted, now that Mirai was actually trying to have a conversation with him. Speedily, the boy displaced himself, moving beyond the stairs and going to the top floor.* - Wed Dec  2 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Neat place, yeah? - Wed Dec  2 07:28:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
"Here? This room is private," the Interim replies.

In no time, they have moved to the sleeping quarters. Indeed, Sanoke had been here quite often -- and it showed. Papers were all over the table, and there seemed to be clothes left all over the floor, leaving the room pretty dishoveled. 

The movements don't stop, at least not until they were by the mattress. 

Sitting, a glance falls back onto the Byakugan wielder. "Alright. So how are we going to start. With my back or whatever?"* - Wed Dec  2 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: No one is allowed upstairs, but I see your point. - Wed Dec  2 07:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sure. - Wed Dec  2 07:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Strip. - Wed Dec  2 07:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) does just that.

He forms a single seal, enveloping his body in a plume of smoke. As the smoke dissipates, Sanoke stands devoid of most clothing, save for boxer shorts. Naturally, his body isn't much to rave on, as he didn't focus on physical attributes to be dominant.

His frame is athletic, lean and muscled, but still relatively skinny. At Mirai's behest, the male manuevers, laying flat on the mattress and eagerly awaiting his massage.* - Wed Dec  2 07:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) was giddy with joy.

It didn't take long for the Interim Kazekage to actually get coozy, his body fidgeting to make his positioning a bit more comfortable. The guy practically sported goosebumps, as he too had been legitimately waiting for quite a bit to actuallly get some one on one one time with Mirai- -Who was habitually angry at him.

For the moment, Sanoke looked ahead, a dumb smile plastered right on his facial features.

That is, until the characteristic sound effect of a ninjutsu being used played through the area. His gaze flicked to the side, finally getting a gander at the Hokuma's bodacious body. She was ridiculously endowed, to say the least -- yet it all seemed to be natural, andcorrespondant with her body size. Pervertedly, the snow-haired summoner couldn't help but to eye every inch of the woman's godly physique, which seemed to only be enhanced by the skimpy lingerie she wore.

Naturally, the desired effects are casted onto Sanoke. His cheeks immediately redden, his heart rate picks up, and ofcourse, the beginnings of arousal makes itself apparent -- although probably hard to be determined given he was laying on his stomach.

It was as if he was a gluttonous akimichi who had been taken to a full course buffet. Nevertheless, from start to finish, the teen eyed his wife-to-be as she moved onward with a model-like gait, and gathering tools from the drawer. The patent massage oil is equipped, and with a squelch, the liquidy contents are poured onto the beaut's hands. 

Inevitably, it comes to pass, with Mirai's hand being pressed against his back, releasing the ointment onto the Kage's flesh. Needless to say, it was warm to the touch, and served as a proper soothing agent. Pleased,Sanoke hummed along, clearly appreciative of the effort.

"--It's fine. I've dealt with worse woman rage. . Plus, I'm going to be your husband. If I couldn't take your emotion, I wouldn't have stuck around. 'Sides, you being angry at me just makes it clear that you care, right? I like that," the lad replies with a cheerful tone, rebuffing the apology. There was no need for it.* - Wed Dec  2 08:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) grinned lightly -- not to ridicule the woman, but simply because he found the jealousy charming. Many people could perhaps be put off by the possessiveness, but to the contrary, for some odd reason it attracted Sanoke. 

"I figured, hah. Sometimes, it's like no matter what my answer is, there'll be something wrong," the boy states nonchalantly inbetween hums.

His body continued to subtly fidget or move as literal chills were running through is body. "Umf. . .! Wow, I knew Hokumas were like. . . really good with targeting precise locations and using their fingers, but you're pretty incredible. You ever took a class on this?" Sanoke compliments with a grin plastered on his face, his commentary briefly being interrupted by more hums or pleased grunts.

The teen never moved from the general spot.

His cranium moves about, allowing view of Mirai's flawless body as she graciously continued to knead and rub out any anomalies. -- And from this, his eyes drifted forward, gawking at the woman's erect nipples. They clearly spoked through her bra, giving him a clear display.

For a moment, Sanoke is lost in lust, his tongue lulling out and a hand beginning to rise. For a moment, he'd reach the promise land, and giving an absentminded fondle -- before remembering what was going on. "-- Oh. Massage, right. . . " Hesistantly, the hand falls back onto the bed, though his eyes never leave the scene.

At the act, Sano's cheeks flare redder like a pikachu, and his erections grows more profound. Temptation was evident.* - Wed Dec  2 08:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: That was therapeutic. - Wed Dec  2 09:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) continued to smile from ear to ear as Mirai's nimble fingers worked their magic. Her slippery hands moved along his back, giving more chilling sensations that ran rampant down his spine.

There's a lasting shudder, before the male's gaze shifts onto Mirai's face.

"Whew! I'm guessing ya had enough for now?" He says with a partially fatigued tone, his eyes still occasionally tracing along the voluptous form that the Hyuuga sported.* - Wed Dec  2 09:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Mhm. - Wed Dec  2 09:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Want to come with me find Koji? - Wed Dec  2 09:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) leaps up!

He felt like a million bucks. By now, he could keep his arousal in check. With a single seal, the clothes from before are back on.

"That was great, though. Thanks for that-- Let's rock."* - Wed Dec  2 09:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Come hold my hand. - Wed Dec  2 09:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) was in a daze for a second. He shakes his head to remove the rust, and presses a hand forward to interlock with Mirai's. 

"There. Hrm. . .We should probably check his usual training spot."

And off the two went.* - Wed Dec  2 09:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Mhm. - Wed Dec  2 09:13:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) peered forward.

A hand rested on his forehead, blocking out the sunrays. ". . .Well that's a sight. . "* - Wed Dec  2 09:16:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Yo! - Wed Dec  2 09:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Teach me something new! - Wed Dec  2 09:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shrugs.

His feet stamps onto the ground, leaving a deep imprint along the sand's surface. ". . .Hrm. . .No problem! Secret Ninja Art. . . Great Wind Bullet Barrage. . . Supreme. . !" 

Yes, he was a lot more energetic for some reason, and limber too. Both hands came together, forming a pyramid-like seal. With that, chakra in his body is easily manipulated, and gathering in a condensated manner within his lung pipes. It doesn't take much longer, before the built up energy is siphoned within the oxygen, and forming various, baseball-sized pellets of wind.

Sporadically, Sanoke exhales, releasing about one and a half dozen rounds of wind bullets. "Dodge 'em!" They're split in half, with eight or so going towards random locations near Kinami's and Hideo's body. Naturally, they would have to contort or move around in various different directions to have a chance of evading.

He could keep this up for a while too. . * - Wed Dec  2 09:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Let's go to the hide out. - Wed Dec  2 09:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Yahh, lets go. - Wed Dec  2 09:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Oh. . .Maybe I shouldn't have gotten involved! - Wed Dec  2 09:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Feel free to come if you want Sanoke. - Wed Dec  2 09:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hey! I'm going to make them dodge for a while, okay? I'll be there in like three minutes. - Wed Dec  2 09:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: This damn Sanoke. . . What is he trying to accomplish here today? - Wed Dec  2 09:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: You probably wanna watch your cousin or whatever fight though. - Wed Dec  2 09:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Hmm.\ - Wed Dec  2 09:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) wasn't going all out with the ninjutsu, obviously.

He had no intent on breaking any bones via concussive damage, as that would be counterproductive. The two were set to participate on the grandest stage of them all, the chunnin exams -- so why send them there banged up?

Impressively, the duo were capable of evading the incoming, fuuton-based projectiles even while engaging in fierce, close-quarter combat. "Not bad! - -But I feel offended! Let's see you guys try it with this!"

A single seal is formed, spawning a plume of smoke. For now, two clones were produced, each one mimicking Sanoke's own likeness, and of course packing a punch in their own right. Without hesistation, they spread towards the different angles, while forming the Bird handseal. Just as with the last time, breathing control is imperative. upon in taking a volume of wind, chakra is kneaded, and used to form baseball-like constructs.

Rapidly, they're expunged from the Sanokes bodies, each one beelining to the target. Strategetically, they're placed with gaps and arcs, making it possible to evade while still being fierce in close-range..

Although, the question remained. Could the duo even perceive or detect them while trying to smash each other's faces in?* - Wed Dec  2 09:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Ultra, Superb. . . WIND BULLET BARR--- Oh. . Uh.. - Wed Dec  2 09:34:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) grunted.

He was legitimately feeling challenged now, as the two still nimbly danced around his attacks. ". . .Geez. . This might be a glimpse at the final match in the chunnin exam. . .!" Sanoke teased with a wide smirk, his teeth glimmering in the merciless rays of the sun.

Still, the male kept with his endeavors a little while long. The clone'sbody raced, moving in a semi-circle, and thus producing more Wind bullets, this time at varying angles. Certainly, these would be more difficult to evade.

"If they can evade again. . . "* - Wed Dec  2 09:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hey Sanoke, Akira told me he gave the key to his house to you. Is that correct? - Wed Dec  2 10:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) paused in his assault.

"Hi, Mira-- You finished already?" Then Chikyu came. He turns, looking on pensively. . .

"Where did I put that.."* - Wed Dec  2 10:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Mhm. - Wed Dec  2 10:13:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looks through his scrolls.

Endless sheets are unsealed, before finally a single key is reached! Carelessly, it's tossed on over to Chikyu to store. "There ya go. Wonder how Akira is holding up in Konohagakure anyway."* - Wed Dec  2 10:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) wasn't going to let up.

They had to work on evasion, as it was imperative for any taijutsu specialist to be able to evade from a distance. As such, Hideo isn't spared any mercy. The bullets were concussive, and hit like bricks -- although not hard enough to compromise bone structure.

If not moved out of the way, the young lad would find himself being overwhelmed with the onslaught, perhaps even toppling him over. "C'mon! Move out the way!"* - Wed Dec  2 10:35:44 2015

And suddenly, she was attacking one of the clones.

Being a mere doppleganger, it serves to reason that neither of the bunshins can quite measure up to the strength of the Kazekage. Thus, while h'd normally be able to evade with little sweat, the clone seems to hold a bit of trouble.

Nearly, the specimen is capable of evading. As it ducks, the blow manages to knick the top of the head, and just that was enough to force an early dismissal. 

"Not bad, you actually could land a blow on my Kage Bunshin."* - Wed Dec  2 10:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) kept casually leaning against the wall.

With his RInnegan, the boy can easily read the chakra network. "Hrm. . .Oh, she's doing that thing Paine usually does," the summoner stated with a smile -- It as impressive to say the least. Even if close-ranged fighters commonly could engage in the utilization of such.

"What's that thing called again. . .?" Sanoke muttered while pensively looking to the ground.

Indeed, in this state, Kinami's speed had increased just as much as her strength. . . And this just barely makes her faster than Sanoke's clone can manage. Still, it acts on reflex, his body too blurring, and giving chase away from the taijutsu specialist's grasp. With a single clap of a hand, a gale is produced, sending a powerful current in the general direction of the Hassan.

With enough hope, it'd be capable of sending the taijutsu specialist skidding back. If not? Then once again, Kinami scores a nearly evaded blow, reducing the clone to nothingess. Regardless, the scene was impressive hit or miss.

"Oh! You're getting pretty strong there, kid," says the boy that's only about three years older. "Glad to see you haven't been wasting your times. . .Who knows, maybe you'll even win in the chunnins."* - Wed Dec  2 10:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) chuckled, enticed by the prospect of seeing more.

"Lots of strong taijutsu users here. I'm sure you got some neat 'forbidden' techniques to show off. if so? Good. It could help you score more points," the Kazekage stated with smirk. A thumb juts up, giving a thumbs up to Kinami due to how hard she had been working to accumulate this level of strength.

"At this rate, you may even be able to take me on soon."* - Wed Dec  2 11:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Haha. Trust me, if I am lucky enough to unlock my next gate by the time the exams are here. - Wed Dec  2 11:08:09 2015

After some thought, the perfect task is developed.

A scroll is released onto the floor, with chakra being applied seconds after. In no time, smoke is coughed up, and as it clears, a massive stack of paper is conjured. The height was enough to rival someone even as tall as Mitsunara, although the sheets were criminally light.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Why so quiet, though? - Wed Dec  2 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: There's a few things I need to talk to you about, business and personal. - Wed Dec  2 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: What's up? - Wed Dec  2 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Need to talk to you about something I want to provide to the village if you are willing to fund it. - Wed Dec  2 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: And then something else private. - Wed Dec  2 23:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Want to go somewhere we don't have to whisper? - Wed Dec  2 23:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Works. Lead. - Wed Dec  2 23:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) takes a seat. He goes to order a menu 'cause food.

"So. .?"* - Wed Dec  2 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I was wondering if you were willing to fund the project for soldier pills. These would basically help boost up our forces in times of trouble. - Wed Dec  2 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) had ordered some sort of roasted beef.

He eats ravenously for one reason or another, his canine teeth utterly ripping the meat to shred. For a second, it appear as if he's going to choke, although that moment is brief.

"Soldier pills? What do they do? And can you give me a price range? -- And the ingredients needed, of course."* - Thu Dec  3 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) leaned forward with bowl-shaped eyes.

Was kiyoko speaking the truth? While it wasn't exactly a foreign concept, he was pleasant surprised that one of his own had been capable of producing a pill of this nature. 

"Huh? Really. . . That does sound useful. It'd be a great lift to the Sunagakure. I love it. I'll put forth whatever resources you need to get the task done. Chunnin and above also sounds like a nice policy, assuming things are pricey,"Sanoke muttered hastily, his excitement as clear as night and day.* - Thu Dec  3 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....I uh... - Thu Dec  3 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: What about the other thing? - Thu Dec  3 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: The other--yeah... - Thu Dec  3 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: See... - Thu Dec  3 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: This might sound -weird-... - Thu Dec  3 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: But just hear me out. - Thu Dec  3 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I was wondering if... when me and Lera get around to having kids... - Thu Dec  3 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: If uhm... if you'd be the donor.... - Thu Dec  3 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I mean, you are my best friend and everyone else that is single and an option ...died. - Thu Dec  3 00:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oooh. I mean, I like you both. And normally I'd do it buut. . I kinda like not being in fights. My fiance is possessive. - Thu Dec  3 00:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You were my first choice anyway but I kno-- - Thu Dec  3 00:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Don't think she'd like that. - Thu Dec  3 00:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: O-oh... - Thu Dec  3 00:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looks apologetic.

"Sorry. . "* - Thu Dec  3 00:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I thought with me having taught her and us being friends... and like.. - Thu Dec  3 00:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...I don't know. - Thu Dec  3 00:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shrugs.

"I mean, she never said 'No.' But. . Yeah, she's extremely possessive of me. And I kinda like that she is. I mean, you could also, but you'd probably be better off asking someone else? -- But if you need another favor, I might be able to help!" He changes the subject, clearly feeling a bit bad about not being able to help a good friend.* - Thu Dec  3 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You can't talk to her and see what she will say? - Thu Dec  3 00:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Would it be better if I went to her? - Thu Dec  3 00:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Uh. I'm unsure, probably better if you do it.  - Thu Dec  3 00:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Although she's a fire cracker. . Thiscould end bad.. - Thu Dec  3 00:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You think she might go for it if I spoke with her? - Thu Dec  3 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Probably not. She wouldn't want to share any part of me. - Thu Dec  3 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Even if it's just donation. - Thu Dec  3 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Well, at least that's how I'd predict. - Thu Dec  3 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...that's really se--...er... nevemind. - Thu Dec  3 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Se? - Thu Dec  3 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Perhaps it's best I look elsewhere... this is pretty shitty... but I'l try and get ov--...selfish...*Sigh*. - Thu Dec  3 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'm trying not to talk badly about your fiance... I know you love her. - Thu Dec  3 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh. . Maybe. Yeah, she'll probably even admit that she's selfish with me. But hey, that's my finance. If she doesn't want me giving other people donations, I'd respect that. I mean, I wouldn't want her - Thu Dec  3 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: To be like a suggo-rat mom. - Thu Dec  3 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: There are just things I haven't particularly...enjoyed about her.  - Thu Dec  3 00:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Like? - Thu Dec  3 00:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Honestly.. being a surrogate mother and giving a sperm donation are very different... - Thu Dec  3 00:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: The mother has a connection to the baby due to the nine months and the birth. - Thu Dec  3 00:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You... would be giving me a cup of sperm... - Thu Dec  3 00:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: .... *Cough* - Thu Dec  3 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeah! But I know how Mirai is. She'd just look at the kid and be like. . 'So this is Sanoke's kid. . .I was supposed to be the only one.' Or something like that. - Thu Dec  3 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I know her too well. - Thu Dec  3 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...but it wouldn't be your kid... it's be Lera and my kid... ugh.. - Thu Dec  3 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I hate that mentality...  - Thu Dec  3 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No.. forget I said anything. - Thu Dec  3 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I don't want my child to have someone looking at them that way. - Thu Dec  3 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeah. I'm sorry! I really wish Icould help. - Thu Dec  3 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: But my hands are tied. - Thu Dec  3 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: It's fine... - Thu Dec  3 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: So. What issues have you two had in the past? - Thu Dec  3 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Yeah by your fiance who has you whipped. - Thu Dec  3 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Nothing... it's fine. - Thu Dec  3 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Forget I said anything. - Thu Dec  3 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I know she's pretty. . Hrm. .  Overbearing, and mean-spirited at times. - Thu Dec  3 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: She dumped me for her training.... - Thu Dec  3 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: She went and had someone else teach her. - Thu Dec  3 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Without informing me. - Thu Dec  3 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: She also treats you like shit. - Thu Dec  3 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Which I can't stand. - Thu Dec  3 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: She's rude to anyone who she isn't a direct friend with... I get that you said that's just her but it's a bit much. - Thu Dec  3 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: She's toxic. - Thu Dec  3 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Wow, I'm glad you care. But yeah, before she was being angry at me. - Thu Dec  3 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Because I was spending enough time with her. - Thu Dec  3 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I won't ever speak of these again because very soon she will be 'Mrs. Kazekage'....  - Thu Dec  3 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hah, it's cute. We ironed everything out the other day. - Thu Dec  3 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: It isn't just that, I've seen several times she treats you poorly.... - Thu Dec  3 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Eh. . . I'm going to retire sooner or later. - Thu Dec  3 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: yeah.. I'm sure you did...  - Thu Dec  3 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Who knows. Maybe you and or Lera will take up the mantle. - Thu Dec  3 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: She is so inconsiderate. I understand if you two have your issues but she made you walk over to her when you were having a conversation with me and chikyu. - Thu Dec  3 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Then you'll be 'Miss Kazekage.' Or something like that. - Thu Dec  3 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And then she has influenced Chikyu to do her bidding to make you go over. - Thu Dec  3 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: It isn't about being in charge, it isn't jealousy, it's just that I shouldn't be saying these things about someone that high up... but... you asked. - Thu Dec  3 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods.

"She's a bit overbearing! But. . Dunno, I got a thing for hard-headed women. And I'm numbed to it, 'cause my family members sometimes were worse. . " He exhales, briefly recalling his experiences as a child.

"All of your complaints are understandable. Not everyone can deal with her on a day to day basis."* - Thu Dec  3 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: -- But is it bad that she got a second teacher? Before, you were pretty pre-occupied with Aza and such. - Thu Dec  3 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I liked having a student... I don't care that she got another teacher but she didn't -tell- me. - Thu Dec  3 00:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: She just did it and never even informed me. - Thu Dec  3 00:35:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Seeing her name on the nurses roster. - Thu Dec  3 00:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh. .  - Thu Dec  3 00:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Tried talking to her about it? - Thu Dec  3 00:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What's the point... - Thu Dec  3 00:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Dunno. Good to iron out issues. - Thu Dec  3 00:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You two could be great friends, you never know. - Thu Dec  3 00:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I see it as hopeless... - Thu Dec  3 00:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: She doesn't want to be my friend. - Thu Dec  3 00:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Nonsense! - Thu Dec  3 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: --And sorry about up and walking away from you the other day. You're a friend, I was just determined to get past her angst. - Thu Dec  3 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Sanoke..she said hi to everyone but me when that happened. - Thu Dec  3 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Blah. . .No need to look too much into it. She and Chikyu are besties. - Thu Dec  3 00:43:05 2015
