<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) had followed along. His hands remained in pockets, and his eyes scanning the area for any potential traps or opponents. After some observation, there proved to be none, much to Sanoke's delight. 

After kneeling, a glance is provided to Koji, a known bearer of the Byakuan. "I suppose I'll leave it to ya to locate them? If not, I can have my summons look around. " He wasted no time, drawing an inkling of blood, and subsequently sending out two snapping turtles. They're slow, but seem to have a knack for digging through the ground. As this is done, they'er navigating around the sand already, as if to utilize magnetic senses to aid in the location of the terrorist.

Meanwhile, the summoner himself just gives glances about the region. This wasn't seeming to be a hard mission thus far.* - Fri Oct  9 18:18:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) was following behind the two.

He was as cool as ever, and pocketed his hands. No comments nor words are given. Instead, the two actual shinobi could handle the talking.* - Fri Oct  9 18:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blinked. The second someone came crashing through a window, his gaze had shifted over. On instict, a hand goes to grab his Kunai from a holster, and it's held defensively.

". . .Oi. This seems like a trap. Koji, you got a read? -- You're the leader, give us orders," he says, his head moving in a swivel to pick up on any suspicious activity. As a note, the male's eyes were refined and specialized, he could pick up on chakra on vision alone. Thus if there were any illusions, henges, or fuuinjutsu traps around, these could perhaps be picked up on.* - Fri Oct  9 18:54:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
It doesn't take long for Sanoke to take the intiative. Having no turtle shell on, he's at last able to move at full capacity. With a pivot, his body breaks off into a streak of blue, white and red. At this rate, he suffers very minor tunnel vision, but can generally keep a lock on his surrounding. 

Assuming that he's able to get close enough, a single seal is woven through. As that comes to an end, the chakra built up from the hand motion is emplyed to manipulate the wires that almost always were wrapped around his forearms. As they speed, the wires binding aims to wrap along the legs of the  of two of the fleeing individuals -- thus disabling movement. Was it going to be enough?

If that hadn't been effective, Sanoke was stilll in hot pursuit.* - Fri Oct  9 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) knows better than to leave Koji alone.

"Shit, we gotta split up. Koji! I leave Ganba to you, understand? He'll be backup!" the chunnin roars. After bitting his thumb, five simple seals are completed and a hand presses against the ground. Within the distance, the almighty Turtle Boss had been conjured -- his size modest compared to most summonings of this calibar.

Using it's chakra, the shell stands upright, granting the reptilian the ability to spin and crash right through the housing. Before hand, the insstructions to aid the Hyuuga in his battle are given. . . Hopefully it could be of use. 

Meanwhile? Sanoke continues to give chase a breakneck level of speed. It was surreal, and the rate of velocity could legitimately be confused with shunshin considering how ridiculously swift it was.* - Fri Oct  9 19:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Orien, Megan(Meekee) says: Damn they caught back up. - Fri Oct  9 19:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***KazeKage**(Ziare1) says: They stand no chance. - Fri Oct  9 19:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) finally comes to a stop.

"Geez. . . These guys are fast," he remarks, irritated by how far they had to run. Already, the boy found himself handicapped, as it appeared that his summoning was left to protect Koji -- after all, the Hyuuga was likely taking on the most powerful of the enemy. Briefly assessing the wsituation, he figures it's best not to do a massive, Area of Effect attack. The basket could possess the Daimyo, after all.

Instead, the chunnin again draws a weapon, his Tanto to be specific, and stares to the duo of criminals.

". . .Yeah. We're pretty fast. I'd hate to have to get violent, since that can lead to bad things for the both of us. Can you hand over the basket?" he asks somewhat casually, as if the crooks would actually comply.* - Fri Oct  9 19:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) frowns. He was kinda hoping to take this one on.

How tough could a puppeteer be? But Tetsumi had already taken the initative. Quickly, with a single seal formed, chakra runs through his form, allowing for the sudden acceleration to occur. In the event that Megan was truly occupied, the brashful teen would be more than capable of getting away, and speeding off into the horizon. 

His body continued to be a blur as it raced along the hot, desert-y terrain. Sunrays beated down fiercely upon his frame, yet the heat coming frm nature paled in comparison to the fire currently burning in his core. There was a person in danger!-- Even if it was probably just a snobby Daimyo that cared little for the average citizen. 

Zig-zagging around the area, he has no where to go but east. . .Would Sanoke be able to catch the fleeing 'Kazekage' in time?* - Fri Oct  9 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***KazeKage**(Ziare1) says: MMmm.. - Fri Oct  9 20:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***KazeKage**(Ziare1) says: You've made it... - Fri Oct  9 20:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) comes to a skidding stop. 

The friction leaves deep depressions along the grainy sand. "Phew. . . Caught ya! Anyway, this ends now. Give me the basket and we can just end this peacefully. No one has to get hurt," Sanoke says, aiming to reason.* - Fri Oct  9 20:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***KazeKage**(Ziare1) says: You want the basket? - Fri Oct  9 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***KazeKage**(Ziare1) says: How do you know you're not in a genjutsu? - Fri Oct  9 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***KazeKage**(Ziare1) says: You shouldn't be making orders. - Fri Oct  9 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Hrm? I should be able to tell if I'm in a genjutsu or not. .  - Fri Oct  9 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
The genjutsu begins to activate with swift effectiveness.

As a deceptively intelligent lad, in most cases, Sanoke would be able to see right through the illusion. But. . . His inner fearsp proved hard to overcome, especially as they were being exploited by such a sophsticated genjutsu. As the illusion sets in, Sanoke's vision grows hazy for just a second..

The false-Daimyo momentarily is forgotten about.

What was Sanoke's worse fear you'd ask?

Being alone. There existed silhouettes of his deceased companions, and more importantly, close relatives. In the center was his first girlfriend as well, Mirai Hokuma. In their appearance, none were even looking Sanoke's way. Instead, their backs had been turned, giving the teen the cold shoulder. THeir mouths begin to move, first beginning with hushed whispers and cryptic points. . . ridiculing and belittling the male.

"He's nothing. . . Just some punk from around the block. It isn't like he has any worth in the world. . . If he disappears, who would care?" 

Those cold words hit him like a ton of bricks, each sound being enough to release vicious assaults upon his spirits. Sanoke's body shook with frustration, as those that chatted negatively against him proceeded to walk away. It mirrored his childhood far too vividly -- as he was a child of neglect. One with no siblings to call his own, and parents far too busy adventuring and making discoveries than to spend time with their kid.

The omnious laughter littered the empty plain. . But rather. . . It serves as motivation. Standing up, the shinobi aims to function even as his fear is going fully force. Both fingers press together, spawning a single seal. . . 

"Shadow. . . Clone jutsu!" On command, four clones spawn. . . Yet. .  SAnoke lacks the ability to really move due to the paralyzing fear. Taking note of this, one of the doppleganger grabs a Kunai knife. . . 

"We don't got time for this!" And quite literally stabs him in the center of his palm in hopes of getting this fool's head into thegame.* - Fri Oct  9 20:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) caught the basket. . . He remained vigilante, having one of the clones swiftly go to release or open the container. Was the Daiymo in?

The real Sanoke still seems a bit shaken up. He's in both physical and mental pain, exhausted due to the mindfuckery that was genjutsu. . .

"Hng. ."* - Fri Oct  9 20:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) || Good thing he had a clone open it.

The contents combust immediately, releasing a massive explosion. It's by then that he can shake off his shortcomings as natural instincts take over. 

Adrenaline flowing, he kicks off the ground once more, his body breaking off into a streak of blue and white once more. Sadly, it isn't quite enough to escape the full brunt of the blast. His right arm would suffer nasty burns, along with the outer portion of his hips. Thankfully, it was better to just sustain those injuries, rather than actually dying.

It paid to be fast.* - Fri Oct  9 20:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) was on a single knee, his gaze glued to the ground.

The genjutsu had really done a number on him. The mental exhaustion forced everything heard to be. . . seen as somewhat incoherent. He wouldn't answer Jiki's question, at least not immediately.

The boy is breathing a bit heavy, and it's clear that the bulk of the damage came on the inside, rather than on the exterior.  "The Daimyo . . . -- He wasn't in the basket. This was a ruse, I think. . . As I opened it, the entire thing was rigged. . "* - Fri Oct  9 21:02:56 2015

A thumb moves, swiping under his nose before giving life to a spirited thumbs up. "Name's Sanoke.

"Hahah. Right, to make this fair, I'll battle you in your own element. We'll do this strictly with taijutsu," he says confidently. The turtle shell on his back is tossed onto the ground, releasing a massive quake. In this unrestrained form, Sanoke certainly had the ability or strength to keep at his range. Thus, if the going got tough, the boy was more than prepared to bolt. 

It doesn't take long for his knees to buckle, and the rest of his body to tense up for a basic stance. "Hope you like what you see. This is a stance my master has been tryin' to teach me. 'Turtle Style'. . . Get ready, and come at me with your full power, alright?" the chunnin instructs with a sly grin. He didn't think of Mirai as much of an opponent to be frank, hence his arrogance or general overconfidence.* - Sat Oct 10 03:20:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) wastes no time.

He releases a seal, conjuring up a table and several supplies. "Since you don't know the Finger Carving seal, i want ya to use the supplies here to mimic and follow me along."

On the table were two sets of ink brushes, and two thick bottles of ink. Sanoke takes one, while sending a sheet of paper along the table. "Alright. Fuuinjutsu is a very broad and versatile   category. To do it involves drawing symbols, and releasing chakra evenly along the symbol to make it do certain actions. For this, I'm going to teach you the basic seal, alright? So copy my hands carefully," the ex-shinobi explains.

Before long, his hands dip the ink brush into the bottle, forcing to to soak up the liquid. Soon after, Sanoke's hand is brushing along, inducing an inscription or glyph along the paper. He goes in a slow fashion, making a singular Kanji, one that translated into 'Contain', as this was a basic containment seal. 

"Alright. First I want you to copy this perfectly. Penmanship is important.  . the next part is instilling the instructions within the seal. This takes a great deal of chakra control, understand? I'll guide you through this process once you copy my basic seal."* - Sat Oct 10 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||"ALright. . .What's next is simple. You build up chakra, and glaze it over the seal evenly. There needs to be an equal amount distributed per the range. From this, you have to place the instructions, which is basically based on your will," he says, referencing the aspect of 'Yin Release', if Trilliam knew what the hell that was.

"What you do in terms of instructions here is to have chakra be released into the air, and effect the space itself. There would be a  dimensional void that you can seal objects in. The max capacity? Is based solely on how skilled you are. This shouldn't be too hard given your current level of skill . .. Practice doing this seal, and instilling your chakra. Once done, you place an object in the center."

A kunai is conjured, and set on the center of the sealing glyph. 

"To make this get sealed, you also apply chakra onto the object -- and the quantity again has to be as even as humanly possible. Assuming you can do this while activating the seal, the object will be stored away for a long way. As per usual, the more skilled you are, the larger amount of items you can store at once. Get it? Now give it a try."

Of course, he doesn't mention the process of release, considering it would probably be self explanatory.* - Sat Oct 10 06:09:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) (*Sanoke rolled his eyes.

"Hahah. Right, to make this fair, I'll battle you in your own element. We'll do this strictly with taijutsu," he says confidently. The turtle shell on his back is tossed onto the ground, releasing a massive quake. In this unrestrained form, Sanoke certainly had the ability or strength to keep at his range. Thus, if the going got tough, the boy was more than prepared to bolt. 

It doesn't take long for his knees to buckle, and the rest of his body to tense up for a basic stance. "Hope you like what you see. This is a stance my master has been tryin' to teach me. 'Turtle Style'. . . Get ready, and come at me with your full power, alright?" the chunnin instructs with a sly grin. He didn't think of Mirai as much of an opponent to be frank, hence his arrogance or general overconfidence.*)* - Sat Oct 10 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
"You talk so proper. It makes me smile," the teen notes, as if completely disregarding her entire conversation.

There's a small lapse in conversation, before he inevitably speaks up once more. "I don't think I can beat ya with just taijutsu. . . I -know- hahah. You ain't there yet, Mirai. Show me the true power of the Hokuma clan, though," Sanoke said with a playfully snide tone. His teeth clenched together, barely staving off a giant grin.

His brow twitches in annoyance as he can tell what the hand gesture meant. She wanted him to come to her, much to his chargin. "Y'know. . . I'm told the best offense is a good defense. But eh, I'll indulge ya--" He hardly waits for the sentence to be complete. With a slight motion, his momentum quickly accelerates, granting him the ability to break off into a blur or streak. For most people a clear view of his body would be impossible, yet it remained to be seen if the Byakugan could properly perceive the rate in which he moved.

Tssshh!

Sand is held sliding, simply due to Sanoke's swift momentum coming to a stop. The high level of velocity forces at least a galloon's worth of grain to be tossed into the air, and a significant gust of wind to flow around the battle field for just a moment. This event could likely tip Mirai off of his location -- but just as the boy had landed, a simple palm thrust is being sent towards the girl's ribs.

Hit or miss, Sanoke is quick to follow up. His body breaks into another blur, this time spinning to build up speed for a kick. His right leg extends, kicking at the back of Mirai's knee in hopes of tripping her up.* - Sat Oct 10 06:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Well . ..

That. . . was. . . new! "Oh shit!" With his eyes, he could clearly see the build up of chakra. Sadly, it was far too late, considering his unpreparedness. In no time, there's a transparent pulsation of chakra. Just that alone is enough to force Sanoke to stagger back, losing balance, he's preparing for an evacuation. "What the fuck. . Is this jutsu--" Then the spinning had began.

Due to the rotations, the chakra takes a more concentrated form. An azure colored sphere of pure spinning destruction is ongoing, and thus sends his body packing. Skidding through the skies, Sanoke eventually tumbles along the ground, his body partially scratched and marred due to the strength and suddeness. Shakingly, the teen arises back to his feet, and looks on with mild surprise. "Alright. . . Alright. . . Not gonna lie. You got me good on that one," retorted the fun-loving shinobi with a grin. He was impressed, although angry at himself at the same time for being so wreckless.

Once more, the snow-haired teen falls into a stance of his own, this time waiting for Mirai to come to him. "Now you try me!"* - Sat Oct 10 07:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Mirai was good.

But Sanoke was just a tad bit too experienced. He wore that same confident smile even as the Hokuma charged in, sending a spine-chilling gaze with those beautiful lavander eyes. Still, the glare wasn't going to unnerve Sanoke to the point where he'd find movement impossible. 

Indeed, this was going to be one the first times in ever that Mirai would be able to see the chunnin's true ability. 

Dexterously, he steps back, his eyes scanning and picking apart her stance. Just as a hand is thrusted, Sanoke jukes away, allowing the chakra-cladded hand to miss it's mark by a hair. "Tooo slooowwwwww," taunted the immature teenager. Moving in unison with the attack, his body does a rotation again, allowing him to spin out of harms way, while gearing up his leg for a strike. Once more? It flies, this time with the intent on slamming into the Hokuma's ribs or waist area.

"Take this!" Of course, while not a taijutsu specialist, the blow was relative quick -- about as fast as Mirai's own. How would she deal with the threat? Assuming she hadn't move, his right hand falls out of a fist, and strickens. It swipes through the air, delivering a cross chop to the neck to make her all uncomfortable. The neck was pretty sensitive, after all.* - Sat Oct 10 07:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) || He had gotten comfortable, a bit -too- comfortable. "Haha! Boom! Man, it feels good to be such a great shinobi! Haha!" Sanoke cheered, clearly having some form of enjoyment when it came to this fast-paced spar. His leg would have settled down after the kick, and his arms reel inward so that he can be build up momentum for sequence assaults.

Despite being more than capable of running circles aroound Mirai for fun, he stayed put, not even gathering any space nor distance to better defend himself. That arrogance would force him to pay the price. Briskly, another chakra-cladded palm is being sent his way. 

In all of his showboating, the immature Turtle Summoner fails to register the blow immediately, thus interferening with his reaction time. Just barely, he avoids a direct collision with his stomach, forcing the palm to slam into the rib or waist region. But even that is a pain, sending waves of chakra through is flesh, completely and utterly bypassing any defenses his natural bodily cells may have offered up. 

It attacks the chakra system, perhaps being able to cut off a tenketsu or two. But what more, the Gentle Fist attacks his body internally, sending waves of pain through the shinobi's frame. He cringes and instinctively begins to backpeddle at a fast pace to gain some space. "OOWW! What. . .The-- What the hell was that? It's like you just took some needles and started to pound my inside," complained Sanoke in an exasperated tone.

Regardless, his fists rise up once more. 

It's obvious that the reeling pain is bothering him, perhaps being able to have an effect on his overall battle ability during the course of the spar. "At least I know to avoid now. . . at all costs."* - Sat Oct 10 08:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Things were getting bad-- but it was far from over.

His eyes open a bit wide as it seemed Mirai had entered a trance, her focus presumably being unwavering. Still cringing a bit from the assault, it isn't until the Hokuma's hand cocks back that Sanoke makes his move. Fighting in taijutsu purely -- while manageable -- wasn't the best course of action. The two were in par, with the summoner simply having better reaction time.

Sadly, he had no intent on using his full physical strength to inflict damage on his loved one. . . Likewise, Mirai's Gentle Fist proved to be indiscriminate, thus making enduring impossible.  In a flash, he flickered out of sight as his body contorts, making the strike miss it's mark.

Due to Mirai's Byakugan, she'd clearly be able to tell where Sanoke had gone -- towards the air. No more using pure taijutsu, this wasn't going to do him anygood. Instead, as he's airbourne, the warrior strings through a set of handseals, each one manipulating his chakra in a precise manner. On the last, wires come whirring out, about four strands in particularly. They assault different portions of the body, while aiming to constrict and take away all of Mirai's mobility.

"Hah! Bet you thought you heard me say only taijutsu. But I also whispered 'ninjutsu too'!" What an explanation.* - Sat Oct 10 08:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) lands on his feet.

He allows the wires to be released shortly after. "Good fight. .-- And nah, I won. Don't try to cheat me of my win," he says in an untroubled tone. "No need to be a sore loser, geez," a hand moves, going to flick the girl softly on the nose.

Shortly after, both hands rest ontop of his head, and casually, he's moving towards the south. "Anywhooo. Let's go turn in this mission. Even if Hassan is a sleep, we can report to like a secretary or something. I'm sure you'll be able to win next time."* - Sat Oct 10 08:49:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) would have chatted idly as they made their way back to the general public. Briefly, Sanoke -- grabbing Mirai along -- goes into the mansion, turning in a mission completion.

"Alright. We battled, I managed to beat her. Mission done. She's pretty good though," he says with a confident wink towards the assistant. They'd move out shortly after.* - Sat Oct 10 08:53:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) scratches his head.

"Manipulating loosen earth. .  You mean like Hiding like a Mole?"* - Sat Oct 10 18:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: In mole, you loosen the earth...so you would manipulate solid earth into loosened earth. - Sat Oct 10 18:05:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'm a pretty thick-headed guy when it comes to elemental things. Be warned. - Sat Oct 10 18:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And I'm not the greatest teacher, so we will take it as we go. - Sat Oct 10 18:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looked ahead to Yan who was forming a large array of different seals. Each time a new seal is formed, the formation is comitted to memory. He's like a freaking camera, each blink being enough to take a mental photograph to ensure that he's enabled to recycle the memories when the going got tough.

This was a skill he had picked up on pure instinct due to his exploits in the academy. The tutelage in Kirigakure often demanded swift absorption of knowledge, lest the student truthfully wish to be left behind. Quickly, he jots down the needed handseals, and goes to practice the technique on his own.

Obviously, Yan wasn't too bright of a teacher. The information still was helpful nonetheless. Teaching him in a thorough fashion, Sanoke nods along, muttering the instructions to commit those thoughts to memory. Generally, this as a 'basic' level Doton technique, on the same levels with the 'Hiding like a Mole' technique. Mind you, 'basic' was far from 'elementary'.

Generally, the information provided was what you'd expect. Due to the nature of Doton Release, the user had the innate ability to manipulate the properties of all things earth-- meaning attributes such as hardness, weight, consistency, and the list went on. For this jutsu, you were manipulating two properties, the shaping, and the density. "Alright. . So just gotta make up rocks then send them forward. Easy enough. . ."

As a 'C - ranked' technique, Sanoke is visibly struggling. His hands presses against the ground at last, prompting chakra to be pumped directly into ground  itself. The flooring shakes and growls, before bits of sand eventually form into Sand Stones. They're at about the mass of of a fist and they're levitating. Before long, he sends a signal, forcing each of the stones to be released forward. 

They move weakly, due to Sanoke's lack of skill in general, and his inexperience with this particularly technique. Rather than soaring, tiny pebbles meekly fall onto the ground just a few short paces away. "Blah. I'll work on this later."* - Sat Oct 10 19:50:49 2015
