After being given the bright idea of reaching out to other villages as well as to visit his old Home, Sanoke obliges. A small sum of Yen is utilized, allowing a cozy caravan to be employed.With ease, the duo move along kilometers of land, eventually reaching the Land of Water.

It was a lengthy travel, taking roughly two and half days, but in the end, Sanoke had raeched where he desired.

Kirigakure was just as secured as Suna, thus the duo has to go through a slew of guards and checks to enter. If possible, they'd be able to reach the Mizukage in order to check in.* - Sat Nov 28 09:41:58 2015

It doesn't take long to reach one of the docks. There's an empty boat up ahead, and the water flows restlessly beneath the bridge.

"Aww. I was going to suggest a competition. But now it'd be unfair. I can show ya how, I suppose," Sanoke replies. The fishing rod is held to Mirai for the taking.

"--Well, at least this method. Sometimes it's fun to just hop in and go chasing after fishes. It's also good training."* - Sat Nov 28 10:10:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) moves to take a wiggly worm. It's pressed against the edge of his of his rod.

"Alright. Let's see if we can get this done in about fifteen minutes. . ." 

With whipping wrists, the rod is swiped through the air, with the fishing line flying into the water-- several feet away from Sanoke. It dips right through the liquid's surface, and dangles within the oceanic body, awaiting someone or something take the bait.

Rules:
Using dice rolls.


1 - 2: Old Boot

3 - 6: Fish is actually attracted. Will two times again to determine size of fish.* - Sat Nov 28 10:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) exercised use of his consistently active Rinnegan. With the doujutsu activated, Sanoke was more than capable of actually reading the chakras that roamed within the water.

Deviously, this enables him to locate a fish with ease -- and before long, it's hooked! "D-Damn! This one feels like a strong one! I think I caught like a shark!"* - Sat Nov 28 10:40:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) struggled!

"Hng! I can feel it! I can tell, this is the fish that will pierce the heavens! It's like I'm trying to reel in a freaking whale!" the Kazekage complained, his body dipping forward, and facial features contorting uncomfortable.  He was being pulled in-- but before that could come to fruition, his rinnegan is activated.

Additional limbs spawn out of nowhere, giving a mighty tug! In no time, a fish is pulled right from the water, no doubt slinging and smacking Sanoke right in the face. A good six-inched perch.

"Phew. . . Beat that."* - Sat Nov 28 10:47:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) again uses his rinnegan to aid in location a fish.

In no time, one takes his bait, and is reeled right on in! It's nearly ten inches in length, and is settled right onto the docks!

"Hah! You didn't even get a fish. . You got some nasty old boot. Does that mean I win by default?"* - Sat Nov 28 10:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) says: Haha! Boot, boot. . Boot! So I win. - Sat Nov 28 10:57:55 2015

He starts off, grading each test one by one. In the end, Kuro is the first written up, with a less than adequate score of. . .5/10! "Wow. . This kid is dumb. . . "

From there, Sanoke continued to look over the papers, giving his own personal opinion. The scores go as followed. . .

Momura: 7/10
Mizora:  8/10
Ai: 6.5/10
Kinami: 7.5/10* - Sun Nov 29 00:37:07 2015

"Alright. The scores are as followed. . "

"Kuro! A score of 5. . ."
"Ai, shockingly a score of 6.5. . ."
"Momura with a score of 7 . . .!"
"Mizora with a score of 8!"
"And the high point person, Kinami. A whooping score of 8.5."* - Sun Nov 29 00:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) says: The scores will be posted on the school's  board in a bit. - Sun Nov 29 00:39:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) nods.

"There are three parts to the test. Each one with a maximum of ten points each. You can get a score of thirty, but for now. . All you need is 20 over the three tests in order to be eligible for chunnin -- but even then, that's not automatic. In addition, the score is subjected to rise if my assistants or men want igher quality shinobi."

He then hears the question, and smiles.

"I can't tell you all that. There are still people that need to make up the test. But it has a legitimate purpose. . . Everyone here did poorly on that, however."* - Sun Nov 29 00:44:48 2015
