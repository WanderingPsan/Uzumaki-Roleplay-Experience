However, it'd seem that the moment she was prepared to begin with the procedure, Mirai had sprung back to life. Instead, Kiyoko merely demonstrates.

His gaze falls onto the Hokuma now. "So, you got me?"* - Fri Nov 13 06:33:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) flicks ahead like a phantom.

His body stops just before Mirai. Once in place, he kneels, wrapping a hand around the book(s), perhaps struggling due to the weight.

"Geez.. This is a lot of reading."* - Fri Nov 13 07:53:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) tilts his head.

"For what?"* - Sun Nov 15 17:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: For the time of need. - Sun Nov 15 17:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blinks.

"Huh. . Since the when hell did ya care about 'needs' of other people? Wait, I'm going to assume you meant yourself," Sanoke retorts in a re-assured tone of voice. His hand is held out, palm facing towards the skies.

With a single burst of chakra, a specialized scroll is released. It holds the Kame Cove insignia on it's spine, signifying it's importance.

"Alright. This is a special training tool I used to aid in gaining Ganba in my personal summoning. Personals tend to be a bit more difficult to conjure since they have actual fighting potential. This one, while not the strongest has other uses, mainly for defensive purposes and distractions--"He stops prematurely. With that, the scroll is finally unwinded so that Kana could view the contents.

"What this scroll is meant to do is aid in your ability to conjure him. A large part of bringing forth stronger creatures is releasing high quantity of chakra. What more, you have to keep it compact and going in one uniformed location -- targeting a single chunk of space to produce the space-time technique. It's easier said than done, since a lot of people can just toss a giant surge of chakra. The difficult part? Is maki8ng sure it's controlled and concentrated."

A hand is held out, and azure-tinted energy flows around each of his digits. Wasting no time, Sanoke's hand presses onto the smooth sheets. "It's specialized to react to your chakra. Based on how well you do, a sealing glyph will form and spread out. Clearly, the more able youare, the further the symbols will go. Overall, your goal is to make sure that the symbol appears and stretches out from the center to each end of the scroll."

For reference, the scroll had a width and length of one foot all around. It wasn't -that- difficult. Of course, given the nature of the task, Kana probably would find herself suffering from exhaustion. "If you can do that, I'll help you some more. You got a month to get this done," the instructor replies.* - Sun Nov 15 17:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) rolled his eyes at the gesture.

"And what's the hurry? You act like an alien invasion is coming this evening."* - Sun Nov 15 18:03:18 2015

"Took me about a month of trainign, like I said. Now tell me, what's the rush?"* - Sun Nov 15 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) thinks: A month? Tch . . Guess I'll avoid it till I have time to do so. - Sun Nov 15 18:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) catches.

He seals the scroll on back. "Should be at the square," the teen stated with a blank expression. There was something odd going on with this chick..* - Sun Nov 15 18:09:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||His eyes open widely at the sudden rotation.

It wasn't long until chakra had been seeping out, pushing and sending momentum to presumably defend against the hordes of attacks or hostilities the child potentially would face. Sanoke stepped back in recoil, with both arms jutted out. 

The chakra that rammed would find itself subtly being pilfered away, and being assimilated into Sano's own body. Still, surprised, the teen is stumbling backwards, a slick grin manifesting onto his facial features. "Hahaha! That's awesome! And you're only like -FIVE- right?"

Clearly, the elder shinobi was very much impressed. It wasn't often that some runt could use such a nifty technique, with such proficiency as that, mind you. "-- I guess all of the Hokuma are innately talented."* - Sun Nov 15 18:33:10 2015
