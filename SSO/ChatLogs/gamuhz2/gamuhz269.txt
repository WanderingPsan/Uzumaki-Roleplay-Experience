<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Was just teaching your sister gentle fist. - Sun Dec 13 01:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Manami(JustTheTip) says: Mama Gentle Fist is punches right?! - Sun Dec 13 01:14:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Taku(Punkamainia) says: Hey. Is Gentle Fist that palm attack you were teaching me earlier? - Sun Dec 13 01:15:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) smiles.

"That right. . .! Chakra!" His hand is held out, releasing a thick stream of energy onward to Miaka's body. It would warm up her frame, and naturally did no harm.

"Cool, ain't it?"* - Sun Dec 13 01:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: How about you two spar. - Sun Dec 13 01:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blinks.

"What. . What do you want me to do with my chakra?" He kneeled, looking ahead with curious, cerulean eyes. The flow of chakra from before had ceased. 

Given that Miaka was three, she'd probably be able to answer.* - Sun Dec 13 01:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nodded. It was a simple request.

After doing a trio of seals, a plum of chakra shrouds his form. And as it clears,. Sanoke wasi n the form of a general horse. Albeit, he was smaller than normal. 

"NYEEH!"* - Sun Dec 13 01:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) sported a loud grin as Miaka seemed to react in amazement. It was just a basic Henge technique. He hardly flinches as Miaka goes to hop over onto the 'horse's' back.

"Hah! I'm not a horse really, Miaka. Hey, if you want, I can show you an evencooler 'pet'? Ganba loves children!"* - Sun Dec 13 01:45:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: . . I don't care about learning it. It's just inconvenient. - Sun Dec 13 07:16:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: . . I mean, I never said you couldn't. I was rebuffing your claim that you're easy to find. But whatever, I'll go by your terms. - Sun Dec 13 07:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) whispers: Just send them to me. I've seen Mirai so many times around. Kiyoko not so often. But I have to talk with her aswell.  - Sun Dec 13 07:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Okay. - Sun Dec 13 07:21:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Nah. - Sun Dec 13 07:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) whispers: For keeping the secret to yourself. - Sun Dec 13 07:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: No problem. - Sun Dec 13 07:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2)  Incase I have to fight Kana.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
And conveniently. . Sanoke is moving to the scene?

Naturally, many of the shinobi stared daggers at Kana.  Nevertheless, there wasn't a soul that was going to act on her just yet. In no time, however, the would be Sennin had arrived. Appearing in a plum of smoke, the male just looked downward, shaking his head in disapproval.

"Wow. Why'd you turn out to be such an ass wipe? Tch."

He felt shamed, particularly for teaching Kana the ways of the turtles! . . Well, kinda.* - Sun Dec 13 07:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) rolled his eyes back -- although it's a lot more forced and awkward.

"Seems legit. I was about to give you the wedgie of a life time. But you've done some bad things, mate-- Or so I'm told. Come inside, and have a chat with the bosses?" He says casually.

Of course, on the inside, there was a lot of internal conflict. In a way, Kana was charming -- enough to make Sanoke fond of her, in a not-so-romantic way. 

"Please? I don't wanna have to fight you."* - Sun Dec 13 07:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Apologise to me for. . .? - Sun Dec 13 08:12:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Well then, 'big brother' has to learn to not stalk personal information. - Sun Dec 13 08:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) scratches his nose.

He's really in an internal debate. "Hng. I dunno, I think I should capture you. But you came here all chill and stuff. You're the person that wrecked Konoha, right? You at least have to pay for repairs."* - Sun Dec 13 08:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: I'm pretty sure you guys didn't pay for Kumogakure's repairs. - Sun Dec 13 08:19:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: So why should I pay then? - Sun Dec 13 08:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Because you attacked for no reason? Rias never did anything to Kirigakure. - Sun Dec 13 08:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: I attacked Konoha as a whole because of what happened to Kumogakure. - Sun Dec 13 08:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: They requested my assistance. - Sun Dec 13 08:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: I lended it. - Sun Dec 13 08:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: You can go beef it out with them if you want, I have nothing to do with it anymore. - Sun Dec 13 08:22:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You attacked after everything had been settled. - Sun Dec 13 08:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: I told you, I had other things to do. - Sun Dec 13 08:23:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: It was delayed. - Sun Dec 13 08:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: That's not cool, y'know. - Sun Dec 13 08:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) scratches the back of his nape.

"Yeah. I don't think Ican let you go, you know."* - Sun Dec 13 08:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
And of course, things went from bad to worse.

With his rinnegan, Sanoke can quite easily see the build up of chakra. The second, Kana began to  work on her release, Sanoke manuevered to use an equally as reactive technique -- and one that could cover a wide area as well. Immediately, the young kunoichi found giant slabs of earth protruding through the ground-- each one going in a circular fashion to connect and form a Dome.

Naturally, Sanoke's chakra was especially potent, aided in part by his Rinnegan eyes. 

The goal? To incase Kana before the jutsu can spread. Given the earth's element advantage over water, the difference in power was adequately dealt with. As the roaring liquids came rushing in, it'd find itself being stunted in it's pathway, and thus doing nothing more than flooding Kana herself.

Regardless of the effects, the Earthen Corridor also served as a viel of protection to Sanoke -- who remained certainly capable of maneuvering should the attempt not have been effective.  If the jutsu continued to bumrush ahead, the turtle Sennin leaps into the air, avoiding a direct collision given how swiftly he can get up.* - Sun Dec 13 08:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
And the dome was a success, briefly saving Sunagakure from imminent destruction! "Blah. . I fuckin' retired for a reason. . Now let me show you this other jutsu I wanted to teach ya. . !"

Quickly, Sanoke bite down on his thumb, drawing that special nectar. At once, with the blood being drawn, the former Kazekage went through a quicks sequence of seals -- five in total. With the final being performed,  a black sealing glyph manifests over the region, unleashing a large plum of smoke. As it clears, a gigantic. . a gargantuan creature had been summoned.

His weight was enough to collapse a large chunk of the village's gate-- and on top, Sanoke stood proud. "Alright! Ganatora, there's a monster on the inside of that thing. I'm going to hide inside of ya if she uses some giant ass jutsu again. . Understood?  -- Meanwhile, lets flood this shit!" The Kame Sennin stated with some vigor. Brief instructions are supplied, and the scroll containining a portion of his Water-Proof Explosion Mines was clutched. 

Working off the master's command, Ganatora was swift to form or build up chakra. His hind legs lift upward, before slamming, funneling Doton CHakra long the earth. "Earthquake technique!" The goal was simple! To break apart the ground itself, the holes perhaps being large and wind en ough to force the massive Suiton technique to be drained, and thus no longer an issue! 

Would it work?* - Sun Dec 13 09:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: to try and - Sun Dec 13 09:26:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
In the end, Sanoke again had to play hero for the village hidden in the sand!

And he kinda disliked that. Given that all of the NPCs in the area seemed to be a sleep and thus could not erect an earthen barrier to defend, Sanoke and Ganatora were forced to deal with the threat alone

Following his commander's commentary, both of the shinobi worked in unison. Doton chakra is exercised to the fullest, and once more, and Earthen Corridor was effected. Naturally, before it could fully form, Kana was already surfing away in the sand. Of course, the water is again surpressed, and given that this was a double-effort? Chances of it failing was slim.

From there, Sanoke looked onward, annoyed that his former student was presumably escaping.* - Sun Dec 13 09:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) goes to eat the water!

Chakra based was his meal! "Mmm. . .-- Ganatora! You want some? We can crack a hole in if you want to take a bite! This shit tastes sweet! . . .So wait?  Does that mean Kana's insides taste good. . ? Hrm... I wonder what would happen if I ate her--"

"You're an idiot. Next time, try a little harder."

Ganatora, with a huff, disperses.* - Sun Dec 13 09:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Eh... - Sun Dec 13 09:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: That was a pain. - Sun Dec 13 09:56:25 2015

He turns to Mirai. "So we were heading out? -- Oh! Can I show Miaka my special summoning? I'm sure she'll like it," he says with a hearty chuckle, clearly anticipating Miaka's excited reaction to the specialized technique.

And suddenly, the two were blurring. Miaka would fully be enabled to witness her father's impeccable speed. It was this same quality that had made this shinobi a force to be reckoned with, and perhaps one of the more potent warriors that could be offered -- at least by Non-Gezo standards. 

In no time at all, Sanoke had arrived in a more secluded area, although still within Sunagakure borders. Eagerly, he clutched at Miaka's side, ensuring that she was secured and held away from danger. Following this up, his his hand bitten, drawing the small amount of blood required in the manipulation of the summoning technique. From this connection, the flow of chakra runs, and rushes into the air, inducing a powerful, space-time based technique.'
