Unlike the others, Sanoke sprung into action immediately. His body was just as refined as Macbeth -- his velocity more than capable of matching the Huevo Spawn step-for-step. 

For those onlooking, he'd be seen as nothing more than a blur of white. Despite the swiftness, the retired shinobi is still quite in control, and thus with ease, he manuevers through the crowd. Upon reaching Hassan's side, his hands clap together, taking advantage of his manipulation of FUuton Release. A relatively small gust would be produced -- but it spawns near instantly, and thus would force the swords man to relocate!

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||And things got interesting.

His feet kick off  the ground, each step pushing him closer and closer. At some points, it was as if his legs never even reached the flooring.

Mid-stride, Sanoke's hands reaches down, grabbing a scroll. Casually, he releases the contents, allowing for a thick layering of cloth to rush forward. All with the intent of wrapping around Leo's figure and keep his body restained.* - Fri Nov  6 23:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) says: Hello again, m'lady! - Fri Nov  6 23:04:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Static seems to flicker from Sanoke's form as his lower body does a subtle pivot.

Quickly, it's as if his body had essentially disappeared. A blur moves, arc-ing in a circular fashion, before eventually prompting the shinobi towards the north west. The flames from before? Likely do their thing, forming a wall as a detriment. But all the same, Sanoke was gone.

Second time was the charm. Hopefully out of view, after releasing a short flow of chakra, the clothing roll again shoots from his scroll, intent on wrapping thoroughly about Leo's body. Why not end this battle in a peaceful fashion?

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) pats the binding of Cloth. It seemed sturdy. "Sweet! First time I've used that on a real person. I'll leave it to Koji from here, though. ."

"Sometimes, you have to kill the bad guy, y'know? Like the Swordsman from yesterday, or the abominations that keep leavingt the Labrinth. But this, I don't think needs to be. Hassan is just a hardass a lot of the times," he offered to the blue haired girl.

Having said his piece, Sanoke's gaze falls onto Koji. "Anywho. When you got him back at the cells, let me know? And give me instructions on how you want him to be restrained. Fuuinjutsu is pretty versatile."* - Fri Nov  6 23:28:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shrugs. He motions Momura to follow him to the training field.

Along the way, the shinobi murmured, making small talk. "Say. You came from Kirigakure, right?"* - Sat Nov  7 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: Y-Yep. - Sat Nov  7 02:18:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) crouches a bit.

He balls one hand into a fist, while the other merely is held behind his back. "I'll go easy for now. Your move, 'kay? And no need to fear. I'm not here to hurt you. "* - Sat Nov  7 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: Sanoke seems like a good guy.. - Sat Nov  7 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: I trust my friends, but outside that circle, I've learned to be vigilant. I'm not saying anything really other than to be mindful. I wasn't really trying to say that but it's something to keep in mind. You never know with people. - Sat Nov  7 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He remained in place, eying Momura as she came in for a blow.

Of course, his eyes casually pick apart Momura's current stancing -- as it was filled with errors and holes. With ease, his body pivots, speeding around in the typical path, which was that of a semi-circle. 

Unnecessarily fast? Maybe. But everyone knew Sanoke loved to show off. Having evaded the blow, the male stood back, this time bringing his OTHER ARM behind his back. "Please tell me that wasn't all, right> You got to come at me faster than that if you want a shot at making this competitive. Try again," the boy said with a scofff, although still retaining his light-hearted tone.* - Sat Nov  7 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: O-Oh.. - Sat Nov  7 02:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) whispers: (15.2 damage - Sat Nov  7 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||They were close. And it'd be a difficult jutsu to avoid. 

Sadly, speed and reaction timing wasn't exactly where Sanoke struggled. Immediately, his momentum picked up, so much that his body literally flickered like a light-bulb, and at times it looked as if he was sliding rather than actually moving his feet. Again, the teen moved towards the east, each pace leaving an imprint left along the ground.

After evading, the boy paused for just a moment, waving friendily.

Soon after, momentum is picked right on up, allowing Sanoke to land towards the right of Momura. Casually, his body breaks into a twirl, sending a sweeping kick at her ankles to slam her body into the sand.* - Sat Nov  7 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) thinks: Thanks, they say i'm better at fire style than her! So..maybe I should keep it on the low low. - Sat Nov  7 02:40:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) does a few flips, and stops a few paces away from Momura. "Wooow! You're done already?"* - Sat Nov  7 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: I-I'm r-really weak in sandy areas..B-But I can keep going..! - Sat Nov  7 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Grasps his Tanto.

Speedily, it's charged with Fuuton chakra, and swipes, cutting the Wires. 

"--Wire Bind!? That was Noriko's! Where did you get it?"* - Sat Nov  7 02:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looked on strangely as Momura continued rushing towards him. As usual, Sanoke was having an easy time competing with the woman. Rather than dodging, his right arm sped through the skies, swatting the blow right on out of the way.

"---Huh. Guess it's been spreaded in her absence. Pity. -- Show me some more cool techniques!" Sano demanded childishly.

Once the strike had been repelled, he's taking a step back to provide a much needed cushion.* - Sat Nov  7 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: L-Let me punch you..And I w-will.. - Sat Nov  7 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm? That could be dangerous, though! My sensei always told me, no matter how durable you are, never willingly take a hit. - Sat Nov  7 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Jukes to the right.

It misses -- although if there was chakra being built up, or utilized for Sanoke was easily able to hear it, y'know.* - Sat Nov  7 02:53:39 2015
