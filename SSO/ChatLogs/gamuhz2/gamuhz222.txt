<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) bites his thumbs meanwhile.

Chakra funnels from his hands, infusing itself with the blood, and thus granting the bond that had been earned  from the summoning contract.

He presses a hand onto the floor, unleashing a massive sealing glyph that spreads. As it reaches the end point, a plume of smoke spawns, eventually subsiding and conjuring up a turtle. Of course, this was just a grunt, rather than an offensively capable summon.

"Gojo! What's up! You're getting big man." The reptilian stood at a simple two feet in terms of width and height. 

"I-I. . Am? T-thank you--"

"Enough chit-chat! You're going to be a test dummy! I believe in you!" Sanoke blurts off, cutting the timid turtle's commentary short. A thumbs up is given to Ai, granting her the go ahead to test. 

"As for the new guy. . Uh. I know a few techniques, yeah. I mean, I'd have to know ya before I even considered teaching you, however," Sanoke replies, his gaze now onto Daiki.* - Sat Oct 17 20:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) sighs.

He relents, figuring he could indulge the girl. One seal is formed, spawning two Shadow Clones. "Alright . . . Just having these here incase I can't trust ya."

Meanwhile,a few more seals are done shortly after -- apparently doing nothing. "Let's do this fast, though. Been holdin' my lady up long enough," he replies, giving Ai the go ahead to try her technique.* - Sat Oct 17 21:36:12 2015

Instead, his body blurs, blocking off the path.

Clapping his hand together, chakra funnels and sends the wires speeding from his sleeve. The target, you may ask? Shin. Like wild parasites, each of the items seek to wrap about his arms and legs, binding him, and pulling the boy forward.

Quickly, he moves about, taking a seat onto the sandy floor, while motioning for Tetsumi to come closer.

"Alright. Let's try this again, I'm sure you recall my teachings from before. Right?" Sanoke asks, although he doesn't sit to wait for an answer. Just as done the last outing, his eyes fall shut briefly, prompting the chakras in his body to begin gaining activity, and navigating around his body. This was a gradual process, one that consistently gave a boost to his overall chakra control prowess, but also provided the sage-hopeful with the needed wisdom to excel in Genjutsu as well.

"So close your eyes. . . and put your mind on peaceful things. Like a serene river flowing in a meadow. Slowly descend into your subsconious, where your fears and true identity can be viewed without a. . . a filter. That way, you can tackle the problem head on -- assuming you haven't gotten to the root of your nightmares already from the jump," he instructs. 

On the inside, Sanoke honestly was in a struggle. He wanted Tetsumi to have been able to overcome the fears. . . But he also wanted to be witness -- so you can imagine the disappointment that was to come had Tetsumi proven able to master this all on his own.* - Sun Oct 18 03:02:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: *cough* - Sun Oct 18 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hey guys. - Sun Oct 18 03:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I'm going to go to konoha. - Sun Oct 18 03:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Bye. - Sun Oct 18 03:29:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
They're meditating. Be patient, fgt. Of Tetsumi's rp.* - Sun Oct 18 03:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) couldn't see the SHukaku, no doubt.

But there was this strange feeling that rushed through the air, and ran along his flesh. Goose bumps manifested along his flesh, and a chill again runs down Sanoke's spine. But with this, there was also a clear change.

As Sanoke's doujutsu read the chakra, it didn't appear as if Tetsumi was no longer in control, or in a struggle. Had the boy done it. . ? Had he tamed the nightmares that haunted his dreams? If not just partially. At once, the boy leaps up, standing on his two feet and takes a quick first step ahead. "S'up, Izanami. Don't mind me, just helping this guy tackle his Demons. . ' Sanoke declared, while leaning in to scan Tetsumi a bit more closely.'

All seemed well, and honestly. . . It was looking as if the male's work here was done. Tetsumi offeredn o signs of distress, be it on the physical front -- in the form of grimaces, twitching, or disgruntled facial expressions. . . Nor on the spiritual fron. Looking at the flow of chakra on the inside, it seemed as if the young male had retained a complete equilibrium in terms of chakra output. "Curious. . . Tetsumi! I think you're done, I don't see any stress or fluxuation in your chakra -- which typically suggests fear."

A hand rests onto the Sand Manipulator's head, aiming to shake him off the trance. "I think you should be able to sleep now, right? You got control over your nightmare."* - Sun Oct 18 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods.

"Alright, cool. I'mma come tuck you into bed -- Psyche. But try to go to bed, and see if you have those nightmares, alright?" He replies, before turning about face and heading to the north. It was time to go back to the public square.* - Sun Oct 18 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Mhmm.. All right. - Sun Oct 18 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm? He has chronic nightmares. - Sun Oct 18 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's cause of his internal conflicts. - Sun Oct 18 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: So I helped him become at peace with himself. - Sun Oct 18 04:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: He should be able to take a damn nap now. . I hope. - Sun Oct 18 04:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Any other questions? - Sun Oct 18 04:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Nope. - Sun Oct 18 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Just... - Sun Oct 18 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Bored is all. - Sun Oct 18 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) disappears in a plume of smoke.

"Hrm? You're always bored! Anywho, gotta check on my lady friend."* - Sun Oct 18 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) randomly appears.

He throws an arm over Mirai's shoulder. "What's up? Anything cool happen since I've been gone?"* - Sun Oct 18 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blinks.

This was awkward. He quickly removes his arm, and moves on over to the actual Mirai, tossing an arm over her shoulder. "Awkward. . . " He coughs.

"Uhm. What's up? Anything cool happen since I've been gone."* - Sun Oct 18 04:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Holy shit. . I never thought I'd be. . . -- Damn. - Sun Oct 18 04:06:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . .What? - Sun Oct 18 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: This is gonna be fun to watch. - Sun Oct 18 04:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I hope you enjoyed your day. - Sun Oct 18 04:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Something I wasn't part of - Sun Oct 18 04:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I mean. It was a pretty borin' day. - Sun Oct 18 04:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Oh you didn't have fun running your mouth with other people? - Sun Oct 18 04:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I wasn't runnin' my mouth. I was meditating. - Sun Oct 18 04:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Earlier you were. - Sun Oct 18 04:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: You know when you weren't with me. - Sun Oct 18 04:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I was around you for pretty much the entire day in that field. - Sun Oct 18 04:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Excuses. - Sun Oct 18 04:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Lies. - Sun Oct 18 04:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: You were here running your mouth with someone while me and Madelyn were training. - Sun Oct 18 04:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Then you spent most of your time with that weirdo who was in my business. - Sun Oct 18 04:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: He wasn't lying. - Sun Oct 18 04:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) smirks. He's more amused than angry.

His grip only tightens, pulling the Hyuuga into a half hug. "Man. You don't see me complaining when you spent most of the time training Mirai, than day dreaming. Although, it warms my heart that you're getting so hot and bothered over nothing. I'll admit though, I have been getting caught up today by other people. . " He comments, seemingly agreeing with Mirai just a tad.

There were several distractions today.

"But hey. THis is like the first time in weeks where I haven't been by your side for like seventy percent of the day."* - Sun Oct 18 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Its like no one wants to train me anymore welp alest i got the basics. - Sun Oct 18 04:17:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I thought you were going to come and watch like you usually do and I don't care that you're agreeing. - Sun Oct 18 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: You're not getting out of this. - Sun Oct 18 04:17:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Do not test me. - Sun Oct 18 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) 's looks on, a bit wide-eyed.

"Take it easy, geez."* - Sun Oct 18 04:20:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) coughs. It wasn't that big of a secret.

He moves to lift Mirai up bridal style again -- against her will. 

"Ergh. . Let's go grab a bite or something? You seem a bit. . . testy."* - Sun Oct 18 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I'm not hungry nor do I want to go anywhere with you. - Sun Oct 18 04:28:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) apparently had managed to lift her up without resistance.

"Eh. . . It happens. Anywho, the day is still young. Madelyn, care to join us? Going to go grab a bite to eat, since she's so angry. Gotta try to appease her some how, right?" Sanoke states with a sheepish grin. He proceeds off to the south, hopefully without any resistance.* - Sun Oct 18 04:40:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) grunts. Mirai was being super difficult.

Regardless, he continues to cart her off, whispering to find some way to gain forggiveness.* - Sun Oct 18 04:56:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) continued to shuffle down towards the south, mildly irritated at how childish she was being. 

After a few paces and minutes, they'd arrive at the outside of the local restaurant. He sets the woman down, and his hand reaches ahead, moving to her bum. There's a cautious gaze, as he's fearful of how the Hokuma could respond..

She did seem pretty ticked at him.* - Sun Oct 18 05:22:59 2015
