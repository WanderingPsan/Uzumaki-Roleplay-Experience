<br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeah. I wanted to do things like marksmen competitions and such. - Thu Dec  3 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: There you go then. - Thu Dec  3 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: That's a lot of ideas. - Thu Dec  3 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Y'know, just things to keep shit lively. I don't like when people act like bores. - Thu Dec  3 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Which one would you take part in? Since I refuse to let you be on standby. - Thu Dec  3 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...w-what? - Thu Dec  3 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) stared on blankly.

The placidness shifts to confusion. "Uh. . .Did I say something bad again?"* - Thu Dec  3 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You want to have me participate or run a station? - Thu Dec  3 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: For some parts, I'd suppose you could be on standby. But I want you to have some fun too. - Thu Dec  3 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh... I mean... - Thu Dec  3 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I have been slacking on my shinobi skills... - Thu Dec  3 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I hardly know any jutsu. - Thu Dec  3 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hassan wanted me heavily focused on my stuies. - Thu Dec  3 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: studies* - Thu Dec  3 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You practice Fuuton ninjutsu, right? You'll have plenty of skills in no time. If Lera is busy, come and see me. - Thu Dec  3 01:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: O-oh... I mean.. it isn't about Lera being busy.. it's.. -me-. - Thu Dec  3 01:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'm always busy... - Thu Dec  3 01:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Then pump the breaks on your studies for a little. All work and no play is no life to live. - Thu Dec  3 01:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) squints. He's again perplexed by the woman's answer.

"Uh, and why isn't it simple? Not hard to just take a break every now and then. ."* - Thu Dec  3 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Because everyone needs me. - Thu Dec  3 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Ah. . .Well you are the most easily reached Medic in the village. Hopefully more arise to ease the work load. - Thu Dec  3 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Still! When the time comes, you're going to be taking part in the festives. - Thu Dec  3 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Even if I have to make it a command. - Thu Dec  3 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hmph. - Thu Dec  3 01:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Okaay... - Thu Dec  3 01:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says:  N-- What. . That easy? Geez. You're agreeable. - Thu Dec  3 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: It's rude to argue it.... - Thu Dec  3 01:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hah! That's amusing. You and I should hang out more often. - Thu Dec  3 01:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah, but we are both so busy... seems like we haven't hung out in a long time. - Thu Dec  3 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Eh. Things have been dying down for me, once the chunnin exams are over, I'll pretty much only have to write and stuff. - Thu Dec  3 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: -- Baah! I can't hold it in any longer. - Thu Dec  3 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'll tell you the surprise. - Thu Dec  3 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Wow! I expected you to be all curious and anticipating. - Thu Dec  3 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Oh..Someone is in here. - Thu Dec  3 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: C'mon. . The anticipation. - Thu Dec  3 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...what? - Thu Dec  3 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Okay...tell me then if you'd like. - Thu Dec  3 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) groans.

"Wooow! I wanted you to be more excited. . .Anywho. . " 

He beats on the table like drums, building up anticipation.

"At the exam, once it's all said and done. I want to honor you, with a promotion. You done more than enough to ascend beyond Genin rank. Besides, being chunnin isn't all about fighting, it's about having the proper qualities. And you have them all. . . Although, you're a tad bit reckless," the Kaze notes. And coming from someone as knuckleheaded as Sanoke, well. . It meant a lot.* - Thu Dec  3 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) peered closer. For a second, he's  concerned, before laughing the entire thing off.

"Haha! Yeah, I do. So would you accept? I don't wanna thrust you into the chunnin role if you don't feel ready for it," the Interim Kazekage replied in his chracteristically cheerful tone of voice.* - Thu Dec  3 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods.

He had faith in the woman. "Of course I think you deserve it. And your responsibilities would be much like they are now. You're the head medic, so I want you to govern over the hospital. You can look over the nursing staff and/or doctor staff -- and they'll all be under you. I trust that you won't abuse that power. . "  He says casually while eating some more.

The bulk of his feast was devoured, and he spoke with his mouth full for the most part.

"I'll leave it to you to organize the hospital, just as it's left to Koji to organize the force. If you develop more pills? Let me know. But more importantly, you're the go-to medic. I'll help you accumulate ninjutsu, but also hope that you'll develop some medical techniques of your own. I don't think you're the combat type, so I wouldn't exactly put you on the field."* - Thu Dec  3 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: So basically what I already do. - Thu Dec  3 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: --That is, unless you feel confident enough to also be a field medic? - Thu Dec  3 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I want to be a field medic in the future but for now I'm focusing on my hospital work. - Thu Dec  3 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: To aid the village better. - Thu Dec  3 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I think if I focus heavily into the field that I could help better there then to seperate my attention. - Thu Dec  3 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeah, that's what I was thinking! So it's settled then, you'll be honored at the exams. - Thu Dec  3 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: O-okay. - Thu Dec  3 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Thank you for this opportunity, Kazekage-sama. - Thu Dec  3 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's nothin'. You earned it. - Thu Dec  3 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well.. do I need to let you get back to your work? - Thu Dec  3 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Nah. Today is actually a slow day. What you got on the agenda? - Thu Dec  3 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I decided to take the rest of the day off. - Thu Dec  3 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: H-hey... question... like.. don't tell anyone kind. - Thu Dec  3 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Shoot. - Thu Dec  3 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: So like... if your fiance goes and is talking about.... getting intimate with another person... like as a group.. -infront- of that person... are they joking around to fuck with you? Or serious? - Thu Dec  3 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Joking for sure.  - Thu Dec  3 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: I told ya, she probably just likes to make you flustered. - Thu Dec  3 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: They were like... talking...erg.. like it REALLY seemed like they were serious. - Thu Dec  3 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: No! It wasn't Mirai! - Thu Dec  3 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Oh, Lera? - Thu Dec  3 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: LERA pretty much invited MITSUNARA. - Thu Dec  3 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Oh. Lera is a super pervert, haha! Don't tell her I said that, though. - Thu Dec  3 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: So, there's a good chance she'd go for that-- Assuming you dont' deny it. - Thu Dec  3 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...it's true though, I won't say anything. - Thu Dec  3 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I... I mean.. I didn't even know Mitsunara LIKES girls. - Thu Dec  3 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) was having a hardtime not laughing.

He leans in to whisper again. "For sure. You don't remember what I told ya? -- And this isn't anything against Lera. She's just. . Uhm, super freaky."* - Thu Dec  3 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Curious. You'd be against it? - Thu Dec  3 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I mean... I don't know... - Thu Dec  3 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I'm pansexual...Mitsunara is attractive to me because she's my friend but I've never been -interested- in more than one person. - Thu Dec  3 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Duo pervs.. - Thu Dec  3 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Well. If you're nervous, just tell 'em no. - Thu Dec  3 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Nng.. I won't say anything and see what happens. - Thu Dec  3 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Good luck! Side note, you can always just say no. - Thu Dec  3 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) 's smile settled down.

"Good. Anywho, sides that. What do you usually do for freetime? When not spending time with Lera, of course."* - Thu Dec  3 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...there's free time other than that? - Thu Dec  3 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I used to do phsycological evaluations but ...no one else has come to see me that I said I would help. - Thu Dec  3 03:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: C'mon.. - Thu Dec  3 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You couldn't have worked like this all your life. - Thu Dec  3 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....I have. - Thu Dec  3 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: It's sort of how my family raised me. - Thu Dec  3 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You're kiddin' me. Wow, well learn to live a little! Not that my life is more exciting. - Thu Dec  3 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Most of my entertainment is running around looking for interesting fights, eating, hrm. . Hangin' with my summons. What else.. - Thu Dec  3 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh, exploring-- Not a lot to explore as of late, though. - Thu Dec  3 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Heh... uh...  - Thu Dec  3 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'm not really a fighter or an explorer. - Thu Dec  3 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I go out to eat and cook a lot because of Lera. - Thu Dec  3 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I used to hang out with... Aza alot too. *Sigh* - Thu Dec  3 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) suddenly stands. He speeds in a semi-circle, and stops towards Kiyoko's rear. Both hands press against the woman's trapezius!

"Wow, well you need to live a little. C'mon, let's go find things you'd like to do. I remember. . Hrm, Mirai told me girls like to shop or whatever? -- Can't remember what else she said. . " He says in a dimwitted tone.* - Thu Dec  3 04:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) 's right brow rose, inquiring on Kiyoko's sudden reaction. Surely, he clenched a bit, but there didn't seem to be a massage in order -- Mirai would have his head.

"Yeah, you guys are pretty different. Well if not shopping. . .Hrm. . .Got to be something! Do you play boardgames?" He asked in the usual, inqusitive tone. "I'm good for anything. I haven't had any real fun since becoming Interim Kage."* - Thu Dec  3 04:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: What is he doing? - Thu Dec  3 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Earth to Kiyokooo. - Thu Dec  3 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) lifted a hand to rub his chin pensively.

"Hrm. . . That's a tough one! -- Do you gamble?" 

He energetically swooshed back on over to his chair. The furniture rattled, but manages to stay in one piece, and a gale of wind chased behind his figure.* - Thu Dec  3 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Ooh. Hrm, well you can wager anything, doesn't have to just be money. - Thu Dec  3 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Like what? - Thu Dec  3 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's your decision! I can wager. . Hrm. - Thu Dec  3 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Five hundred grand at the most. -- Of my own money. - Thu Dec  3 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Not tapping into village funds. - Thu Dec  3 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...I meant what other things than money can be wagered. - Thu Dec  3 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh. - Thu Dec  3 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Favors. Dares, shit like that. - Thu Dec  3 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm.. - Thu Dec  3 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I don't think you want to play this game with me. - Thu Dec  3 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Why not? - Thu Dec  3 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Especially when the favor I asked you was regeted. - Thu Dec  3 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I mean, I'm sure you pick something within reason. - Thu Dec  3 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...You are giving a gil a chance to get the thing she wants.... - Thu Dec  3 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And you expect me not to pick it? - Thu Dec  3 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: girl* - Thu Dec  3 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oooh. C'mon, this'll be fun. Just don't choose somethin that'll get me in trouble!| - Thu Dec  3 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: .... - Thu Dec  3 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Whats the fun in that. - Thu Dec  3 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Ha! Good one -- But it can still be fun, y'know. If not this. . Hrm. . .What else is there to do in Sunagakure. - Thu Dec  3 04:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: -- You ever tried one of those 'Sand Bathes' things? - Thu Dec  3 04:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Sand bathes? - Thu Dec  3 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: <*Nods*> Yeah, you never heard of one? - Thu Dec  3 04:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No, what's that? - Thu Dec  3 04:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh. . Hrm. - Thu Dec  3 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Basically, I think they place you under the sand, your head out. - Thu Dec  3 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: And heat it up or something. - Thu Dec  3 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....that sounds...so cool. - Thu Dec  3 04:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh! So you want to do it then? - Thu Dec  3 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah. - Thu Dec  3 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: That sounds cool. - Thu Dec  3 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: But uh..isn't that like a couples thing to do? - Thu Dec  3 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Uh. I mean, it can be. But I'm not looking at it that way. - Thu Dec  3 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Just tryin' to get you to live a little. - Thu Dec  3 05:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I mean if you fiance is okay with it then we can go yeah. - Thu Dec  3 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It'll be finne. Let's rock! Want a life? - Thu Dec  3 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: lift* - Thu Dec  3 05:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Uh...sure. - Thu Dec  3 05:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) kneels.

He motions to his back. "Come!" The second she had hopped on, the boy sprinted off, swift to find one of the spa areas, as that's where they usually had the sand bath.

Amidst the sprint, he looked pensively, as if in thought. 

"Where have I. . . Hrm. . Did I k-- Nah. . ." The teen muttered to himself unintelligibly.* - Thu Dec  3 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) continued to freely sprint. He occasionally ran up buildings, and leapt from the roof top. His acrobatic nature was employed to the fullest, each time doing a somersault when leaping from the air to the ground. 

In spite this, Sanoke's grip was iron tight, wrapped around the base of Kiyoko's legs/thigh to keep her secured.  In no time, he's in the heart of Sunagakure. . . And then lost.

"Hrm. . Hrm. . . I think. . Di-- No. . ." The teen muttered to himself, still speaking in a low, unintelligible manner. Eventually, after ten minutes of searching aimlessly, the memory of the institute's location was finally recollected. With a burst of speed, his momentum suddenly shifted to the west, allowing him to scale additional houses.

In two minutes, they'd reach the spa area. "HEre at last!" Sanoke kneeled, giving the medic the opportunity to descend and enter the building. "I think I remember what this thing is. I think my Master loves to do them back at his place."* - Thu Dec  3 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nodds.

"My master is a talking Turtle, in case you didn't know. I don't see him as often as I should, though," The teen replies as he kicked through the door. 

The building was relatively large, as the area often was filled with tourists. -- It was a hot spot after all. The insides seemed to be made with marble flooring, as were the counters. . . And the entire office for that said. Upon stepping in, a cool sensation presses against Sanoke's flesh, the temperature being -far- different than the notoriously hot exterior of Sunagakure.

He stepped forward, and waves to the secretary, who spoke with a proper, almost foreign tone.

"Hi! Hrm, can me and my friend go do those Sand Bathing things? Also, tell me. One a scale to one to ten, how good are these things? I don't think I've ever been in one," the Interim Kazekage spoke. Surprisingly, the secretary damn near screamed at the sight of a Kage gracing the building with his presence!

"L-Lord Kazekage-sama! For your work, we'll certainly allow you to use it for free!"

"--Oh! Can I get some food too?" Sanoke spoke up again, aiming to milk the perks of being leader as much as he could. Of course at this, the secretary obliges, ordering up some food, and scheduling it to be delivered once he had finished with the appointment.

"Sounds good. Let's roll, Lera." And thus they'd go in the direction given.* - Thu Dec  3 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) coughs.

"Err. . . Kiyoko, I mean," He says nonchalantly. The two would have been guided along a lengthy hallway. After a few meters, they'd be able to enter another room -- this one lacking air conditioning for once.

At the epic center of the sizeable room was a sandy pit. The pit was conditioned with about two dozen holes. THe holes were actually boxes, although each box had been covered thoroughly in thick sand. Towards the east and west portions of the rooms respectively were hot-springs. Certainly not big enough to house party, but wide enough to secure at least a single body.

The springs functioned as lakes or oceans, and siphoned water along a path, each leading to the center of the room. Naturally, the water could be turned on and off, but the sole purpose was to dose piles of specailized sand, and condition it for the treatment. Despite lacking air conditioning, the room was pleasantly warmed, and held a herbal scent to it's atmosphere.

"Cool! -- Lets!"

Immediately, one the attendants beeline, due to being alerted of the arrival. Strangely, despite how popular the treatment was, not many people were inline for today. "Lord Kazekage! And. . . " A hand gestures for Kiyoko's name.

"We can get you all fitted in uniform shortly so you can avoid getting your yukatas!" There'd be a changing area for those that were modest of course. The Yukatas are promptly handed on over.* - Thu Dec  3 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) goes to change as well.

However, he doesn't bother moving into a changing room. With a single seal, smoke clouds his body. As it disappears, Sanoke was in his boxer shorts. The Yukata is worn shortly after, effortlessly being slipped in. 

In the meantime, the group of employees were at work, pouring and saturating specialized, volcanic sand. It's soaks up the water thoroughly, forcing more hot-springs liquid to be applied. They're churning, and mixing, ensuring that all goes according to plan.

It'd take roughly half an hour in total to fully prepare. In the meantime, Sanoke spoke idly. "Hope you're excited--" At that same moment, the employees gesture for both of the customers to step into a hole.  He moves into the center most, and calls for Kiyoko to go towards the one to his right.

"--Now I remember this. Yeah, I've been in one before. But not here."* - Thu Dec  3 06:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

There was no guidance really needed. The employees were there for a reason. They gesture for the duo to stay put. Before long, murky, went sand is poured over their forms, enveloping them from their feet to the neck. The almost mud-like nature of the mixture forces it to seep through the cloth -- hence why they forced people to change in the first place.

The sensation may or may not be uncomfortable -- not everyone enjoyed this treatment. 

Sanoke, on one hand, enjoyed the feeling greatly. The hot temperatures, coupled with the odd texture of the sand along with the water made this feel. . relaxing, but also empowering. It washed away each of his worries, and placed the body moreso at ease. . 

With each passing second, the Kazekage was going further into a state of bliss, recalling just where he had seen this. At the Oasis, as this was a technique meant to help but the spirit at ease to aid in drawing out more power. After sighing pleasantly, he nods, giving a glance to the woman.

"Well you should come around here more often. I'm sure this'll be your type of thing. If you want, you can just ask me if you need company," the boy says with a nod. . His voice whimiscal, and light-hearted, almost as if he had taken some drugs. "'Sides that, you tell me you like to cook?"* - Thu Dec  3 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) also still had them shades on.

Too much swag.* - Thu Dec  3 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) 's brow rose in surprised. He expected her to enjoy the treatment, but not to this extent. He hums, still very much finding the treatment to revigorating, the guy felt like a million bucks.

The surprise fades, prompting a hearty chuckle. "Hah. I didn't think you'd like it this much. See? There's a lot more to life than just serving other people, there are tons of things like this," Sanoke notes. His hand was prepared to move to flick Kiyoko in the head for being baka, but he stops short to avoid aggitating the sand bath.

"--And if you cook, you should let me taste some. My favorite thing to eat is sweets," he said in a matter-of-fact tone, expecting Kiyoko to simply oblige. A refusal wasn't even entertained.* - Thu Dec  3 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

"Oh, I remember how this thing works now. Basically, it's suppose to sooth the body. . I'm pretty sure it's also very good for the skin. The feeling places your body and mind at ease, so it alleviate stress. It doesn't actually make you have more energy, but it makes yo ufeel more energized. It's good if you're suffering from fatigue or depression," he notes, suddenly knowledgeable on the Sand Bathing for whatever reason.

-- Seconds later, the employees step ahead, and begins counting down from sixty.

"One minute! Then you all may go wash off and be done with the session. I hope you all have enjoyed this thoroughly!"* - Thu Dec  3 07:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shook his head.

The treatment had lasted about ten minutes max.

"Not here particularly. But we've used the hot springs before," he says with a smile. The thought forces his cheeks to flush red, and a sheepish grin to escape his mouth. By then, the employee had counted down to zero!

"Okay, you two can exit!"

They motion to another compartment of the room, where the cold showers were shown, each with towels. The point being to force the body to cool down, and to rinse off the dirt.* - Thu Dec  3 07:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Shit...why is the water so cold. - Thu Dec  3 07:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) does so as well. He lets the cold water rinse off his body while grinning amusingly at Kiyoko's complaints.

"True shinobi are able to endure any weather," he replies casually. It doesn't take long to rinse. In no time, Sanoke is stepping out with a towel in hand. 

"This was cool,though. Right? Y'see, there are tons of fun things you can do around the village. So don't overwork yourself too much."* - Thu Dec  3 07:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) || 
He turns, sending an arm to gather his Kazekage cloak and proceeded forward in direction to an exit. "And yeah! I feel like a million bucks right now, being Kage is a bit stressing. Right now, I probably got enough motivation to go back and do my 'Hell Mode' training."

Before he could get too far, the massive scar tissues along Kiyoko's arm caught his attention.

Sanoke moved and stared closer, examining the extent of the scars. A hand moved, poking the dried up wounds in order to gauge whether they hurt or not. Once in contact, the finger moved, tracing around them.

"Badass scars. But try not to be so reckless to get more in the future. Do they hurt?"
* - Thu Dec  3 08:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) prods the woman in the cheek, playfully scolding her for the shamed expression.

"Why do you look so ashamed? You got hurt for being a good person. That's the price of being a hero, you get hurt sometimes. You should be proud that you took the time to at least try and help! Even I'm not that good, I'd probably just tie him up and leave him somewhere where he couldn't hurt anyone," Sanoke admits with a light laugh. His light hearted tone makes it hard to tell whether or not the truth was being told. . 

"So no being sad or anything. Let's get outta here. You got your robe?"* - Thu Dec  3 08:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) exhales.

"What's so bad? You still look very good," he notes. At the inquiry of clothes, a single seal is formed, spawning smoke. Before she knew it, Sanoke was already back in his kage outfit.

"You don't need to be so insecure. I mean, Lera still thinks you're smoking. And you're always getting complimented."* - Thu Dec  3 08:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) smiled with content at Kiyoko's lifted spirits.

"See? Anywho, been fun. Should probably get back to the square and hope not many people have been looking for the Kazekage. I hate when requests get backed up."* - Thu Dec  3 08:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) was a pleasantly surprised.

The smile from before widens. Against better judgement, an arm moves, wrapping around Kiyoko's upper body to make the hug mutual. "No problem! You're a friend, and we don't hang as much as we should. So this was a good way to catch up," Sano replies, releasing his hug after a few intervals.* - Thu Dec  3 08:34:08 2015
