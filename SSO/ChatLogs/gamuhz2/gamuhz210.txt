<br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Speeding ahead, his body shortly  arrives by the colosseum. 

It's only half-produced, yet the citizens were already using it for their own purposes. Before long, Sanoke moved onto the inner chambers, where the actual; arena was. There were a few bottom row seats available, thus he makes a swift sprint, first placing Mirai in, then taking a seat himself.

Arms folded, the snow-haired warrior look ahead.

"Alright. This should be good -- Wanna place some bets? Since you should not finally have money," the teenager explains, referencing the mission they had just completed.

Of course, one of the announcer kick starts the show. "Laddiesss. .  .And Gentlemeennnnn! We have quite a show for you tonight. Local bruiser, said to be the greatest wrestler in the desert --- Granite Briiiicck!" Lights are flashing, and a brief musical intro blares into the area. A large man, nearing at about eight feet makes his approach, his body swollen in muscle.

The brute is mean mugging the crowd,  each one individual before facing the entrance and awaiting his opponent.

Funnily enough, it was seeming to be a David versus Goliath story. "Annndd his challeennggerr! The man who many claim is on path to being the fastest shinobi alive. . . Impluusssee!" A red blur streaks about the area, his height being a modest 4'11, and his body proving to be lithe in nature. The two stand on the opposite end. 

With a wide smile, Sanoke stands up, both eyes trained on the titanic battle that was to come. "So. . Bet?"* - Sun Oct  4 04:26:40 2015

"Well. . the colosseum was pretty neat. Can't wait for it to be finished. . . I wonder what types of system the Kazekage will install in it," he muttered nonchalantly.* - Sun Oct  4 04:47:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) sweeps Mirai up once more. He moves ahead, going back to the crib to play some boardgame. "I'm about to destroy you again, y'know," the teen brags, considering the last time they played a game of Boardgame.

Again, considering his speed, reaching such wasn't going to be a hard task at all.* - Sun Oct  4 04:56:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods. He takes a seat, legs folded on another. It was good to talk every now and then, especially now that he was certainly Mirai wouldn't exploit her body to bring out his weakness. A hand rises to his sun glasses, fidgeting it about all cool like. 

For a few moments, Sanoke remained silent, before canting his head on over to the Hokuma once more.

"So, you wanna?" He says, remaining vague to avoid the potential sting of suggestion. Had she declined, he could just pretend as if he referred to something else. Regardless, the boy spoke with confidence, mainly because those cheap ass glasses really did make him feel cool. * - Sun Oct  4 05:35:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods. 

"Let's roll then!" He takes off sprinting at once, while carrying Mirai in a bridal fashion. Oddly enough, even while restrained to this extent, and his speed being halved, Sanoke moved with impressive quickness, his body being a blur to the untrained eye. The target area was the training area to the south of the village, not too far from the  housing district in that particular area. For now, Lera's special technique isn't really taken note of, as Sanoke placed all his attention on winning this race.

"C'mon!"* - Sun Oct  4 07:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Just barely, Sanoke is able to speed on ahead, winning the race. His feet skidded along the ground, as friction enforces a stop. "Wooo! You're getting pretty fast, through. I didn't expect for you to be able to move at even that much speed. Neat flying technique, though," the former chunnin compliments upon  seeing her feet settled from the half-levitation. Once at the area, his significant other is placed onto the ground, while SAnoke himself waltz on over to Lera.

Genjutsu was an area of combat he greatly wanted to bolster, simply because his intelligence and chakra control would make any illusion made a force to be reckoned with.* - Sun Oct  4 07:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well... - Sun Oct  4 07:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: My genjutsu isn't that great, but I can teach you the two jutsu I know. - Sun Oct  4 07:42:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods. As she went through the seals, Sanoke quickly placed his senses to work. His eyes watched as the girl's chakra fluxuated, and his vision committed each different seal to memory. As a novice to genjutsu in general, the shinobi really had no idea where to even begin. Certainly, the technique was much like the basic 'Bunshin' skill taught in the academy, yet there was clear difference.

These clones?

They weren't tangible. But. . . they couldn't easily be differentiated. Taking a quick first step, his leg kicks through the air, forcing his feet to slam right into one of the clone's chest. As expected, the clone splits off, producing a secondary copy. For the next few seconds, the speedy summoner continued to blur through the area, attacking the spawned clones at random.

After having his feet, Sanoke turns, eying Lera once more. "Alright. I get the description. But how does it work? Even a genius like me needs more guidance than this, tch. I ain't -that- smart. " He'd sit, hoping to get a bit more insight so that his attempt and training could be go a bit more smoothly, and actually be productive.* - Sun Oct  4 07:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its not that difficult. - Sun Oct  4 07:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its almost exactly like the basic Bunshin technique. - Sun Oct  4 07:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm. . I'll try. - Sun Oct  4 07:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||The jutsu,  in terms of explanation was pretty simple.

In fact, you'd be better off callling it a derivation of a lower leveled Bunshin tecehnique, rather than an actual genjutsu. From that observation, Sanoke sought to try the technique of his own. 

After weaving through the seals that had been commited to memory, the male's chakra begins to churn inwardly, as he preps it for the skill. Overall, it seemed that an application of Yin Release was best fit, considering this was a technique based on the mind's imagination. For those with senses or great eyes, they could feel the sudden elevatation in his chakra power.

Before long, Sanoke's mind tuned out, now focusing on using the jutsu independantly. "Alright. . .So it's just basically a Bunshin that has a shadow -- like Shadow Clone. But it isn't tangible. This is like the missing link. . .So if i mix knowledge of my two skills, I should be alright. Okay! Let's try this again," the boy murmurs to himself. Upon opening his eyes, the chakra around his frame ignites and is put forth to make the jutsu.

On inception, they spawn two dopplegangers, both towards the opposite end of Sanoke's body. Easily, the mirrored his appearance to perfection, as that portion was a trivial matter, one that even a little academy student could accomplish. After all, how much more different was it than to the basic clone technique? "Course. . . considering this was his first attempt, there were some clear issues. 

The clone moved in a slow fashion, making it clear that they weren't at all the real thing. Aiming to test the theory of it being split, Sanoke's right arm swipes away. Hopefully, with the instructions being implanted within  the jutsu, they'd act accordingly. 

Upon being struck, the clone's body jolted, the skin briefly gaining a static appearance. In no time at all, it splits off, forming a secondary clone-- but just as the second is being made, it the illusion is disrupted with the bunshin finally being dispersed. Certainly, Sanoke had gotten used to the basics, the technique merely required refinement. "Neat skill. WHere'd ya learn it?" the boy inquires.* - Sun Oct  4 08:29:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) unsheath his Tanto. While Sanoke was no true swordsman, every that held endured Noriko's Kirigakure regime had at least some competency with a tanto. It's held upright, and he makes no clear movement to approach the girl. 

"You can, I'm ready."* - Sun Oct  4 10:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) rose a brow. "She seems good. . .Kenjutsu is her speciality. . .Am I really confident enough to engage her in close-quarter-combat. .?" Sanoke murmured to himself, the tone distressed. Although on the outside, the stereotypical, giant grin is being on display, as along side the distress came excitement. This was an entirely new opponent, one that could legitimately be his better. Yet he doesn't move an inch.

The second her blade shot forward, so did Sanoke's Tanto. The two pieces of metal smacked against one another, the friction enough to leave his weapon a bit chipped. Sparks flew as a direct result, cascading on the floor, and unleashing an echo-ing sound effect.

Ching! Ching! Crash!

"Not bad. . . Not bad. Here I thought you were just some girl Lera was trying to feel up," the would-be sage said with a cocky grin, still well in the belief that Violet was apart of some secret Kirigakure harem. From the grip, he pushes off, aiming to partially parry the clashing Katana, at least enough to give him some breathing room. Assuming that had been a success? All that's needed is a slight pivot, and soon Sanoke is breaking into a slight blur, his body displaying extraordinary speed -- even if restrained by this big ass turtle shell.

As he manuevered, his form goes in a twirl, releasing a semi-circle and giving a superficial slash to the girl's waist line in an upward fashion. If struck, she'd suffer noting more than a flesh wound, and her cloth would likely suffer minor cuts. "Hyah!"* - Sun Oct  4 10:18:14 2015

Then the guy below had to go full savage. You never go full savage.  Immediate, Sanoke's body quivered, as the boy induced his Curse Seal transformation. The feeling of the chakra, even without sensory abiliy, was one of pure malice and honestly was a bit unnerving. 

Wasting no time, however, the teen would bit his thumb, drawing some blood. "Gah. I think this might get bad, Mirai. You should step back," the former chunnin stated, once more being as protective as could be. Five short seals are woven through, allowing an outburst of chakra to be unleashed. It rips open the fabric of space and time, conjuring up a magnificient beast-- Ganba. A human-sized reptilian. 

"What's the situation?"

"Oi. . . This guy seems tough. I'm going to need your help in this, assuming no one else can stop him. Hopefully his body isn't as sturdy as he claims, or this might get bad," the turtle summoner in training notes. It was at this point he was kicking himself in the foot for not learning more gen jutsu, considering just how many walking tanks were in this world. It'd be an effective counter to his lack of physical or spiritual might.* - Mon Oct  5 02:26:46 2015

"Anywho, yeah. We gotta eliminate this criminal. . "* - Mon Oct  5 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: <*Gotta take out trash irl. Brb*> - Mon Oct  5 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||It isn't long before they arrive at the designated area. Upon reaching the cells, Sanoke uses his key, unlocking the door and heading in. By now, Mirai had been set on the ground, allowing her to walk the rest of the way. "But no, really. I'm going to try and patch things up between you and Koji. You both are part of the same family -- from the looks of it. And if you're going to be a princess, you gotta be on goodterms," Sanoke explains. His mouth opens for a bit, as he debates on questioning on the title of 'Pricess' -- Why not Queen, after all?

After opting not to comment on such, the turtle summoner continued in stride, his eyes wandering around, taking note of all the different signs that had been posted up. It was these writings that effectively gave him the proper direction for the poor soul on Death Row. 

"Anywho. . .Hope this guy isn't violent. I wonder what his crimes were." In ten minutes, the duo of Sanoke and Mirai eventually reach the holding cells. As the door is cracked open, he steps in, eying the criminal in question. Both eyes fall onto the male in question. A dark-skinned, ex-shinobi. He's bald-headed, and riddled with scars on his frame. Every limb seems to be bound to some chair. . . and for the moment,t he execution seems to be easy pickings.

"I wonder what this guy did. . " Cue turning to grab some files, and flicking through to see the offenses.* - Mon Oct  5 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||"I'm going to talk to him anyway," Sanoke retorts. His mind was set on ensuring that Mirai got as much help as possible, even if in the form of scrolls. Nevertheless, now in the designated area for the murder, he fumbled around, looking for the correct information. After a lengthy search in the archives, Sanoke had finally uncovered the information he so desperately sought.

". . So. . .They sent you two scrubs to try and kill me. . Tch. A fuckin' albino, and some lavander-eyed whore. Can't say my life couldn't come to an end to anyone worse," the prisoner, whose name was Tesumo, taunted, giving a devious grin towards the duo that had come to handle the simple mission. His hands, while still bond, continued to fidget. Up to this point, the prisoner had remained under constant survellience, and his chakra had been seemingly bound. 

"Oi. . This is a bad dude. For a second, I was beginning to feel bad. He's wanted for three counts of attempted assassination on the Kazekage. Has murdered over three dozen people, a registered sex offender. . And damn, he even steals candy from babies. . .!" the teen declares, putting emphasis on the final offense, his eyes giving a glare towards Tetsumo. "That's just freakin' low. . . " he continues, still wearing an intense look of disgust. 

Still, despite his outrage, Sanoke had yet to murder anyone even in his lengthy career as a shinobi, thus there were some jitters. A hand moves to the back of his body, grabbing a scroll. From such? A poison bomb is taken out, with a mixture meant to render the criminal unconscious, although it isn't yet thrown. "You can close your eyes and look away if you want, Mirai. I think you might be the squeamish type."

'Course. . . the crook had under plans. Casually, his hands continued to fidget, and underneath his constraints, the nails that had him bond were being loosen -- but now?* - Mon Oct  5 05:17:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||"Bombs away!" The poison bomb is tossed ahead, and combusts on impact. It clouds the general area, making it impossible for Sanoke to see the criminal, and for the criminal to see Sanoke. Of course, Mirai, with her almightly Byakugan, could likely take advantage of her doujutsu and view through the cloud of poison. ". . .That should take care of him."

Although in that short time, Tetsumo too was taking advantage.

Prior to the meeting, the seal on his body wasrendered inert via burning. His flesh had legitimately been incinerated to the point where the seal was no longer applicable. Ontop of this, now with his chakra unrestrained, and there being actual shinobi on the watch, now was his chance. Taking just -one- hostage would be enough. 

The iron shackles are mysteriously broken, along with this, the crook seemed to have held it's breath. Using a strange jutsu, the nails that once held him in bondage are richochet'd forward, this one intent on piercing through the turtle warrior and his Hyuuga companion all in one blow. Clearly, he's aiming for the chest or heart -- no punches are pulled. ". . Time to have a show. . "* - Mon Oct  5 05:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) had been alerted of such. The second the nails shoot, he kicks off, his body possessing impeccable speed, even while weighed down. "--Be careful! Don't go rushing in all wrecklessly," the more experienced battler warns. He's racing behind Mirai -- being just a single pacebehind by now. "Let me engage him, alright?" A Tanto is already in hand, and the poison is clearing up by now.* - Mon Oct  5 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumo(Lolplz) says: <*Mirai's Byakugan would likely' pick up on something.*> - Mon Oct  5 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) wastes no time. Being the faster of the duo, Sanoke speds ahead, easily leaving Mirai right in the dust. With great dexterity, his body contorts, allowing the projectiles to sail away without a single scratch --- But then.

". . .! Shit! A distraction!" Sanoke cursed. Thankfully, his opponent wasn't too proficient in taijutsu. With a quick slash, the tanto flashes through the area, aiming to cut right into his opponent's arm. Assuming success, it no doubts tears right through the flesh, and into the bone -- but not quite enough to severe. "I got this, Mirai. You should stay back!"* - Mon Oct  5 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumo(Lolplz) thinks: Should be careful from this point. . Took a good chunk of my chakra.. - Mon Oct  5 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) got caught with the okey doke. The Tanto slash wasn't wise in the least, as it had triggered the true ability of the Bunshin. Chaotic electricity ran wild on his body, sending his entire  frame in a seizure-like convulsion. The pain is only amplified by the metal conduct that was his tanto, and forces Sanoke to fall on to one knee. Smoke streamed from his body, his hair was frizzled, and clothes left in tatters.

"O-Oi. . " Sanoke could barely speak, and when he did, it was with an annoying stammer. Meekly, his hand tries to flick forward to repel the incoming projectile, although chances of defending were slim at best.

Hopefully Mirai hadn't been caught as well, or they were going to be in some serious trouble.* - Mon Oct  5 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumo(Lolplz) thinks: Need to make this quick too. . .I give it a little while longer before guards are coming in to check the commotion. . Should have a hostage before then. - Mon Oct  5 06:34:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Meanwhile, Sanoke is still shaking off the effects of the lightning clone. That shit really hurted. . .

Wasting no time, though, he can see that Mirai shows reluctance in engaging the enemy alone, for good reason. She was just a rookie. It was -he- that was meant to protect her after all. Just as the Iron Sand is coming, the turtle summoner seeks to get back onto the offensive, and provide some sort of support. Without question, his hand reaches back, and flicks forward, no doubt releasing three Kunai, each one with three tags attached each.

Two seek to slam against the iron sand onslaught to held in Mirai's potential evasion. One, however, is geared right towards the crook himself. "We gotta stay offensive, Mirai. If we stay on the defense, we give him time to work. This type of opponent strives on being able to stay in one point and make the terrain his playground."

In the distance, guards are definitely getting suspicious as there was quite a ruckus going on in a room that was supposed to be silent. Some begin to chatter, while others proceed to make way to the Death Row area. (They should arrive in 3 turns minimal.)* - Mon Oct  5 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Hook, line, sinker.

Wasting no time at all, his fingers pressed together, forming a single seal. From this, every inch of Sanoke's body is put to work, as the chakra is split into three. From these seperate portions, perfect copies are made -- and they're sprinting into action right from the start. One moves, hoping to grab Mirai and sprint backwards. Certainly, it'd succeed, considering how adamantly Sanoke worked on his foot-speed.

That settled, the other is weaving through a set of seals. On the last, more clones are spawned, yet not the same as Shadow Clones. Instead, they were dubbed 'Haze Clone', a type of bunshin that is often mistaken for genjutsu. The secondary Kage Bunshin, after rescuing Mirai continue and forms the same technique. The duo on conjunction eventually release dozen of false Sanoke, shrouding his visage and making Tetsumo hopefully unable to make pinpoint attacks.

"Mirai! You okay. . ? I didn't expect for you to freeze up like this. . .Sorry for bringing you onto a mission that could have been dangerous," Sanoke states in an apologetic tone.  He begins quietly whispering instructions and gives her the option to leave as he deals with the threat alone.* - Mon Oct  5 07:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
And this pretty much spelled doom.

The clones frantically moved about, tipped off by the sudden multiplication of his Haze Clones. Just barely, they're enabled to avoid being impaled. . and on that note? It was time to end this.

"Shadow Clone Technique! Super Explosion Barrage!" Ah the wonders of being a fuuinjutsu user. Years prior, he's learned to make his explosion tags into mines. These were mass produced, and several were sealed away in his scrolls. Upon whipping it forward, dozens of these previously made mines are set off -- and considering the shadow clones copied whatever the user hand on their person, the amount was overwhelming.

In no time, they're ignited, and combusting all around Tetsumo. The repeated explosions eventually wear the man down, reducing him into a burned and battered mess. Inadvertantly, the mission had been completed. . . due to the fact that the bombardment of the explosion had made Tetsumo reaced and early end. Having completed the execution, Sanoke heads on off, and sweeps Mirai up in a bridal fashion.

His body was far from unharmed, but at least he could walk at a brisk pace. 

"Alright. . .Let's get outta here. .  We need to build up your experience, though. No point in freezing like that."* - Mon Oct  5 07:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) poofs into the area. He's covered in burns, and his clothes are tattered up.

"What's up, people?"* - Mon Oct  5 07:59:34 2015
