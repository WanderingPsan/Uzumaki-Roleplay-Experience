He pauses, looking the foursome up and down. "And it ends there. With the carcass, we were able to run facial recognition. We identified him as Makoto. .

"Also. You can come in, I suppose. You seem harmless enough. Momura and Bryson, care to take her to get something to drink, eat, and maybe a place to clean off? She looks a mess."* - Mon Dec  7 03:49:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Not like I can do anything. - Mon Dec  7 04:04:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) swooped the Hokuma on up.

As usual, the Kazekage marches on over to the mansion. His feet skids along the floor, using the wooden tiles to build up necessary friction. 

"Phew! Finally here! Anywho, what were you up to during my nap? And let's head inside my quarters to grab a bite to eat."* - Mon Dec  7 04:12:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Why can't I do any missions? - Mon Dec  7 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Because, you're overworking yourself. - Mon Dec  7 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: The only 'mission' would be paper work. - Mon Dec  7 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I don't want to do that. - Mon Dec  7 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Exactly. - Mon Dec  7 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Let's go to the private quarters. - Mon Dec  7 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Don't look at my butt either. - Mon Dec  7 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) did just that.

His gaze staring onto Mirai's bum throughout the way. Briefly, his cheeks flushed a bit red, but other than that, there are no actual signs of his perversion. Before going further, Sanoke looked back ahead, rubbing his hand.

"Cool. You want to scrab a bite or something?"* - Mon Dec  7 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Not really hungry. - Mon Dec  7 04:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Are you hungry? - Mon Dec  7 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shook his head.

"Not that much. Was just making you didn't want to eat."

He looks Mirai up and down, gauging to see if she had been in a decent mood. Both arms remained folded.* - Mon Dec  7 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Not really. - Mon Dec  7 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Why are you looking at me like that? - Mon Dec  7 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Mm.. - Mon Dec  7 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shifted his eyes from side to side. 

"Well.  .She did say. . " He pondered to himself.

Abruptly, his mitts moved downward, pressing against the base of Mirai's hips. The right hand drifted further, resting along their rightful spot -- firmly on an ass cheek, and giving a gentle squeeze.

There seemed to be no nervousness on Sanoke's behalf, as he had gotten more than used to the Hokuma. 

"Well, I do remember speaking to you before I went to bed is all." With some sterness, the woman's frame is being pushed back, likely onto the wooden table. It stood at a fair height, enough so that the base of the furniture would be pressed against Mirai's lower back, keeping her balance uncompromised.* - Mon Dec  7 04:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) 's neck craned forward, allowing his face to meet Mirai's neck.

His lips were puckered, and sensually, pecks are littered along the flesh. Sanoke is anything but gentle, and soon the task devolves into shameless, lewd sucking. The sounds resonate around the emptied room, hopefully not alarming anyone passing by of the deed meant to occur-- though this is brief, three seconds at the most.

As the question is delivered, the Kazekage ceases while wearing a sly smirk.

"Well. It's been a while, so I was thinking we'd enjoy ourselves, especially before you and I get busy." The grip established beforehand tightens, giving another iron-cladded grasp of the Hokuma's bottom. Sanoke's other fingers venture around his fiance's waistline, searching for any button, latch, or even zipper to undo.

The eager paws wasted little time, aiming to push down the cloth to reveal her shapely lower body, and smooth skin. Already, -clear- arousal sprouted, as it usually did with Sanoke. His boner protuded, forcing the fine kage-clothing to extend beyond it's usual range. The member twitched slightly, forcing unsteady elevation and decline within the fabric.* - Mon Dec  7 05:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

The scent of Mirai's hot and bothered body was just motivation for Sanoke's continued acts. As the skirt is more or less removed, he pushes the woman forward, successfully planting her on her back along the soften, wooden table.

Like a wild animal, he moved forward, easily removing the bulk of his garmets to allow his own sexual member to hang free. Just as with the other countless encounters, Sanoke was blaring to go, with his cock already beating heavily in unison with his heart. It reached maximum mass, and for now, given the closeness, was smacked against Mirai's sex.

As the teen leaned over, the two correspondant parts shamelessly slithered along one another, the heat transferring and the slippery sensation only sending Sanoke further into bliss. It showed, as the male's face was practically painted in red, his eyes lulled in a loving yet also primal fashion. 

The leaning over served a single purpose -- to give him access to more of the Hokuma's good. In a fashion akin to a simple mut, Sanoke goes to dislodge or remove the woman's shirt, certainly revealing an ample bust, perhaps held in bondage by a bra. That too is slipped away, and now with no restraints, the teen's face beelines forward. 

His lips firmly move to latch around her teats, and giving relentless suckles, like a child seeking to be nursed by their mother. Just as last time, there is little gentleness, thus allow loud, squelching smacks to litter the room. A hand massaged the other portions of the breasts in the meantime, and repeatily his hips thrusted, forcing their privates to grind throughout the endeavor.* - Mon Dec  7 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) grunted every now and then as he orally provided pleasure to the woman's tits.

It was a guilty pleasure of his, although that fact would never quite be expressed. Greedily, his lips contracted, as if he was aiming to milk Mirai like a farmer would a cow. Whether or not anything came from it, Sanoke's effort knows no bounds. 

The teen's tongue lashed like a whip through his suckling, each time sending a blow to her teats. After several minutes of lathering her nipples with his mouthy muscle, the Kazekage finally prepared to go into the main course. With a sigh of relief, Sanoke lifts up, his breath heavy and haggarded, showcasing fatigue due to the adrenaline running it's course.

Despite the lengthy time, his cock is still rock hard, and throbbing as it begged for attention. Veins ran around irregularly along the exterior, and the head stuck out like an essential mushroom.  Taking advantage of the positioning, he lined the member up, and moved Mirai's undergarments to theside to provide an opening. One hand remained along his hot rod, holding it steady and placing considerable force to actually keep it down.

The other? Moves to position the Hokuma's legs in the proper direction. Once all is in place, his hips presses forward, allowing his cock to press against the woman's snatch. The head eases on in. . making the first few seconds gradual and gentle. . 

Once all nine inches could actually be impaled, the pace in which Sanoke's hips thrusted gradually proceeded to incline or rise. Each rep is meant with a slight grunt, the volume of which was also steadily increasing due to the heightened emotion and state of bliss.* - Mon Dec  7 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
His tongue lulled out, practically salivating in spit. 

With the first rep completed, Sanoke releases a loud grunt as the constriction takes place, practically holding him still. Inspite of the overwhelming pleasure, he doesn't sit around and linger. In a fastened pace, the male's hips continued to pump, shoving more cock meat into Mirai's vagina, and of course forcing her body to accomodate for his size. His range of motion was full, and never ceased until his cum-filled balls were smacking along the bottom of his fiance's cheeks.

His arms moved to force her leg to apart further.

Continuing with each thrust, a hand swats downward, givintg vicious spanks to the woman shapely and abundant buttocks. The hits hardly hold back on the shinobi's impressive strength, each collision serving to leave a hand imprint tattoo'd to the flesh. It wasn't quite enough to bruise, but the strikes could perhaps sting.

Fiercely, Sanoke's optics looked her sweated body up and down, marveling as it glistened under the light. He wasn't much of a dirty talker, and thus just kept diligently working to appease his mate. The throbs that came from his cock's muscles were slowly becoming more violent and irregular, of course.  

By now, several minutes had gone by. The Kage's body is just as sweat filled, even with his vast level of physical energy. "Don't think I'mma last much longer. . "* - Mon Dec  7 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
And he was pretty much at his limit.

His lustful desire was still nearly palpable, and there was some distaste lingering in his soul. Heaven like this should never truly come to an end, but alas Sanoke's body could take no more.

Effectively, Mirai's pussy had worked diligently to milk and prime his cock to release it's gooey spunk. At the last second, the teen pulls his hips back, allowing the cock head to pop out while also being aimed perfectly towards the rest of the Hokuma's body. 

In the end, his balls clench and cock expanded, pulsing out heaps or sticky, creamy semen. Like a firehose, the liquids pumps out, painting Mirai's torso, pillowy breasts, and even the bottom of her chin in the semen. It was quite a bit! Exhausted, the shinobi leans forward, panting as if just completing a thousand miled marathon.* - Mon Dec  7 07:07:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) exhales, still feeling a bit tired. 

He moves to pull his pants up and tosses on the Kage suit. "Was fun, though. I should go check to see if those knuckleheads came back from the mission," He notes casually.* - Mon Dec  7 07:19:02 2015

It felt good to be honored with all them honorifics. "Yo, yo. What's good?"* - Mon Dec  7 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blinks.

That was a strange request, and his mystification is noticed.

"A regional trip. . .Eh. Seems unnecessary. For how long did you have in mind?" Sanoke asks nonchalantly.* - Mon Dec  7 20:48:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-Alright. - Mon Dec  7 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: We're going to do laps. I'll run them along with you. - Mon Dec  7 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: O-Oh..alright. - Mon Dec  7 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) grasped onto Momura's arms, before pulling her steadily outside of the village. Surprisingly, even despite Sanoke's modest frame, the Kazekage was deceptively strong. With his strength, he's more than capable of dragging her along the heated outskirts, while hugging along the village's wall. This wasn't due to wanting protection, but simply because their course was actually going to be the village itself.

For now, given how spacious the sand village proved to be, the two were set only to do a single lap around the massive area. SAnoke formed a seal, forming  smoke around his figure, and prompting a change in clothing once the residue had cleared. He now sported the usual training gear -- some shorts, a loose fiting shirt, and a heavy ass turtle shell. Easily, the weights restrained his overall speed, and forced more effort and focus to be applied in order to perform even the simplest of movements.

"I won't kill ya. So no weights for you now. I'm going to sprint along the village's wall with you. As we rush, I'll likely pull a head and send some obstacles. -- Have no fear, they won't exactly harm you, but they'll force you to work on keeping your range of motion and velocity consistent, even as something tries to interrupt you. This'll be good for your overall speed, stamina, and of course reaction training, understood?"

He fidgets at his sun glasses with a gleeful smile. The environmental conditions were especially heavy today. The sun seemed to have experienced some refound rejuvenation, forcing the rays to be energized and particular hot. As the heat transferred, heavy waves could be seen in the distance, distorting one's view. Hell, had you poured water, the liquid would sizzle and even bubble, as if on a stove.

Nevertheless, Sanoke showed no signs of fear. Once in a running position, he gestures for Momura to prepare herself. With a kick off the ground, the shinobi was speeding away, each movement confident and possessing a powerful stride. Even while weighed down, the Interim Kazekage was a blur, his velocity enough to kick up am ild dust storm within the current radius. 

Swoosh!

Off the male went, eager to finish the reps around Sunagakure in a timely fashion.* - Tue Dec  8 00:15:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: So the boy that I'm going to be helping... he needs multiple surgeries but if he stays here in Suna he will be ruled rogue.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: What? Can you try to send a letter to get permission to let him stay here for now? - Tue Dec  8 00:32:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Okay I see you little boy. - Tue Dec  8 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
For a few intervals, the two were actually neck and neck. 

Regardless, upon kicking off the ground, Sanoke suddenly accelerated, speeding on  off into the distance. In record time, Momura was being left in the dust, even as the Kazekage remained deterred by the weights. Seconds tick on, and once out of view, the male had set up traps, each one a specialized Fuuinjutsu formula.

With the preparation time, he;'s capable of sealing explosives onto the ground. . But it reacted differently from the normal bombs. Rather than activating upon stepping on the surface, the seals were rigged to detect momentum or colateral force. The second the red-head was even in the distance, she'd ignite the weakened explosions.

They had no real potential to harm her, but would easily be capable of sending Momura's dainty frame flying and perhaps even tripping her up. Finally, even further ahead, a turtle is summoned underneath the ground, all with the instructions  of utilizing it's Doton and Suiton skills to deter the ambitious taijutsu-minded warrior. 

By now, Sanoke had effectively traveled about ten percent of the way, sweat inevitably boiling along his skin and being saturated along his clothes. Despite the appearance, the male's muscles were still able to function at maximum capacity, only due to overwhelming stamina.* - Tue Dec  8 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) wasn't actually on the scene.

But he could easily view the situation considering each of his summons were innately sharing his vision as well. "She isn't too bad. . .Hah. Reminds me a little of myself at her age. Well, except more stuttering, and less cool. ." Sanoke muttered to himself through the exchange. Each time, for a distance, an excited gasp is released whenever Momura actually proved successful in evading the random explosions, although never once did she complete the processp erfectly.

Still, the point was to gauge her reaction timing, and force her to be able to pivot her body on the fly in order to continue advance towards a specific target. It was this level of training that the Kazekage had to endure while he was simply a grunt in the Turtle Oasis, workintg to refine his speed and overall reflexes. 

All in all, the red-head had worked to impress. In no time, she had made it past the first set of trials. For a time, the teenaged female would be allowed to sprint further ahead, perhaps even for a kilometer or two -- and that's when the next set of obstacles were sprouted. They were revolved solely around the turtle summoned underneath the ground.

Using his Doton prowess, the chelonian detects Momura's speed approach. Immediately, the ground tremors, forcing the sandy floor to collapse in on itself. Thesudden collapse was due to the Earthquake technique being applied underneath the ground, forcing anyone within the short range to evacuate the area entirety, or risk being buried.

In the event  that this had proven uneffective, more elemental skills are thrown into the mix. Effective 'Geysers' are pumped, their liquid nature easily puncturing the thick, sandy slabs of stone, and aiming to strike the taijutsu specialist down. If struck, she'd suffer only minor concussive damage, and be sent spiralling along the desert's terrain.

In the end, however. .. Assuming Momura had been able to continue despite the heat, and her meager stamina, Sanoke would once again be within view. He purposely paused, jogging in place in the meantime. Using refined sensory, the male turns, flicking his gaze onto his student.

"Hey! You actually made it! So far, we've traveled like one third of the way! I forgot to mention it. . But. . Uhm. . No ssuimen to aid, okay?" With that, at a half-paced sprint, Sanoke is moving onward along the course.* - Tue Dec  8 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
He hadn't seen the Suimen and didn't really care.

After jogging some distance away, Sanoke turned, forming a single seal. A devious smile crept onto his lips. With the handsign formed, the scrolls hidden underneath the ground had finally been ignited!

With a plum of smoke, each one combusts, releasing their stored contents. 

Effectively, bogs were being formed, as sticky, earthly residue spewed onto the areas, forming deepened puddles of mud -- the depth being no more than knee-length. Naturally, to give Momura -some- chance to evade the incoming obstacle, the width wasn't too great. They stretched at the most, ten meters (two tiles). 

Repeatily, as the woman managed to evade the first set of pits, more were going to be conjured, and the sand or earth torn asunder. Oddly, rocks were spreaded along, and holes forming due to light explosions that spawned from the sealing glyphs. The sole purpose? To potentially trip Momura on up, and make her rapid velocity all the more difficult to maintain when not on a clear road.

In no time, about an hour had finally progressed, by the way. At least from the beginning of the training to now. They were no doubt nearing completion. But could the young woman actually manage to escape this set of traps unscathed?* - Tue Dec  8 01:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
And with that, the duo were over off.

The weight attached onto Sanoke's body was enhanced, bringing his levels of speed down to Momura's own velocity. Neck and neck, they'd race the last mile or two, and covering the grounds within a matter of seconds. The meager distance certainly wasn't much to shinobi that could obtain the level of speeds that two speedsters could breach.

Sand kicked behind his form along the way, and once at the finish line -- this being the Sunagakure gate, his state of tension evaporating.

Sweat hugged his form, and drenched the usual training suit. With heavy breaths, Sanoke hunched over, allowing the beads of liquid to roll down his flesh and onto the sand, with a sizzle. "Hah! You okay out there? I didn't expect you to be able to complete a single rep."* - Tue Dec  8 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: U-Umm.. - Tue Dec  8 02:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) wore a smile.

"Good. Alright, do you think you can still train? We can do more if you'd like--"

Then a messenger arrives. "Sir Kazekage! Kumogakure is aiming to break off from Suna?" Sanoke blinked, as if irritated.

"Well that's shitty. We just fed, clothed, protected them. Kumogakure belongs to Suna. . . I ain't going to let that sit."* - Tue Dec  8 02:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oi. - Tue Dec  8 02:23:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: S-So... - Tue Dec  8 02:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Going to shut that down in a bit. - Tue Dec  8 02:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You want to take a break from training? - Tue Dec  8 02:27:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Okay. - Tue Dec  8 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: We're going to do the same exercise. . Or well, a similar one. - Tue Dec  8 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: H-Hm? - Tue Dec  8 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I want you to run towards me. I'll be slinging my air bullets your way. - Tue Dec  8 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: O-Oh..alright. - Tue Dec  8 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) backed up.

He tensed his feet in preparation for the would-be assault. By now, Sanoke had moved considerably, enough that he was well out of Momura's range. At her max speed, it'd take about fifteen seconds to reach the Kazekage in total, thus making it imperative that she remain nimble and willing to evade.

After forming the Bird seal, chakra builds up, allowing for the energy to siphon along the air in his lungs. Using advanced shape manipulation, several spheres of wind are produced, and rocketed forward. 

The constructions are hardly visible, but the distortion available in the currents and spaces are clear as day, making for an easy evasion. No doubt, each of the wind bullets are intelligently placed, with enough space inbetween for MOmura to just barely slip in. Albeit, each of the projectiles were rushing with fair quickness. Naturally, each of the airbourne bullets were just as fast as Momura, making it imperative that she react the second any object had been noted.

"Alright! Keep it coming! Let's see what you got?!"

As a note, the power was held back, so much that only minor bruises would spawn if Momura had been struck.* - Tue Dec  8 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Uh... - Tue Dec  8 02:54:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||"
Sanoke was sending air bullets at Momura for the time being.

"Hello, Kiyoko!"* - Tue Dec  8 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) 's eyes followed Momura closely, even as the teen managed to zig-zag around the obstacle. Of course, there was some lag in her speed, as moving about the trail wasn't an easy task at all -- especially considering the collision.

After a few seconds, the two were in close-ranged combat territory. Acting with his usual speedy nature, the Kazekage does a light leap, evading the attacking all together. His feet presses against the ground shortly after, and one seal is formulated, sending out a set of wires to restrain the abrasive watermelon summoner.

"---Sheesh! I didn't say to attack. Also. . you got a lot of work to do. Anywho. . Kiyoko. What's up?"* - Tue Dec  8 03:03:28 2015
