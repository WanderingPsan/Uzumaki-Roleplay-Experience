<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) rolled his eyes at the commentary.

Did Shira really think Sanoke was that much of a pansy? So much that he'd avoid disciplining the boy out of fear of backlash? Without another word, chakra flares along his finger tips and palms.

That same hand presses onto Shira's chest -- removing a portion of the cloth binding, and allow for the chakra to flood onto his flesh. From this, Sanoke is inscribing a detailed fuuinjutsu formula, a -Root Seal- even. As the energy flooded, the instructions are being placed.

Simply put?

It was simply going to restrict Shira from doing certain actions. The most prominent being attacking in general. Whenever the boy sought to strike someone, his body would find itself being locked up and unable to continue. At these points, the sealing glyph likely would expand and become more evident. "That should learn him."* - Wed Nov 18 03:22:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods. He enters into a crouch, his fists rising into the air.

"Right. Let's do this, I'll let you make the first move, eh?" His feet slides alongthe sand, carving a depression onto the ground. 

"I'll admit, though. I'm not too strong in taijutsu."
* - Wed Nov 18 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gains a giddy grin upon reading Kinami's stancing.

"Haha! So you really do know a little something about taijutsu! That's good. . .  But let's see what good it does ya!" Sanoke, eager to see his cousin after such a long time, naturally wants to show off. His hip twists, building up the necessary momentum and forcing his body to beeline ahead.

The total speed is held back, considering the weighted turtle shell he wore (gotta get a new sprite.) 

Once in distance, a half-hearted punch is sent to Kinami's cheek, clearly lacking in power, but still holding respectable speed."Let's see how you can react. . "* - Wed Nov 18 04:13:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||"Nice!"

The blow is intercepted, much to Sanoke's delight. "When you can't dodge, the best option is to block! But don't block like this. . When you do, try to repel my arm. Carrying the momentum to the right is much better than just absorbing the damage," Sanoke lectured casually. 

Then came the secondary blow.

At the last second, his head dips towards the right, forcing the haymaker to miss it's mark quickly. Assuming success, the teen reacted in par, sending a simple palm thrust to the center of Kinami's chest. The goal being to knock the wind out of her body, and send her backwards.* - Wed Nov 18 04:32:12 2015

Nimble. Agile. . . Speedy.

All traits that Kinami displayed excellently. "Wow! You really must be related to me," Sanoke commented with an eager smile, while complimenting himself. Without another word, however, the teen is tasked with defending himself against the speedy opponent. 

His hands flickered around, so swift that it practically formed after images (perhaps an exaggeration.) The purpose in the rapid movement would be to parry off the initial kick, the opposing momentum certainly being enough to stave off his advance into tthe air. "But ya not too strong! Gotta try harder than this, Kina!" 

[Insert Strategist Attitude]

At once, chakra surrounds his hair follicles, prompting a the elongated strands to spring forth and wrap around the woman's appendages. In the event that it had been successful, Sano flicks the chakra-enhanced hair to toss Kinami forward. In the event that she actually is sent ahead, the fellow rushes inward, after her as it floated through the skies!

A cross chop follows shortly after to the neck, hopefully dictating a quick descent to the ground.* - Wed Nov 18 04:51:50 2015

"Poor guy. . . But eh, he brought it upon himself," Sanoke remarks with a slight frown. Yes, Shira was insufferable, but it sucked to see someone lose their life.

At Mirai's behest, he takes out a simple scroll, and jots down a sealing formula.

Once it's in place, the two eyeballs are placed onto the fcenter. A single seal is spawned, allowing the chakra to flow and subsequently seal the eyes away. "Alright. . That should do it. I'm going to keep this in storage now." Once more, Sanoke bites his thumb to draw blood and performs the summoning technique.

Genbi, the common turtle guide, is brought out of nowhere. "I need you to hold onto this for me, Master. It's a special scroll, take it and keep it hidden. Also. . . ! Meet my fiance, Mirai!" As a note, this was a relatively small turtle.

The scroll is taken and placed into Genbi's mouth shortly after his reply of 'Evening, lass.' Assuming the Hokuma had nothing to state, the reptilian is desummoned.* - Wed Nov 18 05:20:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

He stands rigght on up, and proceeds to begin with the explanation.

"The jutsu is pretty simple in explanation. What you're doing is splitting your chakra off from your body, and forming it into an actual clone. . " The generalized explanation was a tad bit lack luster, but Sanoke sought to rectify this issue in a few moments.

His fingers press together, forming a cross formation.

"Follow me step by step. You see how my chakra is fluxuating?" On the inside, his stomach was indeed being chock-full of energy, and churning about irregularly. It was a relatively high quantity, enough to be capable of sustaining life for an entirely different body.  

"What I do is split it apart, while shifting the chakra to be in my likeness. Like a common henge, you manipulate the appearance of your chakra, making it mimic your own looks. . It'll have a portion of your chakra, and be linked to your own psychje. So it'll be great for recon or learning. But the downside? Each clone is weaker than you actually are. About half your strength, in fact. Still, it may be a useful technique for distractions," Sanoke admits, especially for a close-ranged opponent such as Mirai.

Finally, the rest of the technique is induced. The energy bubbling before split off into a plume of smoke, successfully making a doppleganger. "Shadow Clone technique. . "* - Wed Nov 18 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||In the time it took Mirai to begin practicing the technique, Sanoke had taken to the floor. His hands rested ontop of his head, and eyes remained glued to the female as she worked on the cloning technique. 

Repetition was the name of the game. Time and time again, she found herself struggling, yet the Hokuma's near prodigous nature perserveres as expected. "Huh. . ? You got a knack of showing me up. It took me way longer than that to get a hang of the jutsu. . Anywho, you'll be tasked with working on this in a few days. Even if they're half strength, if your new stance or whatever can make you a more precise and faster strike, this could become deadly. ."

He spoke in a tone of reassurance as he profoundly understood the nature of a Hyuuga. Their strength wasn't diminished as their physical ability declined. . Nay, the gentle fist was indiscriminant, and would assault an opponent equally as as hard, no matter how severely the user's strength had been divided. 

"But let's head on out. No point in teaching ya more, since you should focus on what you can do."* - Wed Nov 18 07:06:40 2015
