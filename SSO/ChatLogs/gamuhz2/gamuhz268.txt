<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blinks. He looks curiously to Koji's forehead.

"A seal on your forehead. . .? What's it supposed to do?"

He exhales, peering closer, but remaining cautious. "Tell me. You wanna learn some Fuuinjutsu from me? I might be willing to accept ya if you do. I don't normally teach people my good shit."* - Thu Dec 10 08:13:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
Mundane missions all around. The first being. . . Wood Delivery! Quickly, Sanoke unraveled the scroll's content, reading what the objective of the mission had to be. Being a simple C-ranked calibar assignment, it was certainly not anything that'd be beyond his level of comprehension or ability.

'Wood delivery! But not as far as you'd think. Move on to a western out post, and gather some wood. It's made from especially rare trees, ones that are highly flammable. Naturally, Sunagakure can use these finely crafted pieces of wood for fuel. They're especially useful given that not a single drop of liquid can be found within, making them as dry and flammable as can be.'

He nods, and eventually looks further down,. THere's a map of the area, with dotted lines leading to the destination. To really send this thing on home, instructions are scribbled just below, giving play-by-play details of where to go. Not a detail was left unsaid, and thus. . .Sanoke was off. His wife and children were asleep, and thus there wouldn't be an issue in being away for a few hours.

Speedily, the shinobi moves off, forming a single seal along the way. Smoke puffs out from the ground andh is body, clouding the immediate area. Like any true shinobi, the teen -- or young adult now -- rushed on ahead, his body blazing in glory. Dust was left behind his form in the rapid approach, and effortlessly the former Kazekage is speeding closer to the destination.

Given that this was simply an empty plain of existence with sand, there was very little times in which he had to contort and actualyl move out of the way. In record time, Sanoke is reaching the promised land. With a skid, he stops just ahead of the outpost with a giant smile. There are a large crew within the area, each one holding several wagons, with horses manning the stations and preparing for take off.

With a smile, Sanoke moved ahead, waving his hand in order to greet. "Ah! Hi! It's a good thing you guys were here. If I didn't see these horses. I may have gotten lost! Anywho, I'll transport this to Sunagakure."

--"Be careful, you never know, bandits might lurk around."

Taking the warning to heart, the Fuuinjutsu-based shinobi begins to unseal soem scrolls and adding specialized commands to it. Each of the items are set strategetically along the horses and the carriages, and could be activated on a single seal. All in Sanoke hoped this made the traveling all the moer safe and leisurely. After all, if push came to shove. . .Why not blow people up?

And cue a long winded period in which the horses and the shinobi moved along the terrain. With ease, the male moves a slower pace, enduring the harsh weathers of the desert, and even the occasional flood of sand. He had a facemask to aid in protecting himself, and after an hour more or traveling, the gates had been reached. It takes no time at all for the male to pull the cart of material forward and leaving it open for the helper shinobi to take in.

Now that the mission was complete, the KAzekage blurs in and out of view, his frame speedily searching through the terrain. Perhaps the training field would suffice? "Probably there. . "* - Thu Dec 10 09:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blurs in.

"I finished, yo."* - Thu Dec 10 09:14:40 2015

She drove a hard bargin.

Indeed, Sanoke tended to be exceptionally agree-able, especially when it pertained to his beloved wife, Mirai. As she spoke, the turtle summoning immediately broke out of his daze and nodded along with some eagerness. "Alright, let's go! We can train for a little, but if we do. . . I'd suggest some physical exercise," the Sasaki clansmen declared in an nonchalant tone. A finger was extended, and moved to poke the side of Mirai's belly, teasingly no doubt.

"You still have some of the baby fat from our three children." A short laugh occurs second after, suggesting that this was a joke! . . .Or had Mirai truly changed given the pregnancy? Regardless, the topic is quick to change. "Oooor spar. And if we spar. . . I don't think it'd be smart for me to fight purely in taijutsu, so expect for me to pull out some actual ninjutsu and fuuinjutsu techniques," he says in a moderately hyper tone.

At once, Sanoke kipped up, landing right on his feet. "So, to the training field?" a reply is awaited, and during the sequence, the energetic warrior does brief stretching exercises. Y'know, things like moving to touch his toes, arm rotations, leg lunges, and so forth. It really got the muscle fibers flowing, filled with flowing blood to push his body into tip top shape. 

Assuming the Hokuma had accepted the offer? The young adutl was quick to pick the female up in the same bridal fashion, just as he has done for years now. "Alright! Chikyu, you can come too to watch, if you wanna." And of course, shortly after, his body breaks off into a streak or blur, speedily rushing south to the training hotspot. In record time, Sanoke -- now showing off his added speed -- breaches the zone, and sets Mirai carefully onto her feet.

A wooden bokken is produced. "After this, let's go get a bite to eat? Then head home or something."* - Fri Dec 11 12:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

And so the duo were off. Just as mentioned before, they'd arrive along the field in a whisk of smoke, spawned solely due to Sanoke's constant usage of shunshin. It enabled the swift and timeless travel, their arrival also being greeted with a wave of sand cascading off into the area. 

"Hah! I love doing that. Y'know, you're the only person that never complains when I speed us off to an area. Everyone else is always like. . 'Wowowow! Too fassstt! I'm going to get sick," Sanoke idly spoke, the child-like wonder and nonchalance once more returning to his voice -- months after it's apparent absence. Being a simple citizen, a rounin even, it had renewed Sanoke's pysche as the previous employment was a giant source of stress.

"And I was only kiddin'! You still look great! Anywho. . Yet's start with some training. Physical exercises, one to work on your balance, speed, and stamina? Yeah, that'll work." A hand moves, and presses against Mirai's back. With a puff, smoke rushes out, summoning an moderately weighted turtle shell to restrain her movement and perhaps make it harder to operate entirely. Each step taken from that point was likely to consume a large amount of energy, and work the muscles to the core.

Never being a hypocrite, a shell is quicklly spawned on the former Kage's back himself. It was significantly more heavy, and deterred movement an d other physical activites even further than normal. At Chikyu's behest, the male blurred ahead, his body scaling the mountainous walls, and settling ontop. With a single seal, doton-based mud builds up and is spat onto the flooring, making each step along the exterior of the arena's roofing slippery and compromising in terms of balance. The sequence repeats, until every inch had been accounted for.

Towards the end, Sanoke's speedy frame again blurs, softening the sand on both sides of the track, ensuring that if anyone had fallen, they'd have a nice cushion to hit. Naturally, given that they wer both shinobi, Mirai and Sano's own sense of balance would be higher than the average human -- but even then, the conditions were hazardous enough to force concentrated effort and technique to avoid some embarassment. Especially if you were running at full speed.

"Avoid using Suimen. Let's see if you can finish. . -- No, that would being fair. Alright, let's see if you can finish three laps in the time I can finish six? I bet. . Hrm. -- I dunno, let's just compete, it'll be fun."* - Fri Dec 11 12:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: ... - Fri Dec 11 12:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

He gives Mirai the good ol' up and down, smiling as he admired her form. "The turtle shell looks good on ya. It fits so naturally!" The clear turtle fanatic declared happily. Using a grip, the two were quickly transported onto the top of the wall, where their feet smudged the brown glazing of mud along the terrain. 

"Alright. Hrm, if I win, I want a foot rub."

Without even waiting for comfirmation,Sanoke proceeded with a countdown. A swift and effective 'three-two-one.' And once it began? The former Kage was sprinting, his body still fairly fast, even while weighed down. Despite the added gravity concentration along his frame, Sanoek was still just about as fast as the Hokuma in her base form -- a sheer testiment to his level of physical conditioning.

Each step is wobbly, due to the lack of friction or fortitude. Every so often, he's straying off path, his body shaking from head to toe as it irregularly speeds along the pavement! . . But by some stroke of luck, the lad manages to keep his body upright, and moving along the goal. In no time at all, the corners are cut, and he's moving to reach the opposite or adjacent end of the field. With a quick leap, Sanoke's body scales over the gap and resumes with the moderately-sized path.

It does take long for a single lap to be completed. Along the way, the speedster is continung in stride, only pausing for moments to regather himself once the lack of balance grew too prevalent and nearly sent him over. Each time the gent is about to cut a corner, there's a stark decline in speed to allow for a sudden shift in direction and to avoid the momentum carrying over.

A glance falls back, hopefully viewing how his wife had been doing in the endeavor. "You good?!"* - Fri Dec 11 13:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
--To his surprise, Mirai had worked admirably even as the weights deterred her movements, and made every step an actual struggle. "W-Wow. . Look at her go. Who woulda thought someone built like that could move so swiftly. . " the male thoguht to himself, mouth practiaclly opened agape in surprise. Was this the true extent of the Hokuma's speed, or had she been working this effeciently merely off of adrenaline?

Regardless of the causes, she was leading the way, just barely outpacing Sanoke.

"I won't lose another challenge!" the young adult eagerly yelled, a wide grin manifesting onward to his features. Kicking off the ground with a sudden boost in motivation, off the snow-haired warrior blurred, his  frame elegantly dancing around the mountain's roof and marring the exterior with tattoos or imprints of hsi feet. 

Squelch, squelch!

His breaths were heavy, lungs working overtime to take in vast quantity of oxygen to fuel the body's muscles and grant the needed nutrition to continue working. Adrenaline flowed heavy in the childish warrior's body, granting new life and new vigor, and of course allowing for several more laps to be broken through in short order. . .One, two. . three.. . . ! And finally, numero four. Effectively, Sanoke's strides remained consistent, both llong and criminally swift.

Despite the rapid speed, his perception was refined, and save for a few stumbles, the male seemed to have little trouble retaining balance. The question remained. . .

How was Mirai holding up?* - Fri Dec 11 13:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: <*waits*> - Fri Dec 11 14:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Let's just spar. - Fri Dec 11 14:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: -- Wow! I was about to win. . - Fri Dec 11 14:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Doubt it. - Fri Dec 11 14:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Alright! Let's go. - Fri Dec 11 14:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

At Mirai's behest, they'd change the activity. A simple,. good ol' fashioned spar! It had been a long time coming, especially with the Hokuma's rapid growth. "I wonder. . Will I finally need to go full power? I can tell you've been getting very powerful."

In no time, they were displaced, sitting somewhere along an empty wasteland in Sunagakure. It was devoid of life or activity, giving both parties the perfect avenue to go all out -- plus it ensured that no one would interrupt their battle. 

Once in place, Sanoke does a few somersaults, giving ample distance betweent he two would-be opponents. He falls into a rookie stance, working on his own ability to manipulate one of the Oasis's numerous stances. It'd be fair, given Mirai's near mastery of the gentle fist technique. "Anywho, let's rock. Anything goes, just avoid going in with lethal intent. As usual, I'll let you take the first move."

Along Sanoke's person was a series of scrolls, some with actual weapons, others with 'practice weapons.' As fitted the tags within them to be specific for spars, meaning only concussive and non-lethal.* - Fri Dec 11 14:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
God damn! 

He was visibly surprised, or caught off guard, mainly at how easily Mirai hadclosed the distance, and how swift her hand movement had become. ". . .Shit, shit, shit! You're getting fast!" Sanoke declared, his body promptly dancing out harms way. Each time her arms swung, the gentle fist came closer and closer to striking-- Until on the fifth, a singular blow had been landed.

This time, it wasn't by the shinobi's own doing. . .Nay, Mirai had simply gotten that proficient in hand to hand tcombat. Wasting little time cringing, the bokken in hand is utilized with equal quickness. Three swift swings are unleashed, the velocity enough to make the movements simple blurs and hard to perceive, at least for those that lacked the perception.

They were contained, and dished to the woman's ribs. 

\Hit or miss, the former Kage was going onward with a different tactic to keep his distance. With a single motion, his hands clap together, unleashing a vast andvicious gale of wind. Chakra secrated from Sanoke's form, feeding the wind molecules just ahead, and forcing the wind currents to be beckoned to his will. Thus, the suddden surge or breeze rushes to the Hokuma's form, intent on pushing her back and granting much needed breathing room!

". . .I don't think I can even dare to engage her in close range. She has too many options. . .A few hits and it's all over. ." He's backpeddling, utilizing extreme speeds to cover a vast distance and remain out of Mirai's apparent attack range.* - Fri Dec 11 22:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
A turtle arrives on the scene, and nibbles at Taku's pant legs.

"Hey. You lookin' for yer old man?"* - Fri Dec 11 22:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) thinks: That turtle just talk? - Fri Dec 11 22:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
Yes. The turtle clearly talks. He's a commonly sized one as well.

"Well lemma show ya. . "

Assuming Taku's compliance, the two were off.* - Fri Dec 11 22:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) thinks: .... There's talking turtles?... I want one!! - Fri Dec 11 22:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
The duo would have ventured off into the desert's outskirts.

There? Sanoke and Mirai seemed to be engaging in first combat, where the two could cut loose -- but not so much that it was lethal.* - Fri Dec 11 22:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
In all this time, Sanoke hadn't ever truthfully encountered the specialized Gentle Fist technique! It was a tad bit surprising, and perhaps would have caught the gent off guard, had it not been for usage of his Rinnegan. With the doujutsu active, the warrior can quite clearly see the colored chakra galing throiugh the skies, and rushing forward to attack his body's weakpoints, just as any of the other Hyuuga techniques would do.

". . Can't. . Get. . .Hit!" 

Once more, Sanoke's exceptionally nimble nature is put well in display. His body flicked off into blurs, contorting and moving in oddly formed manners-- which really stressed how flexible he truly was.. It was a free-flowing and often random tactic, which is why he was so excellent in evading almost anything -- Because the teen never truly gave much thought to his actions before going through with it. 

Narrowly, the Air Palm would have soared beyond the former Kage's frame. THe force and velocity made the breeze stir just a tad, forcing strands of hair to flicker onward within the wind. Moving in stride, Sanoke's hand flicks off, forming a trio of handseals and building up a vast amount of chakra. . .!

Mirai, with her All-Seeing-Byakugan, is casually able to detect where the build up of energy had began, and where the energy source flowed! This being? Right onto his cranium, activating the typical 'Yang Release.'  The growth rate, and general make up of his the male's hair compositio was drastically altered, as the physical energies in his body is extraordinarily manipulated. From this, a large amassment of fur builds up and rushes ahead.

The thick lionsmane beelines, aiming to bumrush right into Mirai's form and tackle her onto the floor! Naturally, he was holding back considerably in terms of strength.

-- Then Taku arrived! Even while in the thick of combat, Sanoke always had time for his child! "Hey, Taku! I see Gojo finally found ya?! You sleep a lot, son. Y'know that? Let's talk some more after I've beaten your mom in this spar!"* - Fri Dec 11 23:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

The scene was all too familiar.

Naturally, with his optical prowess, Sanoke picked apart the process, recognizing it as the same echnique utilized by the Hyuuga Zhen. "Freakin' Hokumas, haha!" He said with a smile. The chakra from Mirai's form flared in all directions, while the air palms were accurately being used to pinpoint and weed out the very few weak points that existed within the Lion Mane's structure. 

Given her growing skill, and the lack of effort applied, the attack is a mild success, being capable of rendering a large bushof the hair inert and useless. Strands fall, beckoning Sanoke to release the flowing chakra and resume his normal stancing.

". . . Sheesh. Your clan is pretty versatile. . You guys aren't restricted to close-range anymore, haha." A cheeky grin is worn from ear to ear. Although, the nonchalance wasn't to be confused with an unwillingess to continue, Sanoke's little boy had arrivedo n the scene, and now it was time to ensure that his son view the Turtle-Sennin-inTraining as a person worthy of being looked up too. 

"Let's see ya try this up for size. . "

With that, Sanoke broke off into a full speed sprint. His body arc'd in a circular motion, running tireless laps around Mirai's form. The rate picks up almost instantly, and -- considering the speed -- builds up a faux cyclone of sand. Hopefully, the dust cloud was enough of a distraction to mask his next movement. . . ! 

Mid-sprint, a hand reaches down, summoning some of his specially made explosive-tag bombs -- non lethal of course. About four are launched along the pavement, bouncing over and aiming to surround the Hokuma from different angles. And immediately? They combust, releasing light explosives that possess great concussive power and only very minor burning potential. . . He wasn't trying to freaking kill her, after all.

"Ninja Art! Blow 'em up technique!"* - Fri Dec 11 23:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
The battling abruptly comes to an end.

He turns, eying Taku with a smile as the Byakugan was clearly activated. "Wow! You already can use your Byakugan?! Already at such a young age. You're a chip off the old block, hah."

He swelled with pride at the sight.

Guess being legit was just genetic.* - Sat Dec 12 00:33:39 2015

Taku was being a little unreponsive.

"Alright, to evne use your Byakugan. . .You need to know how to manipulate your chakra. So tell me, what's the first thing you know about chakra?" He speaks with some nonchalance.Abruptly, Sanoke shifts, taking a seat indian-styled along the sand.* - Sat Dec 12 01:39:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) coughs, changing the subject.

"Anywho. . Your chakra is a composition of two energies. Physical energy. . Y'know, your energy that you use when you run and stuff. And spiritual energy, thats your 'souls' energy in a way. It represents your feelings, your emotions, your thoughts- -- all of that jazz. What you're doing is combining them both. ."

He exhales, a holds a palm out. Azure chakra comes speeding outward.

"To do it hinges on your mental ability. Block out all distractions and focus on your inner self. . Locate your internal 'stream' and aim to bind it with your body's n atural energy. Get it?"* - Sat Dec 12 01:53:52 2015

With his rinnegan eye, Sanoke can view Manami's process. And with some luck, she seems able to actually access her chakra -- although, the control or ability to manipulate the energy seemed lukewarm at best.

He giggles, finding Manami's panicked state to be amusing.

"Don't worry! You can't hurt yourself like that. If you want the flow of energy to stop, then just stop thinking about it. You only use chakra if you're actively trying. But that's good. . You pick up fast."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shook his head. 

He smiles, and flicks over to the toddler. "Cute. What, you want to be a Super Hokuma like your mother? To be able to do that. . . You have to learn chakra," Sanoke replied aloud, his tone gentle. There's a low, yet still notable whimisical tone hidden underneath.

"I can help you, if you'd like."* - Sat Dec 12 23:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) smirked.

"C'mon, Miaka. Keep tryi'--" Then it seemed the young gal had unlocked the Byakugan herself. In all honestly, Sanoke was left flabbergasted, as each of the  individuals were displaying prodigous skill.  A glance falls over to Mirai.

"Hey. When did you first open your Byakugan?"* - Sun Dec 13 00:00:48 2015
