<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh. Well, not going to lie. Most of my techniques aren't really that offensively potent. Except one, but it's my original creation. - Wed Nov 18 22:14:36 2015

He speeds to take a seat onto his couch.

A scroll is tossed onto the floor, releasing a seal upon striking the floor. Like a regular capsule, smoke erupts, clouding the items that were being revealed. It was a simple table, with a set of ink and brushes -- just like the good ol' days when Noriko used to teach him. He ponders on the thought. 

"Alright. Choose which one we'll work on first. . . Since I want you to focus on one before going onto the next. Five Seal Barrier? It'd be a nifty technique to lock down your house, and keep things secure. Or finger carving seal? A pre-requisite to writing sealing formulas on any surfaces. Definitely is better than being restricted to ink and brushes."* - Wed Nov 18 22:30:49 2015

"Right. I'll show ya the finger carving seal, then we'll take a recess," Sanoke instructs.

He takes out a scroll, and proceeds to jot down some information. The information was in fact just doodles, each one being broken down into steps. They depicted the process needed to perform the simple ninjutsu. 

Intelligently, he went through the processes while explaining what was being drawn. "Alright. . What I'm doing is simple. The first process is obivous. What you do is build up a small mass of chakra in your belly, and guide it along the chakra ways in your body. The point is to force it upward in a gently, tamed stream up to your hands and finger tips. . "

Sanoke visually shows the process, while the other hand works on jotting the pictures. A thick, azure colored flow of energy finds itself manifested upon his hand. But unlike the finished process, the flow seems to be untamed and moves about irregularly. Imagine a raging ocean -- that's what this was like. "The point from here is to flow the chakra to each of your five finger tips. It's harder said than done, but as you guide the diffeerent patches, form them into oval-like shapes, and it won't be a perfect oval, mind you. Since the chakra will appear like a flame.. . "

And as per usual, Sano again goes through the sequences. Expertly, his flow is calmed and drafted onto the five finger tips, gently forming flaming spheres. "The hardpart is putting this to use. What you're basically doing is pressing your hand against a surface, and like burning a seal onto it's frame. For skin, this will be aggitating. In anycase, as you're burning, you do the usual fuuinjtusu process, and code the seal to your desire, and that'd be all."

A hand pressed onto his table, performing the basic sealing formula. Easy, right?

"After this, I'll show you my ace-technique!"

He fights back the urge to fall a sleep as Ai goes through mimicking his ability. It goes as expected, with the woman routinely failing andh aving difficulties. Even if this was a basic leveled skill, the rank was still high enough to provide some sort of difficulty.

But alas, all seemed to go as planned with Ai finally getting the technique down pact. Albeit, a bit roughly. 

"Good! That's another technique. In a bit, I'll show ya how to make a sealing barrier, but for now work with what you got."* - Thu Nov 19 00:26:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) pressed his hands together. 

The chakra builds up along his body, propelling the shinobi before. In about two to three seconds' time, Sanoke had succesfully covered about one-hundred and fifty meters to the north. The area is marked with a foot.

Seconds later, the shinobi kicks off again, each step sending ahead a gust of wind. In no time, he returns to the previous spot, his legs strickening to pause the moment. "Phew! Y'see?"* - Thu Nov 19 09:35:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: It's not really special. - Thu Nov 19 09:40:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Yep. It's the most versatile of ninjutsu sub-types. - Thu Nov 19 09:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's only really good if you get advanced, though. - Thu Nov 19 09:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: Are you better then what's his face? - Thu Nov 19 09:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: Forget his name. - Thu Nov 19 09:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: The one you said flirts with everyone. - Thu Nov 19 09:50:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Tell me more about this 'style' you're making. - Thu Nov 19 10:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: It's a more advanced form of my gentle fist style except i'll utilize my knowledge on the human body to strike pressure points and render certain limbs useless in combat. - Thu Nov 19 10:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: . . .That sounds terrifying. . What if you strike someone like on the shoulder to make their arm limp. That'll make casting ninjutsu near impossible. - Thu Nov 19 10:11:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: What. . Bars don't serve burgers? - Thu Nov 19 19:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Plus The Hungry Ant is more of a cafe than a bar. - Thu Nov 19 19:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looked to Chiyku in a state of awe, his mouth opened wide in surprise.

"You don't. . Know the wonders of a burger?" He looks around, examining Sunagakure. "Well. . . Makes sense, don't think this place has cows. Long story short, a burger is like an ascended sandwich. . I guess."* - Thu Nov 19 19:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Thu Nov 19 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: *gasps!* - Thu Nov 19 20:01:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I didn't know you guys haven't had one. - Thu Nov 19 20:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Uh.. - Thu Nov 19 20:34:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hmm? - Thu Nov 19 20:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) stared on as Kasanari seemed to be having the time of her life with the burger. His eyes clearly conveyed how mystified he felt as the swords woman was observed in her conquest. 

Was food really that good? Why couldn't he enjoy a meal as thorough as Chikyu had?

At the end, there's a small amount of envy resting within Sanoke's soul, but he doesn't particularly make that known. "Geez. . .You looked like you were in heaven for a second. Was it really that good?"* - Thu Nov 19 20:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Yep, it was pretty good! - Thu Nov 19 20:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Was is as good as. . .. deez nuts? -omit- - Thu Nov 19 20:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Too small and burnt -omit- - Thu Nov 19 20:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Wow. . .I don't think I've ever liked a food so much.. - Thu Nov 19 20:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's kinda sad really. I'll never get to know that level of happiness.. - Thu Nov 19 20:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Like deez nuts -omit- - Thu Nov 19 20:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) had a subtle frown on his face due to the previous revelation. Was there a world or dimension of joy that he could never truly obtain? To have your tastebuds dazzled to such a degree. . . That's all the teen desired.

The self pity ceases as Chikyu makes her approach. Sanoke seemed a tad bit wary initially, but eventually calms as Kasanari is a recognize-able and trusted face. Albeit, it's a tad bit awkward as she's stroking his chin. "Uh. . Are you like. . singing to me?"  the summoner questioned with a slight grin once the swords woman began speaking.

Eventually, he just nods his head with some enthusiasm, fully under the belief that he too could experience the joy Chikyu had the fortune of knowing. "Yeah! . . . But it'll be hard. I eat a lot of things. So far, my favorite is chocolate cake."* - Thu Nov 19 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Uh, what are you talking about? - Thu Nov 19 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . You're not singing? - Thu Nov 19 21:01:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Don't you remember what you just did like ten seconds ago? - Thu Nov 19 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hhaha, Sanoke whats wrong with you. I just came to say, I hope you find something good to eat. - Thu Nov 19 21:02:30 2015
