"I'm unsure who this Flexus guy was. But yeah, as it stands now, I don't have the skillset to battle that dude. I'm not too offensively minded, I could avoid dying, but I can't win," Sanoke admits in hopes of justifying his lack of activity to Yan. Although, to go further, it wasn't as if the Turtle Summoner knew of Baen's heinous exploits, after all.

He turns to Kirie.

"So. Got anything ya can help me with? And I can give you pointer on that jutsu if you want."* - Wed Oct  7 04:37:20 2015

"Huh. . ? What's going on. . .?" The boy questions. The sudden shifting of the earth was startling to say the least. It prompts him to drop his dumplings onto the sand, and beckons for the warrior to take action. . .Or at least be in position to do so.

Deterously, a hand falls onto his hip, retrieving one of the many scrolls he held on his person. Chakra is being built, but he targets no one in particularly. Sanoke didn't know the story, after all.* - Wed Oct  7 07:13:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blinks. This was all really getting out of hand. Sanoke's chakra continued to build up, in preparation to step in if things got too far.

"Violet! You attack to capture, not kill! If this guy has done something wrong, he has to answer to the law!"* - Wed Oct  7 07:41:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) sighs. The shell on his back is sealed away on a moment's notice, allowing full utilization of his velocity.

Why did things always have to get messy? Sanoke forms a single seal, spawning two clones to his right. The first dashes ahead, while forming a seal of it's own, effectively allowing the wires along his forearms to be shot out. Of course, seeing Baen's skill, the former chunnin knew that restraining this beast wasn't possible -- But perhaps he could save Violet from being killed, since murder was assumed to be the goal.

"Hey! Cut it out, man! She didn't even know it was you!"* - Wed Oct  7 08:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) watcheas the Kaguya presumably goes to sprint away.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) had resummoned his shell.

"Hop on my back. I'll carry you to a safe spot, this'll be part of my training. As for the rest of you guys, take care, okay?" He says gently, while awaiting for the Uchiha to get onboard.* - Wed Oct  7 08:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: I need to learn more Fuuin myself ...Case a tailed beast strikes.. - Wed Oct  7 08:11:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: So traveling all the way here from Kumokagure was a waste of time. - Wed Oct  7 08:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) kicks off the ground once Fujitora had gotten onto his back. He moves ahead, sprinting at a breakneck level of speed and heads off the horizon. The momentum kicks up a plume of dust that trails behind his form in the fast-paced exit.* - Wed Oct  7 08:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) cue a few minutes of rushing. They arrive on another end of Sunagakure.

"Anywho. I need some assistance in a lot of shit. Swordsmanship, Doton ninjutsu, Shurikenjutsu, Genjutsu, Fuuinjutsu, and so forth. What can ya help me in?"* - Wed Oct  7 08:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods. He knew all of these things were useful, hence his pursuit in the arts. After all, a shinobi wasn't a man that was just dominant in one area of the game -- a shinobi had to be versatile. 

Upon hearing Fujitora's suggestions, Sanoke's gaze dims, his pupils practically shrinking. "Huh. . ? Shit. . .Uh, I ain't really good with Doton. . . I can't even really build up a large enough mass of Doton chakra," the boy admits. "maybe we should start with Shurikenjutsu?"* - Wed Oct  7 08:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm.. Can you perform the shadow shuriken technique? - Wed Oct  7 08:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . . - Wed Oct  7 08:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Shadow what what? - Wed Oct  7 08:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I take that as a no. - Wed Oct  7 08:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Pay attention. - Wed Oct  7 08:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) paid close attention in hopes of uncovering the true nature of the skill. In his career, Sanoke -had- actually encountered the technique before, but he simply believed the second shuriken that would come from the former's shadow was only a miscalculation or error on his part. Now then. . . It was good to know that a technique such as this actually existed.

All eight of the projectiles hit their mark, bringing a slick smile onto the warrior's face. 

"Wow! I'm not going to lie, I suspected there were more shurikens, but I only caught wind of them once the first had passed on by. It's not a flawless technique, but it can definitely be used to catch someone off guard! Even with great reflexes, you'll be hard pressed to evade on such short notice!" the teen exclaims, his grin giddy and an excited giggle just barely being suppressed. 

A hand rose, rubbing the bottom of his chin. "But this'll be difficult. . All jokes aside. If I want to do it. . I have to aim my trajectory just right, so that the second lags behind the first in just the right positioning. I also have to control the power. . . nevermind the aim. . ." articulated the savant of a shinobi. A hand falls onto his side, summoning a mass of star-shaped, metallic objects. 

Swiftly, he blurs ahead, feet grinding against the ground shortly after to spawn enough friction to demand a hault. "Alright . .Alright. I'mma need you to be my guide on this. Let me know how well I do on this attempt, understood?" Assuming Fujitora agrees, the former chunnin is swift to go back into the work. 

As a trained shinobi, Sanoke certainly knew how to throw a weapon or two. His arm slings forward, with the wrist whipping just as his appendage had reached the endpoint of it's path. There's some torque, allowing for a curving fashion. Following the right arm, Sanoke's left copies the motion-- yet the strength isn't quite even. Thus, the shuriken coming from behind outspeeds the initial shuriken. Not only this, but they're not even lined up properly, making both projectiles as clear as day.

In anycase, as they traveled onto Fujitora, both stars clash against one another, thus throwing themselves off course. "Hng. . ."* - Wed Oct  7 08:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He nods along. What Fujitora spoke of made sense. Why immediately pull this technique out? It was a skill that could easily catch someone with surprise -- if the set up was correct.

For the few moments that the Uchiha actually spoke, Sanoke was attentive. His memory enables his to easily record the information, pretty much absorbing it all like a sponge. Sadly, even as a 'savant', the boy was no prodigy, and certainly no genius. He struggled. . . Struggled -hard.- No matter how often he tried, the technique again ended in failure. 

In time, he had been practicing the jutsu for up to half an hour, all while occasionally being under the watchful eye of the Ryujin. Every so often, the teacher in this art spoke up once more, providing much needed advice. Of course, being an independent studier, Sanoke eventually trains solely by himself -- after all, there was probably nothing more boring than being forced to observe his botched Shadow Shuriken technique again and again.

Thus, at once, his fingers press together, conjuring a single Shadow CLone. With the usual jovialness and enthusiasm, the doppleganger raced ahead, falling into a football-like stance. For real, he really looked like a defensive back, ready to go sack the fuck outta a quarterback. Eyes narrowed, the clone wore a shit-eating grin. "Alright, 'boss.' Let's get this show on the road, I'll tell ya whether you're hot, or your cold. Got me?" 

"Shut the fuck up! And prepare your eyes!"

The curse words are said in a cutesy fashion, making the command all too amusing to really be angry at. Once more, his hands fall to his side, summoning more weapons from his seemingly endless supply of Shurikens that were placed in a scroll. 

Inhale, exhale. He does so repeatily, calming the jittery nerves. With both eyes narrow, Sanoke's feet plant right into the ground. Upon swinging his arms, the boy's upperbody leans in, and his wrists flick. The subtle motions -- while easily being deemed unnecessary to most -- make the shuriken toss all the more powerful. No doubt, he wasn't even close to a seasoned weapon's tosser, but the rate or velocity was still something to admire. 

Nevertheless, admirable or not -- it was still a failure at the end of the day. With a loud clink, the two weapons clash once more. Although by now, he had been more than able to be capable of placing them in the proper positioning. All that needed to be worked on was the precision in terms of power and speed. Nevermind the fact that Sanoke would certianly have trouble aiming with a proper target, as this required far too much effort and focus.

Eventually, the rigorous training exercise go on for another hour. The fact that he's even able to last this long is a testiment to immense will power, along with a silly amount of natural reserves.Small inklings of sweat formed into beads over this period, and trickled down his flesh and clothes. It would have formed a puddle had there not been sand soaking up the water, and of course the outragously hot climates forcing rapid evaporation.

"Gotta. . . Get this thing down. It's literally a D-rank jutsu. . . 'Jutsu'. . Keep at it. . I can tell--"

"C'mon! What are you talking to yourself for?! You almost had it that last time you moron!" Sanoke's clone berates, outraged by the boy's consistent tendacy to monologue to himself. Flustered, the real Sanoke's face growns a tad bit red, before the feeling is shaken off. He shakes his fist, utterly obsencities back in rebuttal. After a lengthy argument, he was back at the fray.

A foot plants onto the ground, and once more, his hands flicker, so fast that it was a simply blur to the naked eye. At last, the shuriken sync'd in a way. One hiding right behind the other. . . ! They speed, moving in a circular fashion, and gaining a buzz saw- adjaacent appearance!

". . .Really! You didn't even throw t--" Poof. The slick talking vclone disperses, caught off guard as he danced around the first Shuriken. Clearly, he had failed to notice the second!

". . .Violet came the other day. She told me that. . . That Koeki died. I'll feel like shit if it's true. . . I just abandoned her and the village. . " Sanoke announces, assuming Lera hadn't yet heard.* - Wed Oct  7 11:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shrugs. Not too many details had been released. . .

"From what I've been told, some man came to attack. . . Beat her and released some -- I dunno. . Violet was vague with the details. . " He says dryly. The simple notion of his childhood friend perishing left a sour taste in Sanoke's mouth, and again made his heart hang heavy. .  This wouldn't be the first time he had let a comrade down.

"If only Noriko was here to see. . She'd be very disappointed," the teen thinks to himself in distress.* - Wed Oct  7 11:50:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) still frowned. He had a tendacy of shouldering the blame, simply due to overwhelming grief or guilt. . "But imagine if I had been there? Maybe things could have been different. . I could have made a difference. Hell, imagine if you were there too. . . So many lost lives. . " The news likely would have spreaded. Essentially all of Kirigakure's army had been eradicated, and many citizens at that.

Things were looking bleak for the land of water.* - Wed Oct  7 11:55:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) scratches his head. 

He looks onto the presumably dying boy. .  His doujutsu activating and making the link apparent. Hesistantly, Sanoke takes a step back, as the feeling that came with his unlocked abilities were hard to resist by now. . "No. . . Ergh. . ."

"Right. .. So what's with that. . ?"* - Thu Oct  8 02:51:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) is shaking, his body sweating like a regular drug addict. It was hard to contain his innate urges or desires. . .Yet the little one remained in the vicinity. The male still had to save face. . .

In a robotic manner, Sanoke makes way on to Izanami, resting a hand on the girl's shoulder. 

". . .He likely had his reasons. He's no doubt a shinobi like you are, and how i was once was. . His resolve pushes him to do extreme things. This boy, he was like a brother to you, no?"* - Thu Oct  8 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) sighs. It was never fun or cool to watch the young die. His hand moved up and down, massaging the young Jinchuuriki's shoulder.

"I'm sure he didn't. . . I just hope you can look pass it. Your friend made some unwise choices -- But he can respected as he was willing to pay the ultimate price in the pursuit of whatever goal he had. I don't sense any animosity. . nor vengence coming from your aura, so I guess that's a good thing," He notes, proud that Izanami wasn't taking Suitengu's demise too personally.

The last thing the world needed was an angsty, angry Jinchuuriki.

"Anywho. . I suppose it's time I bury this. Any last words you want to say. . ?" 

It's funny. His innate desires to utilize Suitengu's corpse was still going strong. But that feeling still paled in comparison to Sanoke's true nature -- one that was friendly and helpful. That was a good sign, at least from his perspective. Maybe power -really- wouldn't consume him.* - Thu Oct  8 03:12:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
And suddenly it was happening.

He was all alone. Time had practically slowed from his perspective. . .His heart beated in a slow, rhythmic fashion that mirrored the warped perception as well. He kneels, at last moving to dig a hole. This is done easily, via use of a Kunai. Rigorously, the former chunnin slashes along the ground again and again.

Eventually, a deep depression is spawned, about five feet in depth total. It's wide as well, certainly enough to bury an entire body -- especially one as small as Suitengu's.

At this point, his frame went through a mixture of emotions. Some were driven by the toxic effects of having the rinnegan. It compelled him to pursue added power, as it so desperately wanted to become whole. . . Vision was becoming hazy, yet still fighting those emotions, Sanoke moved to carry the bloodied carcass in a bridal style. 

Blood and dirt smudged his usually cleaned clothes. Ignoring these factors, the teen moved onto the hole, settling Suitengu's frame into the depression. Snuggly, the boy lays admist the earth. . .while Sanoke himself arose. His heart still panged with desire -- and guilt. . Guilt for what he was about to do. Nevertheless, it was necessary endeavor. Why not empower yourself before people inevitably came?

"No. . No. . .Power. . .I -- Ih ave to pursue. Even if it scares me. . . Even if this feels wrong. . like cheating. . ." The snow-haired boy hesistates. His body fidgets, at some points seeming well on its way to exit. Yet it freezes, and abruptly, the usually reserved young man rushes ahead, latching onto the body. Two fingers move, prodding at his eyes and LITERALLY gouging them out. . . No matter how gentle.

They're held forward. . . and brought towards his own frame. 

Before long, both organs are overwhelmed with flowing energy, and they begins to shape. Indeed, the two eyes would be dematerialized, and quite literally flow into his own eyes. The flow of energy clashes against his body. . and eventually, purple-ish rings spawn. Some of the energetic residue remain on the schelera, and begins to move in circular motions. .. 

Each rep forces another ring to materialize, and continues onward up until four rings were now in Sanoke's purple eyes. As that settles? All the instincts had subsided. He was once more the same ol', fun-loving Sanoke. . . yet now he felt dirty. . . changed. "I need to speak with my master soon. . "

The boy leaps, soon after placing his shadesb ack on. In Katsune's approach, she'd find the last process of Suitengu's corpse being buried. "Hng. . . Hate when the kids die young."* - Thu Oct  8 03:43:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) sweeps up off feet, and moves.* - Thu Oct  8 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Before the trip could begin, Sanoke had to gather the proper provisions. Good fortune shines about upon him. Not only was the former shinobi well-off economically, but he also had some skill in the usage of Fuuinjutsu. Speedily, he sprints around the landscape, stopping at the proper stores to gather needed tools and supplies; things like ninja weapons, tags/seals, and of course some food. 

They also had flash bombs, and so forth. Ignoring his partial guilt for the essential robbing of a corpse, he moved ahead.

Upon going shopping, Sanoke sprints ahead, once more grabbing Mirai in a b ridal fashion and moving beyond the protective borders of Sunagakure. Indeed, they'd be forced to trek along the dastardly desert. The sun is indiscriminate, and beats down on their frames, forcing sweat to seep through pores. Nevertheless, this was in the job description. It isn't long before Sanoke and Mirai trek moret han a mile into the middle of nowhere, following a general map that had been provided within the scroll.

The turtle sage kneels down, pressing a finger along the hot desert flooring. This was going to be difficult for sure. A hand would bite down, conjuring up some blood. "Mirai. Your eyes can be used to track, yeah? I want you to scan the perimeter. Keep your vision close to the ground, and try to see if you can find some underground tunnels. If you do, I'll let you lead the way, so we can infiltrate. . . Luckily, I have some summons that can do just the trick," Sanoke declared.

A hand presses against the ground after five seals, allowing small baby turtles to appear shortly afterwards. They appear ready and eager to go -- but that would have to wait. 

"Let's do this, already. This mission shouldn't take long."* - Thu Oct  8 04:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
"Huh. . It's really right under my nose? God damnit. ."

He blushes a tad, amused/embarrassed at his own inability to see the location of the tunnel. Before long, he summons yet another turtle -- and both seemed to mimick the color or decoration of his eyes. But now held usage of the almighty rinnegan, even if Sanoke's mastery with such was meager.

They begin to dig into the ground, showing speed that was far superior than a normal turtle. As they go, eventually, a decently sized hole is developed, and they sneak into the area. Strangely enough, what they saw was clearly projected onto Sanoke's brain, making this jutsu effective for recon and other tasks. ". . .Keep scanning. . We're about to go in. Cover yourself with the cap so we can blend in with the rest of the worker. The object is going to be simple, we're going to sneak pass the rest of the warriors, and beeline towards the leader. Once we got the leader, we take him out in secret, then use Henge in order to get the rest of lackeys out. . "

It was a full proof plan. Thankfully, as the turtle make their way around, they eventually give life to an entry point. At once, Sanoke has them desummoned and grasps Mirai by the hand. He leads her off, finding the entrance while also getting into a Sunagakure garb just as she had. With his appearance completely concealed, the turtle summoner steps forward. . his feet moving lightly. . yet there being some quickness with his motions. 

"Alright. . .Let's keep it going. . "Thankfully, no one had suspected a damn thing. There were whispers, but in the end, most of the workers had keep to mining. 

Pang! Pang! Sparks occasionally flew about as a result of the relentless hammering away. It was quite clear that they were making a killing. "Keep your doujutsu activated. . .I'll let you lead again. . guide us towards the end -- where the 'Boss' should be. We'll have this handled quickly," Sanoke instructs, his voiced hushed and devoid of any real volume.

* - Thu Oct  8 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||They'd continue to casually waltz around the mining area. To really blend in, Sanoke would have grabbed two pairs of pickaxes, handing one off to Mirai herself. The item rests on his shoulder, and generally, no one had grown suspicious. The mission was appearing as if it was going to be a cinch. . . All they had to do was continue in stride, and take out the boss man in no time.

Before long, they'd have moved nearly a mile within the underground tunnel, and closed in on the mid point -- where the base of operations truly was. The bandit boss for this operation, Randall, was currently seated within it. Oddly, there were no guards, as the Boss -- in all his arrogance -- believed no one could ever infiltrate this deeply within the tunnel, at least not being noticed. 

Little did he know, two talented Sunagakure shinobi were on their way.

By then, Sanoke murmurs more instructions, and his hands fumble while hidden in the cloak. He was reaching for a scroll no doubt, to make this elimination of the threat as swift and effective as possible. "You ready. . ? We should be in the clear by now. . .  Let's go and take this fool out. Try not to kill if you can, i'd like to just have him captured so we can lock things down and be on our way," the defacto squad leader instructs admist the way.

It was only a matter of time. And by this point, he took the lead to be able to shield Mirai had this been a trap. * - Thu Oct  8 05:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
"I can feel more chakra in there. Two in particularly. . Hold your breath, I'm going to throw some gases in. Use your Byakugan to take advantage of such and knock them out. . I'll be by yourside to support you. . "

A few moments are waited to ensure that Mirai was fully prepared to take on such a crucial roll. 

After the lotted time, a scroll is withdrawn, sending heaps of bombs forward. They combust, releasing irritated gases. Ones that force your body to cough, and induces grogginess to ensure that they were weakened. Naturally, given that the tent would only contain the fumes, both of the individuals were rushing out. . . And that's where the duo of Sanoke and Mirai struck. 

Equipped with a tanto, the male moves ahead, holding his breath, and being just behind the Hyuuga. Indiscriminantly, he slashed, his moved shielded by residue of smoke that crept from the tent. Thankfully, he could see chakra, and thus could easily locate both of the perps even as they couldn't locate him. Inspite the use of a sharpened weapon, the teen is mindful to avoid striking vital areas, hoping to slow them down so that Mirai could subsequently knock them out.

Cue watching as the Hyuuga did her thing.

Once both parties are defeated, Sanoke takes the initiative, wrapping them with his Wirebind technique and summoning Ganba -- the turtle was very much like he always was. But even he could tell something was wrong, considering the eyes were precisely like the legendary doujutsu, the rinnegan. Not bothering to question it just yet, considering they were in the mission, the turtle does his job, gathering the defeated parties, and tunneling out. He's on path to Sunagakure. . Meanwhile, this leaves him and Mirai to complete the mission.

Three seals later, and Sanoke mimics perfectly into the mob boss. "I want ya to henge into the others. Let's go and kick these squares out, then I'll seal everything." All in all, the lengthy fight had left him unharmed. He suffered minor cuts or bruises, but a simple bandage was all that'd be needed. Cue leading Mirai back to where they came to leave the mines done for good.* - Thu Oct  8 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Mirai worked admirably, taking out the other warrior with ease. Upon having the criminal defeated, Sanoke continues with his own battle. Swift sword swings are all that's needed, and save for a few cuts or bruise he's able to win in an effective manner. The boss is bloodied and cringing in pain, but he'll live. As previously intended, the wire bind technique goes, constricting their movements, and allowing both crooks to be transported via his summons.

At last, Sanoke henges as one. "Henge as the other, and we'll go."

Assuming compliance, the boy moves ahead of Mirai, and utilizes the disguise to order all the grunt bandits out. They disperse with swiftness, making the mines clear. "Ergh. . That was a fuckin' pain. Let's get outta here though, I'll seal the exit once we're out." He really wanted to go back home, clearly enough.* - Thu Oct  8 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Cue Mirai following suit. They go through the process, having hundreds of bandits exit the area. Once they're out, the seal is placed onto the exit, barring any and all entry. A five seal barrier. Sanoke, grabbing Mirai in the same bridal fashion, speeds on off, prepared to enter the village. 

He does so in no time, considering how close the mining area was to Sunagakure.* - Thu Oct  8 07:38:40 2015
