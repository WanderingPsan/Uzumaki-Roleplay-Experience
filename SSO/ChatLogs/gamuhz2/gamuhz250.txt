<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Should have said something earlier. I keep a lot of stuff hidden in my scrolls. - Sun Nov 22 06:16:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods.

He peers back downwards, and takes a hand to press against Mirai's tits. "So. . What got you going so swiftly?"* - Sun Nov 22 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: We just have to live a little. - Sun Nov 22 06:19:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: So might as well live everyday to the fullest yeah? - Sun Nov 22 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sanoke. . .  - Sun Nov 22 06:20:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) give two simple, absentminded blinks.

After another poke, he looked up. "Huh. . .? Oh, Jiki isn't dead. I can tell! And what's there to be shocked of?"* - Sun Nov 22 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Because you know how you are! - Sun Nov 22 06:26:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: You didn't even want to look at me before. - Sun Nov 22 06:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shakes head.

"I don't know what you're talking about. . " * - Sun Nov 22 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You don't come to hot springs often, do you? - Sun Nov 22 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Not really. - Sun Nov 22 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Why did you ask? - Sun Nov 22 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I dunno. I just rarely see you stop to have some 'me time.' - Sun Nov 22 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Should I have more me time? - Sun Nov 22 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeah. Well, by 'me time.' I meant, we should do things like this more often. - Sun Nov 22 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: We can spend more time together. - Sun Nov 22 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: If you're not to busy. - Sun Nov 22 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'm hardly busy. - Sun Nov 22 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) yawns.

He moves about in a circular fashion, before stopping infront of Mirai. His gaze shifts from her face to her chest -- the process repeating itself back and forth. 

His hand arises at last, making the grabby motion. "Can I?" Sanoke inquires casually. . Almost -too- casual.* - Sun Nov 22 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: S-Sanoke you don't have to ask m-me. - Sun Nov 22 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I actually like when you touch me and when you just take control.  - Sun Nov 22 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) cocks his head back in some surprise.

"What. . Really?" He'd state with slight laughter. Of course, it wasn't at Mirai's expense, he merely found it amusing that she felt this way.

"Knew she was like this. . " 

Without taking any time, both of his hands speed over, and clamp over the Hokuma's breasts. He isn't gentle in the least, giving tight, iron-like grip. "Squishy. . . But firm," Sanoke murmured to himself with mystification. This was a rare opportunity for him, clearly enough. 

Relentlessly, he contorts Mirai's bosom in an assortment of directions, even pushing them up against one another for his own visual enjoyment. At last, his grip is relinquished, prompting Sanoke to simple press against the most sensitive portion -- the nipples. Meanwhile, clear arousal is evident, although it was unlike that she'd even take notice given that they were in a steaming hot spring.* - Sun Nov 22 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: San-Sanoke it feels good. - Sun Nov 22 07:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) could see that he was doing good. Mirai's clear enjoyment was the perfect motivation, prompting the boy to get a little more aggression. The gentle pinches from before gain intensity, his fingers even contorted to twist the woman's teats just a tad. Her commentary, it was like music to Sanoke's ears, which prompted him to give a proud chuckle.

The distance between their body was near non-existent, making it impossible to hide his arousal any longer. From below, Sanoke's erected length could clearly be felt pressing against his swimming trunks, stretching the fabric to its limits. As such, his member likely grinded against Mirai's lower body, perhaps the pelvis or thigh area.

He seemed at a lost of words, debating on how to go on from this. Eventually, the male leaned ahead, planting his lips against Mirai's own. He'd pressed forward, giving a confident, yet passionate kiss, his tongue even slipping in.* - Sun Nov 22 07:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

He was a bit enthusiastic with his kiss. His tongue lashed around violently on the inside, and during the process, Sanoke's hands ventured along Mirai's amazingly matured body.

His mits would venture down her waist and hips, planting itself right along her ass. The squeezes are firm, and tight, and remain consistently all through the essential minute in which he engaged within the kiss. All in all, the smooching was anything but tamed, and sticky saliva could be seen stretching out as Sanoke finally pulls on out.

Using his athletic build, Mirai is guided through the water and pinned against the outer layer of the hot springs. Once in position, his head dipped downward, leaving him in the perfect position to wrap his lips around her bosom. His pants was pulled down all the same, revealing a sizeable member. Seven inches, tan-skinned, and veiny. It throbbed in unison with his heart beat, and was thrusted ahead.

As it were, this was right inbetween Mirai's legs, and while there was no insertion, both of their private areas seemed to be forcibly grinding along one another as he orally served her mammaries.* - Sun Nov 22 07:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

Persistance was key. Sanoke just kept licking and suckling along Mirai's breasts, like he was a baby gaining the needed nutrition from a bottle. He was loud and shameless, each motion sending loud smacks reverbrating along the isolated area.

It was a wonder how the staff hadn't been alerted or alarm. Luck was good.

Towards the end, his tongue lashed back and forth, practically whipping at Mirai's nipples, sending her bosom jolting back and forth. As it were, it seemed that Sanoke had a short attention span, as after just two minute tops, he was moving onto the next.

Sanoke rests one hand onto the woman's hips, she's held into place -- and if there were still any panties worn those were taken right off. With the free mitt, a hand rests against the base of his erect length, and positions into the right area. With a gentle thrusts, the summoner is pushing right into Mirai's snatch. "Uh. . .Tell me if it hurts?" There goes that stereotypical awkwardness. You can tell he's newto this.* - Sun Nov 22 07:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) grunted!

It hurted to say the least, to have Mirai's nails literally digging into his back. But at the same time, his body had been overcome with pleasure as his penis slipped on in. The feeling was surreal, hot, moist, and tight -- constricting about every inch of flesh that piled inward into the Hokuma's body.

With consistent movement, his hips slowly yet sternly allowed the rest of his length to push on in, about six inches in total. 

Once the first rep had been done, Sanoke no longer held any nervous jitters. Overcome by his lust, the boy wreckless winds back up, before being rocketed forward again and again. The momentum carried over, forcing not only ripples to form along the water, but also forcing Mirai's curved and voluptous form to sway against the edge of the pool.

While pre-occupied, it goes without saying that Sanoke took great pleasure in observing the woman's near flawless form as it shook about.* - Sun Nov 22 08:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) was inexperienced as they come!

He continued to pump his hips back and forth, each time sending his body further into bliss. Before he knew it, Sanoke's member had began throbbing dramatically, signifying an end was near.

His breathing was heavy, showing exhaustion or fatigue, despite his super human stamina! - - And after three more strokes, that's all she wrote. Somewhat prematurely, Sanoke had reached his climax, pouring liters of his spunk into Mirai's womp.* - Sun Nov 22 09:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: ........ - Sun Nov 22 09:10:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Y-Yes. - Sun Nov 22 09:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) scratches his head, clearly spent. 

He looks down as some of the excessive spunk slips on out, falling into the water. "Oi. . .This isn't good. And I'm a bit tapped out. We can go again some more, but I'm a little. . . Uhm, out of juice! We oughta get out of here before people start getting suspicious."* - Sun Nov 22 09:14:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: H-Huh? Uh yeah! I'll work on it. - Sun Nov 22 09:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) jumps out of the water. He flicks in and out of view, soon returning with a scroll. The seal is written and used to take in some of the water. This was mainly the portions that had infected with his spunk.

"Phew. . It was fun, though! -- Wait, what would you do be doing for me next time? Eh. . I'll think on it. I did win the competition."* - Sun Nov 22 09:25:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||

Finally, without further ado, the battle was to begin. Honestly, Sanoke was in an internal debate. Should he use his full power. . . or hold back? After all, Ai was a simple genin, while he -- on the otherhand -- was on a level many would presume to be equal of a Kage.

After some thought, he reaches down and conjures up a bokken. A real tanto would be far too dangerous.

Naturally, as an expert in sealing techniques, all he'd need was a simple gaze to determine the nature off the seals. Quite clearly, they were explosive notes, which was intelligent given Ai's natural affinity to manipulate paper. Nothing was more annoying than fighting explosive tags that could literally being manipulated on a thought. 

"Show me what ya got Ai. I might have to use some range though. . " And sure enough, the teen knows what he's saying. As the paper comes flying forward, his hand claps together quickly, allowing chakra to be pumped from his body and flood the airwaves. Due to his affinity with the Fuuton nature, the boy is capable of inducing a uniformed, yet fairly large gust meant to send the Kami shurikens out of the way.

Assuming success, Sanoke picked right on up, a mere PIVOT being enough to build up the necessary momentum. Clearly, he closes the distance with little difficulty, his body being a streak of black, gray, and white. The aim being to get towards her rear, or near it.


And once within distance, the boy displays the high level of versatility that had been demanded as a Kirigakure shinobi. 

He was apt in swordplay.The wooden weapon is slashed down diagonally two times consecutively, one towards Ai's bum, the other towards her rib.* - Sun Nov 22 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
The initial winds wouldn't have served as a boost, as it moved in the opposing direction. Rather than powering up a projectile, the projectiles simply found themselves being flung away.

Regardless, his Bokken strike is repelled by the Paper Guard that spontaneously develop, making his attack null and void. Meanwhile. . . the Kami Shurikens were still being manipulated?

It meant little to him at the end of the day. The second the paper guard is up, Sanoke again flicks in and out of view, his body moving in a semi-circle as he seamlessly dances through the mirage of attacks. "Can't get too close, else I'll probably be greetedwith explosive tags. . ." the shinobi muttered during the fast-paced evasion.

In less than a second, his body had been displaced, this time again towards the north. Seamlessly, a single seal is formed -- the Bird -- in a triangular or pyramid-esque shape. Wasting no time, the boy quickly exhales, releasing a vast quantity of wind projectiles that race forward to strike Ai's presumably unguarded position. After all, could the Paper Guard shift direction quickly enough?

"She fights like Tetsumi. They don't move a whole lot."* - Sun Nov 22 19:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
Surprising, moreso how swift the Paper Guard could move to protect her from the onslaught.

Regardless, it was more of the same, Sanoke wore no sense of fear, even as the Shurikens were again being winded up and sent forward. "You're strong, Ai. But you're a one trick pony, this won't work on me," the teen boasted while going through a fast string of seals. On the fifth, chakra again exits his forearm, sending a massive gale of wind forward.

The general range was massive, making evasion nearly impossible given how swift the current swept the area. Naturally, Sanoke could have evaded if he wanted, but figured it'd be best to just send the paper packing.

"Wind Release: Great Breakthrough!" Indeed, a near invisible, yet powerful wind current moved on over, repelling all of those projectiles and hopefully sending Ai's body skidding back in recoil. If she lacked the balance, she even ran the risk of being slammed onto the floor and sliding away. The entire landscape felt the magnitude of the ninjutsu, as the sand tumbled about one another, some even cascacded onto the wind! 

It was like a Sand Storm was brewing.* - Sun Nov 22 20:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) thinks: Wow... - Sun Nov 22 20:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods along.

Not bad. Regardless, this worked within Sanoke's favor, as he remained certain that with all of the paper being stacked to defend against the Great Breakthough, she'd be more susceptible to being struck down.

The Shurikens were still coming, but in the end, they paled in comparison to the sheer physical might that Sanoke possessed. Once more, as if he was using Shunshin, his body blurred in ando ut of view, zig-zagging along the pavement. His frame curves around, and during the speed process, a singular seal is formulated.

-- The Shadow Clone. 

In positioning again, Sanoke sends a sweeping kick to the woman's ankles hoping to trip her up. Hit or miss, the clone gets into the fray to aid.

Just as the real thing had done, a scroll is taken out to conjure up a roll of cloth. With zero handseals, the cloth shoots forward, aiming to wrap around constrict movement to end this battle. "She isn't half bad."
* - Sun Nov 22 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shook his head.

Using too much power was excessive. Seconds later, just as the Paper Wall is receding, his hand forms into yet another seal. From the ground, condensed sand clumps together, forming a moderately sized dome around Ai's figure -- had she proven not capable of evading or getting out of range. There is a narrow opening, about the size of a person's head, to provide oxygen and to leave the girl susceptible to other strikes.

He had hope this wasn't the case, as the woman didn't seem too dependent on athleticism.

On the flipside, the clone narrow escapes being bond before hand, and positions itself right infront of the hole in the corridor. "Not half bad. Although, I read your moves like a book."* - Sun Nov 22 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) exhales.

He scratches his head, mildly irritated by the bought. Mostly because of the Shurikens that were homing and so hard to deal with. "I'll make a jutsu for that. Good fight, though. Let's head back into town," Sanoke replies while dispersing the clone.

Some hair wraps around Ai's form, and with the girl in tow, he flicks back into the village. * - Sun Nov 22 21:30:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Umm, sure. - Mon Nov 23 00:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: M'kay. Let's rock, since you claim to be so strong, I'll use ninjutsu on ya. - Mon Nov 23 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) jogs in place. His suit is thrown to the side, revealing his turtle shell -- an item that hadn't been worn in quite a bit. "To make things a bit harder on myself, I'll be wearing this," the male says with a glee. A hand patted along the boney shell of the reptilian that served as restricting weights. . . It felt good to be wearing one of these again at long last.

At Sanoke'sside proved to be numerous scrolls, while on his back was a sheathed Tanto. Finally, at the thigh was a Kunai holster -- this man was strapped, sure enough.

"I'mma let you make the first move. M'kay?"* - Mon Nov 23 00:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods.

"Alright! Ninja lesson 101. . . Taijutsu! Or well, kenjutsu too!" He declared with some vigor. He had seen Kinami fight around the training yard -- and boy, the seemingly average teenaged girl had admittedly impressed. Regardless, Sano had no intent on even letting this be closed.

His upper body leaned forward, granting him the ability to build up momentum on the fly. Remarkably, even as he's being weighed down by that dense ass turtle shell, his movements are still significantly hard to track, super human even. It gave the impression. . 'Did this Shell even wweigh a thing?'

Naturally, he's beelining to Kinami's front, and once within striking distance employs use of a bokken. Blurring hands parade through the skies, as the wooden blade seens to strike the girl right on the shoulder blade -- then again, on the trapezius! (Which was the area connecting the neck and shoulder."

"Show me what ya got!"* - Mon Nov 23 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Boom! Pow!

Each hit sends a loud, thunderous boom that litter the training arena. "Wow. . Can't avoid that?" Sanoke declared with a slick grin. He took great pleasure in not only taunting, but toying with Kimani -- who may have deemed herself his rival.

The punch comes in, and just from the form, it's clear that the woman is quite experienced when it came to hand-to-hand combat. As such, the male has to get the fuck out of dodge! With a quick juke, his body ducks on out of the way, allowing the haymaker to completely miss its mark. As usual, Sanoke employs the use of his only 'defined' taijutsu technique, which is a spinnning kick. 

Thankfully, it works in tandem with the evasion, forming a singular, efficient act. Seamless, the kick roars through the air and aims to slam against Kinami's ankles, hopefully tripping her up! 

Hit or miss, the boy is back on the move, forming the single seal, and building up a mass of material within his mouth. In no time, as Sanoke's cheeks puff up, he exhales, sending a stream of muddy earth residue to smash against the teen;'s chest and send her skidding back in recoil. Naturally, as this was just a D-ranked technique, it held very little offensive potential. (meaning dont RP getting broken bones or w/e.)* - Mon Nov 23 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikuryunaki Hanesegawa(Uberseether) says: Should I go first? - Mon Nov 23 01:24:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: Thats different - Mon Nov 23 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) snickered like a child.

"Wow! . . C'mon Kinami, this can't be the best that you can do!" He taunted inbetween laughs as the teen is painted in brown, and hopefully rebuffed just a tad.

Reacting swiftly, the second she pressed forward, Sanoke moved on back, knowing that he couldn't conceiveable keep on evading and sending blows all day. . . Well, in his mind, he could, but the warrior just didn't feel comfortable in being close to such a power house.

As he's moving, both hands come together, forming the Bird hand sign -- a sealing formation common for Fuuton-based attacks. And thus, at close range, he bombards the teen with over a dozen football-esque wind pellets to keep her repelled. "Hahaha! C'mon. . !"* - Mon Nov 23 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I-Im fine... - Mon Nov 23 01:36:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
All was nice and well. . .! 

Even as Kinami danced around the incoming wind pellets, Sanoke never once felt that the fight was out of his control. Simply put, the projectiles were strategically placed, forcing the woman to go AROUND, and thus away from him.

As he's dancing away, the tai spec's punches seem to be just out of reach due to the ever nimble shinobi. 

In response, his hand clapped together, sending quick burst of wind to perhaps throw this woman off balance! If so, it sets up nicely for the next. . !* - Mon Nov 23 02:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Do you guys think it is a good idea to go right back into this? - Mon Nov 23 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
Only -IF- the previous blow had been a success, Sanoke moved to follow up.

He falls back onto his patented hair techniques. With a single seal, chakra floods onto the fur ontop his cranium, strickening and thus making each strand more powerful. The strands speed ahead, intent on wrapping around her arms and legs, binding movement.

If capable, she'd be tossed onto the ground, hopefully shaken up and thus open for attack!

"Not bad. Let's call it quits, though. M'kay?"* - Mon Nov 23 02:05:00 2015
