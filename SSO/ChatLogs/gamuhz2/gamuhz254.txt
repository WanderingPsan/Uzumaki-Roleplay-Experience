<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods. It was tiring to be Kazekage -- everyone needed you. But this was the burden he accepted, at least temporarily. 

"Ah. You should have been here with Hiroshi. Could have been a good help. Regardless, there's still some work that needs to be done. Towards the outside of the western wall, there's more rubble. I have Doton specialists fixing upt he floor, and having blocks of rocks being crafted -- But it's not fast enough. Think you can go down there and hulk smash some of the boulders? Also oversee the area, and make sure none of the construction workers are in any danger."

There could be a load of danger that lurked -- mostly on the chance that some bone-head got stuck under a rock or something. After providing the mission, a glance falls over Hiroshi. "You finished?"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) exhales.'

He rubs his chin, only have partial knowledge of Bijuu and their Jinchuuriki -- nevermind being capable of enabling the hosts to tab into this vast energy source. "When I helped Tetsumi with his demon, there was a lot of meditation and I guided him through it. Y'see, to actually utilize your 'demon's power, you have to be able to tab into your subconscious to either request, or just demand it. Naturally, simply taking chakra at will is pretty hard -- so we'll start you out slow. . ."

A hand is held upward, and flooded with chakra. Sanoke places that mitt against the ground, conjuring up a magnificient piece of rock -- a boulder even. It's erected from the ground, and holds a circumference that easily dwarf even the tallest of men.

"To begin, you'll naturally tap into your 'other' chakra when you're in time of need. This can be in various scenarios -- Such as you being on the verge of death. Or even you suffering great emotional stress or trauma. . . Like say one of your loved ones being in legitimate danger, or you getting -EXTREMELY- angry. . . Lastly, it could also come as your chakra is growing low and you're no longer being able to continue. . ." He says with a cheek grin, and points to the boulder.

"We're going to work on that last one. Maybe once you're tired, the demon will have no choice but to supply you with more energy. If you can force that activation, you can get more familiar with the sensation, and thus gain the needed experience or feeling to try and tap into your subconcious at will -- thus bringing out that chakra. Get it? I know my explanations are kind of weird,"Sanoke continued with that wide grin. 

He pauses, gauging whether or not the young Uchiha understood him. "It makes sense, too. Your chakras are connected. Meaning your spirits are tethered together -- and as you know, your spiritual energy is pretty much the embodiment of your emotions and your spirit. It's that connection that'll allow you to tame your beast. Now get to it, flow your chakra in excessive amounts. I want that force to overwhelm the boulder and reduce it to rubble."

Yes. It was insane, but Sanoke legitimately expected Ai's chakra to be powerful enough that the mere exertion could threaten solid constructs.* - Fri Nov 27 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
"Oh. . You don't want to learn to use it? -And Jiki was a special case. His Demon was literally -always- on his back, trying to make him go crazy. It was so bad that he couldn't even sleep," Sanoke admits.

The summoner descended, folding one leg over the other. A hand motions for Ai to take a seat as well.

"But if you want, I can try to guide you to speak with your beast. It isn't that hard, and follows the same concepts I told you about before." Both hands were pressed against one another, as if he was seeking to break into a prayer.* - Fri Nov 27 23:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods.

"It's simple. . .Meditating is a means to increase your overall level of spiritual energy. It's a process that focuses on the 'self'. . . Well, for most people. For you, your 'self' also has a friend. . . I guess," Sanoke explains somewhat awkwardly, clearly alluding to the demonic creature that lingered within Ai's body.

"Form this seal, just as I've done and begin to knead your chakra."

He did just as instructed too, allowing a tranquil flow of chakra to spawn. The energy is particularly concentrated, enough that there was a vieling of chi pulling just under his body, serving like a platform. Both of Sanoke's eyes remained shut, and gradually he was drifting off into thought. "So to properly do this, block off all worldly distractions. Forget about the desert, the sand. . .Forget about your friends, and your family -- this is all about YOU!"

A weak gale sweeps over the notoriously windy country. Sanoke had remained as quiet as a mouse to allow Ai just a moment to focus on the commands given. Sadly, he'd need to interrupt the silence just briefly.

"And as you do so, you should retain a level of calmness-- complete calmness even. If your mind is cleared, you have a lower chance of being distracted. Think of peaceful oceans, and other tranquil or civil acts and look deep with inside your self. View your spiritual flow, the vast highways of energy that runs along your body, before following that path to your mind. Enter your subconscious, and seek out that secondary source of chakra that remains hidden within. . "

No other words were going to be given. Perhaps Ai held enough mental fortitude and tenacity to meet her bijuu from just meditation alone. If not? Then Sanoke was willing to take drastic measures.

"Nope. This is part of her ninja training. It doesn't matter how gifted you are in ninjutsu or combat in general, if your mind is weak. The way of the Kame is to be unrelenting and un-moving, in the spirit, body, and even mind. Now. . SHH," he motions for the red-haired woman to shut her trap.

A brief comment is given to Ai. "Don't let our talking distract you. Focus on the self."* - Sat Nov 28 00:17:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) was awkward with his wording from this point on.

-Obviously-. . . He wasn't much of a public speaker.

In his call, thousands had marched towards the squared area, standing tall an d proud -- side by side. These were the individuals that kept Sunagakure up and running, the same shinobi that would risk their lives ten times over for the sake of the village. For a moment, Sanoke marveled, gaining a cheekish grin at the sight. 

"I hope you've all been having a comfortable time in the last two weeks or so. Sunagakure has been recovering nicely. . .I think I read in a book somewhere. 'The will of Sunagakure is as plentiful as the grains that embody the desert!' . . .A little cheesy, but that quote fits. You all haven't given up, even in the turmoil, which is great."

He motioned for them all to give themselves a pat on the back.

"And even with the recently deceased, their spirit lives on within those that survived! From them, a new generation will arise. Which will bring me to my first point. . . " A scroll is shuffled out of the Kage suit . .! Speedily, the 'Kazekage's hand whips through the air, pointing right towards Trilliam. A huge factor in securing Sunagakure's victory.

"I'd like to first honor an explosive shinobi. . . The grand son of the previous Kazekage, Trilliam Hassan...!" 

The crowd audibly gasps, shocked that such a young shinobi had been given so much attention. All eyes were on Trilliam, front and center as the boy was beckoned forward. "-- Not to downplay the efforts of our other young shinobi. But he was particularly outstanding."* - Sat Nov 28 02:02:01 2015

There ain't no council.

Only Sanoke. . . * - Sat Nov 28 02:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) wore a chuckle at Trilliam as the young shinobi rose.

A hand rested onto the elementalist's shoulder, prompting him to turn about face and eye the crowd. 

"For displaying such a high level of excellency. . .  Trilliam will be bestowed with the official rank of 'Special Jounin!' This is no small feat, especially given his young age. As a special jounin, is responsibility to the village will increase vastly! And I expect that he'll get the respect he deserves."

With that, chakra is activated, releasing the seal. In Sanoke's mitts were now two seats of clothing. A standard Flak Jacket, along with a modified Jounin suit. It particularly stood out from the usual, so that no one would confuse Trilliam for a full-fledged Jounin.

It's held to Trill for the taken. Once done, the Kazekage's eyes fall back to the crowd. "That said. We'll move on momentarily to the grave yard. I've had men set up the bodies to be buried. Each being set in alphabetical order based on surnames. You all will easily be able to find whoever you want to pay respect too."* - Sat Nov 28 02:19:05 2015

With that, Sanoke nodded, prompting the horde of shinobi to follow him to the north. They were to march in a uniform fashion, each going beyond the mansion and heading right towards the grave yard.

The land was massive, and numerous Gravestones could be observed as far as the eye could see. However, even then, they hadn't yet occupied the entire region. Moving further along, the Kazekage and  gang eventually reach the designated area. 

There were already shinobi there, organizing the caskets -- most of which were open for the world to view. A lot were nameless NPCs. But front and center, coincidentally, the shinobi most relevant to cause had been placed. 

Ryomen, Aza, and of course Marrisa (although this was closed casket for obvious reasons). Strangely enough, they were positioned next to other prominent members of Sunagakure. Those that had been deceased months prior, and likely held a special place in the heart of the men gathered in the graveyard.

On ce again, with some awkwardness, Sanoke spoke. "Once more -- You all shouldn't see this as a sad situation. All of these people here, they all died for a good cause. They all placed their lives on the line for the sake of this village, all those that live within it. So. . . I ask that you not mourn or curse their death. But accept and embrace it. When you think of their demise, you shouldn't feet anguish or sadness -- But motivation. Their selflessness is the perfect example of what a shinobi should be!"

Short and sweet. He pauses, and begins to point towards individuals in the crowd. "If any of you have any last words you wish to say, step forward. Any momentos -- ANYTHING. Do so now."* - Sat Nov 28 02:45:32 2015

"Can you describe his appearance? We're not exactly keen on letting randoms run on about especially as our village is recovering. Do you have a permit or traveling papers at the very least?"

And so it seemed that not too many had any to say.

A few of the nameless shinobi took steps forward, most remaining as composed as you'd expect from hardened war vets. The Kazekage took front and center, and with a simple hand gestures, all of the coffins are sealed and buried into the ground. Dirt piles over the coffins, sealing them completely underneath the ground.

"May they all rest in peace! Thank you all for coming. For that wish to begin registering for the chunnin exams, make a line alone the mansion. Come with I.Ds if possible, and give your names to my receptionists. Once you're jotted down, you're free to leave. We'll handle everything from there."

<br><br><font color=teal>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) says: Hi. - Sat Nov 28 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Bye. - Sat Nov 28 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) says: ---Wait. - Sat Nov 28 04:22:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) spoke while again going to demonstrate the Five Seal Barrier.

Again, he goes to summon the table along the floor, stocking it with supplies. Most notably? The tags, each the size of a traditional explosive note. 

"Alright. This is a barrier technique or formation meant to utilize the basics of the Lotus Sealing technique. Overall, you're going to be making five different seals. Four will be correspondant to the fifth. What the fifth does is actually activate an invisible barrier of chakra, meant to protect whatever the tag is stuck onto.  "

"In addition, each seal must be fitted to work in unison with the others. The barrier is meant to be connected to the other four seals. Given the low level, it can be eliminated by just removing the tags -- but each must be removed in unison. The more skilled you are, the longer the distance can be. "

That settled, Sanoke proceeded to actually work on inscribing the seal. Chakra flooded along his fingertips, working like a blow torch. It goes, screeching a symbol along the surface of the paper. Each time, the instructor moved in a slow, deliberate manner to showcase the method in which the seals had to be formulated. He give little tidbits every now and then, allowing proper tips to be detailed of how to code or imbue the instructions.

Notably, the boy is a tad bit more chipper than normal. "So. . Mirai. Want to get a bite to eat? -- Here even. I've been working on my cooking skills." They still sucked, though.* - Sat Nov 28 04:35:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) had been keeping a close eye onto Ai's progress, give tips when the occasion arose.

After several failures, she finally gets the technique done well enough!

"Cool! Side note, out of curiosity. What did Fuji leave ya in the scroll? That giant ass Golem technique?" He asks. Assuming an answer had been given, he waves Ai off.* - Sat Nov 28 05:12:19 2015
