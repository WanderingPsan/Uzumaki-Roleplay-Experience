<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Eh. He'll be alright, - Sun Sep 27 19:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Uh...okay then - Sun Sep 27 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: See, you look much more decent now. - Sun Sep 27 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm. - Sun Sep 27 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Right. - Sun Sep 27 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Now, Let's get started. - Sun Sep 27 19:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gives a nod.

"We're going to do a different mission for now. The fighting mission will have to wait until we're all ready. . " With that, Sanoke kicks off the ground, blurring towards the south in hopes of leading Lera to the proper destination. The scroll is in hand, and is utilized as a map of sorts.* - Sun Sep 27 19:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: So...whats the mission? - Sun Sep 27 19:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
"Huh? It's. . 'B-ranked'. . . We're going to teach a class. Probably a class filled with rich students that want personal teachings from badass shinobi," Sanoke replies along the way. They would slow down once in the rich area of Kirigakure. 

A few paces later, and they're right infront of the special 'Academy.' "Anywho. What three topics you want to go over? I'm thinking Fuuinjutsu is a cool one, I love to discuss. I'll probably trying to go over Summoning Ninjutsu too," the hermit says again, while turning to face the black-haired elementalist.* - Sun Sep 27 19:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ............................ - Sun Sep 27 19:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: For real? - Sun Sep 27 19:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We're teaching a class? - Sun Sep 27 19:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeeppp. - Sun Sep 27 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ..... - Sun Sep 27 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ...ninjutsu i guess. - Sun Sep 27 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh. - Sun Sep 27 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Genjutsu as well. - Sun Sep 27 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) followed closely behind Lera of course. He wasn't much of a teacher, and fully intended on having his fellow shinobi (or well, former fellow) do the bulk of the work. 

Nonchalantly, Sanoke gazes over the massive classroom-- and clearly is unphased. He was as cool as ever, and would never dare to crack under pressure. "S'up future knuckleheads. . . " the teenager muttered as the initial teacher had given an introduction.  As Lera took to the center stage? He followed suit, falling right at her side. 

--- Then the summoning was pulled out.

A plume of smoke was momentarily over the area, building up anticipation to see just what Lera had managed to conjure. You can imagine his surprise once it was apparent the versatile young kunoichi had managed to pull out a freakin' Wolf. "Woah! I didn't know you knew summoning jutsu too!" bellowed the snow-haired warrior shortly afterwards. He's grinning from ear to ear, yet that simper is swift to fade, mainly at the awe that the students held. Feeling a bit jealous, and suddenly competitive, the summoning specialist eventually bits his thumb.

"Oh my god, a wolf! Cool!!"

"I wanna pet it!" The kids were really star-struck. . . Yet he would not be out done.

Five short seals later? His hand presses against the air, releasing charcoal-tinted, sealing formula into the area. The fabric of space and time itself is distorted, allowing for a massive wormhole to be developed. Just as Lera had done, smoke clouds the area. . . and yet as, an even more impressive beast remained.

Ganba. The Chunnin's most powerful summoning. He's easily as tall as a human, even while on all fours! 

"Haha! Or. . Or, you can pet my more awesome summoning creature, Ganba--" Sanoke's face is soon overwhelmed with redness as the sound of snores litter the area. ". . .Uh. . . Give me a second to wake him." Cue speedy, anime-esque movements that prompt him to end up ontop of the reptilian, stomping at the shell. But it was to no avail, Ganba would not awaken yet, hell, he didn't even seem phased by the blows.* - Sun Sep 27 19:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) continued with his futile attempts to get his personal summoning to awaken. 

Lera was going to be the one left with really taking care of this entire subject. "G'damnit, Ganba. . . I'mma tell on you, making me look angry infront of all my fangirls," complained the oft childish traveler. The turtle, however, still fails to budge. Instead, Ganba simply grumbles, begging for five additional minutes of sleep. Sadly, the fun times couldn't last forever,  as a voice blares through the room. It's deep, and commands attention, and even forces Sanoke to briefly shake in his boosts.

"H-Huh? Oh shit. . .That dude scared me.  Lera, cov--" Commands were ready to be given, but it seemed that the young kunoichi had other plans. As the wind speeds out, the fuuinjutsu-minded warrior gets in on the action. To assist in the dismantle of the hordes of men, a scroll is whipped out from his waist, allowing chakra to flow from his fingertips and onto the sheet of paper. "Watch and learn, kids!"

"Fuuinjutsu at it's finest! I'm going to unseal these papers to help me attack!" Just as the explanation is given, the scroll is unleashed, allowing a bombardment of bombs to be slung outward, aided by the release of the Fuuton technique. They were simple Explosive Tag Mines, mixed in with poison bombs -- meant to knock people out. The second the wind gale had subsided, the assortment of tools were being igniited and blowing shit up to smitherines. 

Hopefully he hadn't gotten too overzealous. 

Regardless, seconds later came the poisonous smog. Would that handle it? "Gannbbaaa. Wake up."* - Sun Sep 27 20:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
Sanoke takes a step back. 

He looks ahead. "Oi. . .I'mma release a little a bit of range. . " He mutters. Another scroll is whipped out, allowing a slew of relatively harmless weapons to fly -- Shurikens. Yes, they were 'harmless', as non-fatal areas would tend to leave an opponent down, but not dying. As the countless shurikens sped out, many of the men were struck down.

More than likely, LEra is fine, considering the Domu is up. There may be chip-age at the armor, however.

"Geez. You learned a lot of shit, Lera. Might even be able to beat me."* - Sun Sep 27 20:31:21 2015

Blurring, the shinobi comes to a stop, hoping to get in the mid-point between the battling duo, and the Gezo Prince.

"It ain't self defense to screw with someone's body. Root seals aren't cool," Sanoke retorts. He gestures for Kohaku to move Mitsuru a bit away, and Fujitora is noted via peripherals.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) turns around while speaking.

"I ain't even doing this anymore.You're just makin' up bullshit, things that aren't even relevant. I'm getting ticked off-- Noriko wouldn't be happy to see what you're doing to her village."

Not making a single moment, he speeds off, hoping to blur into the distance and get the heck out of this village. It was by now that Sanoke was remembering why he opted to retire -- simply because he and Kirigakure often were at odds.* - Sun Sep 27 22:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: If she's just going to be some coward. - Sun Sep 27 22:41:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
And thus, Sanoke had officially left Kirigakure for good. Or so he thought.

The village had become far too apathetic, perhaps due to Noriko no longer being around to provide a guiding hand. After a day's travel, he's far away from that forsaken kingdom, and sitting along by one of the rivers. His heart panged with guilt, due to knowingly leaving Mitsuru in that pitiful village hidden in the mist. 

As usual, to keep him company, the Turtle Summoner eventually releases enough chakra and power to induce a space-time manipulation, or summoning technique. Smoke pops into the area, before clearing and revealing a relatively familiar summoning. ". . .Mr. Sanoke? How can I help you?" The reptilian proved to be Mr. Genbi -- Sanoke's turtle instructor. Immediately, the elderly turtle presumed his summoning to be over desire for knowledge -- or additional training in the way of the turtle.

Of course, these thoughts are absolutely dismissed, as Sanoke had yet to even master the summoning of Ganba. After some long winded discussion, he begins to relax, next to his turtle companion.

". . . Bah. Guess it can't be helped. I suppose it was a smart idea that I retired early," Sanoke muttered out loud with aggitation. His heart was in turmoil, simply because. . . Well, with his family being so busy with their archeology, and general adventuring, Kirigakure and its military was like a secondary family. Of course, excluding those that just ignored his presence. 

The kage in particular, Noriko, had often taken time out of her busy schedule in order to entertain his foolishness. Even taught him how to be a decent shinobi. And to think, he was leaving that all behind forever -- if not just a long ass time. Not to mention a large reason of his 'defection' was due to the sudden change of his childhood friend, Koeki. The emotions roaming through his heart sweat, as he pitied how cruel life could be sometimes.

Tears build up. . .But they don't fall.

Instead, they serve as a catalyst for a genetic change. Chakra is churning, building up at optics. . .before at last, a single ring spawned. It was purple, and the overtones of the schlera also began to darken. "---Sano. . ? Sano. . ?" Genbi called out, startled at the changed. 

As one of the older gentlemen in Kame Cove, he had legends involving the Sage of Six Paths, along with the almighty Rinnegan the male had utilized. ". . .Is this. . No, he can't be. . " Genbi murmured, already making ridiculous assumptions. The turtle's heart was racing, overwhelmed with excitement and newfound hope in Sanoke -- not that there wasn't interest in the boy before. "I can't let him know the seriousness of this doujutsu. . . But i'll at least let him know he has it. ." After a pause, the green'd creature begins to speak up.

"You have a strange eye--"

"Yeah. . .I can feel it. Chakra had built up there for some reason. Maybe due to my emotional stress," the snow-haired teen says, cutting of Genbi's commentary. Indeed,  he was quite knowledge of all things related to chakra. Thus, it was no secret, due to chi being partly made up of your mind's consciousness -- spiritual energy -- that emotional stress could trigger additional power.

"It's weird though. . It's like. . It's like i'm getting stronger. I dunno what his means, Genbi. Should I. . . be afraid?" Power often made good men cruel. It was this thought that roamed through Sanoke's mind. With all the angst he felt towards Kirigakure;s steady decline, this could be the turning point in Sanoke's view.

Then. . .

THWAP! A rock smashes hard against his head, leaving a lump. "Shut up! You're talkin' like you're gonna be some crazy maniac, lynchin' fools fer looking are you funny. Don't worry about those eyes -- Hell, you're not even ready to use it. For now, focus on your trraining. You still haven't even mastered summoning Ganba, far too much energy is utilized. Plus, you're -still- weak against genjutsu!"

"OOOWWW! I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry! Geez. .. " He complains, completing breaking the seriousness of the situation, just as the wise turtle had intended. After nursing the lump on his forehead, Sanoke finally begins training, opting to take advantage of his Kage Bunshin ninjutsu and practice his Genjutsu: Kai. Considering the latter used a barely noticeable amount of chakra, using something like Kage Bunshin to speed up the rate in which he gained experience was a feasible desire.

With a single seal, his chakra fluxuates, splitting off into four different pieces. As it combusts, smokes clouds, allowing a spontaneous creation of the four different clones. Each one just as dashing and handsome as the real Sanoke. With five intelligent fiends on the prowl, mastering the jutsu was going to be a sinch. 

Quickly, they all settled down onto the floor, holding tightly onto the Ram handseal. Their chakra systems all fluxuate randomly, before the energy flowing in the cranium comes to a screeching hault. As it freezes, he releases a simple jolt, revitalized the surge of energy and effectively leaving him in conditions that would make any genjutsu vanish. It was like cleaning your computer as it was slowed down by viruses or unnecessarily high amounts of files.* - Tue Sep 29 08:43:56 2015

After days of roaming about the desert, seeing what the Land of Wind had to offer. . .Sanoke heads into the main village itself. His body, as per usual, is a simple blur of white and blue, considering the velocity the teen consistently used. Towards the end, he lands in the area, rocks and sand twirling about his frame for just a moment -- perhaps due to usage of shunshin.

Honestly, the sight is one to behold.

Citizens, as far as the eyes could see, working alongside one another to presumably build Sunagakure back into something worth living in. What catches his attention the most, however, is the magnificient building being worked on in the horizon. For some odd reason, Sanoke felt compelled to rush over in order to view the building up close. . . then to subsequently utilize suimen to run along the walls -- don't ask why.

"Geez. This place is really bubbling.  . I remember when I came here last time, tit was a ghost town. Or well, bandit town," he says casually to no one in particular.* - Tue Sep 29 14:04:48 2015
