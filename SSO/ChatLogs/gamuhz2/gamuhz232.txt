After all, Genbi had warned him. With the power that had been bestowed upon Sanoke, letting emotion rule his decisions could eventually lead him down a dark path.* - Fri Oct 30 07:30:59 2015

Two persons of interests that he'd yet seen before were Shinji and Chikyu -- the latter of which actually spoke out. After shaking his head to awaken from the daze, Sanoke's gaze falls onto the youthful swords woman towards the south.

"Hrm? Yourself included. You're up early as hell. . . Guess the early bird gets the worm?" He says somewhat awkwardly to sound clever -- Of course, the former shinobi had been referencing training in that statement.* - Fri Oct 30 11:12:00 2015

It was always pleasant to see young shinobi have such enthusiasm, such fire . . . Instincttively, his right thumb juts on out, giving the girl a proud thumbs-up! "Thats the stuff! You gotta train hard, and be relentless if you want to make it anywhere in life!" His eyes goes up and down, following the blade as it's lifted up ahead, only to to slammed downward -- yet still missing the ground. 

Casually, Sanoke would arise, and do the usual stretching exercises to loosen up his muscles. 

"Yo. What's your name again? I can't tell if you told me or not," The would-be hermit declared with a somewhat energetic tone.* - Fri Oct 30 11:22:14 2015

"Huh. . .? I wonder why. . . Y'don't seem too tough. You're pretty skinny," Sanoke remarked in a blunt yet innocent fashion. -- Then the weapon slams against the ground. While Chikyu wasn't exactly a power house, the sand was easily parted, leaving a small depression along the sandy floors of the village.

"--Or not. You seem pretty handy. I guess ya showed up all the kids?" He continues with a sly grin, his arms folded. Clearly, the snow-haired warrior didn't think too much of the woman's ability as of yet -- after all, save for the slam on the floor, she hadn't really showed her ability.* - Fri Oct 30 11:35:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) briefly flicked his eyes over onto the action.

The usage of Shunshin -- It was a fancy sight to behold. His refined eyes could visibly see the rapid build up of chakra, that routinely converged within the muscles to give accelerated movements. But yet. . . Sanoke seemed stoic, almost unimpressed, despite the goofy smile that he wore plastered on his face.

"Hrm? He is. Say, if you want. I can give you a little spar later, I guess. You seem like a interesting fighter," Sano retorts, again giving a gander to that amazing blade the swordswoman sported.* - Fri Oct 30 11:49:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He sat back down, idly observing the fight as Marrissa displayed her nifty abilities. The Fire Shroud technique, however, did not quite hold a lasting appeal on Sanoke -- as it i had done to Chikyu. Far too often,that same ability has been on display. As such, while it was still a marvelous, dazzling manuever, Sanoke had grown numb to it's application. 

". . .Welcome to the world of shinobi," the teen replies quaintly.

His arms were folded, and with a curious stare, the boy's eyes settledb ack onto the lengthy 'bout. His curiosity was placecd moreso in Angetsu, who seemed to be a mysterious character. . . One with unknown ability and talents. But unfortunately, it seemed he'd succumb to defeat by the hands of a simple Kage Bunshin from the looks of things.

". . .C'mon, guy! You asked for this spar, get more wreckless or creative! You can at least defeat a clone!" urged the summoner in hopes of pushing Angetsu to try with a bit more inspiration.* - Fri Oct 30 12:04:54 2015
