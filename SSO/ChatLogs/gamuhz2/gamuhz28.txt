<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Right then. - Thu Oct  1 07:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||No time at all is wasted to go on  the defensive. Observantly, Sanoke examined each facet of Fujitora's body. Thus,the second the Kenjutsu user even fidgeted, a hand moved down. As the Exploding Flame Shot came, the turtle warrior broke into a sprint, although his speed was inhibited by the weight of his training tool -- the massive, brown turtle shell that you saw currently hugging his back. With the weight attached to the construction, every  step was a struggle, thus simply standing remained as training for the would-be turtle hermit.

Considering his rate of velocity, along with the quickness the boy reacted, the attack misses it mark. But the evasion makes one thing clear -- Fujitora certainly had an avenue to strike. Upon getting close, the teen summoner's hand had dipped into a Kunai holster. Just as the flames came in, Sanoke's kunai flicks through the skies, forcing the two metal weapons to clash, releasing sparks. Sadly, one hand chakra flow backing it, and the other didn't. The edges of his Kunai knife was melting just a tad. 

Quickly, while parrying the blow, Sanoke ducks, releasing a sweeping kick towards Fujitora's knees in effort to knock him over. "Geez. . .! So you can do more than jutsu Fuuinjutsu. That's neat."* - Thu Oct  1 07:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||The kick, unfortunately, is unable to go on fully. Fujitora was pretty swift in his own right, thus forcing Sanoke to switch things up. Mid-stride, the sword change in direction is noted, mainly due to his above average vision. "Hng! I thought the parry would be enough, but I didn't knock it back with enough strength either. . .!" the teen muttered to himself, teeth gritting against one another. On instict almost, the partially melted Kunai is swiiped ahead again, just barely keeping the blade from striking against his frame.

Assuming success? Sanoke's legs kick fronm the ground, in aim to propel himself backwards. It moves at roughly half his true velocity, but even that was a formidable rate of speed in itself. (About 4 tiles)

If even a smidget of breathing room had been obtained, he takes a scroll, and with a single hand flaps it open. Chakra surging, one of the glyphs is unleashed, releasing a fairly large amount of weaponry about -- roughly three dozen different projectiles in total. 'Course, considering this was a spar, there was no lethal intent. Thus, all the weapons were wooden, their edges dulled, and light variants of simple explosive tags being glued onto 'em.  "Gotta keep this guy off my case. . . He got the upperhand in close-ranged combat. I can't even be on the offensive in there. . ."* - Thu Oct  1 08:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) || All of the shurikens had missed their marks! But. . . that's precisely what had been intended. In no time, all three dozens of objects clattered onto the ground, just as Fujitora is closing ground to engage in close-ranged combat -- which seemed to be an area in which he excelled. 

Quickly, working against the tactic, Sanoke speeds ahead, his eye just barely being able to pick up on the impressive usage of Shadow Shuriken. Mid-stride, one more Kunai (this one with a seal drawn onto it) is drawn, while the melted one from before is tossed down at the boy's ankles -- hopefully distracting him from the endeavor as Sanoke sought more ground. Assuming all had gone to plan, a single seal is sequently formed. 

. . .Unsuspectingly, this activated two sequences. First? The explosive tags are ignited. Next? The weapons seemingly gain a mind of their own, as Sanoke activates the almighty 'Homing Seal'. This prompts the seal in place to seek out the beacon, which ironically enough was situatiated on the Fuuinjutsu Specialist's person. Sadly for Fujitora,  he was right in path, forcing all the weapons to strike against him -- assuming he didn't detect them coming from behind and avoid.* - Thu Oct  1 08:36:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) quickly leaps towards the right-- allowing the weapons to stray right pass him. Perhaps, based on Fujitora moved, they'd still be on track with him. Before any collision, however, the explosive tags unleash their full might.

Simultaneous with the explosion, Sanoke weaves through two seals. From his sleeves, a set of wires come speeding out, each strand controlled entirely by his will. They curve, hopefully wrapping around Fujitora's arms and his legs-- keeping the nifty Uchiha bond for the explosions meant to come and weaken him. "I think I gotcha!"* - Thu Oct  1 09:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
"Ooooooh! You're bringing out the big guns! Hrm . !" He declares excitedly as the Flaming Shroud moved to scorch the bindings. Slowly, they were being burned away, but not before Sanoke had simply released them. Considering the technique Fujitora had opted to utilized, it was becoming clear -- Sanoke couldn't win until he too went to use his greatest techniques. Sadly, he wasn't quite willing to go towards them in a simple spar.

"Haha! This is going on a bit too far, though. We'll call it even here, okay?" The turtle summoner replied with the usual, friendly smile.* - Thu Oct  1 09:24:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
The day was young. Upon waking up, Sanoke washes his face after performing his daily, morning rituals. These 'rituals' were pretty normal tasks. Y'know, showering, grooming himself, and doing the typical speed and/or conditioning training. For those that slept comfortably in his neighborhood, they;d soon find a disturbance as the shinobi restlessly ran up and down, tirelessly repeating the repetitive process over and over. Upon doing the hundredth lap, the shinobi hastily dashes downward. Fatigue was evident, but considering Sanoke's strange gene, and penchant for lasting despite the trying physical trials.

Even while weighed down by his shell, the Turtle summoner eventually manages to reach the public hotspot, where shinobi  tended to gather up as they waited for missions. His sprint kicks up a storm of sand, granite-made particles of dust that lingered behind his body, serving as an outline for the path that the speedster traveled admist his travel. It doesn't take long for the boy to reach his destination. There's a brief glance given over the area, and overall, it's what you'd expect.

Shinobi gathered around, training and conversing as they'd await a mission. Yan, Koji, Kirei, Fujitora, Hassan -- not a face went unnoticed. His senses keened in, aiming to pick up on any disturbance. Before long, the warrior sprints ahead, moving in a semi-circle, only to fall next to the seemingly motionless citizen -- Mirai. His head tilts, seemingly filled with inqusitive thoughts. Why did this girl just stare ahead in lifeless fashion?

Casually, Sanoke's hand wavered, moving infront of the woman's optics, to gain attention. "Yo, yo. What's up?" the laid back warrior inquires, fidgeting his stunter shades with a smug smile. Those glasses really made him feel like the shit, clearly enough. * - Fri Oct  2 03:54:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blinks. "What. . ? What does money have to do with this?" He says in a mystified manner. After a pause, another thought creeps into the simpleton's head. "Oh. Are you just standing there 'cause you're broke?"* - Fri Oct  2 03:55:05 2015

"I've been a shinobi for like. . . six years? Ever since I was twelve. Believe me, I'm okay in the money department," he continues to brag, clearly confident in both his economic status, and general awesomeness. Before long, the all-too-casual teenager throws an arm forward, aiming to wrap it around Mirai's shoulder. "You gotta ease up, though. Why so tense?"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shrugs. This was training for him -- and he always trained. As evident by the turtle shell on his back. Quickly, the shinobi's hand speeds ahead, grabbing ahold of Mirai's legs and her waist, sweeping her up in a bridal fashion. "This is just like trainin'. My master used to make me do this with boulders back ont the island," the chunnin comments.* - Fri Oct  2 04:28:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I guess that's smart. - Fri Oct  2 04:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: We could have a whole fight and you wouldn't see all of my abilities. - Fri Oct  2 04:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Don't care. - Fri Oct  2 04:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: So get it out now... - Fri Oct  2 04:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: This is like right by the road. Don't wanna go further down? - Fri Oct  2 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: This is good I need to See Lord Hassan. - Fri Oct  2 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: What am I seeing? - Fri Oct  2 04:31:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gives a blank stare. His eyes shift from side to side. .. 

Was this really happening? With some hesistance, Sanoke takes a step away. Just to keep the peace. "Gah. . .What's with me and running into controlling women," he thought to himself, a hand running through his head of hair. Memories briefly flash back, picturing his mother -- a woman he referred to simply as 'Demon'. Just because of how domineering she was in his disciplining.* - Fri Oct  2 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Ergh. . .Still not even half as bad as mom.. - Fri Oct  2 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: . . .Although. . I hope this doesn't trickle down. Kirie is kinda crazy too. - Fri Oct  2 04:34:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: So what's up? - Fri Oct  2 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Why do you gear those stupid glases? - Fri Oct  2 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Glasses* - Fri Oct  2 04:53:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: They have white eyes. - Fri Oct  2 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: I thought those people were extinct. - Fri Oct  2 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: How is it going? - Fri Oct  2 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Huh? - Fri Oct  2 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Kirigakure wasn;t even close. - Fri Oct  2 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: The spar. - Fri Oct  2 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: To being able to wipe them all out. - Fri Oct  2 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I dunno. I think Koji might be going a little rough, let's see howshe handles it. - Fri Oct  2 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Take Kirie on. - Fri Oct  2 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: She does not want to reveal abilities she might use against me in the future. - Fri Oct  2 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Which makes sense...I guess. - Fri Oct  2 05:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: There's no trustworthiness in it, but it's reality. - Fri Oct  2 05:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Sanoke, we do need to talk about what you can offer in the mission. - Fri Oct  2 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Of course in private. - Fri Oct  2 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Koji..I got next! - Fri Oct  2 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh. i mean, it isn't a secret. I'll tell ya now since we're on the same team. - Fri Oct  2 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I use Fuuinjutsu, Non-elemental techniques, and summoning skills. - Fri Oct  2 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: The rest of my skillset is close-ranged, and based on me using my speed and reflexive ability. - Fri Oct  2 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I see. - Fri Oct  2 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I am just an elementalist. - Fri Oct  2 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And I am a summoner.... - Fri Oct  2 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: Just in case, I won't say my best asset around Kirie. - Fri Oct  2 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: I already called dibs. - Fri Oct  2 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh wow! What can you summon? I can summon turtles. - Fri Oct  2 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Get in line - Fri Oct  2 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: So you wanna spar them and not me, Al-Saachez? - Fri Oct  2 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Yeah just about. - Fri Oct  2 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Interesting.... - Fri Oct  2 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Fair enough. - Fri Oct  2 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: She's probably scared. - Fri Oct  2 05:30:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: smirk* - Fri Oct  2 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looked ahead to the battle, which had easily been in Koji's favor. Careful, Sanoke is sure not to laugh -- considering he knew what type of girl Mirai was, and if she was like any of the others encountered, laughing would spell doom. His eyes brriefly shut, anticipating some backlash or anger due to the crushing defeat. Yet imagine his surprise when it's simply the Hyuuga intertwining her fingers within his own, holding him still.

"Oh. . Phew. Thought you were angry for a second," Sanoke remarks.

"You did got handled pretty easily. I expected you to be stronger, tch."* - Fri Oct  2 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I don't fight much. - Fri Oct  2 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Which is why I have you pet. You will do all my fighting for me. - Fri Oct  2 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Ha. - Fri Oct  2 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) fidgets his glasses with his free hand.

"Tch. . . Tell me. You really think my glasses are cheap, though?" the previous comments from Mirai didn't even seem to be registered.* - Fri Oct  2 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Those aren't name brand. - Fri Oct  2 05:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: They are cheap. - Fri Oct  2 05:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) scoffs. He's still clearly on his high horse.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: For training. - Fri Oct  2 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's weight, so no matter what I do, my body is getting stronger. - Fri Oct  2 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I use it to develop my strength, stamina, and speed. - Fri Oct  2 06:26:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: Will you take that off when we play? - Fri Oct  2 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Uh, sure? I'll leave you in the dust, though. - Fri Oct  2 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Guess I can't go too fast. - Fri Oct  2 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: Are you really that fast? - Fri Oct  2 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Eh, somewhat. I won't test my speed until like another week. By then, I'd have worn this shell successfully for a month straight. - Fri Oct  2 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: Shall we go play then? - Fri Oct  2 06:36:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) moves to whisk Mirai off her feet. "Guess so. Kirie, we oughta battle later. And I might have a technique to show ya," he replies. With a single seal being formed, Sanoke's body speeds off into the horizon.* - Fri Oct  2 06:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: We'll work on your moves after I recover from battle! - Fri Oct  2 06:42:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Well sort of. - Fri Oct  2 07:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Impatient over the battle I'm guessin'. Yeah, they need to pick up the pace! - Fri Oct  2 07:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: ... - Fri Oct  2 07:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: he didnt make it this far in a short time sitting on his butt - Fri Oct  2 07:48:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods as Kirie had finally ended the battle.

"Yeah. I'll teach her wire bind or somethin," Sanoke states. Without another word, he sweeps Mirai up, and shunshins off again. "So, we gonna like race?"* - Fri Oct  2 07:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I don't wanna race. - Fri Oct  2 07:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You said we were going to play. - Fri Oct  2 07:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . .? - Fri Oct  2 07:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Take me to your house. - Fri Oct  2 07:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods. He continues in stride, seemingly unphased by the added weight from lugging Mirai's frame around. After traveling a few blocks, Sanoke reaches his home. It was a relatively small home, and was recently rented out due to the extended stay in Sunagakure. "Ay. Are you like a shinobi or somethin'? Since you're using the special eye technique. That takes some type of chakra control, " the teen questions. He seemed to know a thing or two about doujutsu.* - Fri Oct  2 08:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I am. - Fri Oct  2 08:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Barely though. - Fri Oct  2 08:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Sweet. You oughta join me in some trainin' sometime. I can teach ya a thing or two. - Fri Oct  2 08:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gives a curious gaze. His head gestures towards the flooring. "Put ya down?"* - Fri Oct  2 08:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Teach me things like what? - Fri Oct  2 08:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: You don't look like the type to practice taijutsu. - Fri Oct  2 08:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I know a lotta non-elemental things. Kai, Shunshins, y'know. Shit like that, general use. - Fri Oct  2 08:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: yes put me down. - Fri Oct  2 08:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Wanna see a cool one? - Fri Oct  2 08:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sure. - Fri Oct  2 08:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) had of course set her down.

As the world's biggest show off, Sanoke takes a step back, his hands soon pressing together. Speedily, once the single seal is formulated, chakra surged, inducing the 'Yang' transformations. They seep out of his pures, before eventually latching onto the Wires that were almost always hidden in the boy's sleeves. Gaining life, the thin metal objects are sent stabbing through the skies. Sanoke is more than able to manipulate each strand -- and they move, aiming to wrap along Mirai's leg -- weakly of course, he wasn't looking to harm.

"I need to improve this technique, though. Make a V-2 version," the teen boasts, wearing a smug grin.* - Fri Oct  2 08:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Cool, right? - Fri Oct  2 08:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Not really. - Fri Oct  2 08:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) facepalms, his grin immediately dissipates.

"Not. . . Really?" He says with a whine. "Geez. I guess you just don't know greatness. . ." the wires that had been sent forward relinquish their grip, hiding back under his sleeves. 

"I've won many battles this way."* - Fri Oct  2 08:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Seems very basic. - Fri Oct  2 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I mean. . .It's not a super S-rank technique. But it's pretty neat. - Fri Oct  2 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Imagine the possibilities! No need to be such a downer, you know. - Fri Oct  2 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: If you think so Sanoke. - Fri Oct  2 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I just don't think much of the technique. - Fri Oct  2 08:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm. I'd show you my turtle. But don't think you'd find a talking turtle cool or anything. - Fri Oct  2 08:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: That's pretty cool. - Fri Oct  2 08:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Better then just some wires. - Fri Oct  2 08:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Ooooh! Wanna see? - Fri Oct  2 08:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sure. - Fri Oct  2 08:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
And thus, he gains that grin again.

Sanoke -- being the egomaniac that he was, was eager to show off his ace maneuver. Biting on his thumb, a bit of blood is drawn, which serves as the catalyst for his jutsu. Five seals later, a hand presses out onto the air, forcing a sealing glyph to be spawned. As it spreads, a massive combustion falls on over , sending smoke. And as it clears?

There stood Sanoke's prized  possessiion, Ganba! The giant, human-sized turtle. Laying at six feet, his shell was a dark purple, and flesh remained a light blue. Of course, lazily, the reptilian remained on theground, borderline sleeping. "Oi . . .What I told ya about summonin' me to show off to some stupid human girls. . . " Ganba complains. If he wasn't so damn tired, he'd be giving a mean stare.* - Fri Oct  2 08:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Oh is that why you carry a shell on your back? - Fri Oct  2 08:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yep! I am a student of the turtle. This is my minion, Ganba. His grandpa is my teacher. - Fri Oct  2 08:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||
The giant turtle had seemingly gone into a snooze.

"Righ' . . " From there, he snores, seemingly having no interest in assisting Sanoke's odd endeavors.* - Fri Oct  2 08:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Badass, right? - Fri Oct  2 08:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Indeed. - Fri Oct  2 08:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I am impressed Sanoke. - Fri Oct  2 08:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) flicks on nose.

"Maybe if you show your worth, I'll teach ya about these things. 'Course, you might just try to treat them like pets -- and they wouldn't like that."* - Fri Oct  2 08:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: It's pretty cool but i'm not intersted in having them. - Fri Oct  2 08:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Woooow. Eh. . .I guess it makes sense. Your strength is taijutsu. - Fri Oct  2 08:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: So I guess you oughta focus on your strength. - Fri Oct  2 08:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Yeah and it's sort of your thing - Fri Oct  2 08:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: you should keep it to yourself. - Fri Oct  2 08:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeah. Until I master the ways, then I'm going to try and find a student. - Fri Oct  2 08:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: why? - Fri Oct  2 08:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Because that's the way things are supposed to be. - Fri Oct  2 08:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I won't be around forever, after all. I'd want my legacy to be continued -- if I ever have one. - Fri Oct  2 08:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: You will. - Fri Oct  2 08:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: You seem way to involved in this shinobi stuff. - Fri Oct  2 08:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) blinks.

"But I'm not even a real shinobi. I'm mainly a traveler."* - Fri Oct  2 08:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: So you're not from Suna? - Fri Oct  2 08:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Nah. I'm from the Land of Water. Mainly was around Kiri for the most part. - Fri Oct  2 08:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: ... - Fri Oct  2 08:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: How will you be my pet then? - Fri Oct  2 08:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm? I'm mainly situated in Suna -- Err. And pet is such a demeaning word, y'know? - Fri Oct  2 08:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: It's a term of endearment. - Fri Oct  2 08:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I work for the Kazekage. But I'm not really a shinobi, y'know? - Fri Oct  2 08:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's like. . . I'm just a guy that can stay here. Occasionally I'll help out, but I can pretty much do whatever I want. - Fri Oct  2 08:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Sweet deal, right? - Fri Oct  2 08:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: If I just walk away right now, can't be called a rogue or anything. - Fri Oct  2 08:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sounds cool. - Fri Oct  2 08:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: What do you plan on doing? - Fri Oct  2 08:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) rubs his chin.

"Uh. I dunno, my main plan is just to be a neutral guy that keeps tabs on things going on in the world. I also want to adventure, try to find some lost treasure or some shit," Sanoke explains with a shrug. "I used to be a shinobi, but I decided to quit and be a traveler just incase my village did something I ain't agree with."

After a pause, he peers ahead, growing a bit more intrigued now that Mirai had settled down a bit, at least in comparison to how she acted earlier in the day. "So you, why'd you become a shinobi anyway?"* - Fri Oct  2 08:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: To protect my eyes. - Fri Oct  2 08:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Mmm, makes sense in a way. The stronger you are, the most able you can protect your eyes. - Fri Oct  2 08:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Pretty much. - Fri Oct  2 08:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) rubs the back of his neck awkardly.

"Anywho, yeah. Sorry 'bout a few years earlier. My village was being crazy and eye-thirsty for some reason."* - Fri Oct  2 08:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Who was it that killed most of my clan members? - Fri Oct  2 08:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: <*coughs*> - Fri Oct  2 08:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I'll kill them. - Fri Oct  2 08:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I mean. Not most of your clan was killed. . .Hell, you guys aren' even a clan to be frank, considering how spread out you all are. Buut.. - Fri Oct  2 08:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeah. My village, Kirigakure. They tried to do a doujutsu hunt or bounty. - Fri Oct  2 08:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: They were after your eyes, and another version with red pupils. - Fri Oct  2 08:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sickos. - Fri Oct  2 08:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Right now, there's even another bounty. For guys with like. . . Strange purple eyes. - Fri Oct  2 08:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: With rings around the center. - Fri Oct  2 08:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeaaah. It's pretty weird. But eh, in the shinobi world, special eyes equal power, no? - Fri Oct  2 08:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I suppose so. - Fri Oct  2 08:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Anywho. What we doin' here? Thought were we going to play a game. - Fri Oct  2 08:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Oh? - Fri Oct  2 08:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) thinks: Hrm. - Fri Oct  2 08:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||And so it began. His eyes looked on with anticipation, as his hidden, perverse nature was creeping up. Cheeks were instantly flushed, and his heart rate slowed to a crawl. As Mirai's hands pressed against the sash, her pull appeared to have taken an eternity. Then the robe sleekly falls onto the ground. It was a sight to behold -- No, it was more like a dream.'

Never in Sanoke's wildest dream did he anticipate a woman built like this to ever just toss herself at him. 

But here it was, happening before his very eyes. Of course, the beginning of arousal is clear, as there's a clear lump manifesting near his loins, yet the would-be sage didn't move an inch. Instead, he trembled, knees shaking in fear. His face, by now, had developed to be on levels with a tomato, and on instict, a hand rose to his nose. "N-No. . . All of my peeping. . .All the magazine, I'm still not ready. . ." the teen muttered to himself. And it was true, that's all he could do -- think about doing things, be a perv. . . But really, he was all talk, no action.

His body ached, ached with desire, sadly the boy held coldfeet. In a mechanical fashion, he's turning, looking at Mirai as if she was a fine meal just waiting on the table for his own delight. Yet he could not act. . . Strongly, the boy considered fleeing to save himself the embarrassment.  * - Fri Oct  2 08:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: D-Did I do something wrong? - Fri Oct  2 08:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shook his head. It was clear he wasn't actually replused -- just scared like a child.

"N-No. . .Just. . . --" He turns, kneeling and facing a wall. Heavy breathing. .. Heavy breathing.* - Fri Oct  2 08:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: It's okay Sanoke. - Fri Oct  2 08:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I'll put back on my clothes. - Fri Oct  2 08:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) had by now nose bleed. The sight, it was too glorious for his eyes -- And in truth, he didn't want Mirai to put her clothes on, but lackedthe courage to actually go through with it all. "Ergh. . N-No. . I'll just be a minute."

Assuming compliance, it would  be a few minutes before Sanoke alas stood once more and turned to the bed. Manly, proud steps are taken on over to the mattress-- And then he caught wind of Mirai's amazingly proportionate and curved frame. Blood again rises, inducing another near-nose bleed.

Swiftly, he turns away again, barely avoiding a faint. * - Fri Oct  2 08:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: God damnit, Sanoke. . .  - Fri Oct  2 08:57:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) exhales. He stands up, still not looking towards Mirai.

"Great body, though," he compliments. A hand moved again to fidget on the stunter shades-- even with that scene just pulled, Sanoke still felt like he was a boss ass ninja. "That's sweet. Hopefully I can shake this fear off before then, probably will need some help."* - Fri Oct  2 09:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I'll be seeing someone else by then. - Fri Oct  2 09:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shifts his head down. Right with the low blow. "Eh, I getcha. Anywho, you had any other games. . ?" The teen said all nonchalant, his voice briefly losing that whimisical tone.* - Fri Oct  2 09:09:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Yep. - Fri Oct  2 09:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) exhales. That was a close one.

"Yeah, sorry if I disappointed ya. Can't really help it."* - Fri Oct  2 09:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You oughta still train with me, though. - Fri Oct  2 09:10:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Seems legit. He can probably show ya the other basic skills too. - Fri Oct  2 09:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I'm sure he will. - Fri Oct  2 09:13:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Man. I gave you the option for a reason. - Fri Oct  2 09:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I'm down for either. - Fri Oct  2 09:16:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) breaks into a strreak. His body blurs, moving out of his bed room, and into the attic. He searches, finding an old box, one that's covered completely in dust and cobwebs. Frantically, his hands  wipe away, allowing a clear view of the title. 

"'Boardgame'. This is great."

In no time, the ex-Shinobi is back infront of Mirai, the board set on the table. "Alright, let's rock."* - Fri Oct  2 09:22:46 2015
