<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Finally, after a long dog of inactivity, Sanoke begins with his long-winded period of training. The scroll, which had been delivered to him days prior by Tetsumi, was finally unwinded. The contents unravel in full, showcasing all the juicy information needed to master or at least gain a decent grasp of the latest fuuinjutsu technique.

From this information alone, Sanoke is genuinely impressed. Never before had he anticipated that Fuuinjutsu could be incorporated within cloth. Based on what the scroll detailed, the jutsu was simple -- in that you used Yang Release to give life to the piece of clothing. From there, you manipulated it, allowing the item to race on over to your desired target -- normally that of an opposing shinobi.

In the event that the cloth is enabled to fully cover up your opponent, that's when the Fuuinjutsu actually kicked in. Naturally, the binding properties restricted physical movement, yet the technique also seemed to deter the manipulation of chakra all together. Definitely, this was a usefful skill to add towards Sanoke's own arsenal, as it would enable him to restraint his opponents in a much more smooth or seamless fashion.

Quickly, after reading the scroll, the shinobi goes to the general shop, gathering the needed supplies. Once back at the local training area, the boy's chakra funnels along the thick fabric, imbuing a large chunk of energy into the fibers. With that, while there is no clear aura of azure chakra, Sanoke's item speeds ahead, wrapping around a nearby wild animal, a coyote. Easily, the coyote finds itself restrained and thus unable to move. From this point, the aspects that effects one's chakra also is held in bondage.

After an hour of practice, there's yet another skill to add towards his every growing arsenal.* - Tue Nov  3 09:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yo, yo. - Tue Nov  3 10:37:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Exactly my point. - Tue Nov  3 10:41:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Teaching me. - Tue Nov  3 10:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gives an absentminded glance to the skies.

"Uh. . " he rubs his chin. "What was I going to teach you again?"* - Tue Nov  3 10:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) suddenly breaks out of his daze.

Shame too, they were pleasant thoughts. "Oh yeah! -- But I don't even know if you're good enough, y'know?" he looks Kana up and down, examining her form. She didn't seem like much.* - Tue Nov  3 10:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) does a twirl. He just narrowly gets out of range, allowing the blow to miss it's mark completely.

"Huh? That's easy. Anyone can shoot damn water through their mouth. . " He replies.* - Tue Nov  3 11:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||His hands clap together.

Immediately, a thick viel of light blue chakra surges around his frame. It's powerful, kicking starting a gentle breeze -- one that's surreal, even for a village situated in the Land of Wind. At once, the flow of chakra reaches it;s climax, and mixes in with the dirt, thus enabling Doton Release.

Casually, giant slabs of Earth sprout, blocking and thus forcing the flow of water to be diverted. It rises high, and perhaps runs the risk of forcing Kana to run into it? Hit or miss, Sanoke's location is displaced. In a swirl or whisk or white, his body speeds upward, suimening ontop of the surface. "Neat! It's amusing that you're trying so hard to prove yourself. Are ya a fan of turtle?"* - Tue Nov  3 11:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: boo - Tue Nov  3 11:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Easy peezy.

He yawns obnoxiously, to egg the woman on further. The gesture is more friendly or childish than anything malicious. "Not bad. Although ya kinda just came at me for no reason. I was  -going- to test, y'know?" Sanoke asked nonchalantly. He balanced himself along the edge of that consistently erect Earthen Corridor, his gaze peering down to the fellow, Kirigakure-spawned shinobi.

"Mmmm. Alright, now if you're done doing useless attacks. I can go test ya. Maybe in the training field? Nah. Too small," he muses to himself. A hand presses along his side, unsealing a giant chicken wing.

The boy continued to mutter to himself almost inaudibly, his mouth remaining full despite the self chit-chat.* - Tue Nov  3 11:36:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: The way of Kana says you need to slit your throat. - Tue Nov  3 11:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) kicks off.

Once in distance, his hair elongates and wraps around Kana's frame. "Let's roll." Cue forming a single seal and disappearing in a plume of smoke.* - Tue Nov  3 11:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: --That's not very nice, Kana. - Tue Nov  3 11:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: <*And suddenly poof*> - Tue Nov  3 11:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Ninja as fuck.

He arrives at the western outskirts, where Kana is finally relinquished. 

"Alright. The name of the game is simple. You're going to battle me," Sanoke replies casually. He taps against his back, unsealing one of the patented Turtle Shell along his back. It's a bronze tint, and seems to be rigid, having been forced to weather an abundance of momentum from the looks of things.

Certainly, the shell is heavy and weighs each of the boy's movements down. . . but he shows no sign of distress or fatigue. "Alright. . Last thing. . .Hrm-- Oh!" 

He face palms, having nearly forgotten about the other trick. It was a simple tool-- and really resembled the previous shell. Indeed, as a plume of smoke develops and dissipates, an item that contains two miniture turtle shells appears. They have the calcium-based, protective covering on opposite ends, and both seem to be tethered by an exceptionally rigid string. Casually, Sanoke takes such, and lays it on adjacent portions of his shoulder, allowing the two miniture shells to linger around his body.

"The point is to see if you can challenge me. . . enough that you can force me to either drop the shells, or even steal it. To make it fair, I'm weighed down, limiting my own ability. Of course. . .you're probably still going to fail, y'know? I did this training with my master. It took an entire month to do it."* - Tue Nov  3 11:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Funnily enough, he had still been working on devouring the entirety of that acursed chicken leg. Well. . . delicious was more like it. Having completed it, Sanoke releases a light belch, tossing the boney trash on towardsthe floor. "Oh we can begin--" And just as he's giving the instructions, the ever-brashful Kana is swiftly working to defeat him. Water is visible, shooting away on to the soil andspawning the beginnings of a puddle.

Quickly, Sanoke moves to respond -- while retaining that confident, yet childish grin through it all.

His hands interlock with one another, forming the common Doton symbol, the Snake. From this, his chakra can visibly discharge and knead itself along with the usually dried sand. From nowhere, the floor is terraformed, gaining the sticky and somewhat liquidy effects of mud -- as it was just that. Thick, and saturated, brown mud. Consequently, the water given before only serves to make Sanoke's ninjutsu more powerful and wide spread. It seeps, covering a decent radius, enough to spawn a pit.

Upon stomping his foot, the mud river flies ahead, aiming to engulf and send his would-be apprentice skidding back in recoil.* - Tue Nov  3 12:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Through the entire battle, he wore the same, amused expression. -- Not that this was a particularly challenging bout up to this ppoint. To the contrary, the sage's arrogance forced him to believe one thing; this was a walk in the park. Kana, for all intents and purposes, was simply doomed to fail.

Nonchalantly, a secondary seal is formulated, allowing more and more Doton chakra to be produced. It pours from his soul, and beacons that solid aspect of nature to be bent to his will. At once, the ground shifted, and from a small portion of the mud already manifested, two figures begin to arise. Their shadowy frame initially hold no shape nor form, but in time, there was particular definition added into the mix. Indeed, both of the entities took on the likeness of your's truly, Sanoke.

Attacking in tandem, one takes a step foward, manipulating the mud residue with a sign. Once more, an even larger quantity of mud is produced, and sent forward. It was produced in the form of a wave-- a tidal wave even, one that can eclipse the body mass of a typical human being. Meanwhile, hit or miss, the secondary clone presses his hands together, stringing through a trio of handseals himself. 

Instead of producing another wave, an average-sized dragonmaw cracks away from the ground. And from that construction, mud bullets -- as if from the creature's gullet -- rockets out, about five in total. Each one rivalling the mass of a bowling ball, but of course being much weaker. "Haha! C'mon. . .You know if you keep your distance, you'll never succeed, right? You got to get close if you want to stand a chance. Although. . . Mmm, I know how nervous you get being close to a guy as cool as me," taunted the teen.

As a note, the area in which he stood was devoid of any nasty, muddy residue. Thus. . .He backtracks, and take a seat.* - Tue Nov  3 12:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Huh. If she learned Earth jutsus, she'd be a regular ol' turtle. - Tue Nov  3 12:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: *Heh - Tue Nov  3 12:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||"Clever. . . But chakra costly like a motherfucker. . " He says, his eyes able to read the quantity of chakra that exerted from Kana's body. Of course, he also kept tabs on the Jinchuuriki's normal reservoirs of energy, and thus could tell when fatigue was beginning to arise. Sanoke, however. . . Remained as fresh as can be. After all, the former chunnin wasn't exactly prone to utilizing or relying on massively powerful, B-ranked techniques. 

Especially consideringly. . . Well he had none.

Kana's attempts work well, as her Exploding Water Wave completely and utterly obliterates the incomnig Mud RIver. Of course, the Mud Cannons -- or Dragon Bullets -- manage to puncture a whole, perhaps making the flow of water irregularly. In some strange way, however, the woman's efforts make her more than capable of evading the incoming projectiles. And thus, she rides on, ready to wreck havoc.

In response, the clones form yet another Earthen Corridor. Sadly, they're spawned from simple fakes. It's able to hold off the wave for just a second -- but just that is enough for Sanoke to act. Indeed, the massive onslaught of water continues ahead after trampling through the obstacle. As it clears, there would be a silver-haired shinobi submerged underneath the water.

However. . . This was just a fake.

In the time that the earthen corridor had been spawned, obscuring vision, the true Sanoke had speedily taken the time to hide underneath the ground. Considerable distance is obtained, saving him from any aftershock. Would Kana see through it?* - Tue Nov  3 13:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||It was a clever move. But it doesn't really mean much in the end. Sanoke, in his haste, had proven to a bit too clever, having already placed a clone in his stead. 

The Water Dragon, as it crashed down, finally combusts, spraying the muddied area in a glazing of water. 'Sanoke' twitched. . . And subsequently vanished in a plume of smoke. It was a Kage Bunshin!

The real thing? Cleverly moves along the ground, his hands grasping along Kana's ankles, and pulling her downward. If successful, she'd be submerged within the muddy terrain, up to her neck. Assuming that goes smoothly, Sanoke arises, wearing a slick grin. "Hahah!"

Will narrate after this.* - Tue Nov  3 13:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||"Hah! Told ya you wouldn't be able to do it!" Sanoke declares, the shell from before still dangled from his neck.

Sanoke was many things. One being a physical specimen. For the next hour or two, he's able to easily keep up with the efforts, mostly due to the absurd levels of stamina that the teen sported. The sun was beginning to settle, and once more, the 'Contract Holder' makes an approach. 

SMugness was evident as his eyes traced onto Kana's mud-stained form. 

"Anywho. Ya failed. . ." Sanoke would regretably stated. He flicks his the woman on the nose, playfully as per usual. "Better luck next time? Well. . . Ergh, probably won't be a next time. I don't think you got what it takes."* - Tue Nov  3 14:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) grunts.

"A whole month. . Geez. I'mma have to toy with you for that long?" He says with an exaggerated young.

And so began the training montage. For the next week or two, Sanoke would resume with the training. Day in and day out, challenging and subsequently humiliating the less experienced Kunoichi. On the fifteenth. . . enough had been seen at last. He's fresh off of dominating Kana once more, this time using his Leaf Whirlwind technique to trip her up into a face full of mud.

". . .Man. You're persistant! Lucky for you, today marks the last day of your initiation. Ya showed the right characteristics. . . One of the main tenets of the Kame Cove. You have to be persistant, unwilling to compromise. . . Your will musn't be broken. And man, if you can take being manhandled for this long, you're alright in my book!" He gives a thumbs up, awaiting a response at last.* - Tue Nov  3 14:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) rolled his eyes.

"Maybe, maybe not. You got a long way to go one way or another," he replies casually. After biting his thumb, five seals are produced. The sealing formula runs along the ground, conjuring up one of his best turtle pals -- Gekka.

It was a sloth-like turtle, with a oversized mouth. The stomach was used to store an assortment of scrolls

On this occasion, the contract scroll is held within the reptilian's maw. "And this is the Sacred Contract. Hrm. . But first."* - Tue Nov  3 14:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He goes to take the scroll and unravels it.

Along the fabric's paper are twelve names, each written in cursive. At the bottom, is Sanoke's.

"Hrm. . . Show me your breasts! Then you can sign," he says with a nod, his tone seemingly dead serious. . . 'Course, still with the usual, whimsical tone.* - Tue Nov  3 14:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) stares to see if she's really going to walk off.

Of course, in the event that Kana gets too far, Sanoke would have no issue covering the distance.* - Tue Nov  3 15:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) stops her.

"Alright. Was just checking to see if you'd actually do it. Draw your blood, and sign your name."* - Tue Nov  3 15:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's how contracts are handled. This 'contract' is really just like. . . a special fuuinjutsu. It'll link you with turtles. - Tue Nov  3 15:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: But requires a blood sacrifice. - Tue Nov  3 15:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He nods.

Once her name had been written, the blood dries automatically. A black kanji forms, granting Kana with the ability to now contract turtle summons.

"Anywho. Those are the handsigns. Let's see if you can summon something that's not shitty."

Cue showing the proper handseals.* - Tue Nov  3 15:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||She gets the worse turtle possible.

It's akin to a snail. Feeble, weak. . . and generally useless in everything. "Wooow! You got a long way to work. Why do you like turtles again?"* - Tue Nov  3 15:18:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) thinks: What an idiot. - Wed Nov  4 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . . - Wed Nov  4 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) had been on his way from Konoha.

For what? Reasons unknown. Nevertheless, Sanoke -- with all of his usual supplies and battle gear being worn -- made way to the south. In this leisure travel, a strange presence is noted. . .One that's relatively familiar. The teen's innate sensory abilities kick in, and soon it's vaguely recognized as Nina.

In no time at all, his body flickers, practically teleporting into the area. :"Nina! Haha, funny to see you out here, eh? You oughta be more careful, though. These woods are dangerous. Where ya headed?"

The scene initially takes sometime to legitimately be registered. Grainy, soft dirt could be seen piled up ontop of one another. . . And of course, Nina was clearly the one that had been digging. Yet the person's facial features, that's what struck out in the end. His maw had briefly opened to continued the idle, friendly chatter, but at last. . . the tragedy had been discovered.

"-- No. . Please that isn't? No way. . " Unbeknowst to the young Uchiha, Sanoke was actually an old comrade to the recently deceased.* - Wed Nov  4 06:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) pressed a hand against Nina's shoulder.

His eyes watched as the Earthen Corridor proceeded to envelop and thus block off Violet's body. "Violet. . . Wh-- No. . . Forgive me. Forgive me for not being there when Kirigakure needed me. . ." He says with a heavy heart. The former shinobi holds back the urge to break into tears -- considering this was yet another soul that he had failed.

No more.

A glance falls onto Nina. "Tell me. Who did this? Was it that bastard. . .Edge?" * - Wed Nov  4 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gripped tighter.

Had she really expected him to leave her alone? "Talk to me. You can't keep things bottled up, you know. . "* - Wed Nov  4 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) frowned. He remained passive, nevertheless.

"And if I let you go, what good is that going to do? You'll just get used to being alone -- then your heart will harden."* - Wed Nov  4 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) speeds ahead. Hestops right infront of Nina.

"C'mon! It's your buddy. . Sanoke."* - Wed Nov  4 06:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) a hand seemingly rests at his hip.

"I can't do that. I'd never let one of my companions just run off and be a mess. I want you to come back to Suna with me. . . After I complete a little mission."* - Wed Nov  4 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: No. Now leave me alone. - Wed Nov  4 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I can't. Well. . No, I won't. - Wed Nov  4 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) is following.

"And where is that?"* - Wed Nov  4 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) flicks ahead like a phantom again.

Once more, Sanoke is right infront of the Uchiha. "Yo. I can't just let you leave. .. I'll take you in, you know? Even if by force."* - Wed Nov  4 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) was damn confused.

His Tanto is grasped, and chakra funnels along, darkening it's tint. "A girly pet. . ? That's. . -- What? I hope you don't think I have less than honest intent for you. . " He says with some exasperation. 

Was Nina lowkey calling him a pedo?

"I'm getting married in a few months, you know."* - Wed Nov  4 06:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) sheaths his Tanto.

He wears a frown. "I'll check in later I guess. For now. . . I should finish that job. Be safe, okay?" He turns now, and gives a glance onto Thaen. In a whisk of white, Sanoke disappears.* - Wed Nov  4 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||In perfect position, Sanoke begins with his scouting.

After all, as it appeared, if he didn't take action, everyone else would be content with just waiting. Swiftly, blood is drawn. After five short seals, chakra pumps and summons his turtle. Due to the nature of his Rinnegan, there was innately shared vision between the two.

"Alright. .. Genbi. I need you to look around this area. Search for any traps -- and if all is well, use your aquatic ability to smoothly enter the village. I'm doing a consensus, and generally seeing if the village is in decent condition. . ." With that said, the reptilian speedily enters the water. Soon after, it's joined by various other creatures which inevitably allow for a swift, mapping out process.

It was like having nearly a dozen mental televisions running along in his head. Eagerly, Sanoke draws this shit up.* - Wed Nov  4 07:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) returned after his scouting period of Genjigakure.

There wasn't a lot to be said about it. The army Edge possessed was large, but certainly didn't  have close to Sunagakure's amount.

"S'up."* - Wed Nov  4 07:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmph. - Wed Nov  4 07:40:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gulps.

"Violet's body. . .I don't think she's killed her. But she went M.I.A. I was busy with a mission, so I couldn't stop her."* - Wed Nov  4 08:53:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Heh. - Wed Nov  4 09:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So is most of the human race, don't worry about it. - Wed Nov  4 09:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hehe, well don't worry about that! Being dumb isn't all that bad. - Wed Nov  4 09:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm? I don't worry about it. I'm smart whenever it counts. - Wed Nov  4 09:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gives a glance to both of kunoichi.

"Katana users. . .Y'know. I can get down with a blade myself. Since when was Kenjutsu becoming so popular? More and more people use it these days."* - Wed Nov  4 09:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? - Wed Nov  4 09:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It is. - Wed Nov  4 09:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Sometimes, your fist just isn't enough. But most people -- save for genetic freaks -- can't take a hit from a Katana. - Wed Nov  4 09:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mhrm. Especially with a good strong arm behind it. - Wed Nov  4 09:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Glad, I just stick to a simple sword. - Wed Nov  4 09:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) does one of those random things people do when they're bored.

He runs around in a circular fashion, his path going about both Kasanari and Ketsuki. Briefly, Sanoke had legitimately forgotten about the two. Upon starting the second lap, the teen pauses.

"--Blargh. This place gets dull sometimes. Besides doing badass things with chakra or weapons, what do you two like to do?"* - Wed Nov  4 09:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Oh! - Wed Nov  4 09:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: And I like reading all sorts of material, really.. Oh, that and.. - Wed Nov  4 09:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Physical exertion in general, really. - Wed Nov  4 09:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) visibly grows a little flustered.

Although, it's tamed compared to how he used to be.* - Wed Nov  4 09:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Eating Spicy food is also very nice... Heh. - Wed Nov  4 09:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Seems legit -- Yess! Food, that shit is great. - Wed Nov  4 09:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Training is cool too. I train a lot. Shame there aren't a lot interesting opponents to face. - Wed Nov  4 09:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Never heard of that. - Wed Nov  4 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It's a very, very spicy meat dish with pasta. - Wed Nov  4 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Imagine Tofu.. - Wed Nov  4 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But made entirely out of spicy materials. - Wed Nov  4 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) scratches his cheek idly. The description sounded good -- enough to build up a small appetite. 

"Sounds cool. If you all want, we can go get some food," he says with a blank gaze. . . In hopes that this wouldn't be taken the wrong way. His body acrobatically contorts afterwards, allowing him to land in a handstand effortlessly, using only a single arm.

"Or we can do some 'physical exertion.' You two seem somewhat strong, y'know?"* - Wed Nov  4 09:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Bwah! - Wed Nov  4 09:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Nah. - Wed Nov  4 09:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It's a double entendre; when you say something that can be interpreted one of two ways, while meaning one but not the other. - Wed Nov  4 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So that people THINK you mean the other one. - Wed Nov  4 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It's a kind of joke - Wed Nov  4 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: .... - Wed Nov  4 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Huh? - Wed Nov  4 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Its not very funny.... Boo Sanoke. - Wed Nov  4 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He leaps onto his feet.

"Hrm? What are you talking about? You guys said you liked physical exertion," Sanoke stated innocently. His lower body proceeds to bend, stretching out the joints located on the upper thigh. Sanoke's arms even did the helicopter routine.

". . .Ergh. I'm not telling a joke? Two on one. Right here, right now."

He's dead serious.* - Wed Nov  4 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Heh. - Wed Nov  4 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Ergh. . Girls are weird. I won't question it. - Wed Nov  4 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: How about it, then? - Wed Nov  4 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Miss? - Wed Nov  4 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: YOu and me against him, two on one? - Wed Nov  4 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Eh, I'll give the youngster sometime to respond. - Wed Nov  4 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: I'm so confused! - Wed Nov  4 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Since you're only a genin, how much do you want me to hold back? - Wed Nov  4 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: However much you want to, Sanoke.. And Miss. - Wed Nov  4 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: He's challenging us to a fight. - Wed Nov  4 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Because he was trying to do a play on words. - Wed Nov  4 09:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: I'm gonna...go take a seat. - Wed Nov  4 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Seems this will be one on one. - Wed Nov  4 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So- you mind if I go all out, then? - Wed Nov  4 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That is- if you're holding back, Sanoke. - Wed Nov  4 09:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Uh. Sure, sure. - Wed Nov  4 09:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: -- And I wasn't doing a play on words. I was just copying what you guys said. - Wed Nov  4 09:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) debates on how to best deal with the opponent.

"Hrm. . .I'll start with a Kunai first. . . That should help me be able to defend against the Katana," he murmurs to himself. A hand sweeps downward, grasping at the nearby Kunai holster. Immedietely, the ninja knife is grasped and held firmly within the right hand.

Sanoke takes a step back, his knees crouching to tense the muscles so that they're more able to act once the going got tough. "What's up. . ?"* - Wed Nov  4 09:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He stares on innocently as per usual.

Despite being a nineteen year old man, Sanoke very much retained a level of. . . childishness. A sly, mischevious smirk remained on his face almost habitually  -- and that expression didn't change one bit. Not even as the seal is formed, and thus the genjutsu is put into play.

The chakra surging from Ketsuki's body firmly strikes Sanoke'sceberal nervous system. In time, the illusion takes place,  as the 'black leaves' serve as a distraction. Sadly. . . Who Ketsuki faced wasn't exactly some low-leveled punch. As a retired shinobi, he excelled in all basic tenets of shinobi skills -- yes even Genjutsu. 

"Huh? One second, I think you put me in a genjutsu."

The Kunai is placed into his mouth, teeth clenching along the hilt. Once done, a single handsign is formed, breaking the genjutsu with ease. "Alright! Let's go now!"* - Wed Nov  4 10:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He observes as Ketsuki's body disappeared. 

"Huh!-- Fast. . !" The boy roared out. 

His head is turning, viewing Ketsuki barely via peripheral. But even then, the former chunnin is more than capable of hearing the motions of her body. And thus, as the slash goes through, defensive measures are taken.

A slight pivot of the foot is all that's needed. Momentum is obtained near instantly, and forces him to slide just out of range of the diagonal blow. Ironically, the man often known as a turtle Summoner, was stupendously swift. He moved at speeds that rivaled even the most veteran Shunshin practitioners. The velocity was at such a rate, it was highly doubtful anyone in the area would be able to perceive him -- in fact, he'd merely be a streak of white and black.

Amidst the evasion, the Kunai is taken in hand and speedily swiped, intent on going at the woman's hip. It was a precise action, and had things gone according to plan, no flesh would even be struck. Rather, only a slight incision was spawned through the fabric.

A thick trail is left along the sand, once Sano had stopped just two feet away. 

"Hahahaa! Not bad! -- And thank you, Chikyu! I'll try to make this a good show for you!"* - Wed Nov  4 10:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Playfully, his hands whip through the air, as the Kunai is gripped tightly.

The movement of his body's appendages was nearly as swift as his running speed. In no time, the two pieces of metal strike one another, unleashing booming 'clank'!

From the friction alone, droplets of sparks fly, crashing into the sand shortly after. With just one arm, the would-be sage presses ahead, aiming to keep that blade at bay. "Huh? Yeah. If I went too hard, I'd win too fast. Y'know? I can see that there's a difference, heh," Sanoke rebuts. After the brief period in which they gave a test of strength, a sudden push is given, hopefully sending the woman back in recoil.

In that instant, he flickered out of view, stopping a few paces southwest. 

With just a single seal, the boy's cheeks puff up. Upon exhaling, a thick stream of brown, muddy residue flushes out, aiming to envelop Ketsuki's form, and of course send her staggering back in recoil. It was a nifty technique, sure enough. But with the ease of use came a clear lack of power. It wasn't going to hurt, needless to say.* - Wed Nov  4 10:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Of course, he spots the bombs as they're coming.

Easily, they -can- be repelled. But to dominant the fight from start to finish would be boring. Instead, he back peddles out of range, allowing his vision to be obscured -- for Ketsuki's sake.

"For a second. . .I thought that was poison. Come out. . Come out. . Where ever you arree. . . " He says with a cheekish grin. Adrenaline was finally being developed, just what did the young Konoha shinobi have planned?* - Wed Nov  4 10:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) has clone here and what not.* - Wed Nov  4 10:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Nah.

IC they still at the entrance.* - Wed Nov  4 10:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||His hearing is refined -- but probably -not- quite enough to accurately locate a projectile as it's slinging through the air. Again, with a singular pivot, Sanoke makes his move.

Casually, the Kunai misses its mark entirely, given that neither can really see one another.

Taking a grasp at straws, his hands clap together, now allowing a strong gale of wind to sweep over the area. It pushes, dissipating all of the smoke and hopefully reaching a far enough distance to strike Ketsuki. In the event that it had? She'd find herself likely being toppled over and sent onto the sandy floors.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meanwhile. . . Sanoke's clone is doing it's thing.

"Probably not. Why did you come to Suna? Old man Hassan doesn't usually like visitors. Especially unannounced," he speaks in a matter of fact tone. "By the by, you might want to take. . . Like a day to shop. Your clothes are pretty tattered, man."* - Wed Nov  4 11:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shrugged.

"I'unno. Maybe you could get to talking and tell me why you're here?" he says while running a hand through his nape. The tone is still whimisical, even if the words could be seen as heartless. . . considering this was apparently an underpriviledged girl seeking shelter. But based on how Sanoke spoke, you'd swear he hadn't even noticed.

Curious, cerulean eyes remain trained on her form -- taking note of all the small details. Especially that Katana.
* - Wed Nov  4 11:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Hook! Line! Sinker!

As the attack succeeds, he breaks out into a massive grin. His chuckles are giddy, like a child that had just been taught the joys of candy or videogames. "Hahaha! Man, this is great! You're doing a lot better than I expected, though. I actually have to use my elemental techniques."

His hands pressed together again, forming another unique hand sign. From this, the mud previously placed along the ground is utilized. Rigidly, the liquidy substance takes form, gaining a life of it's own. Given enough time, four seconds flat, what was once massless earth was now a clone, completely in the likeness of Sanoke.

His arms are folded. "Want to put this on recess, though? It's nothing to feel bad. You're really strong for a rookie shinobi. If I were to put myself as a rank. . . I'd say I'm. . Uh, a high-leveled chunnin? Maybe even a special Jounin. So there's a huge difference in skill level."* - Wed Nov  4 11:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||His eyes expand, practically popping out of his head.

"YO!" Every hair on Sanoke's body stood up as he examined the Peasant's strange appearance. Her skin was beyond white, moreso than even a caucasian that had lacked a tan. Heart racing, breathing rate accelerated, it takes Sano a while to gain some calmness.

Once he had, though, the psuedo-shinobi gives a reply. ". . .You chose a good place. My goodness, your tan is horrible. I can tell ya what. I'll let you in, but you gotta go see the Boss Man immediately. M'kay?"* - Wed Nov  4 11:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||With ease, Ketsuki's sword strikes right through one of the first clones.

As it's severed, the doppleganger is instantly reverted back to it's previous form, this being massless mud. "That's what I'm talkin' about! C'mon, let's rock!" 

For now, the second of the Earth Clones take a back seat. Sanoke again grasps at the Kunai from his holster, and holds it up in a defensive position. If Ketsuki wanted to play? It was Sanoke's obligation to entertain her. Albeit. . . the battle was likely soon to end.

The speedster remains in the same spot, his free hand gesturing for the girl to come closer.* - Wed Nov  4 11:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Sunagakure played no games.

"Hassan's policy." With that said, he goes to lead the Peasant Girl along the path, his eyes still observant to ensure that there was no funny business going on. In time, they were likely to be upon the square or mansion.* - Wed Nov  4 11:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hassan? - Wed Nov  4 11:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Yo? - Wed Nov  4 11:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) comes in with the Peasant Girl.

"This girl wants to like. . I'unno. She wants into the village. It's your call boss man."

This is a clone.* - Wed Nov  4 11:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||The plan was flawed-- But it had one advantage.

Shock value.

"A dynamic entry!?" The teen thought to himself. In the end, however, his mind is more than capable of processing the situation beforei t got out of hand. Just seconds before the kick could actually knock his teeth in, both of Sanoke's forearms jutt upward, lessening the momentum. A strong recoil occurs right after, forcing the defender to stagger back in recoil just then.

But, right as Ketsuki's eyes remain on him, his hand goes through a string of handseals.

Upon the third and final being released, chakra pulsated through the skies. The second she had touched the floor, it would feel as if the ground was suddenly terraformed or manipulated. Indeed, now there was a sticky, murky-like consistency -- Quick Sand. The false imagery was quite convincing, very much feeling and looking as if the real thing had been spawned.

Slowly but sure, she'd find her body being pulled inward within the genjutsu.

"Secret Style. . .  Quicksand technique!"

Had that worked, the clone comes in at last from underneath the ground, pulling Ketsuki in by the ankles. Head Hunter.* - Wed Nov  4 11:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: THE FUCK?! - Wed Nov  4 11:31:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I don't see many fat women period, they all seem to either be Loli's, or mature and beautiful... - Wed Nov  4 11:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Uyahh.. - Wed Nov  4 11:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ..Anyway, I guess with me fully immobilized, you've won huh? - Wed Nov  4 11:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods.

He goes to pat her on the head. The genjutsu releases itself, but Ketsuki is still effectively bound.

"Not bad, though. You should have began training as a shinobi earlier. I'm sure you may have been able to win then."* - Wed Nov  4 11:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: 'Course- you don't think I'd actually give up because of something like this, do you..?! Now seriously.. - Wed Nov  4 11:41:26 2015

"Yeah. I just learned the skill a week ago. No one said anything about getting out."* - Wed Nov  4 11:42:17 2015

"I was only kidding, you know. . " He says with a sigh. His eyes look over the damage that was done to the area unnecessarily -- thankfully, explosive tags were harmless for one reason or another.

"Geez. I just wanted to see if you would panic."* - Wed Nov  4 11:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gives a whole gaze onto the swordswoman after she gets blown away by the concussive force.

Of course, he seems to have missed that part.

"Huh? Whatcha doing, Chikyu? I think she's trying to play a game."* - Wed Nov  4 11:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shook his head.

"Didn't take you for a jokster, Chikyu-- Gah. That name. . . I'mma just call you. . Chik. M'kay?" 

Once Ketsuki had made it known, Sanoke turns, eying the oddly pigmentated woman. "Oh, hi. I'm guessing Hassan said you could stay."* - Wed Nov  4 11:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||The response brings nothing but confusement.

"Uh. . .Is that a yes or no?" the warrior asked with his usual head-tilt. His face scrunched up mildly.* - Wed Nov  4 12:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Neither am I. - Wed Nov  4 12:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: So she's allowed to stay? - Wed Nov  4 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm only allowed to stay fourty eight hours... - Wed Nov  4 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah... Two days, huh..? I'm hre visiting a very close freind... - Wed Nov  4 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Still, I'm only here for so long myself. It's nice to meet you, regardless- I'm Ketsuki, you are? - Wed Nov  4 12:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: <*glances to Chiyku*> Huh? What's rude? -- Wait. . . I think she means the comment about Hassan. - Wed Nov  4 12:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Oh. - Wed Nov  4 12:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah, I see. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So you're a wanderer, then? - Wed Nov  4 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Our...Kazekage is....well... I don't know. I haven't met him. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm from Kirigakure.... it is not safe there. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: So a peasant girl was required to meet him...but his own people haven't met him. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Kiri. . .Yeah. I saw one of my friends dead not too long ago. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah..? What happened...? Are you okay..? For that matter- would you like someone to keep you company while you're here? I know that wandering alone can be really unpleasant. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: It would have been nice for him to know how I entered the village....he assumed a broke in and it made for a bad first impression. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Damn. She's really friendly. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) coughs.

"Whoopsie?"* - Wed Nov  4 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Wow.... that's messed up. I can see why things might have gone poorly, then. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It happens. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I doubt it would change anything.... - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I suppose he said you could gather supplies and get a change of clothes- thus the two days- then leave, huh? - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Probably not. He -really- doesn't like strangers. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Coming to his village. And it makes sense. . .sometimes. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well, I suppose it is true to say that.. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yeah.... well... considering he expressed he is from Kiri... it was rather insulting to have me turned away so quickly. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Like one time, there was this Bone guy that would come here and randomly threaten to kill people. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: With the village expecting an attack from Genjikaure soon, he's on a bit of a paranoid edge- still, that kind of thing.. - Wed Nov  4 12:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah. - Wed Nov  4 12:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Are you okay? - Wed Nov  4 12:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: She is extremely friendly. - Wed Nov  4 12:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: So wait. What precisely is going on in Kirigakure? - Wed Nov  4 12:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: The Mizukage is dead, there is no leader, and Kiri is a shell of it's former self.... I am fine, but it isn't a home. So I have no home. - Wed Nov  4 12:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I used to live there too-- - Wed Nov  4 12:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...My god. - Wed Nov  4 12:10:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Was it Edge and his men again..? - Wed Nov  4 12:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) sighs.

He was going to become an alcoholic at this rate.* - Wed Nov  4 12:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'll talk with one of my friends. She'll give us the scoop.. - Wed Nov  4 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't know who Edge is. - Wed Nov  4 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: -- So wait. If he turned you away, why are you still here? - Wed Nov  4 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: He gave me two days I said. - Wed Nov  4 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh. I wasn't listening. - Wed Nov  4 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Two days is... basically turnin--... - Wed Nov  4 12:11:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Females. - Wed Nov  4 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I just said I wasn't listening -- for that comment. Geez. - Wed Nov  4 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Is that a good joke? I feel like I did good. - Wed Nov  4 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Oh....guess not. - Wed Nov  4 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: Heh... good joke. - Wed Nov  4 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) thinks: I thought Sanoke wasn't listening to her. - Wed Nov  4 12:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shook his head.

"Nah. I think I was fantasizing about going on a mystical adventure.I got a short attention span sometimes."He notes. That being said, he rushes towards a wall and leans against it.* - Wed Nov  4 12:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Alright. - Wed Nov  4 12:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) wakes from his daze.

"Huh? You're leaving? Roger! Catch ya later. Feel free to come see me again if you want to train some more," he says cheerfully as usual. A hand rises, waves good bye. * - Wed Nov  4 12:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Nah. She's just a chill person. - Wed Nov  4 12:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: So you've been to Kiri, Konoha and now Suna. The climate doesn't disturb you? Given. . y'know. - Wed Nov  4 12:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Your condition. - Wed Nov  4 12:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: My condition? - Wed Nov  4 12:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: How horrible SANOKE! - Wed Nov  4 12:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Just because shes a girl, doesn't mean she can't take care of herself! - Wed Nov  4 12:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) defensively holds his hands out.

His eyes squint and face scrunches up again. "No, no, no!" the teen exclaims, claiming innocence. "I was just saying. . . Y'know. The darker you are, the better you're able to take on sunrays or hot places. And well. . . She's the opposite of dark. -- I'm an idiot! That's make up, isn't it?"* - Wed Nov  4 12:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ....oh... - Wed Nov  4 12:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: No. - Wed Nov  4 12:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: This is me. - Wed Nov  4 12:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: How rude, judging some off their skin color! Are, you saying I wouldn't be able to handle the cold just because I'm dark! - Wed Nov  4 12:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: No! . . .Chikyu! This is like science. - Wed Nov  4 12:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's fact. - Wed Nov  4 12:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: The heat does not bother me. - Wed Nov  4 12:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: OH, becuase of my skin color is a fact I'm lesser at you in something? - Wed Nov  4 12:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||And suddenly, Sanoke was at her side.

A hand moved, to grasp against Ume's cheek, prodding at her skin. Friction is evident -- but there doesn't seem to be make-up being smudged off!

"Amazing! . . Uh. Are you like a mutant or something? --- Er. . . Yeah, kinda. If you're lighter than me, than you can't take sunrays as good." He speaks to Ume and Chikyu interchangeably.* - Wed Nov  4 12:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He continued to rub, entranced by the strange sensation that came with feeling the Peasant's skin. His face told it all, as the boy stares on with a clearly mystified, or captivated gaze. (:O)

"Huh? Well it's. . y'know. Bad. Just. . Ab-normal? Not something you see a lot?" He said gently. His words were often broken up slowly, andSanoke clearly takes time to choose his vernacular carefully, as to avoid offending the sensitive. Due to the manner of speech, his commentary is slow, sentence choppy, and generally awkward.

Of course, given his constantly activated doujutsu, it was certain that he'd be able to detect the build up of chakra among the cheek -- yet the boy doesn't say anything in reference to it. But at last, the grip is released, once Chikyu cried foul once more.

"It's fact, Chikyu! I'm not picking on her or anything.  . . "* - Wed Nov  4 12:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: You keep talking about skin color and how strange she is! - Wed Nov  4 12:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: You're picking on her! - Wed Nov  4 12:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) is pleasantly surprised that the woman isn't instantly sidingwith Chikyu.

Typically, females tended to team up against him..

"Hah! Stop being so sensitive. Geez, the public is so soft nowadays." He turns to face Ume now. "So what were you about to do? With your chakra."* - Wed Nov  4 13:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Chakra? - Wed Nov  4 13:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: TIts rude no matter what, to say someone weird or abnormal because of their skin color. My dad told me to respect all kinds of people, especially as a man to a woman... Well that part doesn't work really anymore, since he learned I was a girl.. But the rest of it still stands! - Wed Nov  4 13:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) shook his head.

"Tch. You must not be realizing, you're speaking to the ace shinobi! Sanoke!" He declares with a sense of pride.

"But eh, I'll bother you about it later," says the lad with a shoulder shrug. "Alrighht! I'm sorry, Chikyu. Ergh, I'll try not to be all. . . prejudice and stuff."* - Wed Nov  4 13:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) is smacked a bit too hard.

He flinches in recoil. "A-Aha. Y-Yeah," the male states in slight pain. He turns, and gives an overly courteous bow-- repeatily. In fact, he had done bowed about eight times in a row.

"Forgive me Ume-kun! Err. . Chan. Which one is for girls again, Chikyu?"* - Wed Nov  4 13:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: How the heck am I supposed to know? - Wed Nov  4 13:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) exhales.

"Right. That should keep Chikyu off my back."

As the girl tries to prod for a name, he goes back to leaning on the wall. His gaze remained on Ume, just staring her down, hardly even blinking. Clearly he was examining her -- but not for the reasons people would think.* - Wed Nov  4 13:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Nope.

He was being pulled into a forced, trio hug.* - Wed Nov  4 13:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Cool. This shit is weird. Hrm. . . my instincts say. - Wed Nov  4 13:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: To see how far it can. Do I harass her? - Wed Nov  4 13:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Didn't take you for a hugger. - Wed Nov  4 13:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Nice to meet you, Ume! I'm Chikyu. - Wed Nov  4 13:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeah. Nice to meet ya. I'm Sanoke, as you've probably heard. - Wed Nov  4 13:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yeah...nice. - Wed Nov  4 13:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: So ya say you're from Kirigakure. . Huh? What were you doing before leaving? - Wed Nov  4 13:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Just...living. - Wed Nov  4 13:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: And you had to do it someway. It's not like you're self sustaining. - Wed Nov  4 13:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Lying is starting to become easier. - Wed Nov  4 13:49:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: M'hm. Konoha is on the look out for her as well. - Wed Nov  4 23:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Ah. Yeah, those places would be obvious. - Wed Nov  4 23:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: If I was a person on the run. I'd just hide out in the forest. - Wed Nov  4 23:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah, people seem to think while Ortho was the one who attacked, he wasn't the one to kill the Mizukage. - Wed Nov  4 23:36:32 2015
