<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||He conjures up a scroll.

As it's opened upward, he rolls it over and begins to scribble a few notes via Finger Carving Seal. It was like a blow torch magically being developed along the shinobi's appendage. Despite his naive demeanor, Sanoke was pretty knowledgeable on the finer aspects of chakra -- and Fuuinjutsu in general. He thoroughly goes into details, depicting the important of even quantites of chakra, and seals themselves.

Overall, the scroll shows that releasing your chi evenly over the seal is ideal.

Likewise, the scroll shows a step-by-step diagrapm of how to write the sealing. Sanoke gives a glance before tossing the item on over to Yan. "You'll need ink and paper to do these instructions. Once you can purposely do the basic sealing -- that means sealing an object and releasing -- then I'll show you a neat technique. Alright?"* - Sun Nov  8 02:47:15 2015

He does thing extra. Spontaneously, Sanoke just appears. Sand and rocks swirled around his form before finally falling onto the ground. In hand, there's a chocolate bar, which the teen munches on.

"S'up."* - Sun Nov  8 08:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) tilted his head.

The munches proceeded to slow, as the situation gained a degree of awkwardness. "Hrm? What's going on. . .?" Sanoke inquires. He kicks off the ground, effortlessly closing the distance, and being just in the mid-point between the two.

"What you guys talkin' about?"* - Sun Nov  8 08:08:57 2015

Greedily, Sanoke continues to nom away. The chocolate smudges a ring around his lips  before the teen eventually begins to speak. 

"Uh. You sound nervous. Koji tells me you're feeling ill. . ? Cause you miss your friend?"* - Sun Nov  8 08:17:29 2015

"Uh. . . She isn't very good at lying," Sanoke stated with a sigh. He makes an approach, sticking a hand out to help the girl up.

"C'mon, tell me. I can probably like solve the issues. Not to brag or anything. . . But uhm, I'm kinda like a super hero here."* - Sun Nov  8 08:20:54 2015

He gives a glance to Koji as the Hokuma gives his explanation. Still, Sanoke is more than just a little skeptical. 

"Eh. . . Seems fishy. I don't get why that'd make her all red-faced," the teen declared.  His eyes are canted downward, eying the woman as she sat along the floor. As the grip was established, she's pulled up.

"Telll meeee. I'll . .Uh, give you candy?" Sanoke spoke, practically begging.* - Sun Nov  8 08:31:08 2015

Then he offered to get me a passport, but that's crazy, to go across the regions just for a 'feeling'. - Sun Nov  8 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) wears a look that suggests complete and utter confusion.

"Oh. Uh. . I don't get it. What 'feeling'?" A hand moves, scratching his head. "I mean. Sight is technically a feeling, right? One of the five senses of feels."

He may or may not have any idea what the hell he's saying.* - Sun Nov  8 08:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I.... had an -emotional- feeling... like a beginning of a crush. - Sun Nov  8 08:37:07 2015

It all made sense now! But still, Sanoke looked confused. "Uh. . . But why, though? Like why is it such an un-nerving idea?" He replies, the excitement dying down immediately.* - Sun Nov  8 08:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Because...when I started to get these feelings...we were talking about how she...can't be with anyone.... because they always end up dead. - Sun Nov  8 08:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Hrm. . ? Naaah! That only happened like twice. - Sun Nov  8 08:44:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods in appreciation of the statement. 

Last thing Sanoke needed was someone else blaming him for making some random person cry. A hand moves, patting the girl on the shoulder. "Good for you, though. Lera is a cool chick."

A glance falls over to Koji, who was seemingly falling a sleep.

". . And that isn't safe. Whatever. -- Wait, why were you with Koji to place Trilliam in jail?"* - Sun Nov  8 08:56:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) grits his teeth.

He wanted someone to be dazzled. A hand moves to awkwardly rub his nose. "I mean, eh. . . Was just trying to see if you'd grow curious of it."* - Sun Nov  8 09:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) immediately gets nervous.

Not because he was un-used to physical contact, but because he knew had a certain someone stumbled upon this -- things would get bad soon. 

Regardless, taking advantage of the grip, Sanoke takes off. Via use of Shunshin, the two covered dozens of meters in a matter of second. His feet pressed against the southern village wall, and thus they can exit outside.

"Alright. . ."* - Sun Nov  8 09:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) perked a brow.

He had grown so used to doing that, his body almost didn't register motion sickness anymore. "Uh. . . You okay there? Maybe Koji was right. . . Ya do seem a little ill," the teen questioned innocently.* - Sun Nov  8 09:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You just.... tossed me across the fucking ...village..ugh.. - Sun Nov  8 09:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: What? No I didn't. I just carried you. - Sun Nov  8 09:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: So...fast... - Sun Nov  8 09:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods.

"Yep! It what happens when you wear a turtle shell for like five years straight."

He takes a seat, his legs folding over one another indian style.* - Sun Nov  8 09:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||For the weeks that preceded this day, Sanoke remained hard at work.

Day in and day out, he practiced hard, working on theory-crafting his latest technique. It was one based solely on Yang Release, and of course, he had been given guidance on it by teachers that hailed from Kame Cove. After the weeks of work, the teen was finally ready to put his thought into action, to make mere dreams become realities.

"Alright. . . To do this jutsu, I have to make sure I can firmly apply my neutral chakra onto every fiber of hair. Each milimeter must be fed an increasible amount of condensed chakra. .  . much like the healing technique performed by common medics. Thinking hard on this, Sanoke proceeded with this initial process, each time being capable of ingraining a higher, and more concentrated quantity on his own. For the next week or so, that's pretty much -all- that he did. 

On every other training session, there was his trusty companion -- Lord Genbi -- serving as a helpful guide. He continued to scold the much younger Sanoke, giving tidbits and guidance to ensuring that the Yang Release technique went as according to plan. After weeks of continued effort, the teen is at last completed, capable of sending a wealth of chakra to ensure that the life or physical aspects of his energys had become one with the cells.

Finally, there came the finishing touches. 

The nature of the jutsu could been as a perfect personification of the definition that comes with Yang Release. What Sanoke sought to do was simple -- and that was to ensure that his hair suddenly gained the ability to be lengthened at will. Well, so long as chakra remained etched or persistant in the hair's form. Utilizing the chakra's simple nature, the hair itself begins to expand, flowing like the ninja was freaking Favio. It continued to grow, before eventually Sanoke's hair stretched out onto his bum. 

Just that simple process was enough to leave his exhausted, be on it the physical plain or mental. After all, manipulating such a large amount of chakra in one go was a tiring endeavor, even for someone as  experienced as Sanoke. Nevertheless, the process had been done,. From this, he seeks to add the next two quantities. The first being his ability to harden the hair, making it's durability to be on par with common ninjutsu weaponry. Of course, as this is the most imperative portion of the technique, it's the hardest. 

It takes roughly two weeks now, two weeks of continued practice until Sanoke even has even a semblance of completion. In the beginning, the teen's hair remained luxurously soft -- and thus held no actual combative abiility. But as time went on, there was a rigid quantity being added, Progressively, it became harder and harder. First like rubber, than like plastic. . . 

As usual, the turtle summoner was relentless in his endeavors. Sweat pooled around his body, and his breath was heavy -- haggard in it's performance. "Geez! It's been a while since I've seen ya work this hard, ol' Sano! Haha, glad to see you got some work ethic in you! For a minute, I was beginning to think my faith in your abilities was misplaced!" Genbi declared heartily as he notices the sweat trickled away from Sano's frame. Indeed, it was this work ethic that had managed to push the shinobi this far in the first place.

Eventually, as the weeks went on, he's more than capable of now hardening the jutsu to a significant point. It was as dense and hard as low-ended metals, like Iron. Once the first two portions had been diligently completed, Sanoke is hard at work, moving towards the final portion. This was trivial, given that it meant the user was now just tasked with sending the hardened and elongated hair forward.

And the sequence was much like the same. At first, the boy struggled, hardly able to make his chakra-infected hair move. But as repetition went on, things grew more and more do-able. In no time, his hair was whipping back and forth, like Willow Smith.

Given how much effort the teen had applied for the previous month, today likely marked the end of his terrible trip. However, he takes a recess to recover the lost vitality.
-------------------
Cue entry to the village's plains, with the budding Medic in tow.

Again, now in a sitting position, the teen exercises the bulk of his training and thus moves to put it all together. After a single seal, the male's hair gains amazing length, and hardens all in one go. After the required preparation, with ease, Sanoke sends a large bundle of hair flying ahead. It smashes into the nearby wall formation, the strength enough to leave a massive dent. Rock flowed or crumbled downward, slamming against the empty pavement.* - Sun Nov  8 09:25:45 2015

One thing that raised alarm was that Sanoke's eneergy certainly -felt- different. Why? That was pretty hard to determine. Perhaps it felt divine, maybe it felt unnatural. Regardless, the odd sensation could be pin-pointed to the shinobi's eyes.* - Sun Nov  8 09:44:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) looks down, clearly seeing the chakra.

It presses against his body, weighing it down severely. But let's get real. . .Sanoke literally wears turtle shells most of the time.

"Huh? The fuck is this. . ." He declared, taking notice of the added center of gravity. Oddly, the male is still significantly fast. In response, his hair activates, gaining fluidity and thus moving to trap and mind Lera.

"My. .. Lera. You're getting. . . . "

Dramatic pause.

"HAIRY!"* - Sun Nov  8 10:02:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) reads the flow of chakra.

He kicks off his feet with a smirk, sliding along the ground. Some hair had been burnt, but it mattered little to Sanoke. Given that he could just grow more with a jutsu.

"Dammmn! You're getting good, Lera," the male compliments, doing some stretching exercises.

"Ya think you could take me on now?"* - Sun Nov  8 10:05:00 2015

". . . Ergh. . .I'm sorry." What more could he say?* - Mon Nov  9 09:23:37 2015
