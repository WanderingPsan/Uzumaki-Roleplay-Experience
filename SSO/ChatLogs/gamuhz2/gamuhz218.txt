He presses two fingers together, spawning a trio of clones. "Shadow Clone jutsu!" You could never be too sure.

His right arm is held out shortly after.* - Tue Oct 13 07:28:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) 's brow twitches in mild surprise as he finally gets to see Saeza's features as she undergoes the change.

It was an appearance that's utterly demonic in nature, and sends caution running through is frame. Was this an actual human? Partially frozen in fear and surprised, the bite goes through, giving a sharp pinch that riddles along his forearm. But as the pinch subsided, in came the pleasure. 

It really -was-  like experiencing an orgasm. 

SAnoke's breathing picks up a bit, and his face suggests a strong feeling of euphoria. Quickly, the boy pulls back, and slides away. "Sh-shesh. . . What a jutsu. . ." the teen admits. "And the look from before, it was downright demonic. Huh. . . I dont' think you're immortal. . .  but you do got some neat skills. . ." He continued inbetween pants, still unsettled by how a simple bite could feel so good.* - Tue Oct 13 07:39:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) gives a glance towards both of the gents, his mind suddenly being filled with thoughts.

"Yo. Tell me, why did you guys decide to be shinobi? An' like. . did your academy ever make you guys craft a nindo?"* - Tue Oct 13 08:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) 's eyes and glance still remained filled with a whimisical-state. He was a bit too chipper, and often took little to nothing serious.

Yet there's something about Jiki's comments that bring his usually high spirits down. The kid had lived a rough life, that much was obvious. It was a wonder how he hadn't developed into some sociopathic rogue. The hardships certainly held the potential to push him to that point.

"Tragic. Uh. . . Sorry 'bout that," Sanoke replies, glazing over the comment before shifting his gaze onto Hiroshi. "and that's good enough reasoning for me. I didn't have a nindo either when I was in the academy. I only got one because it was required of me in my training," he comments before taking a seat in the sand.* - Tue Oct 13 08:19:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) nods.

"That's right. You should face it as soon as possible. . Because, the fears -- your 'nightmares' even -- can turn out to become a weakness. However, conquering or triumphing over those fears, in the end, will make you much more powerful than you could ever hope. Don't let your fear control you, rather. . You should be in control of it, you get me?" Sanoke lectures, perhaps being a subtle  advice for one thing--

To master the beast that laid within his  stomach.* - Tue Oct 13 08:33:42 2015

He looks ahead. "If you want, you can do some meditation sessions with me later. I do them on occasions to hone my chakra control, build up chakra, and of course to work on my ability to focus," he offers, looking onto the boy that seemed lost in thought. Perhaps due to contemplating his actions?* - Tue Oct 13 08:41:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Oi. Let me go check. - Tue Oct 13 14:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Given all of the time taken to get acclimated with his growing skillset, Sanoke eventually went back to his genetic prowess -- the almighty Rinnegan. It was a skill that had randomly but thrown upon him, and boy. . . Sanoke had every intent on using it's power to the full capacity. Even without using any of the designated skills, simply having the doujutsu active gave a massive boost in strength.

On all facets of shinobi-hood, the boy had obtained starked inclines in term of overall ability. In addition to this, he could also see and discern chakra, enough to nearly identify it to an actual person. But. . . This wasn't enough.

In his exploits, the teen had figured out a single ability -- one of the Asura Path. And that ability? Was to grow additional limbs. Even while using it, his skill and ability to call upon that path was actually a bit sub-par, and Sanoke -knew- this. It was as if the eyes spoke to him on a subconscious level, beckoning him to pursue further power, and giving hints that this was just the tip of the iceberg. "Alright. . . Let's do this. ."

Sitting down indian style, the boy at last begins training, funneling a higher source of chakra towards his optics. From this onslaught of energy, he can target one of the rings, which evidently is the path. The inner most ring prompts the usage of his Asura path, and sends a wave of instructions about his body. Eventually, the chakra pools around the shoulder area, where the changes -- physical ones that is -- begin to develop and transforms. 

There's a bulge being developed, and it convulses in all types of crude, uncomfortable manners. From this, the lump begins to grow more abundant and gains mass. It stretches out in a slow manner, and occasionally flickers or fidgets, showcasing Sanoke's rawness or inability to truthfully use his Asura Path to the full power. He's breathing harshly, and taking a high amount of focus to actually produce the desired results. Sweat boils along his forehead, but doesn't yet drop.

With a quivering body, the release of the arms continue in stride, eventually forming two extra appednages from the shoulder. They're perfect in terms of anatomy, with every muscle and cell being forms to perfection. It allows the arm to possess the full range or ability of a normal, naturally spawned appendage. Likewise, it possesses the same level of strength as the teenager himself, making it formiddable for taijutsu-based combat, or just overwhelming an opponent due to the ability to multi-task.

After taking a quick breather, Sanoke resumes with the task. Thankfully, there are no handsigns needed in the endeavor, allowing him the ability to build up a potent gathering of chakra just using his focus alone. From this focus, he's repeating the same sequence, again spawning a set of appendages via the Asura path, all intent on making his overall ability one that's not meant to be trifled with. 

However. . . It's found that forming another set while two extra arms were already spawned as a tall-task. He struggles far more than normal, but eventually those lumps grow beyond the normal size and grant him with more arms to work with. Exhausted, Sanoke finally takes a moment's rest.* - Tue Oct 13 15:58:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) had been sitting along the sand, using his Doton chakra to build up a psuedo-chair. Wasting no time whatsoever, he perches his bottom onto the construction, and thus giving himself room to read the latest scroll.

In recent weeks, Sanoke had gone a long way to expanding his own growing skillset. From the addiiton to taijutsu, to the discovery and refinement of his own elemental nature type -- even if it was extremely raw and unrefined. The teen had been making great progress. . . and with his recent alliance with a certain specialist, it would seem that now his genjutsu prowess were going to take a stark incline as well.

Unraveling the scroll, the chunnin's eyes perceive the information. Due to his already basic knowledge in genjutsu, the first few paragraphs are skimmed. . . It's the secondary excerpts that seem to catch his eyes, as it describes just how the jutsu work. The scroll reads. 'The jutsu is mainly meant to alter one's sense or perception of direction. This is more easily done in forested or thick areas, where a path isn't linear. Thus, if you want the jutsu to be as effective, you should seek or spawn these conditions,' the scroll read.

Looking ahead, Sanoke nodded, reading more and more juicy tidbits of information. In the end, the nature of the genjutsu was unique in that it could be layered on an area, and activated once someone came in contact with it. From there, it altered the target's sense of sight and feel, thus manipulating how they moved and how they perceived direction. A nifty technique. . . and certainly a jutsu that the scholarly Sanoke is able to pick up on with relative ease.

It was sensible for him to have talent in such. Both FUuinjutsu and Summoner also required impeccable chakra control, which he clearly excelled in to be a specialist in those two. "Easy. . .Just got to master it now .. "* - Wed Oct 14 11:42:43 2015

Another execution mission. . .

Boy, it was like they wanted to complete and utterlydestroy Sanoke's moral grid. Despite some hesistance, he eventually decides to go along with the demands. With a quick sprint, the shinobi moves a bit downward, heading right towards the village's cells. The jailing building was one that remained consistently populated-- which wasn't a surprise, given the city's nature as a previously bandit-dominated infrastructure.

Upon arriving, he pushes ahead at the steel-made doors. The structures push open, albeit with a long-winded creak, suggesting that despite Sunagakure's recent resurgence, this building in particular was old, withstanding the test of times. Indeed, there was no doubt that this was one of the few buildings that had remained standing after Sunagakure's recent destruction at the hand of the Shukaku. Most buildings were absolutely ravished, yet there existed a few that managed to stand tall to this day.

Familiarized with the location, Sanoke casually moves about, recalling one of the missions that had been completed a few weeks prior. It's where the first murder of the Shinobi's life had been committed, albeit. . . He had no other option. It was either his life, or the life of the criminal, who just so happened to be on deathrow. There existed just a smidget of guilt lingering within the summoner's soul, yet he realized that the decisions made that day could not be faulted.

Sometimes the world was just had a cruel way of working.

That settled, putting those thoughts beside him, the teen continued ahead. His body shivered due to the frigid coldness that this prison felt necesssary to have -- for reasons unknown. Along with the strange temperature, there seemed to be an equally as perplexing gale or gust of wind that manifested. The draft was chilling, and honestly made Sanoke's skin tingle. "Geez. . . If I wasn't a sane man, I'd say there was a ghost living around hear," the boy joked to himself, underneath his breath.  Each time Sanoke spoke, the air around him condensates due to the stark differences in temperature.

It doesn't take long for him to enter the main holding area. As he prances through the vicinity, various crooks give him strange looks and glances, some even yelling obscenity. --- Then that's when the true nature of the mission is revealed.

"--Did Fujitora send you!? This guy is out of control. . ! Jus' like the other criminal that's been forced onto Death Row, he isn't going down without a fight! Last night, as one of our guards, Rose, went to deliver the final meal, this punk -- Santo -- pulled a fast one, and took her captive. Beware, he has a special release, one that mixes too basic nature type. . . Suiton and Fuuton, to create the ice release blood limit!" the sergeant blurts out, eagerly informing Sanoke of the strange situation.


The boy experiences a brief mix of emotions. His fists clenched, and there's an eager gleam being worn. . . but all the same, his heart raced. This was legitimate danger, and of course legitimate excitement. "Alright. . .! No need to fear sir, I'm borderline a Jounin-calibar shinobi! I should be able to quell the threat in no time, okay?" the happy-go-lucky teen said with a confident nod. His thumb juts up, giving a brief gesture to acknowledge that he truthfully believed himself to be capable.

Racing ahead, the boy's shell is sealed away, allowing his velocity to obtained it's maximum potential in record time.  Upon reaching the end of the room, he looks ahead, eying the steel-plated, and reinforced door that was wedged into the wall. The dull, gray, yet sturdy construction seems to be sealed shut rather effectively, and is glazed in a layer of dried ice. ". . . The fuck. . . Is this actually real? Never seen a ninjutsu like this," Sanoke muttered, of course his tone still lacked any sense of urgency. Ice was ice, right? If you applied fire or explosives, it was eventually going to crumble.

And thus, this is the course of action that he subsequently takes, with no other thought even being given. His right hand blurred down, grabbing one of the nifty scrolls that were almost always perched on his 'utility' belt. Each scroll is covered with oddly shaped glyphs, all of which are filled with chakra and of course containing a ludicrously high amount of items. Where they were stored? The world may never know. . .

Upon building up or kneading his own flow of energy, it eventually speeds on out, sending endless streams of explosive mines. As they come in contact with the dried, icy surface, the mines combust, releasing their chaotic might onto the world. Fiery discharge can be seen briefly illuminating the typically  isolated room. Red and orange colors dazzle in the atmosphere, and temporarily cloud the area, making it nearly impossible for view. ". . What' a ---"

He commented with a calmed tone, figuring the job to be done. But, in a typically anime-like turn of events, just as the smoke clears, it becomes apparent that the Ice Release covered wall was unphased. Save for a few cracks, which were creating melding away. By then, the criminal, Santo, was well aware of Sanoke's approach, and honest. . . It brings him great humor.


"Hahaha! Damn. . . So the calvary has arrived?! HAH! Man. . . This is too good. . . You failed hard there, mate," Santo taunted, his lips twisted into a sinister grin, stretching from ear to ear. As a note, he was a relative tall man, and well muscled. His hair was a mix of cyan and white -- making its appearance resemble snow, albeit snow that had been struck with cyan dye. There were feminine screams as the woman being held captived pleaded for mercy, and begged for help, though each sound is muffled due to being gagged. This made it even more surprising that her voice could get so loud.

"Keep tryin' to get in, though! Keep it up. . .Make my day, before I go to slit her god damn throat! " the rogue threatens. "-- I -- Nah. . . That'd be too easy. In fact, I thought I'll just force her into a state of hypothermia. I'm going to drain every joule of heat in her body. . .	I remember when I did it to the last lady. Y'know, being frozen alive tends to make your cells morph in the strangest ways. . . But the most enjoyable part is watching the seizures or shivering that's induced as their body has their liveliness stripped from their soul. Hahah. . ." 

And it's clear that the criminal wasn't making any bluff. This guy was on Death Row, after all. The question remained. . . Why not just kill the chick and be done with it? Then it donned Sanoke, the entire point would be to have leverage in order to make for an escape.

After much deliberation, Sanoke makes one last call in hopes to pacify all of the animosity. He wouldn't be able to live within himself if unable to at least -try- to save the damsel in distress. Thus, the teen chatters along with the criminal for several minutes before eventually reaching a compromise that they both could be happy with.

The ice along the floors and the walls begin to recede, and with the recession the door is cracked open. Santo remains at a distance, with his damsel still firmly held in bondage, the bottom of her foot being encased in ice. ". . .Alright. I'll let her go -- but first. . I want you to be felt captive. Capeesh?" -- Without even waiting for an answer, Santo's techniques are put into action. Forming a single seal, tendrils of flexible ice move, wrapping around Sanoke's arms and legs, releasing a chilling temperature that made movement more difficult and left his body in extreme discomfort.

It was much like his wirebind ability, except far more swift and even more potent. The frigid cold makes it hard for Sanoke to struggle. "Alright. . . Alright! Now let her go. . .!" Sanoke demands with a fierce glare.

"Nah. . . I don't think so. Y'see. . .Two hostages are better than one, y'know?" Santo muttered with a devious grin, while pulling one of the most bone-headed, villanous trope. In all of his confidence, his back had been given to Sanoke -- After all, bond by the ice release technique, where was no way in hell that the young summoner would ever escape, no? Sadly, the criminal had yet to account for the boy's doujutsu.

The first path activates, granting him the ability to use the power of Asura. From this, Sanoke's shoulder and torso convulses, immediately giving life to entirely new appendages. Discreetly, they're going behind his back, while weaving though a set of seals. On the final, a summoning is produced, well away. Without even being needed to be given instructions, the Turtle Summoning begins to spin, rushing swift en route to Santo.

On collision, the Ice Releaser user is sent spiralling into the wall, the impact enough to force cracks to be spawned along the frame. "-- Ganba! Good, go get the woman! Get her to safety, I'll deal with threat here. . .!"

Of course, there still existed one problem, even as the extra appendages come to the rescue. Sanoke is still bond and thus his mobility is limited. After some arguing, the turtle summon follows the command, escorting the Damsel out of the rooom, justas Santo is recovering -- and boy is he pissed. Sadly, the future Turtle Hermit had no intent on letting the Ice Releaser user regain composure.

Seven seals are quickly woven through, just as Santo is rushing ahead. The brute's hand is cladded with formed ice crystals, which take the shape of a lance -- it's extended, and rushing ahead, clearly due to Santo's cognitive commands. And just as that destructive attack is closing in, the rocks underneath their feet gain life. Dozens of large-ish spheres richochet from the floor and strike at the rogue's face and chest, making his aim compromise. Couple that and Sanoke's persistant squirming, and the boy is just narrowly able to avoid a fatal blow.

For the next ten minutes or so, the duo continued their battle. Somewhere along the line, Sanoke manages to break free of the constraints, due to using explosion tags while Santo is kept at bay. Nevertheless, towards the end, he's covered in bruises and burns -- with the person on Death Row left to be dealt with by the authorities. It's needless to say. . . the execution goes on without a hitch.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Without a word, Sanoke takes off, his body breaking off into yet another streak. For the untrained eye, it was like the dude was teleporting, as his speed rivaled those that utilized even the almighty Shunshin.

Of course, it was still plausible to track his movementsb ased on the dust clouds that would be kicked up where ever he ran. Using his Suimen ability, the male eventually treks up the wall, and flees to the west. The strides are long, yet swift, allowing him to cover a lot of ground as Tetsumi presumably matches this rate of velocity by simply flying.

Once an adequate distance is reached, Sanoke comes to a screeching stop, his feet kicking up another mass of dust, this time in a more concentrated fashion. Deep foot prints are left along the ground, and with a grin, Sanoke turns to face the Sand Manipulator himself. "Alright. . . Let's do this like brutus. Remember, this is going to be deep meditation, so that you can go into your subconscious and more or less 'sleep.' I'll guide ya through it. . .and if I ain't enough,I'll bring out my master," the teenager notes.

With that, he descends onto the ground, allowing his legs to cross over one another, entering a meditative stance. Already, his chakra is bubbling, and gaining some momentum on the inside as it prepares for Sanoke's daily spiritual training. Of course, his eyes remain open, looking right ahead onto Jiki.

"Also. What were you saying before Fuji cut us off?"* - Wed Oct 14 18:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||By now, Sanoke's meditative stance had been fully achieved. His chakra fluxuated gently, while still remaining perfectly within his interior. On occasions, the energy swirled violently as well, only to calm -- Making it quite similar to an oceanic current, one that was dictated by the gravitation pull of the moon. Both eyes were closed, but strangely. . . the boy remained very much aware of the ongoing nature that occured in the 'real world.' In this state, the boy could practically enter his subconscious, and view his 'true' self.

It was a wonder, how could someone as lackadasical and childish as Sanoke be this enlightened. And that answer was simple -- the reptilians that he used as a crutch taught him these philosophies. 

"I'll give ya a quick excerpt. Master Genbi told me long ago that anyone that every depended on physical might, or natural raw power would always fall in the end. He noted this. . 'While it is important to have a powerful body. A powerful body is useless if your mind is weak. It is true, the turtles of Kame Cove pride themselves on possessing rigid, unrelenting or unwielding bodies. . . Yet, your mind must also be sturdy, stubborn. .. and unwilling to be subdued.' You get it? Will power is an important part of overcoming your fears. . " Sanoke lectures, while the chakras in his body continued to surge.

Hecould feel his soul being nurtured by the constant movement of his energy -- which was based on chakra control. Each second spent doing so granted much needed experience, and of course aided in building up 'muscle memory' in that aspect -- as I've noted several times in the past. After all, that was one of the main way to gain more powerful chakras, via experience.

"Anywho. . . That said. Copy my stance, and go into a meditative stance -- and I mean a deep one. One that's damn near sleep. . .focus on your spiritual energy, seep into your own mind's consciousness, and see yourself for what you are. If you can go into your subconscious, you can find out why you -really- are afraid of those nightmares. Since there's always a reason for fear -- it isn't as if we -choose- to be afraid. Believe me, I can relate. Don't let my suave attitude fool ya. . .I have my own fears."* - Wed Oct 14 19:09:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) ||Through this all, Sanoke had remained in the same position as always. His soul had reached absolute equilibrium, at a constant state of peace -- or control. This was the philosophy instilled into all that ever dreamed to gain significance while as a henchman of the Turtle Oasis. To be in control of your emotions, and to never have your will defeated by your own mortality.

Even as Sanoke had no actual idea that a monstrosity lingered within Tetsumi's body, the scent of malice and angst coursed through the air. It was spine-tingling, and forced the boy to shake or shiver, even in the heated airs of the desolated deserts. Seconds crept up, allowing the Turtle Summoner to remain in his stationary position, unmoving for several minutes, perhaps even twenty. ". . .I'll leave him to his devices for now. . . This is a journey that I can guide him in -- just as my master had done for me. But in the end, I don't control anyone's will. . . That goes against the very concept. It is you, Tetsumi. . ." he muttered to himself, within his mind, monolouging.

His breathing grew a bit more heavy, as the killing intent from the Shukaku practically manifested into the real world. In no way could this be sensed. . . But there was this strange feeling in the back of the male's head -- something sinister was afoot. The wind swayed omniously to add to the drama, forcing grains of sand to pile up ontop of one another. It continued to blow, as if being mother nature's call to Sanoke, a warning even-- to never trifle with power that was beyond his own comprehension. Regardless. . . the boy's thoughts continue, and his heart remained set on getting the youngster to face his demons.

"You are the only one that can control you. This is where your personality, or your resolve will be shown," the teen continued silently, still having chakra kneads. Sweat boiled around his forehead, not due to the agitating heat, but rather the mental exhaustion that came with his task. With each passing second, Sanoke's chakra was growing far more potent and far more powerful -- But in the end, the time had run it's course. It was funny, despite the boy's consistent training, he had yet to master the training style. A true discipline could stay in a completely motionless position for hours at a time.

Eyes flicked open, the boy is able to more thoroughly observe Tetsumi as he underwent the internal struggle. With his doujutsu, it's quite easy to keep tabs on the Jinchuuriki's fluxuating chakra. . . and while it had taken no immediate inclines or spikes, it was easy to see the chakra quivering, growing more restless by the second. 

"Mm. . .You told me abit about yourself. About how you've lost many of your cormades. . . Your shinobi. Tell me, are you so easy to forget the definition of shinobi? To endure. Just as they have . .. So must you. In fact, it's selfish for you to shoulder all the grief, as they would want you to grow from this. No harden your heart, and become a bitter old man," he says, hoping to push Tetsumi within the right directions.

"There are two types of energies in this world. . . positive and negative. It' up to you decide if the negative emotions in you will overpower the positive. Don't be so selfish as to blame all of the hardships on yourself. It wasn't within your power to prevent the tragedies, thus it isn't your fault."* - Wed Oct 14 20:43:44 2015

He continued to look ahead.

There was no intent on stopping this at all, this was good for Tetsumi's training.* - Wed Oct 14 20:44:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) silently, Sanoke kept watching over the boy as he went over the internal struggle.

"I can smell it. . Nevermind the 'fear'. . . He's still struggling with himself. The grief, this has to be overcome first," the boy muttered to himself. It was an amusing sight, someone so childish all of a sudden having guru-like knowledge or insight.

Given enough time, it seemed Tetsumo would have made it out okay, with the boy's eyes officially opening. "Is that a smile? Good. . . I think you're on the right path. But I doubt that your fears are solved. No way you can resolve all of your issues in one session. We will do this again throughout the week, and reach the source of the problem -- if any. Then? We will conquer," the turtle-shell wearing the boy comments.

With that, he steps on up, and stretches. "Aggghhhh! My leg is half a sleep. . . I shouldn't stay with my legs crossed for so long. . My flexibility isn't that good," he notes with wobbly legs, which comedically carried his body on over to the wall. "Let's head back, though."* - Wed Oct 14 22:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) opens his mouth.

He debates on taking the lift, before waving it off. Spontaneously, his shell is summoned back onto his back. "Nonsense! This is just training! Even my body will bend to my will, ahah!" Cue Sanoke aiming to climb up the mountaintops as Tetsumi road off into the sunset.* - Wed Oct 14 22:28:41 2015
