<br><br><font color=yellow>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) || It had been a quiet day in Sunagukure. Despite the drama that occurred earlier with the priestess, her entire demeanor had changed and she seemed to have a positive attitude. After growing bored of standing around the woman would've suggested the trio do some training to hone their abilities so that they could grow stronger. 

Having faced a powerful death bringer the woman doubted her abilities and was eager to grow stronger to obtain the power to rid the world of necromancers whom she deemed to be evil. Arriving at the local training grounds where Shinobi usually came to train and spar the priestess would've noticed that it was completely empty. A smile formed upon her face at the sight of the area. 

Peering towards Bryson for a moment the priestess would part her lips speaking in a fragile tone. "After that mission that I went on I've realized that I'm not as strong as I think. I'll have to acquire more power if I plan to become the most powerful priestess that ever lived. No weapon formed against me shall prosper." The priestess stated delicately before she approached a target. She occasionally watched Shinobi toss weapons towards the target as they attempted to improve their aim. 

The woman would reach for her quiver retrieving a single arrow placing it along the string of her bow.  Closing one of her eyes the woman would attempt to fixate her gaze upon the center of the target. Focusing for a moment the woman would've conjured up her spiritual energy, causing the arrow to be imbued in a golden aura. Shooting the area the arrow would've been engulfed in her spiritual energy as it was launched towards the target. 

The arrow would've shined brilliantly as it soared through the air. A loud thud could be heard as the arrow was embedded within the wooden target. The woman would've missed the center of the target by a few inches. Peering towards where the arrow landed the woman would've sighed. "I really need to improve my aim." 

Fujiko thought to herself a bit disappointed that her aim was a bit off. The woman was capable of fighting from afar, but it wasn't always certain that her arrows would land. She knew it was important that she worked on her aim and the woman intended to do so at this very moment.* - Sat Dec 12 23:24:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) || The sounds of Avrian repeatedly extending his fist forward filled the air as he utilized his spiritual power and performed the technique that seemed to grow more powerful each time that he used it. 

Having grown up with Avrian the woman would've picked up on his ability to master things quickly and she considered him to be a prodigy due to how fast he excelled at things and how strong he became in a short manner of time. Unfortunately Fujiko wasn't as lucky as Avrian and had to work harder than most of her peers to become great. 

Despite this the woman was a hard worker and didn't mind working harder to become stronger. Peering towards the target the woman would've remained silent, pondering a few things before she proceeded with her training attempting to improve her aim and chances of her arrow landing on the intended mark. 
Retrieving another arrow from her quiver the woman would've placed along the string of her bow before she focused her spiritual energy encompassing her arrow with her spiritual energy. Shooting the arrow towards the target the arrow would've been enveloped in a golden hue before it was embedded in the target. 

This time, however the woman would've managed to hit the center of the target. "Bullseye" the priestess thought to herself after her arrow landed on the intended mark. Her aim seemed to have improved significantly during her years of being a priestess. She recalled a time where she never hit her marks now she was becoming more frequent with her arrows hitting the intended mark.* - Sun Dec 13 00:26:24 2015
