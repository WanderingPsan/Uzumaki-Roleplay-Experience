<br><br><font color=teal>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) says: I'll find somewhere to go. - Sun Dec  6 23:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) would've travelled a considerable distance from Kirigakure all the way to Sunagakure. The young priestess had managed to find her way to the village hidden in the sand after abruptly being kicked out of the village by the Mizukage. The woman was completely fatigued after traveling the desert especially in the blazing heat. 

Upon arriving at the gate she would've noticed a numerous amount of guards guarding the gate. She wasn't quite sure if she was allowed in and no Shinobi seemed to be present at the moment. Then an idea came to mind. Reaching for her bow the woman would retrieve an arrow before she retracted the string of her bow and generated a stream of energy upon the bow. 

In a matter of seconds the arrow would've been shrouded with light. Shooting the arrow within the air a crescent light could be seen enveloping the arrow as her spiritual power surged through the air as she attempted to garner the attention of the Shinobi of Sunagakure by displaying her power. Despite her age the young priestess possessed a considerable measure of spiritual power and planned on developing her spiritual abilities as she grew older and became a beautiful priestess.* - Mon Dec  7 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) peered towards the individual as he arrived at the gates. Naturally the priestess would've looked him up and down, noticing the bible and the traditional clothing that he adorned. Instinctively the young priestess would've contorted her body bowing before the individual before she addressed him in a delicate tone. 
"Greetings pleasure to make your acquaintance I'm Watanabe, Fujiko a priestess sir. Unfortunately the leader of Kirigakure decided to kick me out of the village because she was tired of my presence. I have no where to go so I was wondering if I would be able to stay here until my knight came for me?" Fujiko inquired peering towards the individual waiting for a response. She wasn't quite sure if he was going to allow her into the village, but she was desperate and lacked a place to stay.* - Mon Dec  7 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: Is that woman the source? - Mon Dec  7 03:26:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) peered towards Bryson before she placed her bow upon her back as she approached the gentleman. Then suddenly a gentleman along with a few other individuals would've arrived at the scene. Gazing towards Sanoke she would've taken a notice of his fancy clothing and assumed that he was the leader of the village. Addressing that individual she would speak in a fragile tone it would be clear that the woman was apprehensive and wasn't a threat. 

"Salutations sir, I'm going to assume by your fancy clothing that you're the leader of this village. I'm a miko and I hail from the village hidden mist. Unfortunately, after I completed my training to become a priestess and returned the previous Mizukage had passed away. The current Mizukage then proceeded to kick me out of the village because she didn't like my presence for whatever reason. So I travelled here because I've no where to go. I can assure you if you allow me to stay within your village I will work for you and slay any demons or demonic entity that you may have here until my knight arrives." 

The priestess stated pleading to be allowed within the village. Her body was consumed with sweat and it would be evident that she had a rough day.* - Mon Dec  7 03:38:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) glanced towards Momura as she approached her. Instinctively the woman would've bowed before her before she accepted the watermelon. "Thank you for your act of kindness lass. I really appreciate it I've had such a horrible day but It makes me happy that a complete stranger would show me kindness." The priestess stated before she peered over towards Izanami addressing her. "What it is dear?" The Miko inquired gazing over towards the child.* - Mon Dec  7 03:43:08 2015
