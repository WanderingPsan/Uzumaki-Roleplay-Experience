A woman inquired peering towards the priestess who seemed to be troubled by something. Peering towards the woman Fujiko would part her lips responding to the woman's inquiry. "If you'll excuse me miss I must tend to something rather important." The priestess stated before she bowed towards the woman before she strolled off heading towards the direction of the gates. 

Heading towards the gate the woman would've spotted a caravan that had arrived at the village gates. Her gaze was fixated upon the caravan and the minute Avrian stepped out of the caravan to reveal himself a grin would've formed upon the woman's face. Approaching the guards and Avrian the woman would've spoke in a delicate tone. 

"I knew it was your spiritual energy that I sensed. It's taken you quite a while to find me Avrian. So much wasted time that we cannot get back, however, I'm glad that you've finally come now we can continue on our quest to vanquish evil and purify the corrupted souls of those who choose to abuse their powers and use them for evil."  Fujiko said peering towards her companion. 

He would've likely notice the change in the woman's physical features she had blossomed into a beautiful priestess. Her long Raven hair would've cascaded down her back and she adorned her traditional attire. The garments would've clung to her frame and she would've developed a womanly shape. The priestess of course would've noticed the physical changes that Avrian had gone through since the two of them had parted.* - Fri Dec 11 12:00:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: Hm so thats him? - Fri Dec 11 12:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) Would've called off the guards who guarding the gates of Sunagakure and protected the village from any potential threats that dared to harm the village. The guards naturally would've heeded the woman's commands due to her being a current resident of the village. 

Approaching Avrian her gaze would've been fixated upon on as he kneeled before and explained why he hadn't been with her at all times. Listening intently Fujiko would nod her head before she bowed before her knight as a sign of respect. Parting her lips the woman would speak. 

"You are forgiven my knight.  I knew you would come for me sooner or later and I knew that it must have been out of control. You've been loyal   to me and have shown me nothing but compassion. All is forgiven and I am honored to work alongside you once more. Please come in we must catch up and you must meet a select a few of individuals who have embraced me and treated me with nothing but respect. I've even managed to meet someone who was trained and raised at the Tenryuujotei temple." 

Fujiko stated, speaking about Bryson and a few other individuals whom she had become acquainted with during her stay at Sunagukure. Assuming that he would've risen to his feet and approached her to enter the village Fujiko would've embraced him tightly. It was evident that the woman harbored feelings for the individual who she deemed as her knight.Pivoting on her heel the woman would've turned around seeing that Bryson had arrived at the gates. She would've assumed that he had sensed Avrians spiritual energy and came to the gate out of curiosity.* - Fri Dec 11 12:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) || The sound of Bryson's deep voice resonated throughout the area as he spoke. A smile formed upon the woman's face as she peered towards the cleric who had arrived just in time for her to introduce him to Avrian.  Responding to Avrian's inquiry the woman would've spoke, lowering her voice so that it wasn't very audible. 

"This village has been kind to me for the most part.  Everyone that I've come across seems to be kind hearted and doesn't seem to harbor any evil intentions. I will say that I've come across a necromancer and a woman who seems to possess demonic energy but we can discuss that a bit later on." Fujiko stated before she bowed before Bryson. 

Tilting her body back into its original position the woman would've spoke to the cleric. "Indeed, this is Avrian the knight that I've told you all about. " Fujiko stated peering towards Bryson before addressed Avrian next. "Avrian this is Bryson, he grew up in the temple and has taken me during my stay here in the village. He is very kind hearted and I'm sure you two will get along great." Fujiko expressed introducing the two to each other for the first time. She would then become silent allowing the two to engage in conversation.* - Fri Dec 11 12:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***KazeKage**(Akainu_Hellhound) says: this is hard cuz raikage was here - Fri Dec 11 13:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) would've remained silent allowing the two men to speak to each other after being introduced to one another. Fujiko would've listened intently to the commentary as both of them spoke and seemed to have an understanding despite not knowing each other for quite some time. 

A smile formed upon her lips at the sight of Bryson and Avrian getting to know each other. Parting her lips Fujiko would speak to Bryson. "See you later, Bryson we will speak later, maybe we can go out to eat or something."' Fujiko expressed bidding the cleric a farewell as she watched her leave the area. 
Then her gaze would've been diverted towards Koji, who adorned the attire of that of a Kage. Bowing before the Hokuma before she addressed him the beautiful priestess would speak. "Greetings, I am a current resident of this village. The previous Kazekage granted me permission to live here after being kicked out of Kirigakure by Kana. Will you allow my knight to take harvest in this village as well? I can assure you that we will not cause any trouble should you allow him to." 

Fujiko stated peering towards Koji looking him directly into his lavender shaded optics. They were quite beautiful and shined beautifully as the sunlight beamed down upon them.* - Fri Dec 11 13:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) was astounded that the Kazekage would've allowed her to remain within the village of Sunagakure and would've granted her knight permission to stay as well. Fujiko would've bowed before him once before she expressed her gratitude. 

"Thank you you're very kind, unlike the current Mizukage of Kirigakure. I'm not entirely certain why she is the way she, however, I hope she overcomes it and I hope there are more people in this world like you sir. Thank you I am truly grateful." Fujiko stated expressing her gratitude in a joyous tone. She would've approached the gates of Sunagakure stepping further into her temporary home, assuming that Avrian would follow her. 

The jewel that would've been upon her neck would've illuminated shining brilliantly as she stepped forwards into the village. She would've answered Avrian's inquiry shortly after lowering her voice, of course, as the two of them spoke to one another. "Mhmm. He is the leader and is a Shinobi. According to Bryson, he is a part of a noble family and they seem to be good people. They each have beautiful lavender eyes. That's how I identity them." Fujiko whispered in a low tone peering towards Kuro and Koji as she spoke .* - Fri Dec 11 13:32:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) || As the conversation between the priestess and the monk continued she was growing quite frustrated with him trying to pry her away from her destiny. At a very early age the woman had known that it was her destiny to battle necromancers and stop them from stealing the souls of the innocent. 

Strolling off towards the gates of the Sunagakure the woman would've assumed that Avrian would've followed her to the gates so that the two of them could depart and locate the necromancers that were wreaking havoc upon the innocent. Once Avrian had arrived at the gates the priestess would've addressed her parting her lips to speak to him. 

"He doesn't quite understand that this is our calling. I understand and respect his beliefs, but he needs to do same regarding our beliefs. This is my calling and I've known for a very long time that this is what I was born to do. There is a reason that I have this power.. This gift. I don't like killing people, but when a necromancer begins to steal the soul of innocent people, that's when someone has to draw the line and that person is always going to me."  The priestess stated in a serious tone. 

It would've been evident that she had taken her duty as a priestess seriously and was dedicated to fulfilling her duty. Closing her eyes for a moment the woman would've intended on sensing the demonic energy of the necromancer that seemed to be attacking in a nearby area. 

Sensing the presence and the energy of this necromancer, she would've peered towards Avrian pointing him in the direction. With her bow attached to her figure the woman would stroll off in the direction prepared to conjure up her spiritual powers should she need to.* - Fri Dec 11 14:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) || Time seemed to go back quickly as the two of them were engaged in a rather serious conversation as they travelled through Sunagakure heading towards the area where the demonic energy was. Parting her lips Fujiko would speak, responding to Avrian's kind words.

 "Right it is no longer important. For now let's work on completing the mission that has been assigned to us. We will be staying in Sungakure for a while so it's best to complete this mission and earn the respect to the Kazekage." Fujiko stated ending the conversation no longer wanting to dwell on the Kuro situation. Proceeding forward the beautiful priestess would've voyaged forward utilizing her innate ability to sense demonic energy. 

Within an hour the two of them would've arrived at the area. Fujiko naturally would've taken notice to how empty the area was and how it seemed to lack people. Parting her lips the woman would make a comment . This is definitely the place." Fujiko said before she gestured for Avrian to take the lead in order to shield her from any potential threats. 

With her hand clenched upon her weapon the woman would've strolled forwards following behind Avrian. Then suddenly a sound resonated throughout the abandoned area as a flurry of bats fluttered about. The bats would've possessed demonic energy and seemed to be a potential threat. Gazing towards Avrian as he sent a single blow towards the bat. 

His fist would've been engulfed in a golden emanation lighting up the area a bit as he struck one of the bats before a sizable explosion followed. Hearing Avrian call out for her the woman instinctively would've reached for her quiver retrieving a single arrow before she placed in on the string. The beautiful priestess would've conjured up her spiritual power and suddenly the bow would've been imbued with her spiritual power. 

The arrow would've illuminated an area as it shined brilliantly. Then the arrow would've been shot towards the pack of bats that were headed towards the priestess. A crescent light would've been emitted as the woman shot the arrow. The arrow would've voyaged towards the bat and it would've been shrouded with light. 

Once the arrow was in close enough proximity it would've pierced through the bats vanquishing them instantaneously once it came in contact with them. "Swoosh" would've been the only thing heard as the remaining parts of the deceased creatures would've fell upon the ground causing a thud to resonate throughout the area.* - Fri Dec 11 22:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) || Utilizing her spiritual powers and displaying her prowess when it came to utilizing light magic in the heat of combat Fujiko would've vanquished the creatures that dared to strike her and her knight. Peering down towards the remaining parts of the creatures for a moment the woman would've fell silent for a bit. 

She would've pondered on how well the two of them worked together and how empowered she felt when she was alongside her sword and shield which happened to be Avrian. Without hesitation, the two of them would've voyaged forwards coming across several obstacles as they proceeded to head towards the location that the demonic energy radiated from. 

As they voyaged forward the duo would've come across a few low leveled demons. Fortunately the two of them had trained together and worked best when they together, making it easier for them to destroy and vanquish the lower leveled demons. By now the two of them would've slaughtered a numerous amount of demons as they finally approached a fork in the road. 

The energy that the woman sensed would've grown stronger and was almost insufferable. She sensed the most energy coming from the center building. Parting her lips the woman would've spoke to her knight. " I sense demonic energy from all the locations, but let's head towards the center area. That is where most of the dark energy is coming from. Let's deal with that issue first, then check the others." 

Fujiko instructed naturally wanting to see who possessed such immense power. The woman had slain a numerous amount of necromancers in her day but never had she met a necromancer that had possessed this much power.* - Fri Dec 11 23:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) || Having decided to go straight towards the source where most of the energy raided from the duo would've arrived at a door that seemed to be locked. Waiting patiently as Avrian bashed the door down with his mere fist. After several seconds of being struck repeatedly the door would've finally given in and the two of them would've gained access to venture further into the building.

Entering the area after she was given the okay by Avrian she would've strolled inside the strange area, glancing around a bit for a moment taking in the area. She would've noticed an array of strange glyphs and the demonic energy that she had sensed earlier would've grown much more potent. The two of them were definitely close to reaching their destination and the source of all of the demonic energy that the priestess  had felt. 

Peering forwards she would've noticed a barrier that seemed to have been enhanced by powerful magic. What lurked behind the barrier was unknown, however the woman was going to find out. Parting her lips to speak to Avrian the woman would've spoke. "I'm certain it's a barrier of some type. I'm not sure what is lurking behind it, but we must venture inside. Refrain from striking any humans that may be possessed by any demonic energy. If we kill the person who is the source of all this they may revert back." Fujiko stated peering towards the barrier pondering on something for a moment. 

The woman had thought of something at that very moment, but she assumed that it was a topic for later and she would discuss it later with Avrian. Parting her lips, she would speak once again. "Avrian help me. I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to shatter this barrier by myself, however, I'm sure with our combined might we may be able to destroy it." Fujiko stated retrieving a bow from her quiver. 

Assuming the Avrian was going to follow up with her attack and attack the barrier with his spiritual power as well. The woman would've retracted the string on her bow shooting a single arrow towards the center of the barrier. Aiming towards its weak point with pinpoint accuracy the arrow would've been engulfed in her spiritual power as the two of them attempted to shatter the barrier with their combined might.* - Fri Dec 11 23:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) || conjuring up her spiritual power the priestess was certain that with the combined might of herself and Avrian that they could shatter the barrier . The woman still had a numerous amount of things to learn and wasn't capable of destroying the barrier at her current level. 

Shooting the arrow directly towards the center along wit Avrian's attack being added to the fray would've been enough to create an opening for the duo to enter. Entering whilst they could the woman would've observed the new area that lied behind the barrier. The place was filled with a numerous amount of people who seemed to be lifeless due to having their soul removed from their body. She couldn't help but notice the machinery that was present within the area.

 "Machinery that does the job of a necromancer?" The priestess pondered to herself before she proceeded forwards. The fear that she felt earlier seemed to have diminish now that she had voyaged further into the area. Peering towards the individual through the mirror she would've lowered her voice whispering to Avrian. "This one in particular seems to be a death bringer meaning he's skilled at close combat so be careful. I'll support you and attack from a distance. " Fujiko stated just before he sucked the soul out his next victim. 

 Her heart would've been thumping in her chest not out of fear but out of excitement. She was eager to test the strength of her and Avrian which would only increase over time. Giving Avrian the signal to make the first move she would've tapped him awaiting for him to make the first move and attempt to strike the death bringer.* - Sat Dec 12 01:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) || Fortunately enough Avrian was equipped for fighting close quarters and could likely manage to deal with the death bringer who also utilize close quarters.  Watching the scene as the two exchanged remarks back forth began to fight the woman would've positioned herself behind Avrian where she belonged. 
Watching the two individuals scuffle during the combat, she would've quickly noticed the fight had shifted on the odds of the necromancer who seemed to be winning the fight now. The sight of his blood being spilled enraged the priestess and like she had said she would've supported him. Drawing a single brow from her quiver, she would've placed it along the string of her bow. 

She would've imbued her arrow in light and launched in towards the deathbringers heart after she warned Avrian to get out of the way. The arrow would've been engulfed in a golden aura as it voyaged towards the enemy attempting to infuse light magic into him. Should her arrow land she would've hoped that it provided Avrian an opportunity to utilize his technique that seemed to become more powerful the more he used it. "Now Avrian." The woman would've called out, hoping that he would've caught on to what she wanted him to do.* - Sat Dec 12 02:04:06 2015
