<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) takes out his oriental stringed instrument. His hands were delicate as he trained upon the strings. It started off low, something that caught the notice of those in the area. Heads turn, and children also stop what they are doing and close in. "Huh." The tremblo picks up, soon it is a storm of music building, upon the last note and growing louder, it's frequency and pace increasing by the second.

It was soon made clear where Daisuke's past lay in. His family were musicians, but they were beyond poor. They made money by giving people the luxury of hearing songs. Typically they'd hang in front of shops with their pans at the ready to accept any currency that came their way. They were thankful for even the smallest scrap.

It was something that the male resented deeply. It was why in almost everything he did he worked so hard to do it perfectly. His parents were experts at their craft, and they did not die desolute, before they perished under the heel of the destruction of Kirigakure they were proud citizens who ascended their limitations. Daisuke's father's words were like an echo, always pumping into his head, always filing his thoughts, in almost everything he did... It was maddening..

'Son..They say the definition of insanity is doing something over, and over and expecting a different result... But, that's exactly what we did.. We trained our craft, and put ourselves at the mercy of our audience, we did everything we had to, and we achieved the impossible through perfection. It is why you must be perect in everything you do... Sure, you're unrefined right now, but it takes time... Soon.. You too...'* - Wed Oct 21 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: The sun no longer shines... The wind no longer flows, the water is calm, no longer bearing our woes. The world is still, it's essence gone for our midst... We do not see what is not to be seen, or hear what is not to be heard, until it's gone from our hearts without another word... *Hums* - Wed Oct 21 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) fingers were drawn in complex patterns. The basis of the song was a strong bass, followed by less imposing notes. It was a powerful sequence, and one that matched the tone of Kirigakure. Daisuke moves about the field, playing the soft melody, his eyes trained upon the smallest detail. Then it hit him, like a foot-ball player piledriving into an unguarded torso. 

<I'm home....> It was at this moment the sun eclipses. Golden light resides over the youthful faces that seemed to brighten with the tune, and direction of his music. His head lowers, his mouth opens, and he continues to sing his heart out. His soul followed the tempo of the song, it was truly a beautiful piece to behold if one enjoyed this kind of music, but it was still incomplete. There were many parts to to this piece that he hadnt yet found.

It's imperfection sullied his hands, it was an insult to play this in public, but he knew they wouldn't hear what he knew wasn't present. He knew they would all enjoy it, and truth be told so did he.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) puts all of his tool-set away to focus on more pressing matters. His left hand gradually lowering onto the the blade on his hip. He moves with purpose, and all of his horizontal swings are concise. His momentum is increasing by the second, with each slash he continuously paces himself and corrects the placement of his strikes until he is able to sustain them for long periods of time.* - Wed Oct 21 07:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) thinks: I need to retire...Bah, what am I saying.... - Wed Oct 21 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) reaches for the sheathe of his blade and extends it in a horizontal fashion. The metallic surface sweeping the vicinity, the trajectory of his blade moved with a sort of blur. Daisuke's skill was growing with time, and the final improvements were underway. Perfection was always in his mind with everything that he did. 

Every technique, every action, it all had to be done with the same flow. If it wasn't perfect, it wasn't worthy of being used in battle. This technique would finally reach perfection. He didn't miss a beat.* - Wed Oct 21 14:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) inverts his grip over the blade handle and continues to reach forward with pinpoint accuracy. There was a small delay between his shifting of positions with this technique he dubbed rising silver but that was to be expected at this stage. He continues to go through the motions, the pace increasing with each strike, it was building up to another equally powerful extension. 

"There..." Now, his pace was on a level where it would be -very- difficult to evade him if one didn't have the defensive abilities to guard him. "Shit..." He narrows both of his eyes as he takes into account his breathing which had increased rapidly, along with his heart beat. This made swordplay inaccurate because you had to account for everything.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) shifts his weight to his left leg as he recounts the countless hours he spent with his father in their shack. Poverty was something that always followed the shinobi, but his fathers words were what kept him grounded, and made him resent the world far less than he should have.

"Humans are driven by insanity. The definition of insanity is doing something over, and over and expecting a different result. But take a look at shinobi, we train and train sometimes there is no improvement... Take your typical army on the brink of destruction... The only thing that powers them to do the 'impossible' is their insanity... They fight on knowing their end is near, hoping ... That they can change the result. This prospect of a village is insane, you are insane, but I feel that is the only thing that can truly bring change... People who are driven."* - Wed Oct 21 16:45:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: I wonder how well this will work... - Wed Oct 21 16:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) unsheathes his blade and holds it with his right hand. The unearthly glow of steel casting a profound glimmer of light over the black haired teen. He'd offer a smile, and then a nod in the affirmative. The echo of his blade humming through the air sparking the bout, sparks around his form ignite as the blade is drawn across the ground, and then inverted at the last second.

He wasn't fast enough to make it to her entirely.* - Wed Oct 21 16:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) had no way to guard against her technique. Her speed was greater than his, and in all honesty he knew that she was going to one up him in that regard. Being that he was a Kenjutsu practitioner needed to be adept with everything physical and he simply hadn't had the time to do that, as a result he stumbles forward, taken-off guard by her sudden acceleration. 

The sting of blunt steel against his back angered him slightly as well, but he suspected she was holding back, and of course she was. If she truly intended to finish him, he would've been over in that moment. He turns to face her, his back still smarting from the impact to notice she was flying. 

He repositions his blade in her direction, both of his eyes narrow but he makes no move against her. 

"What....?"* - Wed Oct 21 17:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) didn't have the reflexes dodge the incoming attack, but he didn't need to. He was already on the move to attack, but instead all he found is his blade meeting hers. Sparks sheen the edges and the echo steel matting against steel resonated loudly amidst the company of Kirigakure.
"Gai-Chi."
His horizontal swing is increased due to his grip tightening around the base that was meant to disrupt her hold over the massive-blade.

"Climbing Silver...."

His stance changes shortly thereafter.
"Don't underestimate me."

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: (Well, I'm training for Samehada. But shhhhh. Thats a big secret) - Wed Oct 21 17:23:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: (yuppers, I will actually have Bijuu level chakra eventually. Serene state practically doubles chakra. Funnily enough, the most you'd normaly get to is about 9k. Chakra gene is so OP) - Wed Oct 21 17:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) Lera was smart, every part of the human body was a human. The tactic working of course, the kick lands and he is propelled backwards. <She's too fast for me to guard against.> He sighs, his stance had been broken rather easily, it would take time for him to perfect it.

What's worse, it seemed the blade took on a grotesque transformation. <Her strength is monstrous...> 

He almost thought she caused a depression in his chest cavity, and he drops to his knees. "*Cough"*
<I'm so pathetic, ungraceful... I've trained so hard for this moment.. I will not be upstaged...> 

He was stunned for the moment.* - Wed Oct 21 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) whispers: It is I wish I had it) - Wed Oct 21 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) whispers: Even though I dont use nin) - Wed Oct 21 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) <I will... Not be upstaged...> Daisuke was ignorant of the change, aside from the darkening of her skin color. He suspected she was preparing to make her next move, and so would he. <Father...> He could only imagine the stern look he was giving to him from the heavens. He grasps ahold the sheathe of his blade and launches it towards Lera's face, the speeding bullet did not have nearly enough power to phase her but this was simply a distraction.

His body accelerates despite the pain, the edges of his lips running over with a vivid crimson. His blade inverts, the underhanded grip allowing him to ascend his swordswing into a vertical slash on the opposite side of where he threw his midnight black sheathe.

Of course there was the displacement of wind with his movements which was a testament to his dexterity.* - Wed Oct 21 17:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) <What!? Impossible!?....> The steel strained against her hardened like a dermis. Steel groaning in dismay, it failed against her, and as a result Daisuke had failed his blade. But in all honesty he found her strength inhuman, how was he suppose to handle this monster who was able to deflect his attacks like nothing.. 

<No think....> He took a hard look at her, and saw the change that took place on her skin. He also noted that before she guarded against his attack, but this time she decided to take it head on. 

<What is that?> He had no idea, but he assumed whatever it was he stood no chance. That was the gap in their strength, he could see the gaping chasm stretching for miles. 

<I'm disgraceul..... But...> He quickly whirls the base of the blade against the blut side, using the temper line as a means to parry-slightly, enough so that he could negate the attack and dash backwards with only a modicum of his pride left, if she even allowed him to do that.
<I will obtain perfection.... I swear it.... I will be flawless... I will have no equal...> 
His gaze darkens, he remains entirely still he knew this was going to end up with him on the ground.* - Wed Oct 21 17:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) drifts onto his right knee. He is panting softly, he wanted to clutch his chest but his pride disallowed him the luxury, besides he knew the instinct he had to clutch at his skin would do little to end the pain building in his chest. He crawls over to his missing scabbard and resheathes his blade.* - Wed Oct 21 17:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Keep practicing and ask Violet for training, she's the best swordsman in this village. - Wed Oct 21 17:50:56 2015

"It's not so easy..."* - Wed Oct 21 18:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) notices her handwraps drop to the floor, his jaw drops as he see's the damaged hands come into view. She had been training hard, harder than he had done. Ironically, the callouses on his hands did not come from Kenjutsu or hard larbor at all, but it just showed him how much she was trying to improve herself. He had scars sure, but nothing on the level she had.

"Yeah, but I feel like I'm stuck living the life I think my father would've wanted... Did I ever tell you I am a musician?" Lera's words hit home, but he still felt like he owed it to them to finish what he had started.* - Wed Oct 21 19:01:45 2015

He mutters lowly, this is where his nativity started to show, he still had a lot more to learn. His eyes pan to the floor, it was obvious her previous statement made him uncomfortable.* - Wed Oct 21 19:08:35 2015

It was time for him to do something that he disliked doing the most, handling the deceased. Sure, they were just animals but dead animals were still disgusting. He glances at Kana and tries to conceal a smile.

<She doesn't seem to be a fan either.>

<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) thinks: Three others around the area. - Wed Oct 21 21:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) reaches for the nearest spade and begins to fill the hole Kirie commanded him to fix. This was a mundane chore that required precise timing, Daisuke's muscles had trouble adjusting to the heavy sediment but he works gradually to unearth a modicum of dirt. While all of this is taking place the sheathe of his Katana is hanging limply by his waist.

<Fuck this shit..>
He continues to descend, the spade breaking fragments of rock. His pace continues, his arms struggle to support this action which was growing more annoying by the second but he had to get this done for the sake of the mission. 
<Man...>

There was nothing but silence for the time being. Daisuke had the task of working with the spade like a former enemy. He wondered if the Mizukage got off of ordering them to do arduous labor. Sure, they said it built character but he didn't believe any of that shit. If anything it helped build his stamina reserves. 
His frustation was building and he was on the brink of just quitting the task at hand but he knew better.

Kirie was a literal beast, and he did everything he was commanded in order to secure his fate. The process took several hours, but when he was done he looked at the giant chasm that he swore started from one end, and ended on the other side. Beads of sweat coat the edges of his brows, it was all in all a good day's work. 

"Think I'm done with this."* - Wed Oct 21 22:00:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) pretty much decided that he was going to bury this damn dog today. Kirie had made a point that this needed to be done today or there would be consequences. There was a part of him that agreed with this, but he didn't enjoy dealing with decayed animal matter. The dogs eyes were blackened, and it's head was bashed in indicating blunt trauma. He had already dug the first hole, but now he needed to size the dog up to make sure that all of his calculations were correct. The next step was a difficult one indeed.

He had to touch the corpse, using his powerful arms to lift the beast upwards, and then toss it into the grave like a bag of bones that it was. Flies buzzed violently over-head and he knew the smell of decay would soon fill his nostrils. <This is utterly putrid...> 


Now he grabs the nearest spade and covers the dog with dirt. This process was a tedious one but once he was all* - Wed Oct 21 23:25:26 2015

They were afraid because they were able to sense danger. None of them really were on the offensive, they simply accepted their fate.

Daisuke unsheathed his blade ready to rend their insides. "No.." He resheathes his blade, and relocates the dogs into a different prefecture where he fed them and sent them on their way. He had orders to kill the dogs, but his weakness for animals was immense.

"I hear the birds chirp mildly. The sun hot upon my skin, the wind like pins and needles. It carries a story, one of loss, but one of calm. I don't know why I have never found a place to fall. I am home, but I am not at peace. I feel the pulse, but I am missing the beat."
