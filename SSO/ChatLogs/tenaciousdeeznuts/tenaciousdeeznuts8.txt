<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) ||The thing to understand with Doton is that it was a fierce element. You had to be strong with the shape, and due to it's tangibility you needed to make sure you used the precise amount of chakra to hold its shape. Too much and it would become too brittle and shatter on impact.. Too little and it wouldn't do much of anything at all. "I see..." He rolls the scroll up and places it back into his waistband, it had only taken a few hours for him to come to a complete understanding on how the jutsu itself should be used..

Soon, a massive maw with elongated fangs tears through the skies, it's prolific body was seen streaking over the horizon. "There." It's density is hardened and concentrated to where air currents collect around its body and the surging winds cause a thunderous boom.

The Senju falls on his ass after practically using all of his chakra on the technique. "*Gasp.."* He inhales deeply barely able to recover from what he had just done.

He struggles to his feet forming a string of handseals like before, but he thought it best to start with an easier technique. He had recently read the details on how to create a minature tornado that would potentially help bolster his prowess in Katon. 

"Fuuton..." Winds begin to pick up around the duo, although the over-all strength of the jutsu was imperfect... <Maybe I should work on the other jutsu first... I don't know which yet...>* - Fri Nov  6 22:37:39 2015

The energy continues to carry the the vegetation across the ground, forcefully propelling it into the skies with enough force to rend the leaves to their stems. "Shinobi code.." He thinks back to the situation in Konohagakure.. The people whom he had grown fond of as a child were now nothing more than glorified man-slayers. Take Kurt for example, he was insane to the point that he threatened his own with being maimed if they ever made him angry. Then there was Hideyoshi, he was impulsive in his own right, even for a child, but he was alright enough. 

He turns to Revenant, a glimmer of concern in his eyes..

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) <Fire Run..> The concept with this jutsu was simple. The individual simply had to form the needed handseals and project a stream of fire across the ground until it formed a ring. The intense heat was capable of keeping someone boxed in, but then a thought occured while he continued to read. What if someone was able to add fuuton in the mix to expand the scale, and over all intensity of the flames. If this happened, it would not only keep the target caged in a small area but also increase the scope of the flames potentially melting anything it came in contact with.* - Sat Nov  7 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) tries to replicate the process all over again with minimal success. Reading from the scroll was easy enough, but then translating it into a technique was more complex. For one, you had to deal with the fact that there were going to be mistakes in how you were able to transition through the theory, and turn it into application. "Here we go." The Senjus hands nail together - the tiger seal takes shape in mere seconds. Soon a lethal stream of fire envelops the ground in a fiery rendition capable of burning someone if they got caught in the cross fire.

"Eh, still too little chakra..." He didn't know he had such a long way to go before he could consider this technique truly mastered.* - Sat Nov  7 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) <Guess I cant be lazy about this...> There was still yet more to learn from the scroll. It wasn't something that you looked at and mastered right away. You needed to time in order to fully understand a certain piece of material. This article was no exception, and because of this fact the Senju was going to attempt to start all over again.  The start of the chapter detailed the use of the handseal, the other information dealt with more of the chakra's regulation through the human body and the basics of Katon. You could never control the element itself, you had to direct it, and if you couldn't do that you were bound to hurt yourself and others.

* - Sat Nov  7 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) reads from the document yet again. The details were not really important at this point. He had the fundamentals of the technique down, the only real problem was the fact that his creations were nothing but whispers at best. It was difficult to manage his chakra properly without a decent understanding of how Katon played it's role. He had training from other elements that helped, but every element had it's feel. They reacted differently and would only work if the user had some understanding of how each element truly felt.

He was interested in Earth Dragon Bomb, he assumed it was something that could turn the tide of a battle. He devours the details inscirbed into the surface of the book, casually unlocking it's mystery for his own bidding. It detailed how to construct the handisgns needed to create a Dragon's Maw out of the ground, and then bring it to where it faced the opponent wherein several projectiles were to be unleashed in a wave of rippling debris capable of ripping skin off of bone like nothing.* - Sat Nov  7 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Why do you say that? - Sat Nov  7 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Many people only know one elemental release. - Sat Nov  7 05:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Few know two. - Sat Nov  7 05:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Very little know three. - Sat Nov  7 05:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: And then there are the rare few who know four or more. - Sat Nov  7 05:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: I see... - Sat Nov  7 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Yeah. - Sat Nov  7 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: So consider yourself lucky. - Sat Nov  7 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Hmm. - Sat Nov  7 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) read from the material that had been written down for him to learn. His prowess with Doton was something he took pride in, so something that called for bringing on a river of chakra infused mud - and then disperse it across the lands made things easier to manipulate. There was a problem in all of this however, using this technique used a lot of chakra, and he would do well to remember that the process of over exerting yourself with draining techniques was very, very dangerous. * - Sat Nov  7 16:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) scanned the scroll he had prepared for sometime. Or well, that he had been given. The contents described the process of kneading the doton infused chakra through the ground, and then turning it into a raging river of mud. With this combination they could swipe their opponent off of their feet, and quite possibly drown them if they managed to be caught flat footed. He reads through the first chapters easily enough, techniques like this always proved to be easier when reading about them then actually applying them. But it was also things like this that proved to be an acceptable challenge as well. "Might as well try it now..." He scoff's before throwing the piece of parchment away like nothing.* - Sat Nov  7 16:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) had another topic that he had to start off with. The process of manipulating the surrounding Earth, and then using it as a means to entrap an opponent in Earth had it's uses. Furthermore, through the introduction of his chakra he was able to extend even more energy into the skies - it opens an even bigger chasm, claws of chakra infused rock matter collapse and crush the target if they manage to find themselves in the middle. 

It was a really good technique all things considered. So now came the process of application. The male rotates through the first set of hand-seals and attempts to tether his chakra across the ground. The first bit ended in failure because he lacked the ability to transition jutsu's into another set. <Okay...> He attempts to process yet again, the first set of handseals had been woven, now began the process of trying to uplift the ground upon itself which ended in failure once more.* - Sat Nov  7 16:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) reads the text from the scroll in his possession. Currently he was having trouble understanding just -how- much chakra one would be expected to funnel inside of this technique. Due to the nature of this advanced topic it took several hours for him to truly feel confident attempting this jutsu, even still given his last bout with Earth and Stone Dragon which left him incapcitated he felt as if this would be his chance to prove himself. So, with that he crafts his first set of handseals and forces the ground to rise.

The starting stages of trying to transition through this jutsu was difficult. But the male is able to endure long enough to stretch the lag formation upon itself, and then collapse it from within sundering anything that was caught in the cross-fire. It was a truly formidable technique.* - Sat Nov  7 16:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) continued to scan the contents of the scroll. The complex nature of Earthen Corridor made it to where he had to make sure that he followed the directions carefully. The perfect balance would be needed in order to do this properly. Through the manifestation of handseals the user is able to cause the ground to rise on adjacent slabs, once this is done he topples it upon itself. It was the same thing the Senju wished to emulate, and with this being the only thing he could do he attempts to do it. * - Sat Nov  7 16:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) thought it best to kick start this transition into another round of training. Reading from the expansive collection he had at his side; the male begins charting off with several techniques hopefully unlocking the secrets from within. He is reminded why he does what he does with every bit of information he began to collect. He needed to be alive to see the next idiot try to usher the world into a new age. Everyone was trying to do that, and everyone failed. This was a condition known as hero syndrome he had seen so many fallen victim to.* - Sat Nov  7 17:17:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah, not much to do besides training as stuff. - Sat Nov  7 17:38:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) removes the boneplate from his jaw-line and unhinges a scroll he has at his side. The prospect of controlling the surrounding Earth was a complex one, if you had a trivial understanding, but Aden was different. The properties of the soil, and the proper amount of Chakra that should go into it's manifestation was something that he was starting to have mastery for. 

He begins to dissect the bits of information he needed and the rest was practically useless to him. His growing understanding of the technique was increasing, he even finished the handseals needed to do so. When he was done with this he slides the scroll into his waistband before turning to the crimson haired boy. 

He would notice that the smell of mahogony was strong on his body. 
"You should do more besides train.." He mutters with his acidic tone.* - Sat Nov  7 17:42:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) inhales deeply through his nostrils. While this action takes place he goes through the process of kneading the chakra inside of his chest, and attempts to condense it. There was a buildup of chakra making its way through his maw and towards the nearest tree. These invisible projectiles bite into the timber causing fragments to explode from various positions across the field. "It's still fucked.."* - Sat Nov  7 18:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) had put a lot of effort into his fuuton techniques and he was starting to see a little pay off for his labor. Ironically he still had a lot more to go before he was confident in his abilities as a bonifide elementalist. The next technique on his list to master was a most interesting one. It was known as Divine Wind, and the user was able to spawn gusts of wind to disrupt one's footing or knock over other medium sized objects. It wasn't that strong by itself but when coupled with things like Fire-Run it made for a most powerful combination. So with this, the Senju ascends the handseal scale once more attempting to refine the chakra inside of his body to cause the conditions of violet winds to envelop across the ground.. The torrent was very powerful indeed.* - Sat Nov  7 18:34:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) ||"Sure.." The male states as his hands come together in a showing of dexterity. There wasn't many shapes he had to make in order to commence - chakra trails acros the ground, the floor rapidly pulses and soon a massive chunk of land is ripped away in an instant forming the shape of a Dragon - it's giant maw ripples forth with unbridled intensity intent on stopping just short of Kyushikis frame, no he wouldn't take his life even if it managed to get this close to him, but he certainly intended to shut him up for the rest of the day.

"Do you wish to continue, 'boy'?"
He had not missed a beat.* - Sat Nov  7 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) had bigger problems to worry about than Ziare's shadow which would end this fight as soon as it started. There wasn't anyway he could anticipate this, especially with his lack of sight. He is caught flat-footed, unable to move out of the way after having avoided the bubbles approach.. 
<What the fuck?>* - Sat Nov  7 20:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) due to the massive amounts of bubbles coming his way he acts on defense and warps the surrounding Earth to cover the mass, itself, his ability in Doton was equal to his opponents mastery in Suiton, and said attack he had done had been avoided so that is where it ended.

It could explode, but it was comprised of water fundamentally.* - Sat Nov  7 20:13:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) if his opponent was able to fancy himself around his dragon in such a manner his trap would've found itself working regardless, enough to deflect the bubbles at least. But eitherway due to it's size there was no way he was going to be seen, and the Nara's just wasn't going to be underplayed, he'd be caught regardless.* - Sat Nov  7 20:43:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) brings his hands together refining the state of the air itself. Several gusts of wind building on the edge of his fingertips.. "There.." The winds spiral out of his hand and rocket into a nearby tree. <No, no.. It's all wrong...> He starts off with channeling Doton chakra through his palms, the fuuton affinity swells within the construct hardening it's structure until it burns away- listless embers die off like nothing, and the male is left wondering what he had just done.... This wasn't the first time it happened either, he simply assumed it was a natural phenomenon.* - Sat Nov  7 22:08:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) couldn't help but look at Heiwa the way he looked at everyone else, under cold lenses.. So cold that even the child would be able to sense it - though he would also note a few things about the man that might be off-putting. For one, he had the smell of mahogony clinging off of his clothing. Secondly, it's that there seemed to be some sort of crystalline deposit underneath on his fingers. 

Despite this he seemed to be otherwise okay.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) was looked for any signs of fear lingering on the boy's visage, but he found none at all. He was like a dog fishing for a bone, or in this case a man looking for weakness. 

He could assume that he wasn't going to back down. "I see in your eyes that you're different.. Most kid's your age would be shaking in their boots, but not you.... Tell me... Why are you so fearless?" His demeanor was rapidly changing, going from cold and uncaring, to inquisitive, and interested.* - Sat Nov  7 22:31:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) frowns. The weight of the conversation was resting on the childs father. He understood why the child said what he said, and to make matters worse he was pretty sure the childs father was deceased. "I see..."

He seemed to make a mental note of the child's response.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) reaches into his waist-band and collects a regular looking scroll from his possession. It was filled with all sorts of information like how to manage your chakra properly, and how to use the technique to it's maximum potential. He had studied the material for hours but nothing clicked recently. His mind was on other things - namely his conversation with a most mysterious person..

 He was also distracted by the vanishing act the Lightning God, Zeus had done. It was fair to say without him that Konoha would be in a world of trouble. His lackey was left behind but he was just a child, and this village's face shouldn't reflect the youthfulness of it's ranks.

Children did not lead nations, men did.

So, even while he continues to read in silence hoping that the topic of nature transformation for this type of jutsu to simply click, it didn't.* - Mon Nov  9 00:54:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) forms the ram seal and attempts to filter his chakra through the soles of his feet. He attempts to concentrate all of his will into the technique, expanding the azure energy outwards. When he takes his first step the water above his feet begin to stir, and he almost loses his balance entirely. Too much chakra had been applied in this starting stage so he is sent flying violently across the tide, all in all it was a bad starting day.

The male attempts to emulate the same process and fails. Though, this time he added too little chakra and sinks into the waters below. "I'm starting to over use my chakra.." He mutters, practically struggling to over-come stumbling over his words due to the sheer cold. When he recovers he is seen doing the same process.

He leaps into the water bubbles building on his feet. The vortex calms for a while, letting the Senju regain his sense of balance. When he is able to recover he begins once more, the collection and buildup of chakra aiding the process of him hovering over the sapphire waves.


He is able to hold his standing over the water, * - Mon Nov  9 02:43:24 2015
