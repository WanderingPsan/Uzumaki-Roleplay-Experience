<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) reaches for the holster tied to his right leg. His index finger loops through the eye of the Kunai. He inverts the blade in his palm so that the bladed end was pointing in Ziare's direction. It wasn't a hostile action, he was simply making a point. 

"If I threw that at him right now aiming to rend his brains you'd jump in the way, or do some useless bullshit like that. When he comes to, he'd be unbalanced by your death, and I'd be able to snap his fucking neck." He'd readjust the projectile back into it's respective holder, and then simply turns on his heel.

"This world has no place for weaklings.. This world has no place for sentiment. We are warriors...
We are killers..
We are shinobi." 

He makes his way to the exit without saying another word.* - Thu Nov  5 08:03:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) 
brings his hands together - the shape of the seal being the bird. While he does this the Senju inhales through his nostrils.
<Fuuton....>
 "Sssst." The sound of air rushing into his wind-pipe was promptly cut short now that he begins to mold the chakra inside of his core. He releases the pent up energy through his lips - several invisible bolts of chakra spew forward slamming into the gate southbound.  <Pathetic...> He thinks to himself, while the technique was able to go through it didn't manage to hit the mountain behind the training field which meant he had alot more training to do.* - Thu Nov  5 15:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) || "Hmph." The males hands rotate while he attempts to do his best to transition to the next jutsu. "Fuuton...." He inhales deeply yet again kneading the surrounding molecules of air, and then using his chakra and nature affinity to condense it. While the mixture oscillates inside of his throat he releases the bullets in controlled bursts capable of sundering rock easily.* - Thu Nov  5 15:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) "Still not perfect." Aden was moving as quickly as he could. He forms the bird seal again entirely disappointed with his progress. Chakra swells between various nodes of his body again. "FUUTON!" The nigh invisible pellets were spinning across the training-field skewering rock like tissue paper. The sound of 
miniature explosion ringing through his air informed him that his jutsu had indeed penetrated through the otherside.

Still, it wasn't enough for him... His strength would never be enough to tackle the beast that ravaged his home. Yes, that day would be something the young Senju would never forget. Countless men, women, and children died that day because there wasn't anyone strong enough to confront the threat. The one's that were fled like cowards after it's destruction. They were weak, they were not needed in the first place.

Nor would they be missed.
It was this event that drove him to excellence. It shaped him into being what he was today, he always took note of his physique which was impressive for someone of his age. He stood at six foot five, he was taller than most, and he always wondered if he was different from others because he was destined for -something.- He didn't know what that something was but he was sure of one thing.. 

The next time someone attacked Konoha he would be ready.* - Thu Nov  5 16:08:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: That your life is nothing more than proverbial speck.. - Exactly, which means you only kill those who you feel are weaker than you. - Thu Nov  5 16:19:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) turns to the newcomer a look of skepticism.
"Eh, what's your name?" The Senju ambles a little closer to the blonde haired male/female.* - Thu Nov  5 17:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) couldn't really tell what their gender was at this point, he would assume that it was a female simply because of their feminine features. "I see.." His eyes run all over her form attempting to understand just what they were about. 

He was not subtle with his actions.
When he was done with his inspection he nods his head softly. 
"Nice to meet you, Yutori.. I am Aden."
The Senju didn't give two shits about sexual identity, he just wanted to be correct if there ever came a time if he was going to identify them by gender.

"Nice to meet you."* - Thu Nov  5 17:09:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: I didn't think so... You don't seem to have that way about you.. So, then.. What do you do for a living? - Thu Nov  5 17:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takashino, Yutori(UnknowinglyDeceptive) says: I'm a wrestler can't you tell? - Thu Nov  5 17:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) didn't really seem to be amused at all. He had no sense of humor, or at least that is what it seemed to be like on his exterior. Both of his brown eyes narrow - it was obvious he was  scrutinizing them on the inside for their answer. 

"I usually expect an answer when I ask a question.".* - Thu Nov  5 17:16:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) brusquely approaches Yutori. "The Land OF Fire.." He closes their proximity within mere seconds, the scent of of mahogony wafts off of his body. "Has been destroyed countless times... It has been stepped on, and then shitted upon by this world. It's why everyone do their part to ensure the longevity of this great nation. There is no need for people who are useless... They simply drag us down... Do you understand?" 

Perhaps just this once he drops his guard, a warm aura radiating from his frame which constrasted his indifferent one, but it was brief. 
"Find a way to be of use... Do something to make a living because everyone here is doing just that in their own way."* - Thu Nov  5 17:24:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) said what needed to be said. He ended it there, he calmly distances himself from Yutori after noticing the shift in their demeanor. Like a switch he projects the feeling of depravity, no emotion was readable and his eyes assumed their natural state of passive criticism.

"-Nothing-.. Is going on.."  He added extra emphasis to the word.* - Thu Nov  5 17:36:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) was annoyed by Nigen's comment. <Save me...? Purify?> The Senju crosses his arms over his chest, his brown eyes narrowing intently. He ambles a bit closer to the crimson haired priest, the smell of rich mahogony wafting through the air.* - Thu Nov  5 23:20:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Purging tends to have the deeper meaning that the subject being purged is a threat. Right? - Thu Nov  5 23:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Yes. - Thu Nov  5 23:25:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) hated all of the shit that was going down inside of the Land Of Wind. Sadly, however, he had no choice but to check on the status of the situation. People were always causing problems, but no-one ever wanted to fix anything. No-one ever had solutions to a problem, they simply attempted to fabfricate it...

"Trouble...." He mutters.
Once more he's forced to see what is going on.* - Thu Nov  5 23:29:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) looks to Keiji. "Shut the fuck up." Then his eyes roll to Manda, the giant beast was surely superior to him in about everyway. If Ortho was able to conjure such a strong creature to this realm there was no telling what other techniques he had under his sleeves.

<If I said it once... I said it a thousand times.... Having an open door policy never works... I can tell by how he's acting he's not even from here...>

"What are your demands, hn?" He folds his arms, chakra filling the crevices of his body. In reality he knew that there was little of anything he could do, but as long as he didn't go on a rampage he wouldn't -have- to do anything.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) glanced at Ziare as if he was wondering if he was mentally inept, but then he is reminded that he had fallen asleep during the time. "Aden.." His emotionless gaze harbored nothing but depravity.

The hollow shell that stopped at the edge of the desk pulls a dossier and throws it on the table. 

The folder was of a red haired woman, and a purple haired woman, and lastly a man with black hair.

"If you see anyone of these people avoid conversation..."* - Fri Nov  6 06:56:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) makes his way out of the building. He gives a two finger wave in the direction of Ziare's position, the Senju wasn't really disrespectful, it was that he was blunt. He found that in order to get what you wanted in this world you needed to be direct with everything that you did.

"Take care not to get blind-sided.. With the inlux of outsiders it's only a matter of when and who..." * - Fri Nov  6 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) ||They said a ninja's soul was exposed to the others by fighting. Shinobi often squared against one another to gague eachother's feelings. Why did they try to go through so much trouble to understand one another? It was simple , they wanted to maximize their combat effectiveness, but not only that...

They wanted to be able to empathize with one another by forming strong emotional bonds and connections. This is why they were comrades in arms and were expected to work as a team.

It was only to be seen as a strength.
This was shown to be true through the establishment of Konohagakure. It was like a self sustaining cog-wheel that spun when everyone did their part. When others failed to do something essential the speed of the wheel begins to decrease. Eventually it would stop entirely and cease to function.. 

Those who failed to cooperate with others were destined to fail.* - Fri Nov  6 07:57:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) notices the male out of the corner of his eye. He promptly turns and frowns.
<I should've notced him earlier...> The smell of mahogony would most likely waft off of his body. He enjoyed the aroma of timber and always made it a point to apply a scent to his form. Perhaps this was unwise in a sense of him being tracked with ease, but the male found it relaxing in battle.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) notices the special weaponry Revenant is holding. He turns to her, slightly perturbed by her intentions. "I see you obviously have the means to protect you, and possibly the skill.." He continues to look at her through the corner of his eyes; his right hand ascends to tap the edge of his chin.. Brown eyes quickly avert to the clashing assault of waves battering the shoreline. The rushing waters were very relaxing, and he suspected that the kunoichi had chose this place for a specific reason. Probably because of it's remote location. Still, he couldn't even be sure if she was a shinobi; in this day and age anyone could find oddities such as she did, but perhaps . .  .

"Hmm.. You seem to be a very well to do individual.. " He turns, both of his eyes giving a double take to her form.* - Fri Nov  6 18:48:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) found his gaze meeting her vermillion and lavender sclera. She didn't really seem to be human at all - especially with the mask obscuring her features the way it did. She seemed to be the epitome of death all wrapped in a sleek package of doom.

Even still he was able to see distinct features on her body that confirmed the gender. The curve of hips, and gentle curvature of her bodice. Of course the long alabaster hair that flowed by her shoulders. He takes a step away and looks into the stream of water looking for his reflection. "*Sigh*... Is this a good omen?"* - Fri Nov  6 19:01:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: A shinobi must value the life of others as important as his. - Fri Nov  6 19:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: A shinobi must only take life when necesarry. - Fri Nov  6 19:06:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: That is what I fear, Revenant... I don't know any shinobi's intentions in-regards to what they deem important.. My own comrades would kill most people for looking at them funny. - Fri Nov  6 19:07:44 2015

We fight and bleed alongside our fellow shinobi; we should know they would hate us for it. History is written by the victo, here I am thinking things would change. But you bring down one enemy and they find someone even worse to replace him. Locations change, the rationale, the objective. Yesterday's enemies are today's recruits. Train them to fight alonside you and pray they don't eventually decide to hate you for it, too. - Fri Nov  6 20:02:20 2015

Then someone came along who was more vile than the soul who had just departed. There was truly no sense of solace in this world; there would never be true peace until everyone decided to change. The ideology of peace was an idiotic idea in of itself because humans would always feud.
