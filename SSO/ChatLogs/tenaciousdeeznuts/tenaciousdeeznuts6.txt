<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Simply my first sword. So, I'm not interested in the money at the moment, just to see how well it works in the hands of another. - Sun Nov  1 17:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm, Well I don't really use swords but i've been thinking about buying one... - Sun Nov  1 17:47:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Try asking her to test your sword, i'm sure she wouldn't mind. - Sun Nov  1 17:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Do you know her location? - Sun Nov  1 17:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: She's usually around the mansion or the training field. - Sun Nov  1 17:49:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Well... - Sun Nov  1 19:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: I went to other villages. - Sun Nov  1 19:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Sold some Katanas. - Sun Nov  1 19:12:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Surprised you still alive. - Sun Nov  1 19:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: So, what're you going to do now? - Sun Nov  1 19:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Agreed. - Sun Nov  1 19:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: I need to search for new things....Special things. They'll make my blades amazing. - Sun Nov  1 19:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: What sorts of things are we talking about? - Sun Nov  1 19:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Motors", "Magic Nexus's", "Energy Cores" and "Energy Limiters" - Sun Nov  1 19:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Eh, that sounds strange as fuck... - Sun Nov  1 19:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: And each of them would make strange, but amazing weapons. - Sun Nov  1 19:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Well, maybe I might know where you can find energy cores... - Sun Nov  1 19:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: But. - Sun Nov  1 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: I think a bowl of ramen might refresh my memory, yeah.... - Sun Nov  1 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Wanna eat? - Sun Nov  1 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Oh? - Sun Nov  1 19:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Mhm.. - Sun Nov  1 19:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Well, I suppose why not. - Sun Nov  1 19:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Cool.. - Sun Nov  1 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Lead the way. - Sun Nov  1 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: I know the perfect place. - Sun Nov  1 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: What kind you want? - Sun Nov  1 19:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) slips into his chair as smug as ever. He rotates across the swivel point. When he was done spinning around he'd extend his right foot into the tiled floor to stop himself. "I'm not really interested in food." He catches their scent casually, something Yonbu did to most of the people he met.

Everyone had their own unique scent.
"But I guess I'll take miso-ramen."* - Sun Nov  1 19:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) slides the bowl across the counter and folds his hands. He leans forward, elbows resting firmly on the marble. "Well, let me tell you about that.. You'll want to speak to the Hokage about that... I'm sure he'll set you up nice. What did you think I actually knew the -location-?"

He smiles softly once more, taking hold of a nearby glass and drinking it's contents like nothing.* - Sun Nov  1 19:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) twists his head back a bit, his noir hair limply hangs on his shoulders - he promptly reaches for a set of chop-sticks and twirls the noddles through the broth before dropping it into his mouth. "It's savory.." 

He cuts Ryuu off mid-comment if he timed it right.
"Oh, my bad, didn't mean to cut you off.. He usually hangs around here.. Near the Mansion.. Or you might see him by the training field, don't worry about it though he's bound to show up again."* - Sun Nov  1 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: You seem to be so worried about creating this blade... Why don't you relax some? - Sun Nov  1 19:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: It's not that I'm "worried". But a craftsman's dream is to forge the best weapons. - Sun Nov  1 19:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: I'll help you with what I can, but loosen up.. I know you want to be the best, but even you gotta eat, right? - Sun Nov  1 19:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: I suppose you're right. - Sun Nov  1 19:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Heh, that's the spirit. Trust me, everything's going to work out. - Sun Nov  1 19:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Im curious.. - Sun Nov  1 19:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Hm? - Sun Nov  1 19:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Don't take offense to this but... Is it intentional you look the way you do, cause I almost thought you were a girl...  - Sun Nov  1 19:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) takes a sip of Sake.* - Sun Nov  1 19:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: No, it is not intentional. I just don't find it needed to fix myself up to look like a male. I have male genitals, and that's what makes me a male. That's good enough for me. - Sun Nov  1 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: *Laughs* I don't dispute that fact, but just because you have genitals in the form of a male, doesn't mean you share the same mindset... I guess what I'm trying to say is.. - Sun Nov  1 19:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: You gay? - Sun Nov  1 19:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: No. Looking like a female has nothing to do with my sexuality. And for the record, males who see themselves as females are called transexuals, same with females who see themselves male. - Sun Nov  1 19:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: -- - Sun Nov  1 19:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Well, like I said I was only trying to figure out something about you. - Sun Nov  1 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: It's fine. - Sun Nov  1 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) finishes the rest of his ramen before shaking his head lightly. "Thanks for the ramen, bro." He tosses the empty bowl into the ceiling, it ricochets and lands in the sink with a loud splash. 

"My bad for wasting your time too.. Yikes." 
He makes his way towards the exit, the tarps leading into the shop flutter gently, and soon Yonbu's form is gone entirely if he wasn't stopped.

"To think I was gonna slap your ass, Nyahh sike." He teases before departing with his adult Ninken who approached the shop like the sly predator he was.* - Sun Nov  1 19:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Hm? - Sun Nov  1 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Well, farewell. - Sun Nov  1 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Mhm. - Sun Nov  1 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) ||"Let's go, Kumaru.. You know the drill." "Grrnn." The fierce animal readies itself on it's paws and vaults into the air. While it's suspended into the sky it poises it's genitals upwards and splashes a trail of urine forward. It strikes with accuracy, and now Yonbu is on the move with a running start to give him momentum. Then his form is revolving at an increasingly high pace, in-fact his entire body is over-come with a sort of makeshift tornado and he cuts into the ground with so much force the ground below breaks into fragments. 

"Nice, nice... But we can do better."* - Sun Nov  1 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) was satisfied with his training up until now. His Ninken was the one who was unhappy about their progress. Two gray ears point upwards, the dog's sharp, black eyes appeared to be unamused behind them both doing nothing. 

"Grrr..." The half-breed's tone growl was low. It was something that Yonbu had to take careful attention to because he was usually bitten moments after the dog reached it's threshold of tolerance.

Yonbu dashes out of the way in time for Kumaru's charge to be missed by mere inches. *Sniff*  The indignant dog descends, it's massive haunches covering the road.

 "Cheer up, Kumaru.." 
"We'll get some training in.."

The Inuzuka waited for something to happen; it was a pity that he would most likely find nothing of worth near the Manor during this time.
"Sigh.."* - Tue Nov  3 16:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: ? - Tue Nov  3 16:49:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Me? - Tue Nov  3 17:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) let his hazel irises continue to pierce the tree's confinements. Leaves dance around her body with the shifting winds. Yonbu takes a step forward attempting to get a better look at her legs. <Smooth..> He promptly averts his gaze onto the nearby entrance leading into the manor, he hadn't even noticed that his Ninken had bit into his forearm for being so obvious about checking out her assets.

"I wonder how her ass looks like?" He mutters outloud. 
He turns to Rias thereafter. "Yeah, I was wondering about you too?" 
The dog continues to tear it's teeth into his flesh. In-fact if one looked carefully Yonbu had bite marks -everywhere-..* - Tue Nov  3 17:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Im Rias~ - Tue Nov  3 17:05:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) "Nani?" Yonbu glances at his arm and noticed blood was coming from the open wound, his Ninken still latched onto the appendage like a vice-grip.. 
"Oh, Kumaru... I hope you let go... That really hurts..~" <Now that I think about it... This shit does hurt a lot.....> The dog promptly releases it's hold.

"I'm fine... He does that a lot.." He smiles at Rias, taking the time needed to admire her bust.* - Tue Nov  3 17:19:47 2015

||Nanjuro wasn't a man of sentiment, but he was aware of one thing, and that was that he could finally be at peace. There was something the others were not aware of, and it was before this incident. 

His only love interest, whom had been Khalil had been stripped from him. They now wore the Kitano lineage, and he had to see their house everday. He was like an invisible speck, once she became a women she moved on. He blamed the Kitano members for this, and hated every last one of them, but deep down inside he was just a wounded soul.

Soon his entire body was over-come with a blanket of searing crimson. His skin began to peel off, and his Ninken was able to hear his sizzling flesh even from where it was running.  The loyal Ninken mourns it's master in solitude... 

<I love you... Shota...>
He was dying, and he knew it wouldn't be long before his entire body was broken down on a molecular level turning him into an ashen composite.
<I love you.. Kumaro...>
<I love you....Katsuo...>

The Land Of Wind kicks up a modicum of wind, uplifting the grains into the sky.. He was already dead.

The last he saw before he was oblivion was playing dice with Shota, and Khalil.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) doesn't really do much from here on out. Ziare seemed to be entranced with Yonbu's conversation, at least this is what the male thought. On the other hand he wondered why the girl he was with was as dead as the man's style. Still, despite these disadvantageous factors he assumes the bookworm would've at least shown some modicum of interest towards the strange.. But he avoids it entirely.

"What a bitch.." He mutters under his breath.* - Wed Nov  4 08:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) ||"Damn.. I could've sworn you just heard me.... But, in-case you didnt.. Let me reiterate.. I called you a bitch.. Look, I'm not trying to embarrass you in front of your squeeze, but I've given you plenty of chances to be a man, and you just fall short everytime." Yonbu's head reclines into the wall, both of his legs extending to rest on the seat adjacent from where he was sitting. 

Two hazel eyes narrow towards the cloaked female, he smiles softly.. "Try the fried pork."

<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Oh he was talking about him. You can call males, bitches? - Wed Nov  4 08:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) chuckles lightly. "You gonna fight me now? Good, it'd be a welcome change... Let's take it outside after you, and your girl finish eating.. Sides, I'm not in the mood right now, but if you swing on me, I'll swing right back." His confidence was something that Ziare would notice right away. He was in control of the conversation as long as he had Ziare angry. He would attack him now most likely, but isnt that what he wanted all along.

"Nah.." He waves him away dismissively - his eyes now resting on the girl. <Hmm...> He was silently observing her mannerisms, attempting to see if she was serious, and then trying to see if she was timid. 

<She speaks like she's whispering.. Either that's just how she is, she doesn't want to be noticed or she's embarrassed. She doesn't seem to be poor, but then again I guess you never know these days..>

"I guess the real question is do you have money to pay for it, right? I mean what-other purpose was there for looking at the menu?" He smiles again, under intelligent eyes. On the exterior he seemed to be an impulsive idiot, but he was different when it came down to him having to use his head.* - Wed Nov  4 09:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) "*Sigh*" Ziare's anger had finally reached the point where he felt he needed to act. This was something Yonbu did not want to deal with for several reasons. One, he didn't have his Ninken with the time because the dog had fallen ill recently and so it was being nursed. He took his rounds with Kumaru, attempting to have the beast recover faster than usual but it was a lost cause. 

It just didn't feel right without him. Secondly, if on the off chance Yobu did win he didn't want his comrade to hate his guts for shaming him in front of company. He didn't really care if he was beaten or not if it meant he got to fight and live to see the next day.

"Simmer down.. I'm only messing with you, Ziare." For once he made sure to pronounce his name correctly.

He refocuses his attention to Ume, now that he took a better look at her she did seem to be impoverished. But her tattered clothing was contrasted by impeccable radiance, she was beautiful on all accounts.. 

That meant very little, the male would be on his guard, always. "Continue." He inquires. He wasn't sure if he was right or wrong due to her silence.* - Wed Nov  4 09:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Hmph. - Wed Nov  4 09:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) "Yeah." Yonbu shoots in response. Perhaps Ziare was expecting a different response, but he would be met with the man's passiveness. "I guess you could say that I'm afraid you... That I need my Ninken to defeat you, sure. You can talk about that useless shit all day... Or you can swing on me, and find out... But I should warn you.. I employ a form of fighting that causes extensive collateral damage... While I don't want to hurt anyone, if you press me I might be forced to hurt -everyone-."

"If you aren't hungry then I'm not going to beg you to eat." Yonbu's hands were already sliding into the depths of his back-pouch, ready to recieve the funds needed to purchase food, but it seemed she didn't want to eat.

"Fine with."* - Wed Nov  4 09:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Ahem? - Wed Nov  4 09:23:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) glanced at Marrisa like he was wondering which hand he could use to smack her with. He didn't give a fuck about her stature, common decency was ignored by her simply stepping in and doing what she did - it was ironic in a way... Especially seeing how Yonbu was so rude towards practically everyone he met.
