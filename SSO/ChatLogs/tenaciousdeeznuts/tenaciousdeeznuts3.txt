"We were just looking for the new edition of Ecchi-Uncaged.. My friend lost it.. Didn't mean to interupt your emotion session.. But let's get out of here.. It's not like I wanted to be here in the first place."

Right?

"Sorry man.. I just realized I have to run for my life."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) approaches a set of tomb-stones with a look of sadness. It was needed to pay respects to a family that had lost what they most likely deemed everything. The loss of a loved one. He had a pair of flowers in hand, he lowers himself onto his knees and drops the set of flowers onto the grave. There was a family nearby dressed in black, a child who was followed with a lady, and an older male whom he assumed to be the grandfather.

"I'm here to pay my respects for your family member." They were silent for a good while before they spoke. Their were strained but they came together all at once to fashion a half -hearted thank you. "It's no problem. I understand more than anyone about losing someone in death."

When he had finished paying his respects he waits sometime before searching for the feline. The lady who owned the cat said it usually scurries up trees and stays there for several hours. Daisuke combed the land looking for the cat, namely in the tree-tops but when he found after an hour of searching shocked him to his core. The cat had its head cut off, and paws removed.

It seemed to be some sort of ritual, but to what? It fit the description perfectly so he collected its remains and returned the beast to it's owner. It was a morbid occasion, but a one that needed to be brought to an end. He was thanked for his work and then sent on his way.* - Thu Oct 22 19:02:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) reaches for the hilt of his blade. The flash-backs arrive in time to send him into a fit of discontent. The sweat on his brow building welling profusely. 

Like before he is able to see his father standing before him. He couldn't have been much older than thirty at this point, Daisuke himself being a child. 

Musical notes ascend from the reed his father had his finger on. Slow puffs bring on the feeling of melancholy.

It was a sad song.

The impovrished youth observed his father in rags, he was crying like always when he played a beautiful piece of music. 

'Son, if there is a lesson I want you to learn it is that in order to get anything in this world you must be great at what you do... It doesn't just stop at being great, no, I want you to be perfect... I never wanted this for us, for you to see the side of poverty... I wanted you to have the best, and I couldn't even give you a roof over your head half the time. But... What I can give you is the advice needed to make it for yourself.. Find something, and the best..."

Cobalt eyes fixate on the child the male stood adjacent of, a hand lowering to ruffle his hair.

"Don't have an equal.."

He is returned to reality, the robed male is seen reaching for his Shamisen, the stringed instrument was only one tool he used to express his emotions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxx4z64GH38

His voice follows suit, matching the tempo of the notes. His voice riding the crescendo of the song, vibrato is added giving the notes further twang.

"In the short time we have to play out our lives."
"We get swept off of our feet by the calm."
"Remaining with the memories we will always have."
"Spinning them into spirals and then they fade away."
"As for me I will sing the song of the present"
"That is all I can do, be singing and talking."
"I won't remember what happened at that time."
"But it's been engraved in my heart, so let me go."

Etc.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) looks in Violets direction. "Your child lack manners.. They reflect your personality in all matter of fact. What, you going to strike me now?" Daisuke's hand lowers onto the sheathe on his side, his eyes glistening with hatred. 

"You're all the same.. You all sicken me.."* - Thu Oct 22 22:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) ||Violet would most likely experience a strange sensation as her hand made contact with Daisuke. He didn't remove her grip from his body he let it remain. There was nothing from his mouth that indicated that he was going to make a hostile action. The Land Of Water began to trickle, he extends his left hand forth. Rain-droplets dazzle around his appendages, he could the rain clouds coming in.

It wouldn't be too long until there was 'thunder.' He smiles, in Violet's direction. He had never done so before, and he seemed to care very little about her threat. 

"You know your words remind me of someone that I knew... He spoke of wanting nothing more than peace at one time.. But.."

He pauses.

"Perhaps you've heard of him.... He was alive during the time of the first Mizukage."

He laughs.

"This entire village, perhaps you even included make him a laughing stock.. His very image becoming a bed-time story, something parents tell their children to avoid becoming."

"I don't advise touching me ever...."
"It doesn't work out well."

<Is this what you left behind, brother?>
"Don't speak as if you're a rogue like the very person you destroyed. I assume your role as squad leader is protect? You seem to be a very weak willed leader if all you can think about is killing me..."

Chakra floods his arm that had been touched, just like that.* - Thu Oct 22 23:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) ||reclines his head back as the pain shot through his body. He winces lightly, but as she let's go his body relaxes. <I do wonder what would happen to you if I killed your child in front of you? I'll have to keep that in mind..> 

He smiles as he watches them depart.* - Thu Oct 22 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) took his stance near the tree and descends on both knees. He offers his sword forward, placing it on the blades of grass. <I let my temper get the best of me.. Killing a child in front of their mother? Really? Where is this coming from?> 

His rage was almost borderline illogical, he didn't even dislike the child or their mother, but he didn't fancy them either. Violet had her own reasons to protect her family, and he understood that much, but he would do what he had to do in order to secure his life as well.

He had no intentions to harm either of them as he stated, but there was a part of his being that resented them greatly. Chakra once again builds and flame takes shape through the metallic beam, several strikes were woven deep into the flesh of the bark.

He simply stands back and admires his work.

He recounts his encounters with the male that were a secret for the longest. Of course the records of their relation would be known to Kakei, and perhaps Hassan if he cared to look, and Noriko if she was still alive.

"I do..... But... I guess that isn't here, nor there..."* - Fri Oct 23 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) ||Arata was very intelligent, and he knew it would be good to have friends like him. In all honesty Daisuke wanted nothing more than to be regarded as a loyal shinobi of Kirigakure, but his past was stained with the actions of his kin. During the moment of Akask's insurrection he wasn't even a shinobi, but word of his actions spread far.

Soon, the two weren't even seen together, and the brain injury that followed changed him entirely.

"My real surname is Yusei...." 
"This probably means nothing to you.. But if you stay in Kirigakure long enough, it will."* - Fri Oct 23 04:58:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) "Kay." Daisuke begins to tie a piece of drift wood across his leg. It was actually something that would weigh him down since everything was accounted for in the water. The flipside to this is that this piece of timber was buoyant and would keep him aflot when he got too tired. He expected that there would come a time when he would need to rest, but for now he didn't need it so with this he took his first step into the ocean. 

For now it was only ankle level, and not even enough to pose a threat. He could feel the cold waters rushing upon his skin, and looked over at his comrade. "If you feel like it's too much let me know, heh." Thus began a most tiresome adventure.* - Fri Oct 23 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) "Good.." Daisuke continued with the second step in which case his thighs were covered and now he swings his arms over the line of the tide. The swells respond by pushing him back and forth, but his body acted like an anchor for a bit. He knew better than to fight against the tide so instead he employs a different tactic and changes his position horizontally so it would be easier to maintain his exercise. 

"Urgh..." This was going to be a drag, he knew that much for certain but he wouldn't allow himself to be upstaged by the Hyuuga. If anything this should be the once place where he does well. He was endurant to most strains, but even he had to admit the pacing of this contest was a bit extreme. If anything they would be able to say they were able * - Fri Oct 23 05:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) makes his way onto dry land, it was obvious they would drown if they attempted this.* - Fri Oct 23 06:31:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Just avoid her. - Fri Oct 23 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: Right. - Fri Oct 23 06:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) "I see.." Daisuke ascends from his char with only one objective in mind, becoming stronger. There were a series of steps he had to go through in order to achieve this. One. His physicality needed to be one hundred percent, the mind was just another piece of the puzzle. He thought of a perfect exercise in order to bring his prowess with Kenjutsu under his grasp. 

There was a known legend throughout Kirigakure No Sato that if one focused hard enough they would be able to rend the side of an ants antenna off with a single sword-swipe. "Commence." His left hand brushes the hilt on his side, surrounding muscles form togehter - they tighten with every second, and soon the sharpened metal is brought into view.

The sound of metal locking into place caused the birds that flew over-head to squirm lightly. The grip tightens, the sun parses in golden rays of light. Horizontal swipes are unleashed in rapid succession, and while this is taking place his breathing is a controlled affair. 

With every continuation of offense his pace quickens in speed, and power. The general premsie being that he was building up towards another strike following the last. 

"Dai-Chi.." His stance is now brought into a full guard, blade clutched evenly with two hands, the blunt side of the blade facing forward, but keeping to the horizontal formation. Light barrels from the heavens, several flashes of light manifest in seconds and a myriad of energy travels from the elongated shaft. 
Everything went into this exercise; his lack of trust for Violet clearly expressed with every attack.

"I am misunderstood!" *Zing* The air is sundered - the only noise being the faint rustle of wind that now began to fade into obscurity. He could see the peoples eyes, they did not hold admiration for this child. Their scowls for his deceased brother pierced him. Their unscrupulous demeanor for a once proud shinobi made him sick, but not because he was just sick of them. Resentment of his brothers descension into darkness brought him into this stage of his life.

The young man did not know where his tale began; lost in the darkest of tunnels the only thing that powered him were his emotions, and convictions. This blade would see him into the future. Every perfunctory motion, every slash, every cut it all fed into his drive. He yearned to change the fate of the world with his blade alone, but he knew he would need.

"Shi..Mazu." His right hand quickly pivots, the left no longer brandishing the blade handle, the blade inverts in the air and his feet are quickly formed into a heel toe alignment. Steel against air, the subtle whisper of death glinting at everyturn.. "Raghhhhhh!" 

His blows were frenzied at this point - to the left, and to the right his blade moves. His carelessness was dangerous, but it was also a weapon, it left him sporadic, hard to predict. This was good, all of it was good.

But how useful was the body without a mind to guide it's motions. "I will have to learn..." He flips into the air, his momentum carries him backwards said foot-falls striking the top of the roof, blade in hand. * - Fri Oct 23 08:32:51 2015
