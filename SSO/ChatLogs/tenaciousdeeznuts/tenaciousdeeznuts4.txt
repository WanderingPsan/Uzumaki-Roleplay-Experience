<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) ||"Right.." His first task was showing an individual around a village, and that was something Daisuke could handle easily enough. With this in mind he finds a rather old lady who seemed to be on the verge of going senile. 'Oh, hi there young man.. You mind showing me around.?" Daisuke could tell that she was beautiful in her youth because of her long, silver hair that flowed to the small of her back. 

"Let's go.." He rushes past the foot-traffic his coat pivoting in the breeze. The smell of lilacs filled his nose from the scent her body produced. She seemed to be so serene walking by several of what he could only assume were her friends. But how was this possible, she was only visiting? He didn't really care.

"Yeah, well... This is the tea shop.. They brew all sorts of drinks here."  When he was finished with this he started on the steps of the mansion. His broom begins to clear away several leaves that had amassed on the edge.This process doesnt take long so now he best handle the other task that had been set out for him.


That is until he realized there was more to be done on the sides of the building. With this in mind he begins to sweep away at the sediment that slowly builds over-time. When he pushes the material out of the way, and clears it entirely he begins to work on the back row. Several motions with his broom clear away any other useless particles. "There..."

So for nor he revists the other lady that he had showed around and they shop for green tea. They move about the various rooms intent on finding her order. When he had gotten all of the products he needed for he be pays for her, or well he puts the cost of the drinks on his tab and they make their way out of the mansion.

Once more he clears whatever is out front of the mansion. When this was done he places the cleaning materials away for use later.* - Fri Oct 23 18:42:08 2015

It was a somewhat mundane tast to do but it was needed that is what he had to tell himself all the time.

There was a delay of several seconds between all of this however. He needed breaks because this was something that bored him, and he couldn't be expected to do a good job if he wasn't interested in what he had to do. "There.." He was finally starting to make good progress and he was finished.

The lady returned with her things and was happy.

He extends his right foot forth, left leg reclining backwards to form heel-toe alignment. 

<..>

He accelerates and extends the blade forth, two horizontal slashes were directed against the Hyuuga. 

"Daichi...."
If he didn't block he'd be struck in his head. The grip over the wooden hilt tightens as he hears that the three man team would be allowed to explore, but perhaps this was a blessing in disguise.

"Hopefully Violet falls into the darkest ditch and never surfaces again." He mutters to himself before chuckling.* - Fri Oct 23 19:50:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) was bold, he knew exactly kind of shinobi Lulu was. She was innocent, and hadn't yet faced much in the way of conflict. She also trusted him to be out here, and thank was enough in his book. 

"Think I should just get to the point." He reaches for his left hand and sets it on his crotch. "I am a man, and you are a woman... I think you know what I want from you.."

There was a glimmer of lust in his eyes as well, indicating that he was serious about this happening.* - Fri Oct 23 22:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) "..." The male was shocked she accepted so quickly, but he wasn't going to miss a beat. He reaches for the back of her head; she'd be able to feel the warmth grasp at her body. Next, his lips moved forward to take hold of hers in a strong kiss. Tongue slipping through the gaps of her mouth if she allowed it. 

He would tease her a bit now.
"You're going to have to tell me how much you want it then.."
Both of his hands take possession of her ass, he grips tightly before releasing. His lips start at her neck and move to her chest, he attempts to take the clothing off of her body and suckle her nipples.

"Come.. Tell me.."* - Fri Oct 23 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) ||"I see... Then get on your knees." He states with authoritative base to his voice. His hands press lightly on her shoulders hopefully guiding her to a position that would suit her with being able to handle his length. "Here.." He works on his zipper, and extends his twelve inch shaft against her face. Then it was moving across her lips, the pink head presses against her lips as he attempts to get her to open her mouth.

Provided she does so he presses on the back of her head as he enters her mouth indiscriminately pushing himself deeper into her throat. One could say that he was large enough to clog her windpipe so she would need to breathe through her nose, and he knew it would be sooner rather than later that her gag reflex would kick in.

"Take it as long as you can.." Each second he is applying more pressure to the insides of her mouth with his shaft.* - Fri Oct 23 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) Lulu's mouth left his body member dripping with spittle. The fluids from her body glisten vibrantly illuminating the shaft and coaxing him into a sensation that he was going to cum. "No." He fights against the urge to do so, opting to make Lulu feel him inside rather than finishing right then and there and leaving him with a bad impression.

"Now... I don't know if you're a virgin, but this is going to hurt initially either way. Lay on here back." He works on getting he clothing off of her legs and exposing her legs so that she was totally barren. With this done, he mounts his body on top of hers pressing the tip against the cleft of her vagina. He inches forward, attempting to get the first through inches through the surface of her wall. 

He extends deeper, perhaps towards the four inch mark,. If her walls didn't resist he'd strike her hymen and cause her to bleed if she was a virgin. If not, then he would continue until he hit the six inch mark, and of course she'd be able to feel every inch, every vein, every patch of skin.* - Fri Oct 23 23:04:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) unsheathes the blade from it's sheathe. It's pristine point enabled him to cut through most substances, and he couldn't help but admire it everytime he dared to look at it. "Gngh..." He swings his blade into the air attempting to disrupt it's flow of chakra across the surface of the blade. He continues with driving it while in his grip so that it was held in an inverted fashion.

"I see." He continues to weave the blade horizontally allowing for the currents to sweep across his field of vision. The sproadic motions of his attacking hand against the surrounding air were enough to confuse someone initially, but it was still imperfect.. "This is starting to grow tiresome."

The next attempt was made with him stepping forward attempting to carve the currents of air. If one happened to look directly at the blade they would no doubt be captivated by the Genjutsu's source.  "There.." He channels his chakra through its base and attempts to use it as a trigger that could potentially mislead those who did not have a defense against his technique.* - Sat Oct 24 04:03:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) glances at Mashu with both of his arms coming over his chest. "Huh?" They truly did have peace, but it was something Daisuke was subject to change. The village was on the brink of destruction, but was on it's way to being restored.

The White haired youth who's moniker had been dubbed Black focuses on the stronger. 
"You high?"* - Sat Oct 24 05:57:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) "I see." Daisuke doesn't miss a beat, his indifference would give Mashu the impression that he would never figure out if the male was serious or not. "You seem to be a bit out of the loop.. Not haggard like the butch chick known as Violet.. You should probably avoid them if you want to retain your sanity." 

He twists on his heel, left hand brushing against the hilt on his waist. "Just a fair warning to someone that seems half-way decent."* - Sat Oct 24 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) <Wow.. So he's using that trashy nickname for himself? Well, I did the same to be honest.> "Did he know?" Daisuke smiles for once giving the lad an impression of warmth where he was usually dead inside. "I think I know what he wanted me to do for you.. So come here, and we can speak for a bit... You and I have a lot in common to be honest... Very much so.."

The Swordsman reaches into his pocket and flicks a coin towards Heiwa, it seemed to be non-descript except for a few scorch marks centered around it's surface. 

It was his only possession he had of Akasks.

"Heh."* - Sat Oct 24 06:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Hold onto that. - Sat Oct 24 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: I'll tell you a story. - Sat Oct 24 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) knew better than to give the child some dry lecture that he never wanted to hear in the first place. Heiwa did inquire of a story however, which meant he was curious of the prospect of learning. With this in mind Daisuke pushes his luck further by reaching for his Shamisen.

One note is played, and then another.

Then he freezes, takes the time to smile again and plucks the strings carefully. The sound that left the instrument was hollow, but it's tempo was gradually building.

"They say the sun doesn't shine on the wicked, but it does~" 
"The story of two brothes, halved between good and evil..." 
"One wanted nothing more to live in peace.."
"But this urge led him to sin..."
"So he left his village, and tried to start over."
"He is left broken with despair."
"With no other way out he takes the dagger to his heart."
"His blood paving ceremonies for everyone."
"Save one."
"So they say the sun doesn't shine on the wicked....~" 
"But you best believe it does."
"The only thing he leaves in his presence is a single coin.."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) Explains it's design.
"
Songsteel: This sword's blade is black but it is a standard steel sword with acoustic holes bored through it's center. This allows for sound to permeate through several orifices, due to this pressurized air it can attack the senses. Namely hearing, depending on the trajectory of the swing a sound is emitted from the base which vibrates against the ear-drum if said target is within range. This causes nausea and also the disruption of ones equilibrium
