<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minabuchi Yakaze(TenaciousDeeznuts) unsheathes his blade as there was no better time to do so. He takes a step forward, his right hand pivoting through the air with blade in hand. The gentle sound of metal displacing the surrounding air was something that put Yakaze's heart at ease. The glimmer of golden light reflecting off of the temper line made him feel empowered, and the accompanying stance giving him confidence that he was skilled. 

He kept this movement going for several hours, the outside world of course meaning nothing to him for the time being. There was only his form, he didn't consider his blade to be a seperate object from his body. Rather they were two distinct parts of the larger whole, and only together could they work efficiently. 

* - Tue Oct 20 21:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minabuchi Yakaze(TenaciousDeeznuts) extends his reach horizontally, his right hand quickly inverting with said fingers supporting the base of his hilt. The lines of light that were carved in the direction of his swing gave only a glimpse of what the Minabuchi was actually capable of. His skill could be regarded above average in this regard but there was still yet to learn. The young Genin had not even mastered his bodily control let alone the blade itself.

It would no doubt take time. It was fortunate that his disposition suited him. He could work all day, and would work all day to perfect even the smallest detail. If he didn't like something he would tweak it, he would have to tweak it. Ever since he was little the smallest things made him angry if they were out of place. To the casual swordswing, to the way he ate ramen. Everything had to be perfect, some regarded this as him being compulsive, and it was seen as a weakness in his youth.

But to him? Well, it was a strength. He attempts the same action yet again. Swinging horizontally said hand craning to the right, and then it's base is turned three hundred and twenty degrees around. Said attacking hand is readjusted to it's normal position once he was finished with this attack, and returns to a full guard.* - Tue Oct 20 21:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minabuchi Yakaze(TenaciousDeeznuts) let the wind kick up into his face. His pores opening to recieve the cold, and unforgiving gale. <This enviornment is perfect...> Both of his hands firmly planted on the blade, it's offered adjacently towards the ocean. Quickly, his right hand cranes with his momentum, he is seen strafing towards the right, and then whilst it was still on it's current course he readjusts it. 

When it is returned to it's normal position he resheathes the blade into it's respective holder.* - Tue Oct 20 22:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minabuchi Yakaze(TenaciousDeeznuts) didn't show any signs of stopping now. He was convinced this way was the only way of mastering the technique at hand. Even while he did this he couldn't help but find his fathers words resurface into his mind. That being the fact that all humans were insane in some way or another. The definition of insanity was doing something over, and over and expecting different results. This is what he was doing, and the majority of Kirigakure's military for that matter.

They trained constantly, day and night and there was seemingly no change. Nothing to change the mundane process of trying to tame the forces of nature through nature transformation. No change to harnessing a blades true might, no change in jumping a little higher so one could make it to the next building. Yes, one could say they were all insane for even attempting to do so.

"There..." Yakaze cranes his attacking arm yet again, his arm shooting to the right with blinding speed, and then shifting into a three hundred and twenty degrees before replacing itself into a neutral fashion.

Beads of sweat well on his brow.. His breathing becomes an object of labor, and it is obvious he is fatigued.
But...

His fathers words echo in his mind once more.
Insanity has allowed humans to do the impossible.* - Tue Oct 20 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minabuchi Yakaze(TenaciousDeeznuts) takes hold of the blade resting on his side. The Kanji written on it's surface was imprinted of times long lost. Times when a man had just his blade and nothing else, times when peoples words actually meant something. For Yakaze, he had only taken his first step into becoming a shinobi and still found it distasteful. Not because they had to kill; it was apart of the job preserving humanity and the people who were confined to this village.

It was about the distance, they killed people from afar. Yes, ninjas did strikes form the shadows but Yakaze was different in that he fought with his blade, up close and personal. He had no need for secrecy, he was his own weapon, and because of this it made him different.

Even now as he claws through the air with tempered metal in his hands, all he could do is reflect on what he had been taught. What he learned, but most importantly what else was there that he had to learn from. It was a constant struggle, but he was nearing his ultimate goal.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minabuchi Yakaze(TenaciousDeeznuts) turns westward, his eyes lowering to the pool at his feet. Or rather a water-fall, massive amounts of water were filtered through the rock-formation everyday. Due the casual observer all it was, and all it could ever be was a body of water hell-bent on doing what it did.

But that was the point, even through the destruction, and death there was still ... Life.

Yes, that was important to remember.

"Should probably warn both of you to stop making the situation worse.... Because you have no idea how bad it's going to get."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minabuchi Yakaze(TenaciousDeeznuts) extends his blade forward showering the metallic shaft in chakra. What could only be described as  well embers build around the center, perhaps there was even the creation of a few slivers of flame, but nothing like the Mizukage produced. <Like I expected it's imperfect...> Yakaze had failed with his first attempt but that didn't mean he was going to stop there. He takes a step forward, extending his attacking arm into a horizontal sweeping motion combing through the skies with ease.

While in the same motion he forces chakra through his palm. The unearthly glow of super-heated metal turns into a sort of blood-orange, now that it was bathed in his life force he attempts to change the construct of the chakra into live flames. This time there were a few sparks, but it's manifestation were just whisper's and a far-cry of what they could truly be.

Frustration sets in, Yakaze's cheeks turn crimson, and the area around his knuckles flush. Veins pop out of his forearm, the elevation of his chakra now causing flames to sporadically buckle around the base, the sword was now aflame and his sword swings took on a fiery trajectory.

I won't stop until every detail is refined, and then even then I will try to hone it to where I will never waver... Hnnrg...> Yakaze's mind is racked with his past, his previous failures as a lonesome child. The depravity of his childhood living with parents who didn't have enough money to afford the basics. The countless hours he spent attempting to master everything he did for the sake of perfection, because if he was perfect there was nothing he couldn't do, or have. "Perfect......" Veins explode from his brow, his eye-line was filled with vehmence as he looked at the radiant blade. It cast a reflection so pure his eyes were disturbed by the beam of light, until a stronger illumination ignited.

Flames kicked up into a storm of discontent. The fiery aura so intense Yakaze was shocked, his grip over the blade weakens, and soon the clang of metal against concrete was heard, fierce scorch marks forever staining the surface.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) <Well, I can't complain.. It's not everyday I get to leave home and see things that aren't gray, and or rubble...> Daisuke follows his company, taking his time to take in every detail of their surroundings when possible. It was important to note just in-case they were attacked by an animal or stragglers who happened to be bandits. His body was suited for this type of thing, and even as the hours went on he didn't really seem to be tired at all, save for the sweat that left his brow. 

His chest which had been defined by numerous workouts was also saturated in sweat, and it showed through his shirt, and even his fish-net seemed wet. To forego this he simply took off his shirt, and tied the fabric around his waist. He knew he'd be exposed to the elements as well as any insects that may have flew towards him that had been guided by his sweat glands, but he didn't really care at all.

"Hurry up ladies, and random ginger... I want to make it home so I can play Shogi." His left hand was trained upon the hilt of his blade throughout all of this.* - Wed Oct 21 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) "You know... I take it back.. I guess it's not so bad being stuck with some random chick and her b..-." <Brat...> His words trail off, as he suspects that wouldn't be something one should say about a child. Even for him that was a bit much, it wasn't so much that he really even cared for their feelings, moreso it was the respect he had for the lady with the blade.

<Guess she can't be all that bad if she's decided to be a swordswoman... But her child is annoying as shit..> He recounts the previous encounter, and him wanting to smack her head with the broad-side of his sheate, but even though that was mean it would most certainly teach her a lesson in the future, but one that he probably wouldn't live to see.

There was nothing worse than a mothers wrath for her child. Daisuke knew that much from his dealings with the opposite sex. He knew what their most valuable possession was, and perhaps he had a soft spot for children as well... These thoughts fill his mind on his soujurn throughout the forest. He begins to hum softly to himself, the song was a local hymn of Kirigakure, but one that was rare for anyone to hear, especially coming from a male.

Daisuke seemed to give no fucks, and actually recounted the poem, as if he were home, in total disregard to his company, but all in all he remains alert.

"The rain returns, beating on the roof-tops of those who live. The rain trickles onto the graves of those who do not. The rain falls, and claims all, even those who do not stand tall. The Land Of Waves stretch far beyond the blue sky, each man and woman take a piece of their land when they die.. It's time to return to our land, hand in hand... May my soul be regarded to the purelands. When my time finally lands."* - Wed Oct 21 04:33:55 2015
