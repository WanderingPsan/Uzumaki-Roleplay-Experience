This technique was different from the other's as it didn't seem to involve any handsigns at all moreover it didn't effect the terrain in a way that most -offensive- ninjutsu did.

Heiwa was inquisitive, and he didn't really want to say too much, as that would lead to the other shinobi to question his lack of presence in Konoha.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rhino(TenaciousDeeznuts) "Grhnggg..!" The monstrosity bellows, primal grunts roar off of the walls of the concave walls.  It's footing is broken by the wave of mud crashing against it's hull. Next came the rafters shooting into the beats legs, it' was actually able to cut into it's exterior. The orange shafts remain stuck in it's skin as it reels to the side. 

Pain.

If the beast wasn't mad before, it certainly would now. "Grunghggh!" It had nearly been toppled over, and with the carrots working in tandem with the stream it proved to be very effective. However, unlike most creatures, the Rhindo was very tenacious, and it's impulsive nature gave it an edge over most animals as what would likely be seen today.

"Ruh, ruh, ruh, ruh, ruh," Each huff from it's mouth was the beasts priming itself to commit an act of violence, it's sharpened spike rushes Takuma's position, but it stops a bit short, thanks in part to their previous combo.

Instead the horn slams into the ground with immense force causing the ground surrounding the male to shake. The monstorous strike threw smoke in the arena everywhich way which acted as a smoke-screen of sorts.

Luckily, given the fact the beast was enraged, this situation would prove be disadvantageous. However, if one were to find themselves over-came by it's strength they would end up a pan-cake.

Though for the time being the only person who had to worry about that was Takuma.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rhino(TenaciousDeeznuts) "Gragck!" Even with the smoke-screen, Eiji's carrots were able to find it's mark. The sound of the giant creature clashing against the blunt rods informed them of a direct hit. Not only that, it informed them that the creature had in-fact been wounded. This worked in Eiji's advantage, had he used the Carrots as a means to impale the creature he would've found that the Rhino would've been able to resist it for a while, even if it had been a mortal blow.

But by bludgeoning the monster, he was able to stun it for a fixed period of time, and due to the direction of the blow it follows his momentum and is flung on it's side.

It falls to the ground, it utilizies what power it could as a mean to assault the ground below, already confident the ground below wouldn't do much to hurt it's exterior. This pseudo shockwave was meant to push Eiji away had he been too close.

It was down, but it wasn't down for the count just yet. It looks as if it's trying to regain it's strength!

What would the three of them do next?* - Sun Nov 22 01:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: If I had to take a guess... I'd say Eiji is more analytical. He was aware getting too close to the animal would be something that would end badly. However, Takuma moved forward, not really caring.

From there he flicks a coin towards the uniformed male. Seconds later a cup of Sake slides across the counter. The burly Chef responds with.

He lifts his sake glass making it clear that he had been here all day, most likely drinking. But he had another purpose for being here, he needed to stretch his imagination in anyway possible, and if that meant observing the outside world to make different creations that suited his purposes that was fine by him.

"I know you don't like people. Can't really blame you. I'll leave you alone if you want." He takes another gulp of the liquid in his cup, and yes it went down like fire.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuusei(TenaciousDeeznuts) looks in Saika's direction. It was then at this moment in time the male had a thought. It was so easy for her to give people the cold shoulder, and tell them off speaking of not wanting to be in their presence. Suh a thing would be obliged. 

"You know one day in the future.. You may realize you need someones help, and they might not be there to help you because you told them off in the past." He smirks - a somewhat devious gleam reside with his blue irides.

The bandages around his back cackle softly though the breeze of Konohagakure adding a somewhat morbid vibe that contrasted Ryuusei's jovial demeanor.* - Sat Dec  5 19:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryuusei(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Nothings going on. - Sat Dec  5 19:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuusei(TenaciousDeeznuts) 's smile never fades, and in-fact it was obvious it was forced. "Well, forgive me but the last time I tried to speak to you, you disregarded me as if I was an ant, so that is what I will be." 

His head cranes in Gan's direction. "Names Ryuusei. What of yourself? What do they call you..?."

Ironically, as the girl walked by he made it obvious he was staring at her bust as she walked away. Though, this act was to simply make her uncomfortable had she truly decided on observing his line of sight.* - Sat Dec  5 19:50:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuusei(TenaciousDeeznuts) <Such a dainty looking girl.. You'll have to do more than th-...> "....What is this!" Ryuusei falls on his knees attempting to clutch his arms, but he was disallowed the luxury. The intense pain that ran through his appendages causing him to shudder almost as if his synapses had gone haywire.

".....Raghhhh!" The pain was immense, he honesntly hadn't expected this.
"What did you to me!?"* - Sat Dec  5 20:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuusei(TenaciousDeeznuts) ||"I'm not apologizing for -anything-... My arms are... What did you do!?" He screams a bit louder, this time causing a scene of sorts. It was obvious at this point the male was enraged, and because of this -anger- it made humans say things they didn't mean. Whether it be out of temporary spite, or just find someway to get even.

"You may call me a pervert, but at least I'm not a bitch!" He roars, his back reels backwards and he is forced to lean against the fence for support as he tries to regain his foot-hold.* - Sat Dec  5 20:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuusei(TenaciousDeeznuts) eyes widen as she moved to fix the damage in his arms. So, they were no longer sealed and he was starting to get a modicum of motion in his appendages. He looks on, somewhat saddened by her response, he hadn't intended on causing a scene, and using that term with her because he had been honestly surprised.

"I'.. I'm sorry..." Then his eyes switch to the male in question. His words would have meaning behind them, but it would fall deaf potentially.

"I didn't mean....." He'd turn away and venture into the opposite side of the village knowing the damage had been done.* - Sat Dec  5 20:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuusei(TenaciousDeeznuts) wasnt going to interject in their departure, he assumed he had done enough harm, and since Gan was adamant on being by her side he assumed that she wouldn't be alone. Which, in the end might prove to be disadvantageous for the male considering her unique ability to disrupt the flow of one's chakra and damage internal organs, though Ryuusei knew nothing of what she did.

Really, the only thing he gathered was that she was able to cause him immense amounts of pain simply by touching him, and fixing the matter just as quickly.

"I'm sorry I didn't step in  back in the ramen-shop, but if given the second chane I would do all I can to stop them from doing what they did."

He chuckles softly, his right hand furrowing the crimson strands over his scalp.
"You aren't a bad person, just the opposite... I think you're really cool, but you need to learn how to open up, you never know who might be able to help you in your time of need."

He turns away, and makes his way to the Hokage's manor, intent on creating his next piece of tech.* - Sat Dec  5 21:26:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuusei(TenaciousDeeznuts) 's blue eyes pan in Nigens direction. The male seemed to be just as inquisitive as everyone else here, and Saika did attract a lot of attention. He couldn't do anything but feel some sort of pity for Gan, simply because he saw him as wasting his own energy. There was only so many way's one would say no before they got violet, and he was able to pick up on the patterns. It wouldn't be too far fetched to suspect she would attack if pushed too far.

Her emotional nature was anti-social, but she also leaned towards the more tenacious side of the spectrum where she would actually cause physical tramua if someone got out of line. That made for a very dangerous combination.

<I wonder if she killed that other guy..> 
He gives Nigen a double take, and deduces that he's just an average dudearino.* - Sat Dec  5 21:47:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuusei(TenaciousDeeznuts) makes his way through the seating arragnements, opting to sit by no-one. This action is followed by ordering a bowl of Miso-Ramen, and obliging the Chef with a fair stipend of ryo. 

He didn't really understand what was going on, but he wasn't going to get involved - he remembers vividly of the last time he had annoyed Saika, and it ended with her sealing his chakra nodes, only to unseal them several  minutes later when his threshold for pain almost exceeded tolerable levels.

"You owe me money for my medical bill by the wall." She wouldn't be able to tell if he was joking or serious.* - Sun Dec  6 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuusei(TenaciousDeeznuts) ||"Emotional damage?" He retorts with sarastic flair. It was starting to beome painfully obvious he was upset about the matter. He looks her up and down as he orders the cup of tea - he spends the next few moments fuming internally. "I really don't get it.. Why are you so uptight?" 

His cobalt irides switch to Amaya who's silence added a strange factor into the mix. He takes a step back just in-case as the peering at Saika did not go unnoticed. 

He knew nothing of their connection but wouldnt take any chances.

"Five thousand ryo." He extends an open palm in her direction.* - Sun Dec  6 20:50:59 2015

If she did not release his hand, she would have a nasty surprise for her eyes. Though, it would requite some decent perception to even percieve such, in the shinobi world a single touch can spell death, so this was seen as a hostile action.* - Sun Dec  6 20:57:48 2015
