<br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: . . . - Sat Oct 31 20:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) flicks his lockpick back into his pocket.

"Yo. Mizora? I never got a response."* - Sat Oct 31 20:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: Wonder if I come off as creepy if I have a lockpick in my hand. - Sat Oct 31 20:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: Ah shit, I'm too bored to care. - Sat Oct 31 20:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | Quite literally, Toudou flinches with surprise and shock. "W-What's going on?!" Toudou blinked, raising his right arm defensively as though he were about to be attacked by some animal. "H-Hey, I don't know what happened, but cheer up..." Toudou nervously smiles, not exactly sure what was wrong with Mizora. He steps into the room, deciding that he should at least try to comfort her instead of leave her like this.

He had never seen Mizora cry before in his life though. He always assumed her to be a strong-willed woman. It was peculiar to see her in such a state.

"What's wrong, Mizora?"* - Sat Oct 31 20:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | He blinked and lifts up  both of his hands mock defensively. As she grew more composed, Toudou steps over to her, closer this time. He didn't seem to be as fearful of her, but he did keep some caution up, knowing that she did have mood swings. 

"Hey, look, Mizora, I won't tell anyone about this. But, what's wrong, really?" He asked. He was still standing up, but stood up in front of Mizora this time, trying to get a response from her. His casual, smooth method of talking wasn't changed at all, though it did add a tone of sympathy for her.* - Sat Oct 31 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: Think I'm about to get knocked out... - Sat Oct 31 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | Surprisingly, she didn't care how he had come in. Luckily, Toudou wouldn't be going to jail for break-in today. However, Toudou didn't want to leave in Mizora in such a state. He had grown fond of Mizora's upbeat attitude and her dominatrix personality, that it felt like a shame or a pity to see her in such a manner. 

"You can tell me. I'm not going to hurt you or anything." He figured that might give her some consolation.

He notices how her fists were being clenched and how they had curled in during her speech. He braced himself for a potential punch. He was digging into tough grounds and he wasn't sure if he'd make it through. His right hand attempts to place itself on Mizora' shoulder though, in a comforting and friendly manner, as if to drive home the theory of him being sociable.* - Sat Oct 31 20:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | His neck had been grasped and he was pushed against the wall. Toudou grunted lightly, though he doesn't struggle. Luckily, he hadn't been knocked out by the push itself, due to a formidably durable body of his. He looks back at her weakly and with playfulness hinted in the cornea of his eyes, which were bright green in their approach to her. His hazel eyes didn't show any hostility in return, despite the fact that she had grasp on his neck and could potentially suffocate her.

"Mizora, you know I can't just leave you like this. . . . " He choked on his words lightly, from the fact that his neck was being grasped. Toudou's fear was nonexistent though. Maybe he did have some caution, but he had this feeling she didn't want to kill him.

She would've drawn a knife already or had killed him already if that was the case. The fact that she's taking the trouble to warn him already gave him a sign about her good nature. The nature that didn't want to hurt people.

"Y-You don't want to actually hurt me, huh? I can... sorta tell. You're giving me a warning to leave. You're nicer than you seem..." * - Sat Oct 31 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) sighs.

"Alright, Mizora. If that's what you want. I'll stop by and give you a gift sometime." Toudou comments, as he heads out. * - Sat Oct 31 21:13:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: The hot springs, right? - Sun Nov  1 06:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Yes. - Sun Nov  1 06:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Alright. - Sun Nov  1 06:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Let's go. - Sun Nov  1 06:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | Approaching the hot springs, Toudou grabs hold of the door handle and pushes it open. "Oi! Can we use the family bath?" Toudou asked. 

Toudou felt familiar enough with Mai that she might let such a thing slide. Besides---how were they to talk if they were in different springs? "You want to grab fruit milk so that we can drink it after? I think fruit milk's really good after a nice bath."* - Sun Nov  1 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | "Alright. What flavor do you like? I personally like melon." He shoves coins into a vending machine and pulls out a melon-flavored fruit milk. He'd get whatever Mai wanted as well.

He'd then beckon her to the family bath. "Com'on, let's go to the changing room."* - Sun Nov  1 06:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | He entered the changing room. Without hesitation, he stripped off his shirt, revealing his well-toned body. He changes the rest of his clothing and strips down so that only a towel wrapped around his waist.

"You ready, Mai?"* - Sun Nov  1 06:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) walked on over to Mai and places a hand on her back, patting her.

"You ever been in a hot springs before?" He inquired, as he led the way to the hot springs. He'd sink into the hot springs with a soft sigh emitting from his person.* - Sun Nov  1 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) grinned. 

"Well, once you get a first of a hot springs, you normally want to get a second, third, or fourth dose. I swear the water's here addicting---don't taste test that though." Toudou joked lightly, as he approaches her, wading over to her. His right arm tries to wrap around her shoulder in a friendly manner.* - Sun Nov  1 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) chuckles.

"I mean, who knows what people might do in these hot springs, right? Anyways, you told me something about Taijutsu the other time, I think? You want to talk more about yourself and what you do?"* - Sun Nov  1 07:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Oh...Well, I don't really use a lot of jutsu other than this one with my nails...It's kind of like a cat. - Sun Nov  1 07:12:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: I wish I could throw mine...But I think that'd probably hurt me too. - Sun Nov  1 07:13:55 2015

Toudou unseals a scroll, unfurling it from his pocket. 

He unseals the contents, releasing a battlefield of chakram. He aims to have the electricity ring through all of the chakram and surround his opponent in captivity if successful. Should it have been submerged into his chakrams, it'd leave Toudou with a pretty firework of a battleground.* - Fri Nov  6 05:19:08 2015

"Let's do this." He spins his chakrams around with violent motions. He moves them ridiculously fast and zooms at his opponent, swinging back and forth to try and damage him with his chakram.
