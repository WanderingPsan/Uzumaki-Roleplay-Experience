<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) brings Ryomen to him all the way to the nearby Suna Hot Springs. Toudou would knock on the men's side of the hot springs and pull Ryomen with him into it. Toudou starts by grabbing a handmake basket and tossing his clothes into it. He'd take hold of a towel afterwards, just to wrap it around his waist.

"So, you ever been to a hot springs before? Oh, by the way, my name is Toudou. Shishigami, Toudou. You?"* - Sun Oct 25 06:21:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) places his elbows on the rocks.

"Well, I'm not one to be about that hard knock shinobi life. You know the shinobi life is filled with so much ardor and trouble that it could really kill you just by stress alone. That's why I think it's so important to just take frequent breaks, leaves." 

Toudou grinned at Ryomen. "Granted, fighting is necessary sometimes to make a point. I'm one of those guys---I like to relax and do what I want to do."* - Sun Oct 25 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) grunts.

"I see. Yeah. You're a fighter and you find it exhilarating. I can dig that. I've always been a person of uh... You know, I like playing sports, love playing games, and I definitely love my females. I love money too." 

Toudou said. He had no shame in what he said, even though he broke all three taboos of ninjahood in a moment. He exits the hot springs, before stepping over to the fence dividing females and males.

"Want your first taste of adulthood?"* - Sun Oct 25 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) grinned.

"Com'on, Ryomen. You're such a goody-goody. Sometimes you gotta break the rules for relaxation!" That's what Toudou believed.

He peeped into the peephole that he had carved a long time ago. He glances at the women.

"Oh, she's got a nice pair..."* - Sun Oct 25 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) was punched near the shoulder. He rubs his shoulder. "Ow, Ryomen, com'on. It's just a joke. Com'on, you can't tell me that manly blood inside of you doesn't tell you otherwise." Toudou grinned.

"That fire that lights up in your heart, passion that sparks when you see a beautiful female." * - Sun Oct 25 06:48:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) stood up instead of peeking at the fence. He was wet from the water, but he didn't mind. He starts to wipe at it with his towel and heads back into the dressing room. He'd open the door, sliding it to the side.* - Sun Oct 25 06:55:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) // "Passion fruit, huh? You're real exotic. I'm good myself with some strawberry, coconut, or even pear. Pear, now that you've mentioned it, is pretty good." Toudou grinned. "I'm not so much of a mango person as I am a pomegranate."

He puts his clothes back on and heads out into the lobby with Ryomen. He'd stop by a vending machine and buy himself a strawberry-flavored fruit milk. He'd warm it up using the hand he held the milk with and began to drink it.* - Sun Oct 25 07:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) drank the milk. He wipes off any excess white that caught onto his lip with his sleeve. "We gotta hang out some more sometime. Oh, right, we wanted to do that water competition thing, right?" He said, as he stood up. "We just gotta find some glass cups." 

He scrounges around for some glass cups; the best he comes up with are plastic cups. He fills them to the brim with water, offering one to Ryomen.

"You ready for this?"* - Sun Oct 25 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) // Somehow, by sheer luck, Toudou's chakra was swirling, spiralling, and doing all sorts of unique counterclockwise shifts. These shifts back and forth between counterclockwise & clockwise managed to further the heating process. Toudou grinned. 

"So, you think you can beat me, Ryomen? The older brother always wins." He shouted, even though they weren't really brothers.* - Sun Oct 25 07:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) grinned. "That's the spirit Ryomen! Maybe I just beat you with luck. But you'll be better next time. I boil my water at home all the time, which is why I'm used to this." He said, explaining why Toudou might've performed a bit better than Ryomen in this scenario. "Surpass me in the future. You better do that, though. Promise me." Toudou chuckled. * - Sun Oct 25 07:24:35 2015

"That's impressive. So, I take it you're a medic, huh?" He said, while the cells were regenerating, epithelial stratified squamous cells rapidly dividing in respectful procession by the chakra, which acted as a conductor.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | Quickly, Toudou reacts. His right hand yanks the chakram off of his back and he forces it towards the direction of the water. He spins his chakram at a ludicrously fast pace, diverging the current of the water and splitting the water in a circular fashion so that the directional force would be diverted in several different vectors, bouncing off the prongs of the metallic construct of reinforced steel. "Spicy, missy. But water doesn't put out fires as hot as mine."* - Mon Oct 26 23:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Mhmm.. Is this how I began liking her? Anyway...Need to focus. - Mon Oct 26 23:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | Drawing his second chakram, Toudou braces herself before Tetsumi, dauntingly forming the structure of an orthodox chakram stance. One was prone in the air in a horizontal fashion, while the other complimented it in a perpendicular fashion meant for defensive and offensive access & reach. 

Toudou's hazel gaze lands on Tetsumi. "Be careful now." He gently tosses the two chakram into the air, forms a single handseal, and proceeds to catch the chakram. His chakram prongs dig into the ground when Toudou arches his back over, bending his knees to get closer to the ground.

"Ring of Fire." Suddenly, a ring of fire encloses Tetsumi and Toudou.* - Mon Oct 26 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: Once he stations himself in the fire. - Mon Oct 26 23:19:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | The iron shuriken were very interesting to face, to say the least of it. Toudou lifts up his right hand, holding one of his chakrams. His left hand moves into his holster, ripping a scroll from its contents in an effort to utilize it. He'd swing his wheel of heaven, deflecting some of the shuriken as they came. His hand, which still held the scroll, tosses it up into the air after submerging it in his chakra.

The scroll was unfurled and revealed its contents: hundreds of chakrams. They'd fly through the air, aiming to drop nearby Tetsumi and perhaps even damage him if he was caught by any of the chakram. "Chakram Battlefield." Toudou grinned. He was trapping them in a ring of fire. Not only that though, but the ring of fire prevented his opponent from escape. The chakram were for usage within the contents of the ring of fire, making it a dual fold plan.* - Mon Oct 26 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Nah. . .They trying to kill him! - Mon Oct 26 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | Quite literally, the chakram were blocked by some insipid force erected by Jiki's chakra. Whether it be on his own accord or not, Toudou was not skillful enough in chakra sensory abilities to even tell a difference. Instead, Toudou takes it for granted and executes his next plan. The iron sand was coming at him quickly. He had to think quickly.

That was when he executed a single handseal and stabbed the prong of his chakram into the ground. In front of him, a pillar of fire would erupt like a volcano, trying to spread the sand and hinder Tetsumi's vision. Why did he try to interrupt Tetsumi's vision? Because it was a strategy. Toudou figured Tetsumi could not manipulate nor harness the powers of the sand without seeing Toudou in plain sight. By blocking himself as well as dispersing the sand, he could intervene in Tetsumi's strategy. * - Mon Oct 26 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) || Quickly, Toudou capitalizes on the loss of vision. Toudou harnesses both of his chakram, before firing one of the chakram into the ground below him. He picks up a free chakram from the ground as he routs to the side, tossing it at Tetsumi violently in a circular arc. 

A circular arc was for the purpose of not giving away his location. He'd try to lure Tetsumi to face a different area, which was completely around his pillar. The utility of the pillar was to confuse Tetsumi. 

The real plan was coming up next. He then kicks the chakram which he had once thrown to the ground, kicking it up like a basketball. Simultaneously, his chakram, located in his other hand, is gripped with strength to be thrown -straight- through the fire, which was of ethereal nature, trying to slam into Tetsumi. The Wheel of  Heaven would catch on fire as well, trying to damage Tetsumi.* - Mon Oct 26 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Let's see how this plays out. - Tue Oct 27 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | The chakram were rendered useless by Tetsumi's incessant chalk arms. The sand was far too quick for him to handle and Toudou was having difficulties even penetrarting the sand. Toudou swiftly executes five handseals just as the pillar is falling. Once the pillar falls though, Toudou takes into account the storm that was hailing above his head.

Toudou grinned though. His hands reach for two chakram, spinning them around violently yet with expertise. His eyes gleam with excitement; or perhaps it was just reckless bravery. "Alright, let's see what happens now." He thought to himself, preparing himself to deflect shuriken.* - Tue Oct 27 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | Five handseals. Toudou had deflected a good majority of the hail before being encased by the sand from the sides. Suddenly though, Toudou's chakram digs into his body from the coffin binding him. This results in his Kawarimi activating. Should Tetsumi lack the sensory ability, he may not even notice that Toudou had escaped the confines of the Iron Sand Coffin and had replaced himself with one of the many chakrams on the ground.

"Bingo!" Toudou thought to himself. He'd zoom to the side, dashing straight through his Running Fire. The wall of fire would serve to protect Toudou from Tetsumi's sights; without sensory ability, perhaps Jiki would also have trouble discovering Toudou's escape. Unfortunately, Toudou's body had been replaced with something that did not resemble his body mass, meaning if Jiki kept pressing further, he'd probably notice the mass was no longer the same. Nonetheless, Toudou grips two free chakram in the meantime. He tosses both of them straight through the fire, making a parabolic curve to try and smack Tetsumi from the sides.* - Tue Oct 27 00:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | Alas, even Toudou could not elude the mighty Tetsumi Jiki that much longer. He had been caught by this array of sand which wrapped around his feet, restricting his movement. While Toudou may have struggled, he was not strong enough to break the holds of his hands technique. "Crap.." Toudou whimpered lightly. He rose his final Wheel of Heaven, spinning it out desperately to deflect the sand that was spreading out to contain him. 

Too bad. Toudou wasn't that godlike with chakram. * - Tue Oct 27 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) had been contained. Toudou chuckled lightly, grinning with hesitation.

"You've beaten me." His fire disperses shortly after, the Running Fire being removed. * - Tue Oct 27 00:33:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Gratitudes. - Tue Oct 27 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | Whilst Ortho began his handseals though, Toudou wasn't going to let him slip by with a jutsu. 

Toudou said Ortho was allowed to start things off; he did not necessarily say that Ortho was allowed to hit him first. Ironically though, Toudou's technique was one that would counter the devastating gust of wind. Perhaps, at least. Upon completion of the -single- handseal Toudou had to perform, Toudou dug both of his chakrams into the ground, having the prongs dig deeply into the sandy terrain.

"Circle of Fire. Erupt!" Toudou shouted. Quickly, flames begin to spread around the arena, encompassing Toudou and Ortho. The wind, as it came would blow away much of the fire. However, Toudou braces himself in his position, using the chakram which were dug into the ground to protect himself. Not only that though, the fire rehabilitated itself after draining parts of the wind and once more, reformed, due to the heightened abilities partly thanks to the chakrams' highly conducive properties.* - Tue Oct 27 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) || Very clever. The technique of water was impressive. Yet, Toudou wasn't going to end right there. His left hand sinks into his holster and he yanks out a scroll. Spinning it gallantly, Toudou flings his right chakram right at Ortho, blindingly moving it through the air in an attempt to dig into his leg if he was not careful; he made sure not to target any lethal areas though.

"Don't be too focused on the fire---the real hotstuff is standing right in front of you!" He states aloud. * - Tue Oct 27 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) // It was pretty cool. This man seemed to have a powerful repertoire of moves. Toudou's right hand sticks at the exact moment in time the chakram is returned to him. Toudou then bends his knees and kneels to the ground, preventing himself from being knocked back from the Gale Palm so violently due to being much more rooted to his own center of gravity.

Toudou however, still had the scroll in his left hand. He tosses it straight up into the air, already knowing that the flames were extinguished.

"Then, let's see how you handle this." He submerges it in chakra, before releasing the contents, firing tens of chakram down on Ortho, spreading them out daintily so that Toudou could use them to his advantage. 

[Strategem of Wind]--Yet, at the same token, Toudou fires off his left chakram. 

Why? It was to prevent Ortho from using a Great Breakthrough on his mass of chakrams and mess up his plan. Should he waste his time on such a maneuver, he'd face the wrath of his Wheel of Heaven.

The first move was a summoning---or something akin to it. With Earth Manipulation at his side, the Shadow Clone causes the earth to rupture, piercing bamboo shoots now attempting to raze him. Fortunately, Toudou's reflexes kick in and he dashes forward, interrupting the attack's directive. The chakrams kept on targetting Ortho. 

The thickened syrup slams the airborne weaponry. Yet, gravity begs it come down and as the chakram come down to the ground, they land in goops of syrupy goodness. Toudou realizes that they had been put out of commission by how Ortho had executed his technique. Nonetheless, Toudou executes a single handseal and once more, erects several rings of fire.

This time, they emit from his chakrams, being blasted at Ortho's syrup trap, himself, and his clone.* - Tue Oct 27 02:17:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) // Toudou smiles over at Ortho's direction. Unfortunately though, the singular act of erecting a new clone for his purposes would not him from all of Toudou's efforts. A clever man, no doubt though. 

The first move was a summoning---or something akin to it. With Earth Manipulation at his side, the Shadow Clone causes the earth to rupture, piercing bamboo shoots now attempting to raze him. Fortunately, Toudou's reflexes kick in and he dashes forward, interrupting the attack's directive. The chakrams kept on targetting Ortho. 

The thickened syrup slams the airborne weaponry. Yet, gravity begs it come down and as the chakram come down to the ground, they land in goops of syrupy goodness. Toudou realizes that they had been put out of commission by how Ortho had executed his technique. Nonetheless, Toudou executes a single handseal and once more, erects several rings of fire.

This time, they emit from his chakrams, being blasted at Ortho's syrup trap, himself, and his clone.*)* - Tue Oct 27 03:13:42 2015
