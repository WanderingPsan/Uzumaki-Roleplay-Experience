"Let's look this way."* - Thu Oct 29 06:12:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) stops for a moment to recuperate himself. He was sweating profusely from all of the running and dashing movements. His knees were hurting and aching with a painful sore.

However, Toudou doesn't want to show that to any girl! He powers through it.

"So, you think we should take a break soon?" He questioned, in a lax manner contrary to his actual physical condition.* - Thu Oct 29 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Strange house in the middle of nowhere - Thu Oct 29 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Let's go check the house I guess. - Thu Oct 29 06:15:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) sits down on the ledge of the mountain for a moment. He smiles at her, chuckling.* - Thu Oct 29 06:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: You mean you don't wanna be the one to get shot if it's some crazy hobo. - Thu Oct 29 06:15:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, yeah.. - Thu Oct 29 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I can't pick a lock, but.. - Thu Oct 29 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: We'll see. - Thu Oct 29 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Wait. - Thu Oct 29 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) offers her a lockpick.

"Take this, try your hand."* - Thu Oct 29 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Have fun. - Thu Oct 29 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I won't tell you why I have one of those. - Thu Oct 29 06:17:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Think we should just bash the door open? - Thu Oct 29 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Maybe burn the house down? - Thu Oct 29 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Granted, the latter is counterintuitive. - Thu Oct 29 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I think burning the house down with no idea who lives there would be a /really/ fucking bad idea. - Thu Oct 29 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: If we want to house in it. - Thu Oct 29 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Point taken. - Thu Oct 29 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Let's go rest at the waterfall then. - Thu Oct 29 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: We'll investigate more later. - Thu Oct 29 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, lead the way. - Thu Oct 29 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Come. - Thu Oct 29 06:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Huh. - Thu Oct 29 06:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Nice Bridge. - Thu Oct 29 06:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I have no fucking clue. - Thu Oct 29 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) sits down and has his legs hang off the edge. He looks up to the clouds.* - Thu Oct 29 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well.. - Thu Oct 29 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hope we don't run into any giant monsters, huh? - Thu Oct 29 06:31:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Fuck that shit. - Thu Oct 29 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Hah.... - Thu Oct 29 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You ever see a giant monster before? - Thu Oct 29 06:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Nope. - Thu Oct 29 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: How about you? - Thu Oct 29 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Nope. - Thu Oct 29 06:46:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well.. we could spar again, butt... - Thu Oct 29 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Blowing me up would end poorly. - Thu Oct 29 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: For me. - Thu Oct 29 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well, I guess if you blow up that house, no one knows it was us. - Thu Oct 29 06:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Thoughts? - Thu Oct 29 06:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... Nah, that'd be wrong. - Thu Oct 29 06:53:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) leans back against the bed and begins to rest.

"Night, Ketsuki. Don't kill me while I'm asleep."* - Thu Oct 29 07:04:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Would be problematic if your guardian died in the middle of sleeping. - Thu Oct 29 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: And then you get hit by a giant monster. - Thu Oct 29 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: With tentacles and slime oozing from it. - Thu Oct 29 07:04:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Just a little touchy here. - Thu Oct 29 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Touchy there. - Thu Oct 29 07:07:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Before I go to bed. - Thu Oct 29 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I'm going to set up some traps though. - Thu Oct 29 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) rose from his position. He grabs hold of a small bag he stuffed into his backpouch and attaches it to a kunai. He drops it on the ground, attaches wire to the hole of the kunai, and twists it so that it attaches to another kunai on the opposite end of the bridge. It acted as a buffer in a way, in a vertical fashion to protect Toudou's side of the bridge. 

He'd place a seal on one of the bags, mainly to activate should the wire move in any way and fire off kunais at the supposed target.* - Thu Oct 29 07:09:13 2015

"I'm terribly bored. Let's stretch and burn that house down I guess."* - Thu Oct 29 23:51:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Not a thing. - Fri Oct 30 00:04:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You don't seem pleased by the idea. - Fri Oct 30 00:18:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Alright. - Sat Oct 31 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: A Taijutsu spar it is. - Sat Oct 31 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Don't knock me off the waterfall. - Sat Oct 31 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) stands up and glances at Paine. Quickly, Toudou closes the distance between the two. Jetting forward with his right leg first, Toudou bends his knees to lower his level. He then dashes into Paine, trying to ram into her chest with his shoulder and grab hold of her waist with his right arm, to take her down to the ground in an old-fashioned brawling style.* - Sat Oct 31 00:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) // Suddenly, his left hand had been gripped. He was fairly surprised by Paine's movement, but Toudou wasn't about to lose so easily. Yet, the hand grip had come so quickly, it appeared Toudou was up against perhaps a Taijutsu expert or specialist. As soon as Paine attempted to pull Toudou into her embrace, Toudou juts out his right elbow in an attempt to cushion the attack and strike into her sternum once pulled into her. It'd make the tossing motion ever so difficult, as well as prevent the anticipated bearhug he might receive.

"You're not bad. Fast... in a way." Toudou chuckled. His right foot moves to her own foot and attempts to slam ontop of it and damage it, perhaps to stagger her balance. Upon doing so, it'd situate itself behind Paine's foot and try to keep her in a deadlock, if his strength & Taijutsu knowledge was proficient enough to hold her down.* - Sat Oct 31 01:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: -brb- - Sat Oct 31 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) unfortunately, his elbow had simply been gripped onto. He was still tossed overboard, despite his many efforts of stopping Paine's body from movement. His right leg had been unsuccessful from unrooting Paine from her position. Toudou's legs shift in place as they were in the air, aiming to twist to the side so that he landed on his stomach instead of his vertebrae.

Should it be done, he'd raise himself back up promptly, having mitigated the damage by landing on his stomach instead of his back. The central nervous system was not to be attacked so frequently, and Toudou was recognizant of that.* - Sat Oct 31 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) had erected himself straight forward in his position and had prepared for the onslaught of his opponent. AS soon as the roundhouse kick had come, both of his hands erect themselves in a shield-like defensive cross-arm block. If it cushioned the blow at all, Toudou would swing his leg down at the target's shin and try to damage them, perhaps even knock them down to the ground. * - Sat Oct 31 02:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: aimed for the stomach area with their right leg-' - Sat Oct 31 02:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) had been blocked and had tossed her to the ground. Unfortunately, she had handstanded on a single hand, bending her elbow and pushing off of it to swing a secondary kick. "Woah! You've got some mad reflexes..." Toudou noted, being struck right in the stomach because of a lack of anticipation: he didn't think she'd rebound so easily. 

He backed off briefly and bends his knees. As soon as her small hurricane-like coat of wind approached him, he lifts up both of his hands to try and block her.

Unfortunately, he had been knocked right into the air despite mitigating the blow. Toudou grunted with pain as he stood airborne for a moment, preparing for any attack that may come.* - Sat Oct 31 02:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) // Quite literally, he had been struck four times. While he had blocked the first strike, he couldn't block the successive three which struck him in various areas. He quite literally landed on the bridge, bouncing. He rose momentarily, grunting out of pain.

"You're... really strong."* - Sat Oct 31 02:50:40 2015

He felt much better as the healing process went on, as she continued to heal his wounds. Toudou felt as if he was doing much better afterwards. He had free reign over his body parts, which was the first surefire sign. 

"Yeah, I've always healed a bit faster---pops always noted it. Called me a little monster." He states, as he takes the dose of medicine. "Thanks."* - Sat Oct 31 05:30:14 2015
