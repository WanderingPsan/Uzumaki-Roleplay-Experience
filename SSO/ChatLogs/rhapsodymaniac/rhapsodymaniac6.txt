<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) realizes that he was matched with something he could not defeat. Swiftly, Toudou lifts up both of his chakram. He leaps back in an effort to avoid the fireball for the most part. Due to the directional nature of the Great Breakthrough though, it looked as if it was just forwarding it at a faster rate as well as causing the mass of the fireball to grow in its wake. Toudou's chakram spins gallantly.

Of course, Toudou can't even hope to avoid the mass of fireballs. He could only mitigate the damage. He swiftly steps behind his own Fire Run, rolling to the side and staying close to the ground. He'd have his clothing burnt for the most part, but he's try hard to not expose any of his skin to the air.* - Tue Oct 27 03:23:56 2015

"You're strong." He commented quietly. He admitted he was defeated, and his pride was even hurt in a way.

"My name is Toudou Shishigami." 

He glances at the side, noticing some scuffle.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) grins. 

"Com'on. We'll have fun. And I won't do anything to you. Promise. If I do."

He points at Saeza.


"She can turn me into a eunuch."* - Tue Oct 27 04:45:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Um...I guess it wouldn't hurt... - Tue Oct 27 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Let's go then! - Tue Oct 27 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: To the sushi bar! - Tue Oct 27 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Anyway, I shall be off. I think I know where to find Yukio. - Tue Oct 27 04:46:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Come along. - Tue Oct 27 04:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | Swiftly, Toudou paves the way for Mai as he opens the door to the sushi bar.

"Ossan, I'm here for some rolls! By the way, this here's Mai. She'll be eating with me today. Set me up with a Lion King or something hot." Toudou shouted boisterously. It was just his character to be so confident and overly familiar with others. He gestures for Mai to follow him.

"Com'on. Let's take a seat on those stools over there." He'd pass her a menu too; he was an expert at this outing type of thing because of how frequently he neglected shinobi work. * - Tue Oct 27 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | He blinks. He thinks about it for a moment, placing his hand on his chin.

"I go to a lot of places, so I don't really know if I frequent any one place!" Toudou finalizes, grinning at Mai.

"So, what kind of rolls do you like? You prefer sweet? Spicy? Maybe you're one of those wasabi freaks?"* - Tue Oct 27 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: W-wasabi? No...I guess I could try something sweet... - Tue Oct 27 04:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Alright. - Tue Oct 27 04:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: So what do you think about a Lion King? It's a bit sweet, but it could be a bit sour. - Tue Oct 27 04:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: It's the thing I'm having. - Tue Oct 27 04:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) grinned. As the Lion King arrives on its slender long plate, Toudou grabs hold of a pair of chopsticks. He pulls them out of their paper container, offering them to Mai. He'd take his own pair and dig into the Lion King, picking up a piece of the sushi and shoving it into his mouth whole.

"Definitely tastes good, accompanying the sound." He said, between chews.* - Tue Oct 27 05:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) grinned at her. A piece of rice was stuck to his lips, which is quickly removed by his finger. 

"So, what do you think, Mai? Not bad at all, right?" Toudou asked. "You should try it with some wasabi. The stuff's bitter as all hell, but it's good."* - Tue Oct 27 05:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: It's good but...I'd rather not have wasabi... - Tue Oct 27 05:07:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I'll order some sparkling water for you, if you want it. - Tue Oct 27 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: U-um...No thank you. I'll be fine. - Tue Oct 27 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Alright. - Tue Oct 27 05:11:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Yes. - Tue Oct 27 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I'm a Genin too, so we've got that in common. - Tue Oct 27 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: What do you specialize in? I specialize in weaponry. - Tue Oct 27 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Um...I don't really specialize in anything... - Tue Oct 27 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: But I've been learning taijutsu... - Tue Oct 27 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Learning Taijutsu, huh? - Tue Oct 27 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: That's neat. - Tue Oct 27 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Maybe one day you and I could go emano emano. - Tue Oct 27 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) jokingly pats Mai on the back.* - Tue Oct 27 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Um...Maybe... - Tue Oct 27 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Well. - Tue Oct 27 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I had another question. - Tue Oct 27 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Is your hair naturally blue? - Tue Oct 27 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Yes...Why? - Tue Oct 27 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I've never seen a girl with natural blue hair. - Tue Oct 27 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Oh....Yeah, I guess it's not really so common... - Tue Oct 27 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Uh huh. - Tue Oct 27 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: My hair is naturally orange though, so what am I to say. - Tue Oct 27 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) laughed lightly. He ordered some water from a nearby waiter and two tall glasses of water were set next to them.* - Tue Oct 27 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I use chakram. - Tue Oct 27 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) flashes his chakram off: the Wheels of Heaven.* - Tue Oct 27 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Oh? That's new. I've never seen anyone with those before. - Tue Oct 27 05:31:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: It's definitely not common. - Tue Oct 27 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: So, why did you want to be a ninja? - Tue Oct 27 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: I just wanted to get strong...so I wouldn't have to be scared. - Tue Oct 27 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Ah. - Tue Oct 27 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Scared of what? - Tue Oct 27 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Dying. - Tue Oct 27 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Dying, huh? - Tue Oct 27 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) cushions his chin with his hands as his elbows rest on the table.

"Well, you know... You can always bypass death. With something called friendship. Your friends can help support you. At least, that's what I've been told."

He briefly smiles to her.* - Tue Oct 27 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Bypass death...with friendship? How does that work? - Tue Oct 27 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Friends protect you. - Tue Oct 27 05:41:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: People get strong to avoid death too... - Tue Oct 27 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: But when people have the same motives. - Tue Oct 27 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: The same goals in mind. - Tue Oct 27 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Don't they cooperate? - Tue Oct 27 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Oh...Well...When you put it that way...Yeah. - Tue Oct 27 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: So. - Tue Oct 27 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Let's say I don't want to die. - Tue Oct 27 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: And let's say you don't want to die. - Tue Oct 27 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: And our chances of survival are x. - Tue Oct 27 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You can be 1x. - Tue Oct 27 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I can be 1x. - Tue Oct 27 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: And let's add them. - Tue Oct 27 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: 1x plus 1x is 2x. - Tue Oct 27 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: We'd have double the survival. - Tue Oct 27 05:43:02 2015

"Well, that's the most mathematical way you can put survival." He'd state, as he drinks some of his water.* - Tue Oct 27 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: We should hang out more. - Tue Oct 27 05:45:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: It's just like love in a way. You never notice that baby Cupid creeping up on you, but when you finally realize, he's already shot you once or twice. - Tue Oct 27 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) laughed.* - Tue Oct 27 05:49:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Kiddo. - Wed Oct 28 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: ---- - Wed Oct 28 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Toudou, yo. - Wed Oct 28 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Follow me. - Wed Oct 28 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Hey. - Wed Oct 28 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) whispers: --Hey, yo, look. A Survivor! - Wed Oct 28 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) thinks: No.. this isn't Kumogakure. - Wed Oct 28 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hey, Ma'am, uh.. - Wed Oct 28 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: We're looking for some people, if you got a moment..? - Wed Oct 28 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) quietly observed Amaya for a moment. 

"We're looking in particular for a blacksmith and his partner."* - Wed Oct 28 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: Is that the Kage? - Wed Oct 28 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) thinks: I worked hard. Just.. to fail.. - Wed Oct 28 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) observes the scenario in the meantime. Toudou doesn't stir in terms of facial expression; he was not interested in conversing over the dead and did not want to talk philosophy about a people he was not attuned with either.

He doesn't step forward, allowing Ketsuki to deal with the woman, since girls tend to deal with their own problems in packs. Toudou remains at the side, feeling awkward enough so that he could not speak. Speaking perhaps, would only add to the dilemma that they were already in. The Yondaime Raikage who stood before them though, stood as proud-willed and iron-hearted as ever, which was good.

Toudou glances at Ketsuki when questioned.

"We won't find anything here, it appears. No blacksmith would do business in a village such as this, either way. We'll have to go search remote areas. The blacksmith's personality, when it came to Sunagakure, was very volatile. I've no doubt that the blacksmith wouldn't host himself in any village. If he wasn't in Konoha, he's not going to be in Kirigakure, or Sunagakure, that much is for certain."

Toudou commented with finality. "But, I suppose that in the meantime, we can stay in Kumogakure. I'd like to speak with the Yondaime Raikage, now that she isn't in flusters of emotion." He sets his arms by his side carefully and prudently, as to not show hostility while also maintaining a degree of caution in the village. * - Wed Oct 28 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: No need to continue a search that may be infinitely long. - Wed Oct 28 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: They're a merchant pair---they'll be traveling everywhere. - Wed Oct 28 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: Besides, speaking to the Raikage will give me some insight on Kumogakure's current situation. - Wed Oct 28 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) thinks: I can't afford to be weak. I'll die like my nation if I continue to. I must get stronger or I'll fall. - Wed Oct 28 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm... again, the best of luck. Anyway- you take it from here, Toudou. It's your mission I'm tagging along for. - Wed Oct 28 03:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: . . . . . - Wed Oct 28 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I'd like to ask you a qucik question. - Wed Oct 28 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Why are you traveling to Konohagakure? - Wed Oct 28 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Is it for a motive of training? - Wed Oct 28 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Or is it for a motive of hiding? - Wed Oct 28 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Training. - Wed Oct 28 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Hiding. - Wed Oct 28 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Not going to lie... you won't find much in Konoha. I'm one of very, very few Shinobi left there.. - Wed Oct 28 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: And seeking out more hope. - Wed Oct 28 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Hehehe, yo. - Wed Oct 28 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Yo. - Wed Oct 28 03:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Seeking out hope from Konohagakure though probably isn't the best choice. To me, it sounds more like you're trying to make up for your failure. - Wed Oct 28 03:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mhhrm... right then. Good luck, Mi- Hey, Baen. - Wed Oct 28 03:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yo. - Wed Oct 28 03:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Take my advice with a grain of salt, Ms. Raikage. - Wed Oct 28 03:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: A true leader doesn't need to rely on another village to protect their village. - Wed Oct 28 03:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You only need to use two things and they're readily available on your body. - Wed Oct 28 03:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: My village isn't -even- a village any longer. - Wed Oct 28 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Oh, it's the raikage. Or should I say, random shinobi because Kumogakure isn't worth shit anymore. Bwahahahahaha. - Wed Oct 28 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: 'Course. - Wed Oct 28 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Your village isn't a village now. - Wed Oct 28 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Essentially, he's saying sell your body for food because you're a failure...Bwahahahaha. - Wed Oct 28 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) // While Toudou wasn't a dick, he did have to stifle a chuckle.* - Wed Oct 28 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... I don't think that's what he meant at alle. - Wed Oct 28 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: That's the parody at least. - Wed Oct 28 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) thinks: Guess I don't have any Kumogakure shinobi or kunoichi to kill me for my failure. - Wed Oct 28 03:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Kage-dono. - Wed Oct 28 03:39:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: You could always join Kirigakure, they could use the...one shinobi. - Wed Oct 28 03:40:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Right.. like I said, the best of luck hunting down the man who did all of this. - Wed Oct 28 03:41:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: So uh. - Wed Oct 28 04:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I guess you can start. - Wed Oct 28 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: Oh, he wants to see what I can do. - Wed Oct 28 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | It was a bit difficult for him to get a decent grasp on the genjutsu situation. However, Toudou was already aware of Ketsuki's genjutsu usage. She already stated that many could not break her genjutsu and she seemed awfully prideful of them. Toudou just watched the situation.

Right before his eyes, two handseals had been made, and a sweep of leaves had spawned in front of his eyes. It wasn't something that he hadn't seen before. Toudou's chakra control had reached the point where he could activate the Genjutsu: Kai without a problem.

"The Hell Viewing Technique, huh? But it doesn't look as refined as it should be." 

Toudou steps forward. He did not draw his weapon. He did not believe he'd have to use a chakram to fight Ketsuki. Ketsuki's usage of a tanto also showed some degree of inexperience and to Toudou, a slim grasp on lethality rates too. * - Wed Oct 28 04:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | Very impressive. Toudou hadn't expected such a degree of Taijutsu expertise from the girl who he had underestimated. His Kai activates, breaking through the genjutsu upon the deepest fear materializing. Even so though, Toudou is slightly late. The test sweep of a high diagonal had swung at Toudou. 

Toudou's body reflexively moves in preparation of the technique though. Even though he had barely a second to spare, Toudou looked able enough to react and counter it with a swift sidestep to the left. As Ketsuki draws her second weapon, Toudou's left hand reaches out with insane speed.

The left hand was sure to intercept Ketsuki before her kunai was to even be pulled out properly. His left hand was in the shape of a clenched backhand, attempting to quite literally smack Ketsuki across the face with a bludgeoning shot. A backhand.* - Wed Oct 28 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | Quickly, his strike lands against her face. Toudou steps back briefly, as though to give Ketsuki some room. However, the tanto thrust was headed straight for his wrist as it retracts. Unfortunately for her, the speed at which his hand retracted was akin to the speed at which it had jutted out: it was a lightning fast jab. The kunai was thrown point blank as well, which surprised Toudou to some extent. Toudou blocks it with his elbow, hopefully mitigating any damage to any vital organs.

He smiles at her. "Ah, ah, you're stronger than I originally thought." Toudou quietly comments. "Definitely wasn't expecting that strength of yours to manifest. Granted, I probably held back too much." 

Suddenly, Toudou steps in towards Ketsuki. His right hand yanks the kunai out of his olecranon and his left hand is jutted straight out at Ketsuki once again to try and jab her in the face. Should he land, it'd land with the full force of akin to a straight. Toudou's right leg would swing itself towards Ketsuki's shin, trying to crush into the tibia and bring her lumbering down on her gluteus maximus.* - Wed Oct 28 04:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) blinks at the interesting little technique. "Oh, you know a little Taijutsu of your own too! I'm impressed. But you shouldn't be impressed by my own Taijutsu knowledge. A ninja is naturally raised to be fast, diligent, and able to perform a degree of martial arts." Toudou nodded, after Ketsuki consulted him about his Taijutsu skills.

Toudou weaves a single handseal and places his hands on the ground. Suddenly, a ring of fire was generated, spreading rapidly and with incredible speed. It meant to trap Ketsuki and prevent her from moving too far away from Toudou.

"Ring of Fire."* - Wed Oct 28 05:04:12 2015

"Ring of Fire."*)* - Wed Oct 28 05:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | Toudou seemed surprised that Ketsuki was charging at him head first. However, Toudou wasn't a weak opponent by any means. His right hand attempts to grab hold of her foot and block it in mid-air. Upon doing so, his left hand would reach for her ankle and suddenly, with his strength, Toudou would begin to rotate Ketsuki in the formation of a Dragon Throw.

Quite literally, he'd shove Ketsuki's torso through the fire and have her probably catch on fire, since Toudou was in such close proximity to his own flames. Should that be the case, Toudou would swing her perhaps thrice through the fire before tossing her onto the ground, giving her the opportunity to perhaps remove the fire. * - Wed Oct 28 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | He was fairly surprised by her devoted attack. However, Toudou's strength is a bit much for her. Upon throwing her to the ground, the blade grazes along his body. It is unable to pierce him and latch against Toudou's skin because of how durable his skin was, and the fact that there wasn't enough strength to penetrate all the way in given the conditions.

Should he have tossed Ketsuki to the ground, Toudou would wait for her next move, wanting to see if she'd decide to continue or not. * - Wed Oct 28 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) smiled at her. "Yeah, I'm glad that it didn't kill you or anything. Make sure those tags are out of the way of my fire, y'hear?" Toudou grinned. He finally decided to show Ketsuki some respect. Toudou's left hand and right hand move to his back, yanking two chakram off of his back. He spins them around gallantly, letting them burn with fire as they gather the Running Fire.

"Watch out." He flings out the first chakram. It flies with incredible speed. However, controlled by Toudou, it'd only smack Ketsuki with its flat, bludgeoning end, so that it didn't potentially kill Ketsuki.* - Wed Oct 28 05:33:13 2015
