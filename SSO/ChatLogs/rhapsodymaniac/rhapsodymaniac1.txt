<br><font color=yellow>*???(RhapsodyManiac) // "I'm afraid that it's not so simple." Five years had passed. However, the questionable figure had not changed an inch. Perhaps Tethys would recognize him. After all, he was the one who had reduced him into a puddle five years prior for his intrusion on Amegakure ground. The figure brandishes his blade, which shimmers with an electrifyingly golden gaze. 

"Your force will have to halt here."

Four-thousand soldiers on Kirigakure's side, only two-thousand on Amegakure's side. They paled in comparison. However, the questionable figure simply draws his blade in a crescent.

The ground is ripped asunder with a violent torrent of electricity spreading out. He was well aware of the prowess of Kirigakure ninja in water; water only spread electrical currents and he would use that to his advantage. His electricity was deadly though; it looked to be so ridiculous conducive that it evaporated and separated hydrogen as well as oxygen molecules from each other in a cataclysm of chemical reactions.

"Raijin no Ken: Trueno Arco."* - Sun Sep 06 20:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*???(RhapsodyManiac) // The electricity's surge clashes with the gusts of wind; however, the electricity bursts through the weaker tier of wind elemental proficiency. Wind users were a scarcity in Kirigakure; naturally, the Yuki Clan that was stationed there was proficient in Wind but their scattered nature prevented any equivalency in terms of matching them up to Sunagakure's tier. 

After this raging torrent of electricty subsides, the leading officer fires off another arc of electricity, intent on destroying another portion of Kirigakure's army with a spray of electricity. Amegakure ninja behind him begin weaving handseals for the Water Bullet technique, firing off several torrents of water to capture the electricity and amplify its expansiveness. 

"What are you going to do?" He couldn't see Tethys had escaped. Nonetheless, his army was his primary directive.* - Sun Sep 06 21:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*???(RhapsodyManiac) // He feels a fatal death-grip wrapping around his ankle for a short instant. In a matter of seconds though, the figure is able to recognize the threat; though he did not expect it to have such strength. "So, the child has become stronger over the years." The Raijin no Ken's electricity is redirected downwards. Simultaneously with the kunai plunge, the electricity forms several rings around Tethys' body, aiming to completely jellify him in his place. Of course, by the point he was jellified, the kunai would have already dug into the Face of Asura. Strangely enough though, while blood seeped out, Tethys would've felt little resistance from his "intestines". It was suspect to say that Tethys had not hit any organ with his strike, despite hitting the correct location and identifying the portion of the abdomen that should have the intestines within them.

This merely meant, that if Tethys survived to tell the tale, he may be able to give Kirigakure information and thus, the upper hand against Amegakure.

Unfortunately though, there was little chance of Tethys resisting the electrical effects of the mighty blade.* - Sun Sep 06 21:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*???(RhapsodyManiac) // The Face of Asura stood within the canvas that was the soil. He who had been yanked within it was one who was not going to be handled by their army. The Amegakure army charges onwards, clashing with the Kirigakure army. It is apparent which army is more well-equipped after a short while. Amegakure's army was technologically advanced in comparison. While Kirigakure was reliant on scrolls for unsealing weapons and firing them out, Amegakure was utilizing strange weaponry that uses scrolls as ammo packets of senbons, firing them off using contraptions of their own.

However, there is a clear difference in strength when numbers are accounted for. The questionable figure is defended by several Amegakure ninja, who crowd around ??? swiftly due to a distance gap. The Kirigakure army fought on against his own army. With Tethys at his hand though, the questionable figure jabs the Raijin no Ken into the puddle that composed Tethys. Another electrical shock bundles up and aims to sizzle his hydrified status, likely to lethally wound him. It appeared he was targetting his nervous system at this point, though was unsure how effective it would be.* - Sun Sep 06 21:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*???(RhapsodyManiac) // In a single instant, the man's neck snaps. His neck is bent backwards momentarily. It was expected that he had died.

Clamors from Kirigakure were visible. Kirigakure had believed that their leader had completely wiped the Golden Blade of Amegakure off his feet.

The Golden Blade's hand reaches for his head, snapping it back in place despite breaking his neck. Tethys had managed to escape, but it wouldn't mean his injuries were nothing. He had done damage. And Tethys still didn't know how to kill the Golden Blade.

"A nice try." The Golden Blade stated. "But a Face of Asura is not mortal." The Amegakure army proceeds with their attack, a bloody fight ensuing making the Uchiha massacre look like a water balloon fight.* - Sun Sep 06 22:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*???(RhapsodyManiac) // Wind and fire. It was a mighty combination yes. But was it up to par with Amegakure's specialized army who capitalized on their Water Ninjutsu? Amegakure ninja weaved handseals consecutively, firing off Water Bullet to counteract the source of kunais and wind. At the same time, the questionable figure backs off, flipping into the recesses of his army. 

"This doesn't look good." He stated quietly to himself. "Their army is much too great for ours. However, we have slowed them down and served as an obstacle of impediment. Poison Squad, go."

The secondary line weave handseals, resulting in the emittance of a massive Poison Fog, in hopes of engulfing the center of the Kirigakure army formation. * - Sun Sep 06 22:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*???(RhapsodyManiac) // The fog's upper wave manages to disperse beyond that of the waves. The waves clash against the lower half of the frontline's bodies though. The water crashes into them, claiming them in its violent tsunami-like motion. However, a swift order of guidance leads them to safety.

"Sides men!" The leader had shouted. The Golden Blade's instruction was swift. These men were disciplined combatants who followed his orders strictly. The side movement had resulted in them weaving handseals.

"Fire!" The soldiers fired off their torrents of water, aiming to damage Tethys as well as his force. Even though the water itself...probably couldn't hurt Tethys due to hydrification, should Tethys hydrify, his forces would take the brunt of the Water Bullets.* - Sun Sep 06 22:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*???(RhapsodyManiac) // Suddenly, the expanse of water gave him the perfect opportunity.

"Trueno Arco." That was most likely curtains. He cared not to sacrifice the front lines of his own forces. Several Amegakure ninja are caught in the attack. However, the purpose of this was conducive. Those with their mouths open to fire water would find the water conducting electricity into their bodies. The electricity would scorch them from the inside-out, effectively killed a large portion of the water users indiscriminately.

He also seemed to be targetting Tethys. It was only because of his positioning in the back that he could not accurately hit all of his opponent's forces, and had to sacrifice some of his own though.* - Sun Sep 06 22:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*???(RhapsodyManiac) dashes forward within this instance. Tethys had lept right into the air at this point. Pity. He'd jump simultaneously with Tethys, with his blade poised for contact. His blade is swung simultaneously as the Syrup Trap's handseals are completed, clashing the Syrup Trap with the electricity. The electricity's heat manages to eviscerate the viscosity of the substance, though the water and electricity clashing made steam.

This steam surrounded Tethys and the Face of Asura.

Emitting from the steam were red eyes.

"I see you......" Suddenly, a kick would be ejected from his person, aiming to clobber Tethys in the chest. Of course, Tethys was viable to Hydrify.* - Sun Sep 06 23:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*???(RhapsodyManiac) // The blades clash. Tethys' incredible strength cracks into the blade of the Raijin no Ken. That was the first misunderstanding. The questionable figure causes rings of electricity to run from his blade though, aiming to wrap around Tethys. As Tethys' second blow nears him though, the questionable figure raises his blade.

The Raijin no Ken is bifurcated, resulting in his head being lobbed straight off of his body. Rings of electricity aim to electrify Tethys and damage him further, to lethal condition. Unfortunately though, this was the end of this man's story. 

He was killed by the decapitation.* - Sun Sep 06 23:28:12 2015

He'd proceed to walk up to Misa.

His right hand stretches out violently, targetting her eye. His index finger tries to straight and literally poke into her eye and perhaps damage it. His hand threatens to even sneak itself into her.

It would've enabled Misa to send out that mist. Shoji though, isn't a naive fool. As the gas is released, Shoji pulls back his tongue, yanking it back into his mouth. He builds some distance, bringing himself back momentarily to escape the mist's spray by stepping towards the sidelines. That way, he could avoid its trajectory for the most part as well as position himself for a second hit.

"You taste so good. And you got me to bleed too. Oh, crimson scarlet petals that fall from my beautiful precious!" He yells, lifting up his hands.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) // Caught off guard for a moment, Shoji backs off promptly. He exhibits his first sign of fear. However, the fear is mixed with a sense of curiousity, the nature of which cannot be rivaled by even a scientist archetype. Dark grey skin---Ambrocio posed opposite to Shoji's pallid and almost deathly white skin. "Scary!" He shouts playfully, his eyes widening like dinner plates.

The arm is swung at him. As he was punched, Shoji quite literally skidded back heavily. His tongue suddenly jets out of his mouth in an attempt to wrap around Ambrocio's body though, while he was skidding back. Shoji tried to use this like a catapult while he was thrown aloof. Shoji would try and use the tongue to yank himself back to Ambrocio and perhaps tackle him using his entire body acting as the cannonball.* - Sun Oct 18 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) discovers that he was going to have a lot of trouble dishing out damage to Ambrocio. He is being ragdolled by Ambrocio suddenly. As soon as Ambrocio completed his second transformation, the tongue had been broken free of, leaving Shoji with a rather shocked facial expression. The hand gripped onto his torso and Shoji had been tossed around like a doll. "Ouch!" Shoji shouted.

His arm runs across the ground, resulting in scrapes. He finds himself bleeding minimally, but there was still blood nonetheless. "Ouch. Ouch." Shoji shouted. He runs his hand along the scrapes.

After a couple of seconds though, the skin was regenerating.* - Sun Oct 18 01:41:07 2015

His back ruptures out to reveal three intestines, which stretch from his body like tentacles. The visible chakra of Ambrocio's piston fist was deadly; Shoji could tell that he might even be killed if he was hit by that attack directly. "Shit!" 

Though, what Shoji was doing probably looked way more lethal than what Ambrocio would've done. His tentacles attempt to wrap around Ambrocio's arm and stop him. Shoji's hands would also join, trying to keep his attack away from him.

"S-Strong! You're too strong! Monster!" Shoji shouted. However, his eyes were still glazed over, as though he was really into it.* - Sun Oct 18 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) // Suddenly, his intestines burrow themselves back into his body, rapidly sticking themselves back in. The hole is shut closed by regenerating cells. Shoji is breathing heavily. He had never fought such an incredibly strong opponent before. Shoji was used to fighting people who were like human beings. Always running around. Not a behemoth who could charge through everything like a tank.

"Fucked up? Thank you... for the compliment." He bites his lip and lets himself bleed slightly. * - Sun Oct 18 01:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) rolls across the ground roughly.

"Okay. Thank you." He states calmly. He presses his forehead against the ground eccentrically for a moment; it was a sign of some schizophrenic behavior involving the motor system. Eventually, after a couple of minutes, Shoji stands back up.

"We're done here."* - Sun Oct 18 02:04:09 2015

He begins to laugh insanely, as though touching his nose with his tongue was the biggest Guiness World Book of Records feat.

Eventually, he rolls back onto his side. He starts to crawl, before leaping up to his feet. He follows Ambrocio and John Stanford, obviously distinct and distinguished from the two because he was so weird and strange in his habits. * - Sun Oct 18 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) follows along Ambrocio. He lazily creeps along the ground occassionally. Frequently, he is stopped to hunt for wild creatures on the way. He was especially interested by vultures for some reason. Maybe it was because he caught sight of them dining on a corpse on the way there. Shoji really wanted to eat some of the corpse himself, but he knew that it'd be eyebrow raising. 

Instead, he just scoops out a piece of the corpse for "inspection and scientific purposes." On the sly, he eats it and swallows, dining on it for sustenance. He follows Ambrocio in the meantime, not being irritated by the distance nor by the sun's rays hailing on him. 

"Say! Where is Kumogakure anyways? It's the Village Hidden in the Clouds, right? So we're going to the sky, right?"* - Sun Oct 18 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Not too far away, and.. Kind of, it is called Hidden in the Clouds because of its high altitude. How high up it is compared to the rest of the Earth. - Sun Oct 18 02:37:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) nods sighing.

"Can't we go see the village some more though? I've never been here before. Sightseeing. Sightseeing!" He acted like a child, almost. He adjusts his glasses---which was typical of a nerdy character---though he was not one of those. * - Sun Oct 18 02:43:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) twists and cranes his neck towards Pumaru. Out of the blue, his tongue jets out of his mouth, attempting to wrap around Pumaru's neck. Should it succeed, Shoji would drag Pumaru onto the chopping table and quite literally bring his chopping knife to dig deep into her umbilicus.

"Are you an innie or an outie?"* - Sun Oct 18 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) tightens the grip on his tongue. As she kicked him in the neck, Shoji grips onto her leg. His teeth are born for a moment before suddenly plunging deep into her skin. He'd dig his teeth straight into her flesh, striking through epidermic layer and digging into her connective tissue. Smooth muscle would stand no chance for his biting motion, as he eagerly tore at her flesh to try and break actin, myosin, and other muscular components apart.* - Sun Oct 18 04:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) tore through her leg briefly. His tongue forces her down once more, bashing her against the counter head-first.

"Stop squirming, you floppy fish." Shoji shouted. "I don't like playing with my food." He licks the blood off of his lips. He chews any flesh he caught in his mouth, before digging the chopping knife into her side, trying to dig straight through her waist.* - Sun Oct 18 04:38:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) glances at her.

"Yes, I have a lot of meat in here. Please leave."* - Sun Oct 18 04:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Angelina(JustCallMeGnar) says: So much meat that there's just blood dripping on the counter right there? - Sun Oct 18 04:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) sighs. He glances at her. "I said leave." He starts to walk over to her in an attempt to push her out.* - Sun Oct 18 05:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) says: Begone. - Sun Oct 18 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) flicks his tongue out at her, once more in an attempt to grip her by her neck and drag her along the ground.* - Sun Oct 18 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) quite literally drags her across the floor unless she tried to remove his tongue from her neck. He doesn't feel like speaking either. He'd drag her towards the sink, opening the lower portion of the sink. He'd wedge the girl's head in between a groove in the pipe to aid his suffocation efforts.* - Sun Oct 18 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) stomps in her pelvis.

"Quiet, sow." Shoji murmured quietly.

"Your very body is a shame to the human race." He'd stomp in her pelvis multiple times, in an effort to break her pelvic bone while she choked.* - Sun Oct 18 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) walks away while she suffocates to death.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Well..That's a bit creepy. - Sun Oct 18 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) says: Is it....? - Sun Oct 18 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: A bit. - Sun Oct 18 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) says: Well. - Sun Oct 18 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) says: Not like you'll have a choice in matters in the end. - Sun Oct 18 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) lifts his eyebrows at this point.

"You can come with me the easy way or the hard way."* - Sun Oct 18 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) says: I personally like the hard way. - Sun Oct 18 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: What's the hard way involve? - Sun Oct 18 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) says: Lots of hard things. - Sun Oct 18 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Such as? - Sun Oct 18 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) says: You get to see. - Sun Oct 18 05:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) // Suddenly, his tongue flew out of his mouth. Shoji's tongue aims to wrap around Baylea's mouth to muffle her voice. He'd proceed to wrap the excess around her neck to drag her into his house.* - Sun Oct 18 05:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) lifts her above him for a moment, using his tongue.

"You have a rather exquisite body."

Suddenly, his back breaks open. Three intestines are rocketed out of his back and through his innards, so that they protruded ominously around Baylea's body.* - Sun Oct 18 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) watches her for a moment.

"I'm just examining the course." Shoji was referring to a meal course.

Of course.

Suddenly, the intestines start to spew out white liquids onto Baylea's body, spreading across her clothing to begin disintegrating it.* - Sun Oct 18 05:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) grinned while his tongue was out.

"God, I love these abilities. I'll get to feast on you now." -He said, as he slowly dragged her body down to his body. He'd pull down his pants briefly, releasing his member and manhood. 

"I'm about fifteen... How old are you miss?" He asked, examining her breast. He'd slap it with his right hand, while a tentacle slapped her asscheek. * - Sun Oct 18 05:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) // "I don't have to. But I want to." Shoji grinned.

"There's a firm difference between 'necessity' and 'desire.' Desire tends to override necessity for me personally." Shoji comments. Shoji presses his member against the entrance to her vagina. 

His tentacles run along her legs. One of them begins to dig into into her asshole, while another begins to run across her lips. Both of his tentacles plunge into her asshole and mouth simultaneously once Shoji's dick entered Baylea's pussy.* - Sun Oct 18 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) // "Mmmph. I can't believe this ecstasy, this feeling of fucking and dominating someone older than me. It's great." -Shoji stated, as he continued to push his member inside of her mouth. His hands grabbed onto her breasts and began to tease her nipples. His tentacles zoomed through her mouth and asshole, penetrating and going back and forth quickly with their lubricated edges. * - Sun Oct 18 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) yanks out the tentacle from her mouth, so that he could hear her moans out loud. Shoji dragged her over to the bed and forced her to lay on it, with his tentacle and his dick still entering her asshole and her pussy. "So, Baylea, how does it feel, to get fucked by someone two years younger than you? How does it feel to be dominated for the first time?!" 

He questioned. His right hand trails along her hymen's blood and he laps at it with his tongue, licking it up. After licking it and draining it into his tongue, he'd force a kiss with Baylea, kissing her on the lips and mixing the hymen's blood and exchanging it between the two.* - Sun Oct 18 06:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) wrapped his arms around her waist and continues to buck his hips into her body, kissing her passionately and nearly lovingly. He kept on kissing her, from the mouth to her neck.

"Fuck yeah. Fuck..." Shoji murmured, the nymphomaniac really relishing in the meal that he was getting from her. His teeth dig into her shoulder, but they don't dig enough to draw blood. His tongue laps at her skin lightly as he kept on fucking her.* - Sun Oct 18 06:21:00 2015
