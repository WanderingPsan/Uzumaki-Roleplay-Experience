<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | Both of his hands trail towards his back, eagerly reaching for his chakram. He unequips the chakram from his back and takes a step forward. His gaze settles on Kyubishu. His hazel eyes glance at his surroundings to know where everyone was before he started the fight; he wanted to avoid collateral if possible. 

Suddenly, Toudou's hands stream through their handseals in a moment's notice. He rears his head back before cocking his neck forward where the cervical vertebrae gave him access. 

"Katon: Goukakyuu no Jutsu!"

He thought to himself, exhaling a large maw of fire.* - Sun Nov 15 04:28:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | Luckily, due to the novelty of the technique for Kyubishu, Toudou had found a glint of light. He had unequipped his chakram earlier from his back and now primed them in his hands. Spinning them around rapidly, rotational cuts allow him to slice through the wires before they bounded him. 

His eyes reset themselves on Kyubishu's presence.

"Not bad at all." Toudou stated.

He waits for Kyubishu's move.* - Sun Nov 15 04:35:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) takes a step forward as his beginning initiative. His glazed orange gaze settles itself on Ryomen.

He draws his chakram with a brief, fluid maneuver of his right hand. Upon retrieval, he clutches it in the grip of his phalanges.

"Let's go."* - Tue Nov 17 00:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: So. - Tue Nov 17 00:12:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: S-Sure. - Tue Nov 17 00:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) almost reacted promptly to Ryomen's speed; it looked as though Toudou was able to trace Ryomen's movements. With a twist of his hip and a twist of his upper half, Toudou brings his chakram to intercept the blow from the elbow. His right foot jets out from underneath in an attempt to slam into Ryomen's shin and damage his balance, as well as establish distance.* - Tue Nov 17 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Tue Nov 17 00:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: That was interesting. - Tue Nov 17 00:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I'm ah, gonna go find something to do then. - Tue Nov 17 00:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | The chakram had blocked Ryomen's attack, mitigating the damage quite a bit. Toudou smiles at Ryomen as he backs away, stubmling. Toudou zoms backwards, before suddenly weaving through handseals in rapid succession; one after another had been formed until he finished. He was much faster than Ryomen.

"Now it's time to hit fire against fire." Toudou had expected Ryomen to use fire. He had no bloody clue Ryomen was going to use wind. This counteraction was just a result of Toudou's only element being fire.

"Katon: Goukakyuu no Jutsu."

He fires off a fireball from his maw, aiming to engulf Ryomen.* - Tue Nov 17 00:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: He started out like that previously, I got next on winner. - Tue Nov 17 00:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | A Fireball jutsu now headed at him. Not bad at all! Toudou blins at the sight of it. Suddenly, he spins his blade around, using the friction of his chakram in order to generate flames on its prongs. In response to the Fireball which was directed towards his side, Toudou decided to wage war. 

"Fight fire with fire."

That was his philosophy. He desired to fight fire with fire and prove his ultimatum in fire. That he was the strongest user in the Fire Element and that no other Katon-user could beat him.

"Tornado Flame!"* - Tue Nov 17 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | He had to swiftly countervail Ryomen's attempt at another fireball. The same set of seals was not going to be enough. Toudou lifts up his chakram and spins it around in mid-air. He begins to weave handseals rapidly. Suddenly, a fireball burst out of Toudou's maw.

It inserts itself straight through the center of his chakram; it boosts the fireball's strength and general capacity for distance. Toudou had just utilized his chakram as an amplifier to boost the efficiency of his Fireball Jutsu. Toudou's innovation perhaps could be noted at this point, as he unveiled a second, much more powerful Fireball than he had done previously.

"Not enough, Ryomen!"* - Tue Nov 17 01:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | Another wind style technique, huh? They were fast, Toudou would give him that much. However, Toudou knew that Fire overcame Wind. As soon as the wind bullets came back, Toudou recognized the handseals due to intellect. His right hand spins the chakram around; he hadn't the time for handseals now that Ryomen was relying on the speediness of his wind.

"Tornado Fire." Toudou mutters, firing out another vacuum of flame towards Ryomen in an attempt to veer him off-course and perhaps singe him with the strength of his tornado-like flame.* - Tue Nov 17 01:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) | | Luckily, Toudou -had- a jutsu with no handseals. It was his fast acting Tornado Fire. Unfortunately, it wasn't any stronger than the typical Fireball for the amount of control that it exacted from him. Toudou huffed and puffed, panting just a mite bit. He folds his arms across his chest and starts to walk over to Ryomen.

"A good spar, Ryomen. I expected you to be at least that good. You've got some real firepower packed into you, really. Good stuff comes in small packages, huh?" Toudou said, placing his hands on his knees. He settles his chakrams into the ground by digging the prongs within the sand.* - Tue Nov 17 01:53:55 2015
