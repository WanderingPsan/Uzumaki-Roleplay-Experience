<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) would accept the 90 yen, smiling. And would also take Ryomen's 90 yen, stuffing it into his pocket.* - Sun Nov  1 18:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: 90 yen for a katana? - Sun Nov  1 18:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Yes. - Sun Nov  1 18:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm you got anything else you would recommend for a medic? - Sun Nov  1 18:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I don't use blades, unless it's this tanto. - Sun Nov  1 18:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Hm....Then I'm afraid I can't help, sorry. - Sun Nov  1 18:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Fine. - Sun Nov  1 18:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Hm...Just a moment. I need to smelt down more iron. - Sun Nov  1 18:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Where to find one... - Sun Nov  1 18:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Wait. - Sun Nov  1 18:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Yes? - Sun Nov  1 18:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Might help to look around. - Sun Nov  1 18:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Perfect. - Sun Nov  1 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Perfect! - Sun Nov  1 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Jinx. - Sun Nov  1 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Now...How many more swords did I need? - Sun Nov  1 18:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: One...Two....Three. - Sun Nov  1 18:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Alright, if I'm right, I need to craft one more sword. For now, two of you who ordererd, come recieve your Katanas. - Sun Nov  1 18:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Actually....There was only two, now that my brain functions again. Uh...You and...You. - Sun Nov  1 18:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: Well, if I'm needed--which I probably won't be--, i'll be at the training field working on things. - Sun Nov  1 18:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: Tank you also, by the way, for the katana. - Sun Nov  1 18:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: It's my job. - Sun Nov  1 18:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Anyone else interested in swords? - Sun Nov  1 18:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Lastly, you. - Sun Nov  1 18:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Thank you. - Sun Nov  1 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Thank you, always a pleasure. - Sun Nov  1 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: I'm assuming that is all for my swords. So, without futher due, I'll be off. - Sun Nov  1 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) would begin to exit out of the village.* - Sun Nov  1 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: ? - Sun Nov  1 19:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: How long you guy's been standing here? - Sun Nov  1 19:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Well... - Sun Nov  1 19:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: I went to other villages. - Sun Nov  1 19:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Sold some Katanas. - Sun Nov  1 19:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Came back. - Sun Nov  1 19:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Surprised you still alive. - Sun Nov  1 19:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: So, what're you going to do now? - Sun Nov  1 19:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Agreed. - Sun Nov  1 19:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: I need to search for new things....Special things. They'll make my blades amazing. - Sun Nov  1 19:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: What sorts of things are we talking about? - Sun Nov  1 19:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Motors", "Magic Nexus's", "Energy Cores" and "Energy Limiters" - Sun Nov  1 19:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Eh, that sounds strange as fuck... - Sun Nov  1 19:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: And each of them would make strange, but amazing weapons. - Sun Nov  1 19:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Well, maybe I might know where you can find energy cores... - Sun Nov  1 19:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: But. - Sun Nov  1 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: I think a bowl of ramen might refresh my memory, yeah.... - Sun Nov  1 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Wanna eat? - Sun Nov  1 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Oh? - Sun Nov  1 19:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Mhm.. - Sun Nov  1 19:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Well, I suppose why not. - Sun Nov  1 19:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Cool.. - Sun Nov  1 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Lead the way. - Sun Nov  1 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: I know the perfect place. - Sun Nov  1 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: What kind you want? - Sun Nov  1 19:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) nodded, as the blacksmith looked over to the Raman guy. "One order of Miso Ramen, as well as one bowl of Vegetable Ramen." He said, as he sighed. Of course Yonbu would choose one of the expensive Ramens, but all is well anyway.

"Now then...About the Energy Cores." He began, waiting for Yonbu.* - Sun Nov  1 19:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) sighed. Of course he would get an answer like that. He paid for the meals, and shook his head. "Do you know where the Hokage IS at the very least?" He asked. "Besides the mansion."* - Sun Nov  1 19:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: You seem to be so worried about creating this blade... Why don't you relax some? - Sun Nov  1 19:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: It's not that I'm "worried". But a craftsman's dream is to forge the best weapons. - Sun Nov  1 19:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: I'll help you with what I can, but loosen up.. I know you want to be the best, but even you gotta eat, right? - Sun Nov  1 19:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: I suppose you're right. - Sun Nov  1 19:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Heh, that's the spirit. Trust me, everything's going to work out. - Sun Nov  1 19:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Im curious.. - Sun Nov  1 19:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Hm? - Sun Nov  1 19:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Don't take offense to this but... Is it intentional you look the way you do, cause I almost thought you were a girl...  - Sun Nov  1 19:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: No, it is not intentional. I just don't find it needed to fix myself up to look like a male. I have male genitals, and that's what makes me a male. That's good enough for me. - Sun Nov  1 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: *Laughs* I don't dispute that fact, but just because you have genitals in the form of a male, doesn't mean you share the same mindset... I guess what I'm trying to say is.. - Sun Nov  1 19:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: You gay? - Sun Nov  1 19:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: No. Looking like a female has nothing to do with my sexuality. And for the record, males who see themselves as females are called transexuals, same with females who see themselves male. - Sun Nov  1 19:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: -- - Sun Nov  1 19:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Well, like I said I was only trying to figure out something about you. - Sun Nov  1 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: It's fine. - Sun Nov  1 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Hm? - Sun Nov  1 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Well, farewell. - Sun Nov  1 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Mhm. - Sun Nov  1 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Wheres he going? - Sun Nov  1 19:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Well, I managed to travel to the sand village...I sold a good four Katanas there for 90 Yen each, though someone gave me a 100 intentionally. - Sun Nov  1 19:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: No idea. - Sun Nov  1 19:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm, Oh well. - Sun Nov  1 19:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Now if only I had those other things. I could make amazing weapons. - Sun Nov  1 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Well, At least you managed to make a bit of money. - Sun Nov  1 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: I suppose so, yes. But imagine making an ENERGY bow. That would be amazing. But I'd need an Energy Limiter and an Energy Core. - Sun Nov  1 19:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I wouldn't know anything about that. - Sun Nov  1 19:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: I suppose not. - Sun Nov  1 19:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: You want anything? - Sun Nov  1 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Nah, already had some Vegetable Ramen. - Sun Nov  1 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: I should go. - Sun Nov  1 19:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Greetings, fellow Konohagakure villagers. - Tue Nov  3 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Sup. - Tue Nov  3 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: I am currently selling weapons -- Mostly Katanas, Zanbatou's and Broadswords. - Tue Nov  3 01:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: How much? - Tue Nov  3 01:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Katanas for 100 Yen, Zanbatou's for 200, Broadswords for 150. - Tue Nov  3 01:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: - - Tue Nov  3 01:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Rather cheap, wouldn't you agree? - Tue Nov  3 01:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I gave that sword to my friend by the way Ryuu. - Tue Nov  3 01:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Did she enjoy it? - Tue Nov  3 01:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Let me get like three Katana. - Tue Nov  3 01:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Three Katanas? - Tue Nov  3 01:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Yup. - Tue Nov  3 01:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Alright...Coming right up. - Tue Nov  3 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Yeah, She did. - Tue Nov  3 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: She would be around right now but she's on a trip to Suna. - Tue Nov  3 01:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) would hand him the three ordered Katanas. (Color them as you see fit, and name them as you see fit). "That'll be 300 Yen." He said, a small smile on his face. "I hope you enjoy it."* - Tue Nov  3 01:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Can I make you any other weapon? - Tue Nov  3 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Nope. - Tue Nov  3 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Very well. - Tue Nov  3 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Well this is interesting. - Sat Nov 14 21:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Greetings, you three. - Sat Nov 14 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) simply raised his shoulders, making a shrugging motion as he began to speak. "I come in peace, don't worry." He began. This male spoke in a rather dull, calm voice, as his eyes looked straight towards Tetsumi. He let his shoulders rest, as he walked a tad bit closer to Tetsumi. His intention was to keep a safe distance to show he didn't intend to fight or anything, but simply to get a bit more attention this way.


"I'm here today, traveling throughout as many lands as I could get around entering without...Ya know, the death penalty. I've done some transactions with this village before, and decided to come here and see if my services can once again be provided." He then reached into his pants right pocket. Within seconds, a book had been revealed. "I'm a Blacksmith. Just here to see if anyone would be interested in buying some weapons." He said.* - Sat Nov 14 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: That is all I am here for, nothing else. You have my word. - Sat Nov 14 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) nodded, as the blacksmith put his book away. With that, the male began to walk off to enter Sunagakure. "So, are any of you interested in buying?" He asked with a small smirk on his face. He was happy he was getting to sell. "My weapons are cheap -- According to what your people has told me before, for it's good quality."


He entered Sunagakure, and if they began to walk, he'd follow. At least until he found a reasonable enough person whom he thought he could talk to, and get them to buy some weapons.* - Sat Nov 14 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Jiki.. - Sat Nov 14 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Hmm... These two e- - Sat Nov 14 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Guesss not. - Sat Nov 14 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Oh, I remember some of these..~ - Sat Nov 14 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: What is it, Ai? - Sat Nov 14 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: ? - Sat Nov 14 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Busy..? - Sat Nov 14 22:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Don't think I'll be after this. - Sat Nov 14 22:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Up for a round..? - Sat Nov 14 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Sure.. Why not.. I guess. - Sat Nov 14 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) would then raise his hand, lookin at Mitsunara. "I'm a Swordsman. Though, I am also a blacksmith. I create Katanas most of the time, especially for people in this village." He said, smiling at the girl. "And I'm always willing to teach someone my ways."* - Sat Nov 14 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: From it* - Sat Nov 14 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Is it okay if I watch? - Sat Nov 14 22:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: I'm not busy at the moment. The only reason I entered this place was to sell my weapons for....A reasonable price. - Sat Nov 14 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Now that people had heard me say this -- Just now, they'll come if they wish for the said weapons. - Sat Nov 14 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Hmm.. A'ight. - Sat Nov 14 22:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ah, well. - Sat Nov 14 22:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I'm good on swords, but I'm willin to pay a bit for sword-lessons, if you know any good moves, or a proper style? - Sat Nov 14 22:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Cus.. as it stands... - Sat Nov 14 22:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I'm pretty strong, but I don't know any proper moves, y'feel me? - Sat Nov 14 22:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Well...Hows about you show me what you can do? I don't intend to spar you -- As I myself am not that good. Or...Maybe I am, but I wouldn't know. I'm quite a pacifist.....Sigh-- Sorry, I'm a little strange. Not used to having a student or anything, you know? Anyway...The cost would be a one time fee of two thousand. Is that okay, or should we both find a more reasonable price? - Sat Nov 14 22:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Sure, two thousand is fine. Let's head out to the arena. YOu want me to show you what I can do by sparrin someone else, or by just doin Kata or somethin? - Sat Nov 14 22:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) , noticing this, would raise his right eyebrow in confusion. "I'd rather you fight against someone else. It'd allow me to see your battle experience along with your ability to wield a sword." He said. "But before that...Do you have a Katana?" He asked.* - Sat Nov 14 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I have a Nodachi. - Sat Nov 14 22:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I just don't hve it out right now. - Sat Nov 14 22:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: It's a pain to explain, so I'll show you in a bit. - Sat Nov 14 22:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: A Nodachi, huh? Those aren't good for close combat though. Those are more for cavalrymen. - Sat Nov 14 22:30:49 2015
