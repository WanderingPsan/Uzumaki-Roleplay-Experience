<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Because, I'm not interested in fighting over something that has no gain to me.

<br><font color=yellow>*Baunton, Nicki(Guest_Girl) After successfully setting up the traps, Aura thought she'd do a practice run in training. Wiping off the sweat from her forehead, she makes her way to a nearby tree which was covered in snow. Looking at the tree that was at average height, she says to herself "This will be a perfect training partner." seeing that it was of average height of a person or adult, which was taller then her. Aura left foot slides on the moist ground as she moves it backward as her other foot stiffen as her arms lift into the air as the palm of her hands daggered the tree as if they were in a fight. Aura is copying the stance of Kuro and Gokou (Jyuuken.) Giving herself a boost as she leaps to attack the tree. She begins hitting on the tree for countless minutes to her. Stops hitting the tree as she get tired. As she stops her injured arms make there way into her pocket, reaching a slice of crumbled bread. Taking a bite of the bread, Aura feels as if she could train harder, which she does. As Aura tosses the remains of the bread, she throws a kunai at a wire hanging from the trees. As the kunai cuts the wire, releasing three cables which released 3 logs that swung back and forth, 

Aura was starting to train her agility. As one log swirled back into the hidden trees, Aura takes time to run pass it, as she's in the middle of where it would come from, the log comes in about to hit Aura. Not wasting anytime Aura jumps forward, barely missing the log which had scratched into her kin, causing a cut on her waist….After failing that she thinks she would go back to training with her stance.

After having stopped the logs from continuing on with there movement, Aura goes back  to the tree that she was training on. There, she makes the stance once more this time she felt a little bit at ease with this stance as it started to catch up with her why other Hyuugas did it. Having done the stance, she begins striking the tree over and over with her palms. Till she got tired, Aura wouldn't stop till she felt she needed to which out of sheer will, Aura attacks the tree countlessly till she stops.

Begins hitting the tree once more, in the stance that she was getting accustomed to. Hitting the tree, her palms start to feel harden as her hands were growing immune to the hits. She was barely able to feel the palms of her hands as she kept hitting the tree, the immunity of attacking with this stance was just starting "Hii ya!" As she's attacking she begins manipulating her chakra to her hands, trying to give a move powerful blow to the tree. As she made connect the tree begins to shake as she hit it with enough force that its roots start shaking. Aura started to feel the pain, but ignores it as she strikes the tree with her right hand this time, she then begins to notice the pain, and stops training to heal the hand. Going to her bag, she reaches for a miniature pillow or puffy bandaid, and places it her the palm of her hands. To keep it there, Aura warps her entire hand and half of her arm in warping paper or cloth as its called. She begins to flex, trying to get used to it.

After an hours of trying to get into the new form of fighting style that she'd copy, and also getting into the cloth she begins training once more. After reaching the tree she's been training on, she begins to hit the tree with the palm of her hands, it was much easier to strike the tree, but less force as the padding in between the bandage and her palm was restricting damage. Ignoring it because she couldn't tell how the tree was feeling but knew how she was feeling. 

After a few minutes of training, Aura thinks about taking a break but decides not to "I came here to train… For the next few days, there will be breaks, nor naps!" As she yelled naps, a surge of chakra explodes from her hands and onto the tree, creating a deep dent into the tree, destroying the bark. Aura observes the dent, surprised that she did that "So they disable it with…Chakra. It starts to make sense as chakra could affect someone else chakra, such as genjutsu." Placing her arms downward and letting them swing in the air, she thinks more about this subject and how she could do this.

After a few minutes of thinking about how she could do what Kuro and Gokou did, Aura comes to the conclusion that she needs to test it out, and not sit there and just think it over. Instead Aura goes the a different tree seeing that the training one was heavily damaged. Going to a slightly larger tree, Aura makes the same stance she has been doing for the pass two days. She begins to strike the tree. After attacking the tree for a number of times, she begins exerting chakra from her hands, doing this Aura's attacks begin to affect the tree as the bark from the tree begins to break. Attacking the tree, she notices that she was getting fatigued quicker, as her chakra was draining quickly. As soon as she notices Aura immediately stops "Doing this is taking after my chakra… At a rapid rate." Saying to herself.  Now was the time that she takes a break, to replenish her chakra.
Has a hour break as of now.

Coming from her break, Aura feels refreshed as she had taken a short nap, and having eaten about 3 Rice balls which she had been saving for later. She finds herself in front of the new tree once more "Alright tree lets get this started!" Aura begins training on the tree, as she strikes the tree as if a tiger were attacking a small animal. Hitting the tree with the palm of her hands, Aura adds some chakra into her punches, but only hits the tree like that two times, one in each hand. She wasn't trying to drain her chakra like she normally would, but instead goes to normal training, she's going with a plan to attack normally and attack using chakra every so often, giving her chakra the right amount of time to go back to its normal status, or close to near it. *

<br><font color=yellow>*Baunton, Nicki(Guest_Girl) Walking around in the fields of the academy, happy to have just became a part of the shinobi ranks as a genin, Miya bugs seemed to move around a lot "Hmm?" Looking through her glasses, she moves her eyes downward directly to what seemed like a small tree. Able to talk to the bugs and be able to hear them talk back, Miya asks what they wanted to do, they responded by using their body movements to face toward the tree, which made Miya body move forward a little, but not visible pasted her jacket. Looking  at the tree she wondered if they would listen to her "Well I guess we can do this…" The kikachu inside her body seemed to move around, encouraged that the wanted to do that, some reason unlike Miya, her bugs where sociable or rather excited most of the times unlike Miya who frowned on everything and was socially awkward.
Glancing at the tree for a period of time, her bugs tried to rush her into letting them to go toward the tree, but they were loyal to her and didn't rush her as much as it would be annoying "Ok… Ok lets do this you guys." Still looking at the tree which seemed as if it was a normal tree that was growing at a average rate. Getting the idea that the tree wasn't actually a tree she observes it by moving around the tree seeing if there was any problems with or about the tree that interested her Kikachu "I don't se-"  Stopping on that notion, she sees that there was a fist sized hole at the back of the tree. For some reason, this hole in the tree made the kikachu in her body explode in excitement "Calm down, calm down.." a smirk comes upon Miya's face she starts taking a few steps backwards "I'm going to try something with my knowledge of chakra." Taking another few steps backward, she starts thinking on how she could maybe use chakra to affect herself.

Placing her hand on her chin, Miya tells herself "I just learned this.. I know this." Thinking harder, Miya places her hand that was on her chin to chest level. She then places her free hand on chest level as well. Bringing the two hands together, she makes a hand sign where her right index and middle fingers are on top of the entire hand. Remembering what happened in her head what her teacher told her about chakra control a flash back memory comes to mind "To control chakra you must first relax, and allow your mind to wander abit. By doing so, chakra will course throughout your body, if you are good at controlling this chakra as shown by Samona and Miya, it would take you less time to do so then others." Coming back from the flash back, Miya tightens up her hands together "Got to focus.." As Miya begins to clear her mind of any outside forces she thinks about mental and physical energy placed inside of her.
After two seconds of focusing, a bluish coloring surrounds Miya in a sharpened form which wiggled on the sides a few time but was mainly stable, Miya starts controlling the blue aura around her body. As she does did, it starts the decrease in coloring, causing it to vanish slowly. As the aura vanishes it would impact Miya's skin, creating small harmless holes on her entire body "…" Coming from the holes that were planted inside Miya's body were what seemed like bugs with hard shells which encased their wings.  These bugs came at 2-5 at a time, as they came from the holes, they moved all across Miya's body.  She raises her arms out, facing the tree "Kikachu's go outside of my coat, and appear in swarms." Arms lifted in the air, black specs start to appear on Miya's coat, specs that move which were the Kikachu's. In a short period time the specs gathered and stuck onto the arms of Miya, making only parts of her coat visible, not even her hands were seeable because the bugs gathered mainly on the hands and the center of Miya's arm "Perfect." She stated at herself and the bugs. Looking at the tree, Miya sends a telepathic thought to every one of her bugs listened to her. 

Doing as they are told by their host, the bugs  fly with an incredible speed, this amount of speed surprised Miya herself "!!!" As the bugs flew with a unknown speed, they reach the tree by the dozens "I can't believe there that fast." Watching with amazement, Miya watches as the bugs spread out slowing, as they do it had seemed as if the leaves on the tree were dying but Miya didn't take note of this at first. Watching with amazement Miya gains another smirk on her face, as the bugs slightly covered over entire tree trunk. The tree covered in bugs was barely noticeable, except for blotches that only little bugs where attached to. Miya getting tired but at the same time excited that she was able to control the bugs "Ok its time to go." Lifting her arms, Miya sends a telepathic message to the bugs, telling them to come back and return to Miya's body. It takes the entire group of bugs to listen to Miya, but in time they start to fly toward Miya.

After been gathered up and returned to Miya's body, the holes which allowed the bugs to leave Miya's body heal, the flesh would seem as if the holes never appeared in the first place. She lifts her arms down, Miya looks at the tree, not being able to notice that the leaves of the tree had turned into a dark brown color. Not being able to notice this, Miya begins to walk away from the area of the academy, leaving the academy trying to find her brother, Aburame Famas. Still walking, she didn't notice that the tree had vanished from the air. But something appeared, it was a Iwagakure jounin, who must have transformed into the tree. He must have been spying on the hidden leaf village. Still never to notice this, Miya keeps on walking telling her kikachu's that they were doing going to train harder and harder. *
