<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) nodded his head as his eyes watched the sparring session. It was now becoming questionable if this indeed was a sparring session. He personally didn't have a problem with honing one's skill, as many believed it to be a form of meditation.  However, from what he's seen thus far, the individual with the sand gourd was rather excessive. 

He take a deep breath, standing up from his seat. "Chikyu, is there a reason that shinobi over there is being excessively reckless?", he asked, taking a few steps forwards.* - Sun Nov 29 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: ....Yeah, they just normaly do that. - Sun Nov 29 20:52:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) could see that things were escalating quickly. He was already weary of what was going on, thus when he noticed Momura charging forwards like a while beast, he knew the situation wasn't going to end well.

Even though he'd never seen Momura go all out, he knew that she could inflict great harm, especially after hearing of her victory over Chikyu.  The monk took a deep breath, sprinting forwards towards the three.   He wasn't as fast as Momura,  but speed didn't factor much. Just because one was faster than the other, didn't mean that they had the advantage overall.

Of course, Momura would reach the sand user first, but shortly after reaching her destination, Kuro was right behind her. Quickly, he began to rotate his body, sliding his leg along to gain momentum, all while ejecting chakra from his frame.  The chakra swirled around, forming a barrier to repel those in the area.

"Stop this at once! Be civilized!", he shouted.* - Sun Nov 29 21:47:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) was rather furious. He crossed his arms, looking over at the group.  He'd shake his head in disbelief. "This is not a spar.
