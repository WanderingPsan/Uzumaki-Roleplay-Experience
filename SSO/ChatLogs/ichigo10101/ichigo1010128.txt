<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Trilliam(ZaVante) says: Yes Kuro It was crazy they were putting me throw walls and stuff. - Tue Dec  8 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Trilliam(ZaVante) says: Like man. - Tue Dec  8 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Wanna see or something? - Tue Dec  8 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Sure. - Tue Dec  8 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Speaking about the next move, Bro says you have like a jutsu to make clones. - Tue Dec  8 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Can you teavh me that? - Tue Dec  8 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) nodded as he was all too familar with the technique.  It was something that was taught to him by a long departed friend.   Recalling such experience didn't prompt the monk to exhibit a sadden face, rather he smiled at the youth's acomplisment. "That's rather impressive," he called out.

He then extended his hand out after executing the required amount of seals. Raiton chakra began to ripple around his forearm, traveling down into his palm. The energy crackled as a small orb started to form. He kept the technique rather basic, and held  it in his hands for a brief moment. "I can still see room for improvement, but fret not you'll get there one day," he spoke, tossing the ball into the air.

The chakra ball was launched into the air and never to be seen again as it eventually disapated into chakra particles. "If I knew more, I'd help with your training," he added, stuffin his hands into his robes.* - Tue Dec  8 00:56:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Trilliam(ZaVante) says: WHy is it so quite here. - Tue Dec  8 02:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) was on his way out of the village when he noticed a child on the outskirts. His eyes locked onto her figure as he walked over towards her direction. "Hello there. Are you lost?", he aske,d not recognizing the face of the child.  He gave her a heartwarming smile.* - Tue Dec  8 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) was walking around his old home, hands in his robes and his eyes tracing over just about everything in view. The village had done a great job in rebuilding over the last few months. A smile formed across his mouth as he continued to walk and examine the village.

He suddenly stopped as he noticed the Raikage, and a few faces. Most of them he didn't recognize, in fact he only recalled one other beside the Raikage, but that was only because he ran into the male before.  Other than that, their faces were new.

With a smile still present on his face, he waved at the robed figure. "I see that the village is looking better than the last time I came," he spoke.* - Tue Dec  8 02:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Me? I'm just a wandering monk. I used to live here a while ago. - Tue Dec  8 02:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Alright. - Tue Dec  8 02:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You? - Tue Dec  8 02:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I recall seeing you in Suna not too long ago. - Tue Dec  8 02:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Yeah, was there for awhile. - Tue Dec  8 02:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Got taught a technique, and left. - Tue Dec  8 02:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: What is the point of serving a village...Everyone around me is dead... - Tue Dec  8 02:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: ...... - Tue Dec  8 02:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) glanced over at Aiyana. He recalled her, but due to not seeing her for quite some time, he couldn't fully recall who she was.  She bore similarities to both Ushinawa and Misa, both people who he knew well.  However, for some odd reason, he couldn't match the resemblance, chucking Aiyana's facial features to be a passing face.  

He let out a sigh, now feeling slightly annoyed as to why she looked awfully familiar.* - Tue Dec  8 02:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) says: Hm... - Tue Dec  8 02:46:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) thinks: What kind of name is Kuro. - Tue Dec  8 02:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) thinks: This man is a fuckboy. - Tue Dec  8 02:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yes, I have. I haven't visited in a while, so I figured I'd see how things are going. - Tue Dec  8 02:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: After all, this is still my home. - Tue Dec  8 02:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I suppose it is. - Tue Dec  8 02:47:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Kumogakure will remain on high alert. - Tue Dec  8 02:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: For the time being. - Tue Dec  8 02:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Sunagakure shinobi who are present - do not harm them, simply keep an eye on them with our forces, along with Konohagakures. We will ensure everything goes down smoothly. - Tue Dec  8 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: What's going on? - Tue Dec  8 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Are you going to request their forces to leave? - Tue Dec  8 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: That is a thought. - Tue Dec  8 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I'm conflicted. - Tue Dec  8 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I suppose so. - Tue Dec  8 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: What's going on for the village to be on high alert? - Tue Dec  8 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Kumogakure's independence. - Tue Dec  8 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Kumogakure's independence? - Tue Dec  8 02:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Yes. - Tue Dec  8 02:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I haven't been keeping up with village news, but can you explain to me what do you mean? Independence from what? - Tue Dec  8 02:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Lord Raikage. - Tue Dec  8 02:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Yes, and I will explain in a second? - Tue Dec  8 02:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: This goes back to my request from earlier. - Tue Dec  8 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Hmm. - Tue Dec  8 02:58:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Consider it done. - Tue Dec  8 02:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Then your request is granted. - Tue Dec  8 02:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: There's a Hokage now? - Tue Dec  8 02:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Hm..Is it that woman with the blonde hair? - Tue Dec  8 03:00:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Mhm. - Tue Dec  8 03:00:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I saw the previous Raikage in Konoha not too long ago. - Tue Dec  8 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: To say she was a leader is an insult to Kumogakure. We let her go where she wishes. - Tue Dec  8 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: She? How many Kages has this village has seen. - Tue Dec  8 03:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: But she was still a Raikage. You can't erase history. - Tue Dec  8 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: A lot of things in this village should be erased. - Tue Dec  8 03:09:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: That's foolish. A person that abandoned their village shouldn't have the honor to be claimed.. She left Kumogakure in the midst of danger, she was no Raikage. - Tue Dec  8 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) chuckled at Aiyana's response. "No matter where I go, there's still people like this. Well,they aren't naive principles, rather it's a means of inner peace. You should accept what remains and build upon it. Make something new out of soil.  I've already seen the village has done such," he spoke.* - Tue Dec  8 03:17:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: For the village... - Tue Dec  8 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'd assume they would be on friendly terms because of Hideki. - Tue Dec  8 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) says: It's funny. - Tue Dec  8 03:28:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) says: For them. - Tue Dec  8 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) says: Kirigakure wanted my head on a platter. - Tue Dec  8 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: That bastard is also in Kirigakure? - Tue Dec  8 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) says: Hideki is deceased. - Tue Dec  8 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Hideki? No. He passed a while ago. - Tue Dec  8 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) says: He unlocked Obito's sharingan too smh - Tue Dec  8 03:29:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) looked over at Aiyana, looking closer at her face.  He was really getting a familar vibe from her. It didn't even dawn on him that she herself revealed who she was.  "I'm a friend of his, and his family. In a sense, he's like a little brother to me," he answered.* - Tue Dec  8 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Wow she's a bitch. - Tue Dec  8 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Perhaps, but I doubt they'd be shattered so easily. - Tue Dec  8 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Why are you interested in Heiwa? Speaking of which, you seem awfully familar. - Tue Dec  8 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see..Then I suppose you're his last living blood relative.  From which side are you related to him from if I may ask? - Tue Dec  8 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I feel as though we've met before, or at least I've seen your face around the village. - Tue Dec  8 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: Hm. - Tue Dec  8 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: From his father side. - Tue Dec  8 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: And yes i'm quite aware now...Tis the reason why i belittle your principles...Why they won't last in such a world were everything is ripped from you... - Tue Dec  8 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So you're related to him through Ushinawa, Misa, and Hideki huh? - Tue Dec  8 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) thinks: I wonder if she too was warned by Niza. - Tue Dec  8 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: Hideki... - Tue Dec  8 03:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: And Gintoki... - Tue Dec  8 03:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Gintoki? I don't think I've met them before. - Tue Dec  8 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: But I've a question, did Niza ever give you a warning? - Tue Dec  8 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: Of course not...Niza Killed Gintoki.. - Tue Dec  8 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: I was given many warnings in the past..But by Niza none. - Tue Dec  8 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see. - Tue Dec  8 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: Which is why it strikes me as odd that Heiwa decided to live in Kirigakure despite the past. - Tue Dec  8 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) says: I know nothing of Heiwa. - Tue Dec  8 03:57:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: I see. - Tue Dec  8 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yeah. After Niza's death, things started to go downhill for the village. - Tue Dec  8 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: Is the Gezo world goverment still in power? - Tue Dec  8 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yes, sadly. - Tue Dec  8 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) was traveling around the village. It was awfully quiet inside of Konoha, a bit too quiet. It gave an ominous vibe, but that was usually the case for deserted areas. As he continued to walk around the village, he noticed a male standing all alone.  A friendly smile materialized upon the monks face as he waved hello. "Quite a wonderful day, don't you think?", he asked.* - Tue Dec  8 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) tilted his head slightly as he was a bit confused of the response. Was he a dangerous individual? He shrugged his head and took a few steps forwards.  He extended his hand out in a friendly manner, "Kuro's the name.  What about yours?"* - Tue Dec  8 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) halted his advance and lowered his hand.  He stuffed it into his kimono and gave a saddened look to the shinobi. "No need to be afraid. I'm no threat," he spoke, now smiling at the male once more.

"Anyway, it's a pleasure to meet you Kai."* - Tue Dec  8 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Did I do something to frighten you? - Tue Dec  8 05:03:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) kept his arms crossed, nodding to Kai's words. "I see. It would be nice if you can," he spoke just moments before noticing Osuda's approach. He glanced over at the male with weary eyes.  "Hello again. It's been quite some time," he called out.* - Tue Dec  8 05:23:24 2015
