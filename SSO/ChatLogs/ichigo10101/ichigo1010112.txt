<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was tired of sitting around and doing nothing. Ever since found his way back to Sunagakure, he's been meditating day in and day night, trying to return back to his saint like roots. The events that transpired in his home village all caused him discomfort, and slowly began to corrode.

However, after getting a wake-up call from Reguel, we was slowly going back on track to his original objective.  Well, his objective never changed, just the view of his world.  The pain that he suffered had all made him doubt his end game, but it was for that reason that he began this life long journey of his.

He turned his body towards Reguel and smiled at his friend. "I'm going to be off.  I'll look for Yukio and continue my training. I'll shoulder the wills of our friends that passed, and I'll bring about an era of peace.  No more will I let their cries go to waste," he spoke. He had determination in his eyes.  The embers that were once snuffed out were now burning vibrantly in his eyes.* - Tue Oct 27 04:35:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: That's because our chakra does not drain our physique. - Tue Oct 27 05:07:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) watched Yukio's demonstration.  It was a new experience to him. The whole basis of spirit energy, light, and the gift were all new concepts to him; well not entirely. He understood some, but he was more interested in the Gift.  It was something he felt inside for a long time, but had no understanding of what it was.  His eyes focused on Yukio with all of his attention, absorbing everything that the priest spoke like a sponge.* - Tue Oct 27 05:12:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: But before I try this, what can the Gift do? You said it was like Natural energy and very similar to light.   - Tue Oct 27 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: Well. - Tue Oct 27 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: I can demonstrate something. - Tue Oct 27 05:34:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: I'll show you what the finished result could look like. - Tue Oct 27 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Alright then. - Tue Oct 27 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: Make sure you read that scroll I left for you. - Tue Oct 27 05:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: We'll continue later. - Tue Oct 27 05:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) listened to the words of Yukio. He was confident in achieving the desired effect, but he wasn't entirely sure how. He took a few steps back mentally, focusing on the meditation aspect of the training. It was through meditation that he was able to grasp ahold of the Gift, so it wasn't farfetched to belief that meditating would bring control to it. 

The young monk sat down onto the green grass before Yukio, folding his legs similar to a pretzel. His back was erected straight as he lowered his arms, placing his hands a few centimeters below the waist.  "I can do this," he thought to himself as he closed his eyes and began to breathe in an alternative pattern.  

Oxygen flowed through his nostrils and carbon from his lips.  His chest would expand with each intake of air, and compress when released.  At the beginning it was of a normal average pace, but as he concentrated deeper into getting into his meditative state, the intervals widened.  His breathing became rhythmic in nature, as his focus fortified.

The world around him slowly began to fade as he started to achieve a sense of self.  His focus was needed in this regard as a single misstep could cause him to exit from his trance. As time progressed with each second, his mind sank deeper and deeper into his soul. 

The various collective thoughts that he once had ceased to be as he found himself no longer worrying about the past, rather focusing on the picture at hand; a future of peace and tranquility. As he ceased the distracting thoughts, he began to feel a foreign yet familiar presence boil from deep within.  The presence was neither weak nor strong, instead it felt of balance. 

From the depths of his mind, he reached out towards the presence, wishing to get closer to it. His arm stretched out, nearing the presence. Perhaps, this was the Gift's form in his mind. It had no form, rather it was just a mass of light in a room of void.  He could feel the presence yet couldn't fully grasp at it.   Kuro knew that he wouldn't be able to achieve something such as this on the first try, rather it was through practice that he'd finally achieve his desired goal. This was only the first steps to realizing the truth.

As his spiritual self continued towards the Gift, he could feel its power basking his form. It felt warm, and at the same time refreshing. Just as he felt like he was going to finally touch it, he stopped. The monk opened his eyes, feeling calm but for some reason reluctant to touch the Gift. He looked over at Yukio with a serene expression on his face. Upon hearing his words, he nodded and picked up the scroll. "I'll read it and learn it," he spoke, glancing down at the folded up gift.
* - Tue Oct 27 05:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) looked down at the scroll that rested in his lap.  It reminded him of the time he trained with Niza. A smile formed on his face as he unwrapped the scroll to view its contents. His eyes scanned every letter to the 'T', as the technique was meant for his eyes and his eyes only. 

He immediately recognized the technique as the one that both Niza and Yukio used. However in regards, Yukio's technique was more potent than Niza's. That mattered not as Yukio was the teacher for both Niza and Kuro.   He continued to smile about the fond past as he resumed his training.

Kuro was in a calm state, in fact he was probably in the calmest state he could possibly be in. He felt the Gift course through his body from his prior meditation. It was as if his very being was supercharged, but at the same time it wasn't. He felt a sense of serene.

The monk opened his mouth to allow air to fill up his chest. His chest expanded as oxygen flowed into his lungs. As he did so, he'd mold this own chakra into his vocal chords.  He had witnessed the technique multiple times and knew where its power lied in. It was from the Gift. Using the Gift, he began to mix it with his own chakra, using his throat as a focal point.

The two energies swirled in his throat as the power continued to build up. There was no telling how his version of the technique would fare, but it was better than nothing. Quickly, he released the fused energies out with a loud roar, sending a shockwave out into the open. The wave traveled quite a distance, but soon faded into the air. 

Upon exiting from his maw, he found himself completely drained. He quickly fell to the ground, trying to keep himself up. His breathing became heavy as the technique quickly took its toll. Indeed, this was a fearsome and taxing technique. Instead a look of anguish, a smirk formed on his face. "I can obtain peace," he whispered to himself before allowing his body to lay upon the grass.* - Tue Oct 27 06:31:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) walked through the large arches leading into Konoha's mansion. He'd calmly step forward, stopping a few feet from the shirtless man. His eyes glanced around the area, locking directly onto Kyushiki.

A smile would form onto his face as he raised his left hand to cover the upper portion of his eyes. The monk would begin to chuckle to himself as tears slowly flowed down his eyes.

"I see, I wasn't the only one who survived," he muttered, quickly wiping the tears away and forming a serene expression.

"Hello there," he'd call out, looking as if he was at peace.* - Wed Oct 28 03:05:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: The first step to doing that is through understanding one and another. - Wed Oct 28 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Why do you have hair? - Wed Oct 28 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Anyway, Ichiro. - Wed Oct 28 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Sorry. Please continue. - Wed Oct 28 03:15:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: My Queen is still within Amegakure... - Wed Oct 28 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: And surely you know that not all villages have a 'Kage.' - Wed Oct 28 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Then how are you suppose to guard her. - Wed Oct 28 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Uh...I think they do. - Wed Oct 28 03:20:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Then there is someone guarding her now? - Wed Oct 28 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Yes. - Wed Oct 28 03:20:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: But I see your point. - Wed Oct 28 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) could feel that he was being made fun of by the male. He was used to it by now. Not everyone could understand the greater picture that he was trying to paint.  He let out a sigh as he took a few steps forwards towards Kyushiki. 

"If you see anyone else from Kumogakure, pleasse let them know that everything will be alright. The days of peace will come soon," he spoke, turning around on his heels. 

The monk would then begin to walk away from the grounds waving a farewell towards the three.* - Wed Oct 28 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: I'm under the impression that he doesn't know Kage only applies to the five most major villages... - Wed Oct 28 03:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Alright. - Wed Oct 28 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: See ya. - Wed Oct 28 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Farewell, and stay safe. - Wed Oct 28 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was walking around the village with a serene expression pasted onto his face.  He'd look around, examining nature at it's finest. Ever since he resumed his training, and received the wake-up call from Reguel, he's been in a better mood and more focused.  Perhaps it's because of the gift that he was able to feel such emotions.

As he walked around the village, he spotted two shinobi who he recognized, yet had no name for. He approached the two, waving at them in a friendly manner. After all, he was still a guest of the village.

"Hello there, how are the two of you doing?", he'd ask, stopping just a few feet away from the two.* - Wed Oct 28 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) looked at Koji with a widened expression. He was awestruck. "Shouldn't you be worried about revealing your eyes to people?", he questioned, recognizing the form and the doujutsu itself.  Never in his life would he figured he'd meet another user of the stance.  * - Wed Oct 28 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) thinks: I guess they are more relaxed here about their eyes.. - Wed Oct 28 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Mmm, Training requires I be at full power, but I have precautions. - Wed Oct 28 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Precautions? - Wed Oct 28 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Precaurions... - Wed Oct 28 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Since you took that stance, and your eyes are like that, I can assume that you mean 'that'? - Wed Oct 28 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Nothing, I just found it interesting to see another person with those eyes. - Wed Oct 28 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I was just examining the beauty of nature. - Wed Oct 28 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Nature is beautiful and deserved to be observed by us in such a way. - Wed Oct 28 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) smiled as he raised his left hand up. "You don't have to be on guard. I'm no foe," he spoke out. As the words flowed from his tongue, chakra began to pour into his optic nerves. Various protrusions formed along the side of his face, stretching down to his temple.  His own eyes themselves began to take on an abnormal form.  His usual azure eyes diluded into a pure white.  Upon activating the doujutsu, he blinked and lowered his hand.

"I've the same eyes as you," he added.* - Wed Oct 28 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) nodded, "Oh, I'm sorry. Anyway, what was that technique you just used, and why use a cactus rather than a mental image?", he questioned. His eyes were drawn onto the compressed chakra that released from the male's palm. It reminded him of his own technique slightly, but in a more offensive manner. 

As his eyes were watching Koji's movements, he found himself questioning just what was it that he was practicing. The strikes were all executed in a certain rhythm which he was able to luckily pick up. Perhaps it was due to his own knowledge of the gentle fist style that he was able to even notice it.

"You're the first I've seen with eyes such as mine. Even that stance is similar to my own. Oh, I almost forgot to introduce myself. I'm Kuro, a traveling monk. And you?"* - Wed Oct 28 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) had never heard of the Hokumas, Desert Owl's or even Hassan having a Left Hand Man.  It was all new to him.  Perhaps it was something that came up while he was away.

The monk nodded his head, "I'm seeking unity. Well, to be more exact, I'm seeking peace.  I've reached enlightenment, at least what I believe to be it.  I feel it in my grasp.  And what exactly is the sixty-four palm and the air palm?  I can assume that this 'Air Palm;, is materialized chakra that's expelled from the hand. As for the 'Sixty-Four Palm', I'm not completely following it from what I'm seeing.  Perhaps it's a rapid move against the chakra nodes?", he spoke out, now crossing his arms.* - Wed Oct 28 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) smiled at the offer. "Thank you for the offer," he'd say as he bowed his head. He too sat down onto the ground. "So you too seek to obtain a true lasting peace?", he asked, drawing his sights upon the male.* - Wed Oct 28 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Of course, I hate to see people hurt it's why Istarted the new police force. Though, it doesn't look like it helped much with the bandits walking around it was much worse. - Wed Oct 28 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: There's a bandit issue around here? - Wed Oct 28 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: If I can, I'd like to help. - Wed Oct 28 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: Hello, Kuro. - Wed Oct 28 04:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: I figured I'd be able to find you here. - Wed Oct 28 04:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was still sitting in the dirt, conversing with Koji. As his doujutsu was still active, he had a greater sense of awareness than prior.  It wasn't until he saw Yukio enter his range that he smiled.  Before he knew it, his teacher had appeared before him.

The monk turned his head to the side and waved, "Hello Yukio. I've learned the technique you told me about," he spoke.* - Wed Oct 28 05:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: Excellent. - Wed Oct 28 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: We can move onto the real technique. - Wed Oct 28 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: The technique though it takes a toll on me. - Wed Oct 28 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: ---Speaking of which. - Wed Oct 28 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: Did you succeed with that little technique I taught you? - Wed Oct 28 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Hm? - Wed Oct 28 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: Using the Gift. - Wed Oct 28 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: I did some research.  - Wed Oct 28 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: I figured out that the Gift would have quite the unique effect on the chakra system. - Wed Oct 28 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) whispers: Though I'll get into detail when we're in private. - Wed Oct 28 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) whispers: We can go into a house sometime when you're available. - Wed Oct 28 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: If it's what we talked about before, yes I believe so. - Wed Oct 28 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'll keep that in mind.  - Wed Oct 28 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: Mind if I speak to you a little, Kuro, before you depart? - Wed Oct 28 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: Important stuff. - Wed Oct 28 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Oh, by the way, this is Yukio. Yukio, this is Koji.  - Wed Oct 28 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Sure. - Wed Oct 28 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'm not going anywhere in particular anyway. - Wed Oct 28 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: If that's the case, come with me. - Wed Oct 28 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Nice to meet you Yukio. - Wed Oct 28 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Ok. - Wed Oct 28 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: --Nice to meet you, Koji-kun. - Wed Oct 28 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) rose up to his feet as he dusted off the dirt that clung to his clothes.  He moved his limbs just enough to stretch them before turning towards Yukio. "Lead the way. Oh, and I hope to see you again Koji," he'd add.* - Wed Oct 28 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: ---------- - Wed Oct 28 05:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: Come. - Wed Oct 28 05:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: I have a technique to teach you. - Wed Oct 28 05:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: Now then. - Wed Oct 28 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: The technique I'm going to teach you is dangerous in a way. - Wed Oct 28 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: I's known as the Thousand Armed Murder. - Wed Oct 28 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Thousand Armed Murder? - Wed Oct 28 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: To use it though, you need the Blessing of Kannon. - Wed Oct 28 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: So I want you to meditate. - Wed Oct 28 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Wait, why is it called Thousand Armed Murder? Doesn't the name it has defeat the purpose of what we practice? - Wed Oct 28 05:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: It is an ultimate technique. - Wed Oct 28 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: That is the last resort. - Wed Oct 28 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: It has the potential to kill. - Wed Oct 28 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: But you do not use it to kill. - Wed Oct 28 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: You use it knock out. - Wed Oct 28 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: You generate thousands of hands. - Wed Oct 28 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: The hands can be freely manipulated. - Wed Oct 28 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It sounds dangerous.. - Wed Oct 28 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: You will be the successor to this technique though. - Wed Oct 28 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Does that mean Niza never learned this? - Wed Oct 28 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: He died before I could teach him. - Wed Oct 28 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: . . . . . - Wed Oct 28 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: .... - Wed Oct 28 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: That's all. - Wed Oct 28 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So, I must meditate for this technique? - Wed Oct 28 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) sat down onto the wooden flooring of the house.  He wrapped his legs together as he awaited for further instructions from Yukio.  The young monk was a bit nervous yet excited.  Never had he felt such a responsibility onto his shoulders, but he made up his mind the moment he stood back up from his downed state.  No matter what, he'd shoulder all the burdens of the world to achieve peace.  It may be a simple child like goal, but his heart was fully into it.

As he awaited for Yukio's instructions, Kuro rested his arms along his lap in preparation.* - Wed Oct 28 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: Yes. - Wed Oct 28 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: Simply meditate. - Wed Oct 28 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: Not a single movement. - Wed Oct 28 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: Not a single thought. - Wed Oct 28 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: You must not -think- about becoming stronger. - Wed Oct 28 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: You must simply be thoughtless. - Wed Oct 28 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) thinks: Thoughtless? How do I achieve that? - Wed Oct 28 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: How did you achieve a sense of thoughtlessness? - Wed Oct 28 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: You'll have to figure that out. - Wed Oct 28 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: If I tell you, you'll think about how to do that. - Wed Oct 28 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was a bit confused with Yukio's explaination. To become thoughtless was rather difficult in these times. Had he not experienced hardships, he probably would get a better sense of the objective at hand. 

Kuro just took a deep breath as he clasped his hands together forming a singular meditative seal. He slowly closed his eyes as his lids became heavy and his mind slowly focused on his task. 

He didn't know where to start, so he decided to just go for it. His eyes remained closed as he slowly relaxed his physical body. The once tight muscles that wrapped around his bones became loose with every second. His breathing too became relaxed.  His entire being was entering a state of peace in a sense, but it wasn't true to the word.  Kuro had only soothed his physical form and not his mental self. 

Here lies the true challenge. Yukio had told the youth to become thoughtless, however to achieve such a state, he needed to understand what thoughtless meant. To him, being thoughtless meant not caring for others, but that wasn't the meaning that he was told to express. If he had a better word for it, it would to achieve inner peace, or maybe to just become one.

His mind circled around in search for an answer. He had a difficult time searching for the solution as every time he thought he had it, he'd realize that he was thinking of something. It annoyed him slightly, even though he knew that his failures gave him experience. 

Outside, Kuro sat on the ground in a meditative and tranquil state. His body was Buddha like in nature while he meditated. There was not an error in his form, rather in his mind lied the errors. He continued to focus on the task at hand, going through his mind as if it were a series of file cabinets. With each draw that he opened, he found himself slowly getting closer and closer to his goal. However, in reality he was getting farther from it than he had intended.

The more 'draws" he opened, the more he became distracted with the thought of finding the sensation, rather than just experiencing it.  When he had finally realized it, he decided to start back from the beginning; a new start.

He once again took a deep breath as he retained his stance. Unlike prior, he decided to just go for the flow. The last time he went with the flow, he felt the Gift's presence and aura basking his soul. Perhaps that was the key, or at least he thought when he began. 

In the young monk's mind, he focused on the familiar sensation of the Gift. By now, he'd become familiar with accessing its energy. As Yukio had described before, it was akin to the natural energy that everything released. Using that information as a stepping stone, he reached for his mind's eye.  The monk just sat there and listened to the noise around him. Yukio's breathing, his own breath, the sounds of nature in the background, and just about anything else that was in the room. He could hear it all. 

For some strange reason, while he was in his meditative state, he felt as though he could hear better than before. As if nature was happening right before him. However, he was actually inside of a house, blocked out from nature. That mattered not to the monk as he continued to meditate.   As time continued to pass, he felt his body adjust more with the Gift.  He felt as though his senses were becoming finely tuned to the world around him as his body kept in its meditative state. But for some reason, it felt as though it wasn't enough.

Kuro continued to meditate, ceasing all of his thoughts. The thoughts of war, peace, friends, losses, hope, gains, everything started to fade from his conscious the further he concentrated. Rather, concentration wasn't the proper term for the focus that he had.  To concentrate required one to think, and he was trying to achieve a state in which he didn't think rather he'd become a mental void.  

His body was taking kindly to the effects of his meditation, as his aura began to seep out from his figure. A faint yellow hue began to engulf his body, remaining in a stagnant form. It neither had form, nor moved. It was just there covering his body as if it were a watchful eye. The aura gave off a calm feel, almost as if it would quell the anger of an individual.  Kuro remained in this state as he continued to feel for this sense of "thoughtlessness".* - Wed Oct 28 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) continued to meditate well after Yukio had left. His mind still held onto the feeling that he felt prior, the Gift. It was a unique feeling that washed over him as the yellow aura poured from his body. The aura itself wasn't large or dangerous, rather it was akin to a toddler. It was in need of growth, and through meditation and practice, it would soon receive the growth that it needs.

No more did he think of the problems at hand, rather he thought of solving them. In order for him to solve these problems he had to continue to void his mind of all obstacles. His friendships, fears, hopes, and regrets. The meant nothing to him in the face of progression. For now, he had to bury those thoughts into the recess of his mind. Even though such thoughts constantly plagued him on a daily basis, he had to ignore them for his training.

Should he not be able to, he wouldn't be able to take a step forward in achieving peace, and carrying the will of those who have passed. He had wanted to achieve peace using peace and he believed the key was through following the path he was on. It was going to be difficult, but he knew he could do it.

Just as an unknown amount of time passed, he slowly transitioned himself out from the trance. The ghastly aura lingered around his body for a few minutes, the faded away. Perhaps it was due to the fact that he didn't concentrate on the aura staying. Either way, he felt as though it was enough training for today. 

He slowly got up from his seat, feeling and hearing his stagnant bones pop and crack from remaining stationary for too long. He chuckled as he stretched his limbs, then shortly left. "Seems like I'm turning into an old man," he spoke to himself as he strolled through the door.* - Wed Oct 28 06:34:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was very curious about Necromancers and sensing them.  He pondered for a moment until he extended his hand outwards. With an opened palm, he began to focus his chakra causing his hand to glow a faint blue hue.   Suddenly, the blue began to delude as it's color slowly shifted into a yellow. 

"I don't know much about the light, but I've something similar to it. And my teacher is Yukio. I'm sure you've seen him when he sealed up Tetsujin in that white pillar," he spoke out. He quickly ceased pouring chakra into his hand, causing the glow to fade.* - Wed Oct 28 06:55:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Oh right. I lost against Susumu too. God damned necromancy. - Wed Oct 28 07:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) hearing Bryson's explanation of Necromancers caused him to recall a single person who seemed to fit the bill. He was an anarchist and wished for corpse to be brought to him. If that didn't cry weird, then nothing would.

"Do they call themselves priests too?", he asked unsure if the person in thought was or wasn't a necro.* - Wed Oct 28 07:07:56 2015
