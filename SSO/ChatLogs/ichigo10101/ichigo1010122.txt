<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) stood still for a moment, glancing at Yukio. "Here goes nothing," he muttered to himself.  He'd clasp his hands together, slowly closing his eyes and slowing his own breathing.  The initial beat held no rhythm, but soon it began to form. His breathing syncronized, almost showing no error in it's way. 

His mind cleared itself of all worldly worries, only focusing on tapping into the Gift.  He remained silent for a bit, drawing in the power that rested inside of his soul. A ghastly apparition began to form behind his figure as a yellow aura cloaked his figure. Soon, the apparition's form began to take shape, forming into a buddhist figure.   Once he had fully tapped into the gift, he opened his eyes to glance at Yukio.  He noticed Yukio's eyes drawn towards the tree, prompting himself to glance over.  "What's wrong?"* - Wed Nov 18 01:06:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) wasn't sure what was going on, but he took a few steps back.  Was this the threat Yukio spoke about before? His mind began to race with all sorts of ideas. "Alright," he responded with a grin.  In his current state, there wasn't much he could do.  

The last time he faced a Necromancer, people died, so this wasn't any laughing matter. As his own precaution, he applied chakra into his optic nerves, activating his Byakugan. 

"Let's hope this doesn't turn violent," he thought to himself.* - Wed Nov 18 01:16:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'll try. - Wed Nov 18 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) nodded his head to Yukio's words.  He had no reason to doubt his words, after all he's followed them this far and look where it lead him. To a place he could feel proud about. 

The monk sat down onto the ground, crossing his legs and resting his arms over his lap. It was a basic stance for meditation. As for the previous training sessions, he adapted a familiar take on the assignment. It's been said that a sound mind made a sound body, therefore to achieve his goal, he'd need to meditate.

Meditation brought him the Gift, and it brought him the avatar Kannon. Now, it was going to bring him the ability to materialize Kannon into the mortal plane.  It made him wary, but he knew which path he was taking. Yukio's words from prior rung in his head. He recalled the dangers of the technique, and what it can do without proper control. To have such weight on his shoulders made him fearful, but fear was a product of uncertainty.  He had no choice but to press forwards in hopes of achieving his long term dreams and to promote peace.

Kuro's fingers weaved together, forming a singular hand seal. It was a common seal seen amongst monks, and one he had familiarized himself with well.  As he continued to adapt his breathing into a slow rhythm and clear his mind, the ghastly figure of Kannon began to form around his figure.  His body illuminated with the golden aura unique to the Gift.  It wrapped around his frame almost as if it were a flame of sorts. 

The flame like aura's movements were calm and serene, showing no signs of energetic behavior.  To even call it a flame was a bit of an exaggeration.  However, flame or not, the aura gave a tranquil feel.  The avatar Kannon's spectral form hovered around Kuro, as if it were a watchful mother keeping an eye out for her child. 

Kuro had become accustomed to mixing his own chakra with that of the gift, as evident in his skill in using the "Monk Shockwave". It was a difficult technique to master, but he was able to do so.  He thought back to the training of said technique and began to take snippets from the experience and mesh them with the current training. 

His body remained stationary, gathering his inner chakra.  Unlike the monk shockwave, he had to bring forth the combined energy outside of his body, rather than expel it from within.  He began to channel his chakra, drawing forth energy from his abdomen and circulating it around his body.   The more he thought of the technique, the more he realized how familiar it was in terms of application.  

He had already learned many of the steps needed through his other techniques.  Practices that required one to expel chakra throughout his body, and to mix both the gift and his natural were already mastered. Now it was just the act of mixing the two together.

Kuro continued to channel the chakra in his body, slowly drawing in chakra from the Gift as well.  As he did so, the mystic gold aura began to sway back and forth, almost as if it were alive. The figure of Kannon remained, however its appearance dimmed one second and illuminated another.  The aura slowly began to feed into the specter, partially cloaking it in the golden light.

"Is this it?", he thought, as he continued to maintained his concentration.  He could feel the change in his chakra, as if it were draining. Then again, Yukio did say to use all of his chakra.   When Kuro recalled that step, he feared not for the consequences.   At first he was sending out a steady flow of mixed chakra, all while envisioning the image of Kannon.  Now, he began to give it his all.

Every ounce of chakra that he possessed was now being directed into the materialization of Kannon. Just imagining the figure became as simple as blinking one's eyes. He'd learned to tap into it quite early while he stayed in Sunagakure.  So, imagining Kannon's figure was no problem. The real problem was to bring it forth into physical being.  His body began to show signs of fatigue the more he applied his chakra to creating the physical form. 

The spectral figure behind him began to take in more shape. Instead of a ghastly figure, its image became more apparent. It started to look more like a guardian angel than a ghost.  However, there was one problem, Kuro couldn't maintain such a figure for long. Just as everything seemed to be going well, the figure vanished in thin air, leaving particles of golden light.

Kuro slumped over, opening his eyes as he placed his palms on his knees.  His breathing became heavy as he looked up towards Yukio. "T-that was difficult," he commented with a grin. "I felt as though I was there, like I could reach out and grasp it," he added. * - Wed Nov 18 02:08:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: And control them. - Wed Nov 18 02:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: Manipulate them. - Wed Nov 18 02:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So I must materialize Kannon again, and bring out the arms? - Wed Nov 18 02:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: Yes. - Wed Nov 18 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) nodded once again.  However, just bringing out the incomplete avatar of Kannon drained him of so much.  He took a deep breath, reinstating his initial meditative stance. His hands weaved together as they usually do, and his breathing slowed. 

"I'll bring out two, that should be enough," he thought as he began to dive into his mind. The feeling of materializing Kannon was still fresh in his mind, and thus it wasn't difficult to repeat the steps leading up to the very last portion. However, instead of visualizing Kannon alone, he began to visualize the protector's arms.  

Just like his own arms, he began to craft the avatar's limbs in his mind like a sculptor working on stone.  The arms were cleanly cut and muscular, possessing perfect form and shape.  His imagery of Kannon's arms were akin to those of a protective father.  No matter how you looked at them, they possessed strength unfathomable by others.  They possessed not physical strength, but a higher variation of strength, compassion.   The arms that Kuro imagined were more compassionate than physically strong.

As the monk continued to focus and imagine the features of Kannon, he allowed his chakra to once again mix with that of the gift. The tranquil aura formed around his body once more, now spiraling around as if it were shaping something.  Above the aura lied the spectral figure of Kannon once more.  It's calm and tranquil state hovered above Kuro, as it too was in a meditative state. 

The swirling chakra began to feed into Kannon, draining even more of the youth's reserves, giving rise to Kannon's physical form.  However, Kuro focused more on the arms.  For some reason Yukio wanted Kuro to bring for the arms of Kannon and to move them at will. It seemed like a difficult task, but he was sure to complete it given enough time and training.  

For the time being, he continued to feed his chakra into Kannon, now forming a single arm on the avatar. The arm extended from Kannon's back, resting itself idly in the air. Shortly after, a second arm formed, however its appearance looked a mix of physical and spectral.  It took rested in the air for a moment.  For now, Kuro had brought forth two of Kannon's arms.  It felt off just summoning one, so he pushed himself further for the second. 

He began to visualize moving the arms back and forth in his mind, which resonated with the avatar, causing it too to move abet slowly. It was similar to a golem moving.  Even though the movement was slow, it was still movement. * - Wed Nov 18 02:39:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) released the avatar, causing it's form and mass to crumble down into golden dust. The dust scattered around the room before vanishing with no trace.  He displayed fatigue. His body felt heavy and drained. He looked like a skeleton for a moment.

His eyes glanced around the room as he slowly exited. He'd keep his guard up, opting to continue his training inside of his home where he'd be certain to have secrecy.* - Wed Nov 18 03:51:15 2015
