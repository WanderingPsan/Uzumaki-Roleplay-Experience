However, it didn't really bother him much.  As he got closer to the female, he waved his hand in a friendly gesture. "Hello Raikage. Pleasure seeing your return.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) continued to follow the elongated dirt path. At the end of said path laid a fortress of earthly materials. Upon a closer inspection, he understood the fortress to be a village of sorts. "Hm..Could this be the place?", he thought to himself as he continued to travel along the path.

Eventually he came to a stop as he reached what seemed to be the gates of the settlement. His eyes glanced around, taking note of the security of the area. "Hello there," he spoke in a friendly tone, waving at those posted as guardsmen.* - Sat Oct 17 14:15:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You either wait by the gates until a chuunin or above pops up or you leave. - Sat Oct 17 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Sad to hear. I can get one later for you. I don't forget about people i've seen near the gates. - Sat Oct 17 14:26:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) chuckled to himself. He then looked over at Ryomen, then over at Kilm with a puzzled expression. "This village has rather tight security. I'm but a humble monk seeking life experiences while spreading the word of peace. I posses no weapons, only the clothes that are on my back," he spoke in a gentle tone.* - Sat Oct 17 14:27:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I can guarantee that when they get told to let you in then they'll let you in even when you leave the village and come back later. - Sat Oct 17 14:35:31 2015

It's been a while. I heard that you left Konoha. Heiwa has been looking for you for quite some time. I believe he's still in Konoha," he replied.* - Sat Oct 17 14:38:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't particularly like their influence on this world. I believe they are a source of the reason why we view ourselves as tools, and they further promote the mindset of killing for gain. - Sat Oct 17 14:40:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: And possibly learn some more techniques. - Sat Oct 17 16:47:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Honestly? I got used to that lifestyle. Adapted to it. - Sun Oct 18 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd love for you to try and stab me, just so I could spill your insides all over the place. - Sun Oct 18 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And the funny part about that? - Sun Oct 18 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't even dislike you. - Sun Oct 18 07:02:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: She's no Sand Shinobi. - Sun Oct 18 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) is waiting at the entrance of the village, speaking with a few guards. He was currently denied entry due to the fact that he had never been to the village before, and was currently awaiting for the approval of a chuunin or above officer.  

Waiting out at the gates wasn't so bad as he had met a few individuals while waiting.  In the end, he was being patient. * - Sun Oct 18 07:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was sitting on the side, legs crossed and his hands folded together forming a seal on his lap. He raised his head up, directing his sights over towards Yan.  His eyes widened out of a sense of surprise and familarity. "Oh, it's you. Yan right? It's me Kuro. We met in Konoha a while ago. I've come here for no reason in particular, just to learn from those around me.   I'm just a simple monk trying to view life through a different lens, in hopes that I may find what I'm looking for in life," he answered with a smile on his face.  He then lifted himself from off the ground, dusting the sand and dirt from his clothing.

The youth's azure eyes pierced Yan's figure, as a friendly aura wrapped around his figure. He then opened his mouth once more to add onto his initial statement, "I've also came to visit a friend of mine. His name is Reguel," the monk spoke.* - Sun Oct 18 07:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) nodded his head upon listening to the conditions. "I understand. And we met in Konoha. You were looking for Zeus, and I was leading you to him, but you decided to change your mind right before we met him. And you don't have to worry about any trouble from me. I'm a peaceful individual. Any problems that arise, can be solved with words and words alone," he spoke. His tone was genuine with his intent.

The monk honestly didn't think that there would be any problems upon his visit, and even if anything came up, it would be resovled peacefully.  Kuro then proceded to enter the village. As he stepped past Yan, he stopped for a brief moment, turning his body towards the shinobi. "Thank you once again," he spoke.  "Shall we go in together?", he added, gesturing to accompany the male back into the village. It would prove to be a great opportunity to become well adjusted with the residents of the village.* - Sun Oct 18 07:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: *cough* - Sun Oct 18 07:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah, sure. - Sun Oct 18 07:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: So, what is your goal? - Sun Oct 18 07:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I wish to find a means to obtain peace. - Sun Oct 18 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Doesn't everybody.~ - Sun Oct 18 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Well no..I shouldn't say that. - Sun Oct 18 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I am looking for the same thing. What have you learned from traveling? - Sun Oct 18 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I've learned that not everyone has the same mindset.  - Sun Oct 18 07:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's going to be a difficult thing to achieve, but I believe it's possible. - Sun Oct 18 07:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: There are alot of evil people....The world is based around fighting and killing. I mean, as much as I want peace, I've killed and even vowed to kill certain men. Is it evil to kill?---In your opinion? - Sun Oct 18 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't believe in murder. All lives are valuable. I understand that people feel the need that they must kill, but my journey is to change the way people think. Too many people view themselves as tools, which is a reason why we fight for our lives. - Sun Oct 18 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Is murdering and killing the same thing? - Sun Oct 18 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So to answer your question, I don't believe it to be 'evil' as evil is a relative word. There's no good or evil, just those with an open mind and those who refuse to think in a new way. - Sun Oct 18 07:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Taking the life of an individual is all the same. I've yet to take a life, and I hope that I don't have to. I've been told that such a day will happen, but I really wish one won't arise. - Sun Oct 18 07:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I can't agree with you there. We both are looking for peace in the world though...I don't see it happening without certain people dying. - Sun Oct 18 07:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I am willing to die in order to achieve peace..But I'm not here to die  without a fight. You will find a man one day that cannot be changed, and is destined to be killed or continue killing. - Sun Oct 18 07:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You will realize at that point, this world can't be so innocent....It will never be so innocent. - Sun Oct 18 07:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I know, but you'll never know unless you try. - Sun Oct 18 07:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Everything that I've been taught as been towards promoting the message of peace.  - Sun Oct 18 07:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, we take two paths towards the same goal. Maybe we will achieve it together, through different means. There are many ways to take down a beast. - Sun Oct 18 07:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Perhaps.. - Sun Oct 18 07:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: What is your image of peace? What defines it for you? - Sun Oct 18 07:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: When good men do not die needlessly... - Sun Oct 18 07:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I guess mine is from personal experiences. But my brother was murdered in cold blood and so was my closest friend. - Sun Oct 18 07:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And those men who killed him are the men I have vowed to kill. They are everyting that is wrong with the ninja world. We have a few like that in the village and I wish to change them for the better...From my experience, it's more probable that I'll have to kill them. - Sun Oct 18 07:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see. So your 'peace' is one where your loved ones don't die through the actions of other men? - Sun Oct 18 07:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I guess if you want to put it that way. I don't like to see people suffer and I do not like antagonism. When I see it, I want to kill it. If you let it grow, it becomes harder to kill...Kind of sick but it's true. - Sun Oct 18 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Yo. - Sun Oct 18 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not a murderer. - Sun Oct 18 07:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: One more word implying that and I'm ripping your nuts off with my hand. - Sun Oct 18 07:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Ah, a path of revenge..Revenge is akin to a flame. It burns anything and everything around you. However, lif used and directed properly, the flame can have pupose. - Sun Oct 18 07:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And I do have purpose. - Sun Oct 18 07:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'm sure you do, but it's the flame of revenge that should be directed to a positive outlook.  - Sun Oct 18 07:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: This is the only outlook I see. It's what I've lived. - Sun Oct 18 07:51:28 2015
