<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) watched the male with nervous eyes.  For some reason, things just felt off. The way Sado and Heiwa acted around this masked man just screamed warning. It wasn't the first that he'd seen the masked man either. The first was when Ushinawa and Niza were still alive, at least he's assuming it's the same one.  The second encounter was when he returned to Kumo, but he wasn't entirely sure if it was the same one as well.  

The monk watched as Heiwa moved closer which was another sign.  His eyes looked up over at the masked man who was referred to as Mizumi, keeping onto his toes.  Just as he saw the man lower his arms, he applied chakra into his optic nerves, activating his doujutsu.

Kuro quickly lunged forwards, feeling time move slower than usual.  His awareness had risen due to the hightened effects of his byakugan, while also the current surge of adrenaline that channeled through his body.

Kuro pulled Heiwa out of the way, pivoting his leg as he quickly began to rotate his body in a circular motion. Instantly, a dome of swirling chakra erected from his position, expanding to an arms distance. The dome would provide cover for Heiwa, who would now be behind Kuro, while also pushing Mizumi back.

He'd stop his rotation, glaring at the masked man. "Stop this at once," he said in a serious yet foreign tone.  "Let's solve this with words, not with violence," he added, now standing between the two.* - Tue Oct 20 05:21:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) thinks: But this eye spinny guy....need em. - Tue Oct 20 05:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) raised his hand, placing it directly infront of him, prompting his palms to face Mizume. "Stop. If you're going to keep this farce up, this situation may escalate. Please stop.  I can't trust your words of wanting to 'hug' Heiwa, due to the fact that you just tried to attack him.  I'm a man of peace, not violence, and I'd rather end this with peace.  So once again, please stop your assault," he spoke out.  He'd keep his eyes on Mizumi, while addressing Sado. 

"If you wish to help, I don't see a reason as to not. But I rather end this with peace than violence. If violence does break out, I'll use the appropriate force."* - Tue Oct 20 05:30:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) shook his head once more. "I don't want a hug, and Heiwa doesn't need a hug from you. So please let us end this peacefully."

He slowly began to take a few steps back, getting closer to Heiwa as to act as his shield. "Let's get going," he spoke, nudging Heiwa to the door.  "If either of you attack us, I won't sit by and watch," he added, further directing Heiwa to the exit.  

As he directed the two out of the mansion, he'd try to catch a glimps of the area outside using his Byakugan.  If there was anything out of the ordinary, he'd probably catch it.* - Tue Oct 20 06:05:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) didn't know how the situation was going to end, but he felt as though it was leading into a dangerous situation.  As he watched Heiwa walk over towards Mizumi for a 'hug', he dashed forwards.  His sights were onto the two, as he began to calculate the best option.  

Fearing for Heiwa's life, he quickly launched a quick finger jab aiming towards the base of the skull and the beginning of the neck of the youth.  His aim of course was to strike a pressure point to render the child unconscious.  He'd swiftly bring his arm back, sending another attack forward, this time towards the hugging Mizumi.

Kuro launched an open palm towards the masked man's forehead. There was no hostile intent behind the attack, only the desire to end this quickly and without bloodshed. He knew the longer they stayed, the higher the risk someone may get injured or even worse.  

Should his palm strike prove to stun the male, or even render him unconscious would be an added bonus.  Either way the situation went, he'd grab ahold of Heiwa and pry him from Mizumi's hold, all with the aim to retreat. Heiwa may not believe his words of safety outside, but he himself had complete faith when it came to his doujutsu.* - Tue Oct 20 06:37:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) didn't lower his guard as he now had Heiwa in his arms.  He hoisted the child over his shoulder, glaring at Nigen. He never felt such anger towards a person before. "How can you call yourself a priest? As far as I know, priests spread teachings of peace, not violence. I'm ashamed of you Sado," he spoke, walking pass the man. * - Tue Oct 20 06:49:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) continued off with the unconscious Heiwa on his shoulders. He'd walk out of the mansion.* - Tue Oct 20 07:01:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) whispers: Are you ready ready ready..for the take off?! - Tue Oct 20 07:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Un-Holybond) says: Hey. - Tue Oct 20 07:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Un-Holybond) says: Baby.. - Tue Oct 20 07:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Un-Holybond) says: Let me get yo' number. - Tue Oct 20 07:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) sat the child down after he'd grown tired of carrying him. "He's still outcold?", he thought to himself. He glanced down at the child, unsure if he should use his taijutsu to awake him, or if he should just let him wake up on his own.* - Tue Oct 20 07:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) still retained his byakugan as his eyes scanned the child's body. He'd carefully follow the various pathways of the chakra network, making notes of the various nodes and such of the body. "If I redirect this and that, it should allow him to wake up quicker," he thought as he hovered his fingers above Heiwa's upper body. 

He took a deep breath as he lightly pressed on the various chakra nodes, applying just the right amount of chakra to temporarily shut it down. He'd strike at a few more, setting the child's current chakra pathway to direct more chakra into the head region. He wasn't entirely sure if the plan would work with speeding up the recovery, but it was a try.  Either way, there weren't any risks, at least in this situation. 

After he redirected the youth's chakra, he lifted him once more and continued to carry him on his shoulders. Their destination now being that of Kumogakure.* - Tue Oct 20 07:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) set the child down with a smile. "We are at the border of Konoha and Kumogakure.  As for Mizumi, it was a clone. As I said before, there wasn't anything outside.  Anyway, you're safe. Also, hold still," he began as he tapped the nodes once more, allowing his chakra to cycle around his body normally again.* - Tue Oct 20 07:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nngh..I knew it was a clone. But..how was he not outside? - Tue Oct 20 07:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I saw it. - Tue Oct 20 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: He just wasn't there. - Tue Oct 20 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ... - Tue Oct 20 07:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Is he following? - Tue Oct 20 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Anyway, why did you go to him? - Tue Oct 20 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: And no one is following us. - Tue Oct 20 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..If he was outside then you could be walking into a trap. - Tue Oct 20 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'm not having another person die for me. - Tue Oct 20 07:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: He wasn't outside. No one was there. - Tue Oct 20 07:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: How did you even know that? - Tue Oct 20 07:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: My eyes. - Tue Oct 20 07:35:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yes. - Tue Oct 20 07:38:40 2015
