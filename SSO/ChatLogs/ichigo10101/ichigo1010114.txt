<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) as per usual, he was walking around the village. Out of boredom, he decided to head off to a secluded area, which turned out to be the village arena. It was quite odd to be honest, and it was vastly different than that of Kumogakure's. 

Suna's training grounds were just a plot of sand which was surrounded by molds of earth. It was quite the spectacle.  Seeing how the area wasn't abandoned, he decided to join with the others who were watching a friendly match of skill. He himself wasn't fond of such things, but since it was all for the sake of sports and self development, he had no quams about it. He just watched the two duke it out in silence.* - Tue Nov  3 05:15:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) just so happened to be around when he took notice to the two engaging in combat. He wasn't sure if it were a spar, and from the look of things, no one held any malicious intent.  

"So that's what it looks like in effect," he thought to himself as he paid attention to Koji's use of the sixty-four palm technique.* - Wed Nov  4 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) continued to watch the exchange of fists between Koji and the bulky man. By now, it was starting to look as though it wasn't an ordinary sparring session, however he didn't want to jump to any conclusions. Thus, he remained silent and just observed. If things seemed to get too serious, he promised himself that he would jump in.* - Wed Nov  4 01:52:38 2015

Quickly, he turned his head over towards Aklys, "Was that needed? Wasn't this a sparring match?," he spoke out.* - Wed Nov  4 02:25:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) lifted up Koji after he felt the shinobi's grip upon his hand.  He'd then glance over towards the man, "So he fights for only a thrill?", he responded with a confused look in his eyes.  In all honesty, the culture of Sunagakure was still foreign to him. He'd been in the village for quite some time and he still couldn't wrap his head around some of the things that went on.

He'd then turn his gaze back towards Koji who was still weakened, "If it's not too much to ask, is it possible for you to teach me that technique from before? The one you were practicing on the cactus and used just moments ago. It would help me a lot in ending pointless fights rather quickly," he asked.  His eyes looked down for a moment, then returned back to looking over at Koji.* - Wed Nov  4 02:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Labyrinth, Aklys(Sephiroth3000) says: Thanks for the refill... - Wed Nov  4 02:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) wasn''t paying attention to the fight that was about to begin, at least not at first. It wasn't until he felt the ground rumble that he turned around. However, it was too late as an incoming wave of force began to push him back. Before he knew it, he was thrown quite the distance.

In an effort to protect himself, he quickly began to rotate his body around in a clockwise manner. As he did so, he'd expell his chakra out of his body as it quickly formed a revolving sphere. The sphere acted as a cushion of sorts, lessening the impact he'd recieve upon making contact with the ground.   He'd of course, would recieve some injury in the progress.

As for his grip on Koji, well he lost it.* - Wed Nov  4 02:58:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) could now see that things were escalating. After he readjusted himself back to his feet, he took a deep breath.  "He needs to be stopped," he thought to himself as he looked over towards the raging man.   As the words flowed from his lips, he let out a burst of chakra into his optic nerves to activate his doujutsu.

Seeing how lives were now in danger, he couldn't take any chances, thus he began to get closer.  However, it would be quite a bit before he'd reach the proper distance of the man, especially since he was blown back a distance. 

"I hope this can end peacefully, if not, then  I'm afraid that force would be used," he thought to himself.* - Wed Nov  4 03:24:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) followed the raging male with his eyes as he leaped up into the air.  Unlike those around,  the monk was able to see large amounts of chakra coming from his body, and his fists. "This is dangerous," he thought to himself as he instantly went into a defensive mode.

As he watched the man cock his fists back in preparation for an attack, he noticed something was off.  There was a build up of chakra which was traveling to his fist. Quickly, the monk shouted, "Watch out, he's sending something big this way!"  Heeding his own advice, he quickly stepped to the side, using all of his leg strength to get out of it's range.  

"Why don't you stop this before anyone gets hurt?", he called out towards the man.* - Wed Nov  4 03:56:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was fine due to the rolls.  He still watched the man rage, which led him to recall the scenes of death that he'd witness over the last year.  It sent shivers down his spine, yet he braced it. 

The monk began to gather his chakra from his abdomen and spread it throughout his body, guiding it towards his throat. As he did so, he'd tap into the Gift and allowed it's presence to mix in with the energies that built up in his throat.   He lowered his head for a moment, then raised it as if he prepared to shout.  However, instead of releasing the chakra,  he swallowed it back into his body, halting his assault. 

"I can't use it, not yet..," he thought to himself.  He then took a few steps forwards, glaring at the man.

"Stop these acts of violence!  You speak of honor, yet you attack those who have nothing to do with this.  Don't you have any shame?", he spoke out, slightly angered from the man's reckless actions.  As a pacifist, he wanted to settle this with just words, but at it's current course it didn't look as though it were to happen.* - Wed Nov  4 04:28:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Tetsumi and Kilm shared a summon, and that summon alerted Tetsumi of his death and how it occured. - Wed Nov  4 04:55:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) turned his gaze over towards Ketsuki, who he recalled from when he visited Konoha. He waved at the female with a plesant smile etched onto his face. "Hello there, it's been a while."* - Wed Nov  4 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Greetings Kuro. - Wed Nov  4 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) nodded with Ketsuki's response.  He was somewhat surprised that she recalled his name. "I'm sorry. Please don't mind me then," he replied with an expression that read, "Oops". He then turned his head over towards Reguel and waved over at him. "Hey, I see you're still in Sunagakure. How has the training been?", he questioned.* - Wed Nov  4 05:44:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Nothing much, and it's alright. - Wed Nov  4 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I thought you were a shinobi from Konoha, what brings you here? - Wed Nov  4 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah.. well.. - Wed Nov  4 05:57:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: We're not actually sure yet.. - Wed Nov  4 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: He proposed, and I said yes, but we don't have a date.. as for being too young.. - Wed Nov  4 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well, I'm pretty much an adult- and.. - Wed Nov  4 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Shinobi have a habit of dying young. - Wed Nov  4 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I guess we're both sure enough about our feelings that we want to live while we can. - Wed Nov  4 06:00:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: People like me? What's that supposed to mean..?! - Wed Nov  4 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: It means what it means. - Wed Nov  4 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I think he's trying to say, take better care of yourself. - Wed Nov  4 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's better if a real battle never comes.. - Wed Nov  4 06:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Agreed. - Wed Nov  4 06:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmph. - Wed Nov  4 06:03:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's possible. - Wed Nov  4 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: People just don't believe it is. - Wed Nov  4 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: It gives me more of a chance to operate on people. - Wed Nov  4 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Sometimes, other people will just not let you live peacefully, or avoid battle. Even if you want to- sometimes, you can't. Because if you do..? - Wed Nov  4 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: If you stand aside- often times, it can just let bad people do what they want, without contest. - Wed Nov  4 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Because sadly, there are people in this world who wish others ill- who want to hurt others, for their own benefit. - Wed Nov  4 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: And if you just stand aside and /let/ those people do what they want, you're just as guilty as they are. - Wed Nov  4 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That's what I believe, anyway. - Wed Nov  4 06:05:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I'm sure Kuro wouldn't mind if I slice open your muscles. - Wed Nov  4 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That a threat, then? - Wed Nov  4 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: If you want to take it as a threat sure. - Wed Nov  4 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I mean, I'm not sure why else you would bring up slicing open my muscles. - Wed Nov  4 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Can we please stop arguing? - Wed Nov  4 06:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Who knows? - Wed Nov  4 06:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Sounds good to me, Kuro. - Wed Nov  4 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) thinks: What an idiot. - Wed Nov  4 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: And in this world, if you don't have power to back up your words, nothing will be done. - Wed Nov  4 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: If only Koeki didn't die. - Wed Nov  4 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Agreed... sadly. - Wed Nov  4 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That's why, when I become the leader of the temple, I'm going to use my strength to spread peace. - Wed Nov  4 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Then again I was in Kumogakure so by then I probably couldn't get the training I needed. - Wed Nov  4 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Right now, I don't have enough strength. - Wed Nov  4 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Use strength.. to spread peace. - Wed Nov  4 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: So you're going to bring peace while beating someone's skull in? - Wed Nov  4 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: No. - Wed Nov  4 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: And how do yo uintend to do something like that..? - Wed Nov  4 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That's not the strength I'm referring to. - Wed Nov  4 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: He's a pacifist, if you haven't noticed. - Wed Nov  4 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I want the strength to protect. I want to be just like Yukio. He has the strength to protect his views. - Wed Nov  4 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: If I have enough strength, I can solve conflict without taking another's life. - Wed Nov  4 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Strength isn't only in physical prowess. Strength comes in different forms, courage, words, resolve.    - Wed Nov  4 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Will, spirit. Mhrm. - Wed Nov  4 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) let out a sigh as he raised his head up into the sky, gazing at the clouds passing by. "I've decided on what I'm going to do when I'm finished with my training. I'm going to confront Edge and see why he killed everyone in the village.  If I can calm him down with words, then I'm sure we can become a step closer to realizing the ultimate peace.  Even if he wishes to fight, I won't take his life. If carrying the world's burden means an everlasting peace, then I'll do it," he spoke in a serene tone. 

The monk then lowered his head and smiled at the two. There was something different about Kuro than when the two had last seen him.  He had a different air about him. It was almost as if he had matured and realized the errors of his thinking from prior, and built up upon it. * - Wed Nov  4 06:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I can only hope. - Wed Nov  4 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: In the case that words won't reach him, then I'll just stop him with my two hands.  - Wed Nov  4 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Kuro, when I finish my training I might as well come with you. - Wed Nov  4 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Of course, I dont' mean taking his life. - Wed Nov  4 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That would be helpful. - Wed Nov  4 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: By the way, what do you two know about Edge so far? - Wed Nov  4 06:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I know what he did to Kumogakure, and that's about it.. - Wed Nov  4 06:18:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I thought I purged that from my memory. - Wed Nov  4 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: And you brought it back up. - Wed Nov  4 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I met the guy. - Wed Nov  4 06:19:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: What did he seem like? - Wed Nov  4 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: He's pretty odd. - Wed Nov  4 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: How so? - Wed Nov  4 06:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Well we had a breif conversation so I can't really tell you. - Wed Nov  4 06:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: What made him feel odd? - Wed Nov  4 06:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Don't worry about it. - Wed Nov  4 06:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Besides it's been a while I'm surprised I still remember it. - Wed Nov  4 06:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Oh..Alright then. - Wed Nov  4 06:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: However looks can be decieving. - Wed Nov  4 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That is true.. - Wed Nov  4 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I mean you wouldn't think I have a justu that can kill someone. - Wed Nov  4 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Very true... - Wed Nov  4 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Oh, no. - Wed Nov  4 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I am well aware. - Wed Nov  4 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Are you? - Wed Nov  4 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Medics are very likely to be good at killing you. - Wed Nov  4 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: They know how to put you together- of course they can take you apart. - Wed Nov  4 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I have no idea what the Jutsu /is/. - Wed Nov  4 06:32:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: How does it usually turn out? - Wed Nov  4 18:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was minding his own business until he notice the sky suddenly darken. He tilted his head upwards to see what was happening above, and behold, a massive swarm of birds swooped by.  Suddenly, hundreds of scrolls began to fall down from the sky, descending down into the grasps of those who were in Sunagakure.

A lone scroll dropped down before his feet, resting on the ground now covered in dirt.  Out of confusion, he briefly unleashed his doujutsu to check whether the scrolls were dangerous or not.   Alas, they weren't, so he deactivated his eyes upon grabbing ahold of the scroll. He'd open it up to look at the written contents. Upon having his eyes finish reading it's contents, his eyes widened in surprise.

"What a fool. Doesn't he understand that revenge only brings sadness.  I'd expected more from him," he muttered to himself, finally rolling the scroll up and placing it into his kimono. 

The monk then turned his head over towards the others, "Anyone know where Ortho is?", he asked. * - Wed Nov  4 18:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I don't. When you find out, let me nkow. - Wed Nov  4 18:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You don't have any leads? - Wed Nov  4 18:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I heard he attacked Kirigakure.. - Wed Nov  4 18:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: That's the last I heard about him. - Wed Nov  4 18:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Anyone want to go to my house and smoke a blunt? - Wed Nov  4 18:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) let out a sigh as he nodded his head. "Ortho is following Hideki's steps..It's a shame.  Well, if you see him, what do you plan on doing?", he asked.* - Wed Nov  4 18:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I don't smoke, sorry - Wed Nov  4 18:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) thinks: following Hideki? - Wed Nov  4 18:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm waiting on Hassan's word but if he plans on continuing causing trouble in the ninja world. - Wed Nov  4 18:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Then I will do my best to make sure he can't. - Wed Nov  4 18:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I need to continue my training - Wed Nov  4 18:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I'll never get better if I don't - Wed Nov  4 18:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: What was that!? - Wed Nov  4 18:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Did ANYONE else hear that? - Wed Nov  4 18:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Nope. - Wed Nov  4 18:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) turned his head southwards after hearing the loud explosion.  "What's over there?", he asked before dashing off towards the area.  * - Wed Nov  4 18:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Hey, you! - Wed Nov  4 18:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Did you see what happened here? - Wed Nov  4 18:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Leo(XvXvXvX) says: No idea. - Wed Nov  4 18:21:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Well that's not good . . - Wed Nov  4 18:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) thinks: That idiot doesn't know I'm in the village. - Wed Nov  4 18:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) arrived to the scene quickly after following Shin.  He'd turn to see a house engulfed in flames. "How many people were inside?", he'd ask, quickly directing chakra into his optic nerves.  Suddenly, veins began to bulge from the sides of his face, stretching from the corner of his eyes down to his temple.   His own eyes turned into a milky white as his vision increased by tenfold.  

The monk would look around the area, especially inside of the house to see if there's anyone trapped  or anything suspicious around.* - Wed Nov  4 18:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Leo(XvXvXvX) says: Don't think any one was inside. - Wed Nov  4 18:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't see anything inside.. Do you know whose house this was? - Wed Nov  4 18:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: The village is on lockdown. Get everyone to the center of the village. If anyone is seen roaming, they will be detained and questioned. - Wed Nov  4 18:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Let's search, they can't have escaped while we're on watch\ - Wed Nov  4 18:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I am going to look. Take care of that. They aren't escaping the village. The entire guard is on high alert. - Wed Nov  4 18:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Right - Wed Nov  4 18:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: May I help? - Wed Nov  4 18:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: ... - Wed Nov  4 18:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) shrugged his shoulders as he quickly jetted off in search of the culprit.* - Wed Nov  4 18:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yan. - Wed Nov  4 18:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...? - Wed Nov  4 18:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I saw someone I don't recognize. - Wed Nov  4 18:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: He's close by. - Wed Nov  4 18:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Show me. - Wed Nov  4 18:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: There's two. A female by the training site, and another one who is on the move. - Wed Nov  4 18:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: This is the reason for the second explosion at least. A very flamable material that can only be found here - Wed Nov  4 18:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) arrived at the area shaking his head. He'd look over towards Yan, "I couldn't find them. I don't know where they went. They might of escaped the village. I recall the individual being a male with black spikey hair, and wearing black," he'd report. 

The monk would then take a few steps forwards, focusing his doujutsu onto the item that was in Shin's hands. * - Wed Nov  4 18:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I can probably find out who it's from. If it's from either of the two. I remember what their chakra looks like. - Wed Nov  4 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Then let's see. - Wed Nov  4 18:50:40 2015
