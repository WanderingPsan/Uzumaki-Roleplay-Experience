<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: If you wish. - Sun Nov  8 01:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) examined Momura as she prepared herself for the assault.  He took a deep breath, calming himself as he raised both arms up.  His left arm was stretched further  out, with the rest resting just above his chest. He'd position his feet with the left forward and right acting as an anchor of sorts.

As he took up the position, his eyes followed the female's movements. He remained stationary in his stance up until the very last moment.  Upon the female's leg reaching into his zone, he'd quickly side step towards the left, while thrusting his palm towards the female's leg. In doing so, he'd push her off course from her initial attack, easily evading her strike.

"You're rather fast," he commented, sliding his rear foot along the ground to keep his body facing the female.* - Sun Nov  8 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) could see the female's determination, which caused him to smile. He quickly stepped forwards into Momura's strike range and pivoted to the side, evading the incoming punch. As he did so, he'd jolt his left arm out, transitioning his hand into a palm strike.  He'd send the palm forwards towards the female's exposed shoulder. 

"Word of advice, you should be more relaxed with your body. You expose yourself too much with your movements," he spoke.* - Sun Nov  8 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) never seen the technique before, but he was cautious when the female began to shape her seals together. Upon completeing the seals, he saw her lash her hands out, releasing a rather thin material.  

He squinted his eyes as he noticed a glint of light in the air.  "What's that?", he thought, as the wires quickly wrapped around his body.  "Oh, that's what that is," he spoke out.  He'd remain stationary, looking over at Momura as he was bound in chakra infused wires. * - Sun Nov  8 01:33:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) didn't like being bound by wires, but it was what he got for not being cautious enough.  The monk relaxed his breathing as he saw the female approaching his location.   

He felt the wires tighten against his skin, but that didn't fully stop him.  The monk slid his right foot along the ground, quickly gaining momentum as he began to rotate his body. As he did so, he'd release his chakra out into a full burst, causing the chakra to form a dome around his figure. The more he spun, the more chakra he emitted from his body, causing a pushing effect. 

The resulting force would unwind the wires, while forming a defensive wall should the female lack the brute force to break through.* - Sun Nov  8 01:50:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was familar with the technique as he's seen it countless times.  The monk took a step forwards as he leaned to the side, allowing the kick to glide past his frame.  Unlike before, he had no intention of redirecting it. Instead, he'd launch a palm into the female's stomach with minimum force, opting to use her own strength against her. * - Sun Nov  8 02:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) decided to finally go onto the offense, rather than reacting in response.  He dashed forwards towards Momura, leaving a plum of dust behind, quickly gaining up to speeds of 77mph.   He'd quickly perform a short hop, while rotating his body once more to expell chakra. The expelled chakra formed a defensive barrier around his form, and resided in moments after he ceased.  

He didn't however halt his stride, opting to continue on to close the distance between the two. When he'd reach the female, he'd send a furry of palm strikes into her figure, aiming to disable her for a brief moment.* - Sun Nov  8 02:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) felt nothing as the black seed plummeted into his chest.  It continued to rotate for a brief moment as it embedded itself into his flesh before falling down onto the ground. 

Upon realizing the lethality of the technique, should more force and control be applied to it, he decided to get serious.  The monk's eyes transitioned from his usual azure gaze into a milky white.  Grotesque growths formed along the side of his face as he quickly adopted his favored combat stance. 

While doing so, his perception increased by tenfold, causing him to react accordingly to the incoming shuriken.  The monk quickly rotated his body once more, pushing the incoming projectiles away. Upon ceacing his technique, he'd take a step forwards, jolting his hand towards the female's adam's apple with a knife hand.* - Sun Nov  8 02:36:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) let out a sigh as he towered above Momura. Had anyone seen the sight, it would give him a bad rep.  A smile formed on his face as he released his doujutsu, and extended his arm out to the female. "You should be careful. That could of killed someone," he spoke out.* - Sun Nov  8 02:40:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Like I said, he didn't give me details. - Sun Nov  8 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That's a bit difficult. - Sun Nov  8 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Your name was suggested. - Sun Nov  8 19:04:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But well, the choice is yours. - Sun Nov  8 19:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Well, it's a fairly difficult choice. There's not enough information on the task, and I'm a monk.  Stealth is not my strong suit. Also, I'm considered a visitor to this village.  There's a lot of people who think I'm a shinobi due to the fact that I've been staying here for a while. - Sun Nov  8 19:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see. Well, if you wish to talk directly to Hassan. You're welcome too. - Sun Nov  8 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: To have me assist may also clash against your beliefs. I don't condone violence, or even taking another person's life. Should a situation where the others feel as though they need to take the life of a target, I would most likely interfere. There's been clashes frequently in this regard between me and some of your villagers. - Sun Nov  8 19:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ah. well. Thats fair enough, i'm not one to counter anothers beliefs. - Sun Nov  8 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Oh, I almost forgot. - Sun Nov  8 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm? - Sun Nov  8 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Have you heard from Koji or Fujitora about what they found from the Necromancer?  - Sun Nov  8 19:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The Necromancer? I had no idea there even was a Necromancer. - Sun Nov  8 19:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Who was it? - Sun Nov  8 19:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: He was a man who infiltrated the village a few days ago. I tried to have him live a new life, but Fujitora decided to kill him instead. He believes he's from the Gezo and are out to destroy this village, when it's not the Gezo who were pulling the strings. - Sun Nov  8 19:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see. - Sun Nov  8 19:12:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well. I can ask my brother. - Sun Nov  8 19:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But I don't know how much he will tell me. - Sun Nov  8 19:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Hopefully I can get it back. - Sun Nov  8 19:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: We must always remember the departed, even if those around us view them as evil. - Sun Nov  8 19:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I know what you mean. - Sun Nov  8 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Believe it or not, I've etched the names of all those who've died around me into my soul.  It's sad, but it's all that I can do for now.   - Sun Nov  8 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Back home, there was a memorial I built. Here, it seems as though once a person has departed they are forever forgotten. - Sun Nov  8 19:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No...I still remember everyone ive killed and everyone who has died close to me. - Sun Nov  8 19:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Do you ever meditate on it? - Sun Nov  8 19:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I try not to think about it. - Sun Nov  8 19:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The first time I took a life, I was bedridden for a week. - Sun Nov  8 19:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: This may seem difficult to you, but should conflict arise, try to resolve it peacefully. Even if it turns to violence, try your best not to take their life. We must fight fire with water. - Sun Nov  8 19:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Haha...i really wish things were that simple. - Sun Nov  8 19:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's much simplier than you think. - Sun Nov  8 19:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: There are some people who can't be silenced peacefully.. - Sun Nov  8 19:20:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I've only ever seen him. - Sun Nov  8 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see.. - Sun Nov  8 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And Ortho took the life of someone very dear to me. - Sun Nov  8 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nearly took my life. - Sun Nov  8 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'm sorry to hear that. - Sun Nov  8 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Don't get me wrong. I don't seek revenge. - Sun Nov  8 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I've given up on stuff like that...after losing so much. - Sun Nov  8 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: As for Edge, what can you tell me about him? - Sun Nov  8 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Only that every time he wanders into a village, he either claims it or kills everyone inside. - Sun Nov  8 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: He also seems to have a vendetta against this village. - Sun Nov  8 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's good to see people give up on revenge. You only lose more than you gain from persuing a path. - Sun Nov  8 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Why do you say so? - Sun Nov  8 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Because I want to focus on protecting the things I have left. - Sun Nov  8 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I mean why do you believe he has  vendetta against the village? - Sun Nov  8 19:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm not sure. Only that he seeks its destruction. - Sun Nov  8 19:25:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) glanced over upon hearing someone call out to him. His head turned taking notice to Hanai and Momura. "Oh, hey, how's it going?", he spoke out with a gentle smile.* - Mon Nov  9 04:48:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: H-Hey, Kuro! - Tue Nov 10 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: W-Would you like to come join Momura and I for dinner? - Tue Nov 10 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was just finishing his daily meditation regime. His eyes slowly opened, revealing his deep azure gaze slightly hidden by his midnight blue locks. The monk raised his head just enough to display his entire face. He looked over to the side and saw the frames of both Hanai and Momura. A smile formed on the monk's face just a few moments before he began to talk.

"Sure, I don't mind. The more the merrier," he spoke as he hoisted himself up from the ground. He patted his robes down to remove any dirt that clinged to his clothes. Once he was sure they loose sediments were gone, he approached the two.

"Where to?"* - Tue Nov 10 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: T-To our house. - Tue Nov 10 03:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: C-Come. - Tue Nov 10 03:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: I'll go cook dinner. - Tue Nov 10 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: Hopefully it isn't too small for you... - Tue Nov 10 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: O-Our house taht is. - Tue Nov 10 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's alright. - Tue Nov 10 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It reminds me of the rooms of the temple.  - Tue Nov 10 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) walked over towards a sitting mat. Upon entering the house, he removed his sandals just before stepping on the interrior flooring. When he approached the mat, he steped over it, than sat himself down. He'd fold his legs and erect his torso as to not seem rude at all.

"So, how has the shop been?", he asked, sitting patiently at the table.* - Tue Nov 10 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: T-The shop's been well. - Tue Nov 10 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: M-Mhmm... - Tue Nov 10 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) looked at the dish that rested before him. He raised both of his hands up to his chest and clapped them together. For a brief moment, the monk remained silent as his head lowered. After a few seconds he raised his head back up and unclasped his hands, reaching out to the chop sticks that laid on the side.  With a simple hand gesture, he broke apart the sticks to form a set of two.  Using the two in his dominant hand, he began to dig into his food, grasping the rice, meat and radish.

The monk had a smile on his face as he ate the meal. He was definately gratious for the gratitude. "Thank you for the meal," he managed to say in between bites.* - Tue Nov 10 04:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: M-Mmmm. - Tue Nov 10 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: Y-Yeah, of course. - Tue Nov 10 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: S-So, what do you do for a living, Kuro-san? - Tue Nov 10 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Hm..I guess you can say I'm unemployed. - Tue Nov 10 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That is, in the normal sense of the word. - Tue Nov 10 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: As I've said before, I'm a monk searching the world for an answer to peace. - Tue Nov 10 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: For the time being, I'm laying in Sunagakure for refuge until I can finish my training. Once I'm done, I will resume my journey of wandering the lands. - Tue Nov 10 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So for the time being, I have no actual "job". - Tue Nov 10 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Why do you ask? - Tue Nov 10 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: Ah. - Tue Nov 10 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: I-I was just wondering how you lived. - Tue Nov 10 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: W-Without much money. - Tue Nov 10 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's not that I have no money. I'm using the money I've gained from my travels and from when I lived in Kumogakure. - Tue Nov 10 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: A-Ah. - Tue Nov 10 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yeah, it's not much, but it keeps me going from day to day. - Tue Nov 10 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I live a modest life. - Tue Nov 10 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: W-Would you like to s-stay here instead of the inn?? - Tue Nov 10 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: Mhmmm. - Tue Nov 10 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: I-It might be more comfortable for you. - Tue Nov 10 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Hm.. - Tue Nov 10 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Are you sure? - Tue Nov 10 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't want to impose myself on you two. - Tue Nov 10 04:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: N-No. - Tue Nov 10 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: You wouldn't be imposing on us. - Tue Nov 10 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: I-It'd be nice to have company. - Tue Nov 10 04:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Then I'll accept. - Tue Nov 10 04:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'd have to say thank you for allowing me to stay here. If there's anything that needs to be done, I'll help out. - Tue Nov 10 04:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: M-Mmmmm... - Tue Nov 10 04:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: Speaking of that.. - Tue Nov 10 04:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: C-Could you look over Momura whenever I'm out? - Tue Nov 10 04:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: I-I'm a bit scared for her safety. - Tue Nov 10 04:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I can see why. The shinobi of this village are rather aggressive. - Tue Nov 10 04:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'll try my best to ensure she's safe.  - Tue Nov 10 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: If there's anything else, I'd be happy to assist. - Tue Nov 10 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: T-Thank you. - Tue Nov 10 04:39:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: And the cleaning.... - Tue Nov 10 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: M-Momura usually helps run my store while I'm out. - Tue Nov 10 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Oh that's right, you run the restaurant. - Tue Nov 10 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'll try to not be a burden on the two of you while I stay here. - Tue Nov 10 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: M-Mmmm. - Tue Nov 10 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: You won't be. - Tue Nov 10 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: I-I like your peaceful aura. - Tue Nov 10 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That's good to know. I was just about to leave this village due to the difference of our beliefs. - Tue Nov 10 04:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Seems like there's hope in this village. - Tue Nov 10 04:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: Mhmmmm.... - Tue Nov 10 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So what made you become a chef? - Tue Nov 10 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Well more or less, why a chef of all things? - Tue Nov 10 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: Mmmmm.... - Tue Nov 10 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: I became a chef because I wanted a job that wouldn't have me fight all the time..... - Tue Nov 10 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: W-While I'm a ninja.... - Tue Nov 10 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: I-I like cooking. - Tue Nov 10 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: To see people smile. - Tue Nov 10 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: In a way, it's like being a doctor.... - Tue Nov 10 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: Y-You help stop them from starving with a good meal that can bring a smile to their face. - Tue Nov 10 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That makes good sense. - Tue Nov 10 05:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) had a smile on his face as he set his chopsticks aside, next to the empty bowl. He clasped his hands once more, uttering a chant before resuming his conversation. "Why can't there be more shinobi like that? Many don't understand the concept of an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind." He let out a sigh, lowering his gaze just slightly.* - Tue Nov 10 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: Mmmmmm. - Tue Nov 10 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: It's the upbringing, I guess..... - Tue Nov 10 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: M-Maybe it could be a direct result from the Gezo? - Tue Nov 10 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: O-Or maybe our Kages? - Tue Nov 10 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I believe it's a mixture. - Tue Nov 10 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: The Gezo supports the militaristic actions of the shinobi, therefore the villages continue to strive for the Gezo's support. - Tue Nov 10 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It seems as though everyone who has opposed the Gezo in trying to change this world has died. Hideki, Kilm, even Ortho. It's a shame. However their methods were sure to lead to war. Especially Hideki's and Ortho, now that I think of it. - Tue Nov 10 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: Mmmmmm. - Tue Nov 10 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: I see...... - Tue Nov 10 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: I-I just hope we don't die. - Tue Nov 10 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: You and I... - Tue Nov 10 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: And Momura. - Tue Nov 10 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: Preferably no one.... should have to die. - Tue Nov 10 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: We all will eventually. - Tue Nov 10 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: But I rather leave this world through natural means, rather than ending it early. - Tue Nov 10 05:38:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: This is MY wellbeing and it isn't Bryson's to decide. - Thu Nov 12 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) just so happened to walk into the square. He had a monk like aura about him. After all, he was a monk. As he approached the square, he noticed a female who he somewhat recognize calling out to him. A brow raised upon his face in confusions. "Huh?", he asked as he approached the female.   He could see that something was wrong, but as far as things go, he didn't know the entire situation.* - Thu Nov 12 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Can you please tell Bryson...that everything is fine. I've seen you two speak before...I think. - Thu Nov 12 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I clearly was already taken care of. - Thu Nov 12 01:35:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: .... - Thu Nov 12 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) just looked at the female in silence. He didn't know how to actually react to the situation.  As someone who didn't know the full situation, anything that he could of possibly do can be for the worst or the best.  It was all in the air. 

As far as he could see, the female wasn't in any life or death situation. Rather, she looked to have already recieved medical attention. "What's going on exactly?" he questioned, tilting his head to the side as he crossed his arms.* - Thu Nov 12 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Bryson...everything will be fine...and *at Kuro* it's just that Bryson feel's obligated to help me when I've already been helped... I got a family at home to watch me every moment I'm there I don't need to be hawked when I'm out and about. - Thu Nov 12 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) thinks: Doesn't this seem familar? Hm..Must be in my head. - Thu Nov 12 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So you don't want to receive help from Bryson even though it would most likely be better than the treatment you've had already? - Thu Nov 12 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....I don't need anymore treatment I rather heal naturally... - Thu Nov 12 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Bryson... - Thu Nov 12 01:47:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You can't force someone to receive your help though.. - Thu Nov 12 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: EXACTLY, I was released by the hospital. - Thu Nov 12 01:51:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: You're alive? Cool. - Thu Nov 12 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) took a step forward, raising his hands up with his palms exposed.  He'd wave his hands slightly, "Calm down. No one needs to resort to violence. If it helps, try to meditate," he spoke out. He'd then turn his head towards Bryson, "You fail to see the bigger picture for that situation.  Would you allow an individual looking to take another's life to freely search for that individual?  I'd rather have their hate directed to myself than to another person. As a priest, you've failed to help stop the situation."* - Thu Nov 12 01:55:12 2015
