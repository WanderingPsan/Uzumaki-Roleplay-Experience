<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) side steps infront of Bernadotte, preventing him from getting into Susumu's path. "Cease this before this escalates," he spoke.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) let out a sigh as he could see that even with Susumu's technique, Bernadotte followed the male. "This is enough," he commented. In an instant, chakra began to flow through his eyes, energizing his optic nerves.  The usual clear azure gaze that he was known for were gone, and replaced with a milky white visual.   Even veins began to bulge out from the side of his face, spreading around the corner of his eyes towads his temple.  

As he continued to supply chakra into his eyes, his vision increased tenfold, allowing him to view what one usually wouldn't be able to.  "Stop harrassing him," he added, now taking a step forwards as he launched two fingers at the back of the male's neck.  There wasn't any hint of anger, nor hostile intent.  He just aimed to end the situation before things escalated into something much more dangerous.  As he tried to solve this situation with peace, he noticed with his dojutsu an incoming object.  "More?", he thought to himself as he quickly grabbed ahold of Bernadotte's collar, pulling him away from the incoming arrow.  

After doing so, he'd look over towards the source, glaring at the individual like a parent to their child. "Was that nessecary?", he comment.* - Wed Oct 14 02:40:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) placed the currently unconscious Bernadotte to the side, making sure he was out of harms way.  He then proceded to approach the male who was now bound in a genjutsu and through the unique jutsu that Ambrocio had displayed. "You should release him. There's nothing to fear," he spoke, now standing near the bowman. 

His eyes glanced over towards Ambrocio, witnessing an abnormal chakra from him.  He didn't think much of it, seeing how the male was now in a transformed state.  "It's probably similar to Niza's, Hideki's and Hanabi's transformations," he thought to himself before returning his gaze back to the red haired youth.  

"If he tries anything, I'll stop him," he spoke in his usual soft spoken tone.  Kuro didn't want the situation to escalate, and he definately didn't want to see anyone die before him. Thus, he decided to take it upon himself to be the mediator. If he had to restrain people, then so be it, but in the depths of his heart, he just wanted to solve this scenario with peace.* - Wed Oct 14 02:57:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) let out a subtle sigh, pressing his back against the fence. He'd cross his arms as  he'd continued to watch the exchange. "This world is more complex than I though..Or maybe I'm making things complex..I still want to rid the world of the belief that we are all tools, but is it something that I can do?", he thought to himself.

Kuro kept silent, as he continued to dive into his thoughts, trying to find reason and hope behind his ideals. The monk was pure to his teachings, but he was slowly losing his grasp on them. He practiced a non-violent lifestyle, yet such a life has only led him to feel pain and despair. Using just words alone led to the deaths of many. However, for once, he saw the effects of words in a positive light. No one had died due to his passive nature, and it felt refreshing. However, such a turn of events aren't enough to rid the monk of his doubt. 

He once again let out another sigh, leaning more into the fence, as his body began to slouch down into a seated position. "Maybe I should return back to Kumo and speak with Yukio," he thought to himself, now placing his gaze upon the sky.* - Wed Oct 14 03:43:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) walked off to the distance.* - Wed Oct 14 05:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) made his way back to the temple. He had no problem getting through the gates as he was recognized as an official monk. However, he felt on the inside as though he wasn't truly a monk as he had training to perform. The genin walked himself into the training hall where numerous monks conducted their martial routine.

Kuro glanced at each and every one of them as he joined in with the others. He took a deep breath as he prepared himself to begin a strenuous work out. He raised a hand outwards, palm opened, as if he were in a defensive position. Quickly, the monk took a step forwards, swatting the palmed hand down, pushing away an imaginative force from the center of his chest.   As he did so, he'd twist his body to make the most out of the movement.   

He'd take another step with the opposite foot, repeating the same stance and action as before. This time, he twisted his body along with the movement, further redirecting the movement of the imaginative force that he materialized in his mind.  

Over the course of a few months, he'd been practicing such basic techniques that were passed down to him from Niza. Since Niza was now gone, he had no one else but Yukio to teach him, hence why he returned to the temple.  His own beliefs were rocked and he felt as though he had nowhere else to go in this regards.   As a monk, he'd usually solve his problems through training and meditation, but a problem such as this required the ear of another.

As he such thoughts flowed through his mind, he continued to work with the other monks of the temple to perfect his craft.  Eventually, he became bored and tired of image training, and opt to call for the attention of another monk, one who was around the same level as him.  He bowed towards the man after asking him to become a partner in his training. The fellow monk agreed and the two began to practice their defensive kenpo.  Kuro kept his stance up, reacting only as required from the male. The monk initiated the combat, sending a quick jab combo towards the youth's face and upper body. Kuro responded by stepping forwards, moving his hands as though they were water.  He'd place a palm on the man's incoming fist, pushing it away one by one. His hands motioned in a quick flurry, as he redirected and defended against the incoming assault.  Upon taking his initial step, the fellow monk was left with a brief opening.

Kuro decided to take action upon the opening, still choosing to react with the techniques that were passed down to him.  He pressed his fingers together, forming a knife like motion as he jolted his hand out.  His hand moved rather quickly towards the monk's throat, aiming to disable him with the least amount of effort. Of course, compared to the misdirect technique, his form in the backhand choke was lacking.  The fellow monk took a step towards the incoming attack, cocking back his palm as he launched it forwards intercepting the chopping motion. Kuro soon found his attacking hand was parried and now up in the air.  His eyes were widened upon becoming the victim of a misdirected attack. Before the other monk got the chance to react, Kuro shot his free hand forwards in a straight line at the male's throat.  Just like his parried hand, the incoming hand's figure was that of a knife.  "Hiyah," shouted the monk in training as his arm jolted out. The opposing monk grinned, taking a step back to exit the strike zone by just a few centimeters.  He smiled, sending his own backhand chop towards Kuro.

Kuro had to think quick, as receiving such an attack would leave him vulnerable, allowing for his partner to gain the advantage.  The shinobi monk quickly pulled his extended hand back and twirled his body, allowing for the previously parried hand to come back into action. He opened his palm and pushed the attack out of its strike zone, causing it to miss him entirely and make contact with the air.  Kuro began to feel as though the training was getting a bit intense, thus he jumped back to reorganize himself. "I wish to practice other techniques that would assist in our kenpo if you don't mind," he said to the monk.  Kuro's partner nodded in agreement, "Sure. We must help each other keep on our toes," he replied.  Kuro smiled and entered an unorthodox combative stance.  His arms became limp, as his body seemed to take a stance that was reminiscent of the ever changing form of water.  As he entered the stance, his doujutsu became active, causing for veins to protrude from the side of his face, reaching just slightly pass his temple.  "Byakugan," he spoke out, ready to continue the session.

The sparring monk dashed forwards at Kuro with all of his might. His fists were clenched as he prepared to attack the youth. Kuro simply slid his leg against the ground, as he began to rotate his body in a clockwise manner. Soon, he'd start to pick up speed as chakra was launched out from his body. The chakra then took shape into a dome, while also expelling a strong defensive pressure. As the male came into contact with Kuro, he was launched away from the effects of his technique.  Kuro halted his rotation, glancing at the man as he rose up from the ground. He wiped the dirt from his face and dashed out towards Kuro once more. The youth too stepped forwards, now going on the offense. He'd extend his fingers out, striking upon various points upon the male's body. As he did so, he'd push aside any incoming strikes, allowing for the genin to disable his partner.

The male soon found himself onto the ground, covered in sweat and dirt, while breathing heavily. "Sorry, I got a bit carried away," Kuro commented, helping the man back up onto his feet.  The man smile, and bowed his head to Kuro, prompting Kuro to do the same. "Thank you for your time," he spoke, allowing the man to return to his own training, or rest. He wasn't entirely sure what the man was going to do. * - Wed Oct 14 06:03:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) froze for a moment upon hearing Khalil's words. It was a bit difficult to comprehend what was said. For a moment, he even thought that he misheard the teenager's words. "Did you just say that Maloth is your teacher?", he asked, trying to reaffirm his thoughts.  Maloth wasn't a bad guy, in fact he was rather simple and easy to understand. However, Kuro coudln't imagine Maloth being a teacher.* - Wed Oct 14 17:36:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) too was standing around doing nothing for majority of the day. He didn't have much to do, especially since he moved around as the winds commanded. Ever since the deaths of Niza and Kenshin, Kuro had been traveling day and night all around the world, recording his findings, and searching for a specific answer. 

The monk let out a sigh, leaning up against the wooden fence that stretched quite a distance. His body was in perfect shape, but his mind was experiencing a sense of mental fatigue.  His eyes glanced over at the others for a moment, before sliding his body along the fence and into a seated position.  

It had been quite some time since he last meditate to himself, but it was worth it. There was just too much going on for him to remain stationary, but now it was needed. Kuro crossed his legs, and lowered his arms, resting his hands in the center of his lap. He wrapped his fingers together, forming a unique handseal as he started to ease his breathing and lower his eyelids.  In just a few seconds, the monk had descended himself into a sleep like trance, allowing him to explore his inner mind to realign his mental peace.* - Wed Oct 14 20:49:42 2015

"So this is Kirigakure?", he thought to himself as he stopped before the two individuals who were standing still.  "Hello," he spoke in a friendly manner, waving at the two.* - Wed Oct 14 21:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) raised a brow at the female's words. "Have we met before?", he asked. He as quite puzzled by the female, as he didn't recognize her, at least with the hat on.  * - Wed Oct 14 21:31:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I appreciate the offer, but I'm only here to examine and react. I've come here in search of an answer to a question all sentient forms of life has had at least once, 'How to obtain peace'. - Wed Oct 14 21:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Thus, my journey has brought me to these lands. I hope what I find will lead me to the right answer. - Wed Oct 14 21:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) could hear the wheels of the cart turning behind him. As the sound of the caravgan became louder, it was apparent that there were individuals behind him. He took a step to the left, turning his body to the side allowing the individuals to pass through, and for him to get a good look at both Kirie and the others. 

The monk stood at 5'6, with a lean figure. His skin was smooth and slightly pale in complexion. He wore a dark blue kimono underneath a large tattered earth toned cloak. The cloak was riddled with tears and stitches from it's use. "Hello," he spoke out in his usual gentle tone, as his lips curled up into a friendly smile. * - Wed Oct 14 22:03:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) let out a sigh after hearing the words coming from Kirie's mouth. To him, they were foolish words, and hinted of both fear and paranoia; two elements which often led to violence. "I assure you, I'm not here for such reasons. My efforts are different than that of Kumogakure as a whole. As far as I know, our new Raikage is looking for cooperation, rather than conflict.  I understand your position as a leader, but harboring such thoughts are hazordous to not only your health, but to your people as a whole," he replied.* - Wed Oct 14 22:18:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I understand that as a leader, you must put your people first, but to automatically assume that another is aiming to inflict harm rather than lending a helping hand, is hasty. - Wed Oct 14 22:23:34 2015
