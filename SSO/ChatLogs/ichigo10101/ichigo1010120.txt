<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) rose up from his seated position, exiting out from his meditative state.  He dusted himself off, and stretched his limbs as they were becoming sore from remaining stationary all day. "I wonder if Yukio is around," he muttered as he began to walk around the village.* - Sat Nov 14 22:43:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) glanced at those who were in the arena as he walked by.  He recalled a few faces, but not all.   A smile formed on his face, waving at those who he knew and didn't know.  It was only right to greet everyone.  He'd then walk over towards a wall and sat down, crossing his legs and getting himself comfortable.* - Sat Nov 14 22:47:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) patiently sat in the sand awaiting for the male to begin his one-man show.  As he watched Hatsujin pull out his guitar and play along the strings,  a smile formed on the monk's face.  He could feel the energy and passion that the artist had, just from listening to the strings ring one after another in melodic sequence. 

It was a plesant experience to listen to such a passionate piece of art. He appreciated every second as the notes echoed into his ear, and into his soul. It was as if he felt a connection between Hatsujin.

When the youth finished his performance, Kuro clapped his hands together with a smile still apparent on his face. "What a wonderful performance. You must really feel at one with your instrument to play so harmoniously. Just watching you play made me at ease," he spoke, now standing onto his two legs.* - Sat Nov 14 23:04:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) stolled back to the arena since he didn't have much to do. Upon arrival, he'd step to the side and sit into the sand, directing his sights over towards the two combatants. Hopefully the spar doesn't turn out to be like the previous he watched.* - Sun Nov 15 00:36:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) glanced over at Chikyu, unsure if she was alright or not. As she rose to her feet, he assumed she was perfectly fine.  Then again, he arrived at the very end of the spar. From his perspective, she didn't seem to have any serious injuries.

He took a deep breath, gathering the air into his lungs. His lips opened and moved, forming words directed at the female. "Are you alright?"* - Sun Nov 15 00:57:36 2015

It was there that his body froze in shock at the sight of Kyushiki.  His eyes widened, quickly rushing towards the corpse. "W-who did this!? What happened!?", he spoke out, directing his questions all to Toudou.  He was somewhat frantic, but kept most of his flairing emotions in check.* - Sun Nov 15 01:01:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: We just did. - Sun Nov 15 01:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: The guards. - Sun Nov 15 01:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You need to ask more than the guards. - Sun Nov 15 01:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: We know that a female with purple hair was with him, but it's not Mitsunara. So it has to be someone else. - Sun Nov 15 01:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: My brain hurts, I'm going back to the square. - Sun Nov 15 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) began to walk off, feeling a bit aggitated after seeing the deceased body of an old friend.  He wanted to get to the bottom of this, but didn't wish harm on the murderer, rather judgement and redemption.  

"I'll ask around," he called out, walking away from the group.* - Sun Nov 15 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) walked over towards Shokutsu and Akira, both who were standing before Kyushiki's body. "Can you take his corpse over to a medic please? Also, I've a few questions for the two of you. Do you recall seeing Kyushiki around any female as of late?", he asked, directing his sights over at the two.* - Sun Nov 15 01:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Well, the body was already moved from the scene. - Sun Nov 15 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: How can you tell? - Sun Nov 15 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: This isn't the scene of the crime. The scene is just eastwards of hear near the gates. - Sun Nov 15 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Because the person who found him told us, and we brought him here. - Sun Nov 15 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Why? - Sun Nov 15 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: No idea, but the guards say that he was with a female. - Sun Nov 15 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So, we are looking around for the last female Kyushiki was with. - Sun Nov 15 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Why haven't you told the Kazekage or a Jounin yet? - Sun Nov 15 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Because we just discovered his death? - Sun Nov 15 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Well i'm going to go find and tell one now. - Sun Nov 15 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Let them know of the female too. - Sun Nov 15 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Right right. - Sun Nov 15 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: If possible, I wish to bring the body back with me to Kumogakure to bury with the others. - Sun Nov 15 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mhm. - Sun Nov 15 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: . . . - Sun Nov 15 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: So apparently no one cares he died. - Sun Nov 15 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Like literally no one. - Sun Nov 15 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: So I have no idea who else to turn to for help here. - Sun Nov 15 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) thinks: They don't suspect a thing.....I could skip town and they wouldn't a single thing... - Sun Nov 15 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) thinks: omit-------^ - Sun Nov 15 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Sun Nov 15 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I know it doesn't Shokutsu. - Sun Nov 15 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Apparently this happens all the time here so people are numb to it. - Sun Nov 15 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) says: That's no reason to just be all non-chalant about it. - Sun Nov 15 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Or maybe he was just hated by everyone. - Sun Nov 15 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) says: If so, why not just exile him? Put him to trial? HAve a vote on it? - Sun Nov 15 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) says: Anything but just murder. - Sun Nov 15 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Maybe he just pushed someone too far? - Sun Nov 15 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) says: Is someone that thin-skinned that they would murder someone out of anger? - Sun Nov 15 02:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Perhaps it's because he's not of this village.  The people of this village are rather close knitted with their own. - Sun Nov 15 02:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Sun Nov 15 02:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Well that makes me feel better...not. - Sun Nov 15 02:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: If no one is going to find the person responsible, then I'll do it myself. - Sun Nov 15 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) says: As true as that may be, we are still allied with them. They wouldn't take kindly to us killing off their people. - Sun Nov 15 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) says: I guess I'm going with you. - Sun Nov 15 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: After this is all done, I'm going to cremate him and spread his ashes over Sunagakure. - Sun Nov 15 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm not going. - Sun Nov 15 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: This isn't my business, I just stumbled upon it, sorry. - Sun Nov 15 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I've had enough of death for a while. - Sun Nov 15 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) thinks: He doesn't want to help...he must be the killer. - Sun Nov 15 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) says: So, you got involved with this, only to turn around and back out at the last second? - Sun Nov 15 02:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yes. - Sun Nov 15 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: What do you want from me? You two have it covered. - Sun Nov 15 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: That's suspicious....what's your name again? - Sun Nov 15 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Akira, And it's not suspicious. - Sun Nov 15 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: The body was moved here. - Sun Nov 15 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I just stumbled upon it. - Sun Nov 15 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) walked over towards the mangled corpse of Kyushiki. Both of his arms were missing, along with his tongue.  It was a gruesome sight, but a sight none the less.   Kuro lowered his body before the corpse, removing his coat and placing it over the corpse.

"Aoi, can you watch Kyushiki's body? I'm going to look for the female he was last with," he spoke, turning around to head towards the center square.* - Sun Nov 15 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Sun Nov 15 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Really/ - Sun Nov 15 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You're going to blame me for this? - Sun Nov 15 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: He's not the suspect. It's a woman with purple hair.  - Sun Nov 15 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: When was I placing blame? - Sun Nov 15 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Even though people found this before me and didn't report it? - Sun Nov 15 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I was the one that -went- to report it. - Sun Nov 15 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: No one cared, so why should I? - Sun Nov 15 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) thinks: Clever....Reporting your own homocide.... - Sun Nov 15 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That's a negative attitude. - Sun Nov 15 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Suna has a negative attitude. - Sun Nov 15 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: It's not my fault. - Sun Nov 15 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I just don't want to be caught up in this. - Sun Nov 15 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Don't blame others for your own actions, in this case lack of action. - Sun Nov 15 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Uh, this is your lack of action. - Sun Nov 15 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You didn't report his death to anyone. - Sun Nov 15 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to calm down. - Sun Nov 15 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: You're acting irrational. - Sun Nov 15 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Sun Nov 15 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Right i'm just going to leave. - Sun Nov 15 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I wasn't the one to find him. Rather it was the man with the chakram who found him, and brough us to the crime scene. - Sun Nov 15 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) says: This is going nowhere fast. - Sun Nov 15 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I've had enough of staring at another dead body. - Sun Nov 15 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) thinks: He's the prime suspect....I bet he did it. - Sun Nov 15 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Well I'm still going to look for the woman with purple hair. - Sun Nov 15 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Hopefully, she's still in the village. - Sun Nov 15 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) walked off to begin his search.* - Sun Nov 15 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Hey, hold up! - Sun Nov 15 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Huey(LolrZ) says: ....... - Sun Nov 15 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) waves over at Huey, trying to stop him down.  Upon halting the shinobi, he looked over at the youth with a serious expression on his face. "Do you know of a man named Kyushiki? He has tattoos all over his body," he began.* - Sun Nov 15 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) nodded "Yeah, somewhat purple.  Do you recall when was the last time you saw him?" he continued.* - Sun Nov 15 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see..Well I have some bad news. - Sun Nov 15 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Huey(LolrZ) says: What is it? - Sun Nov 15 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: His spirit has passed the mortal plane.  - Sun Nov 15 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: He's deceased. The sight was rather brutal.. - Sun Nov 15 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) says: That nigga dead yo. - Sun Nov 15 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Huey(LolrZ) says: ..... - Sun Nov 15 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Huey(LolrZ) says: What happened? - Sun Nov 15 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: By chance, do you know of any females with purple hair around here? - Sun Nov 15 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Huey(LolrZ) says: No, but I saw one in the village square not too long ago. - Sun Nov 15 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: The chakram guy, I believe his name was Toudou, found his corpse.  His arms and tongue was missing. - Sun Nov 15 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see..Thank you. Do you recall the female's appearance? - Sun Nov 15 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Huey(LolrZ) says: No. She was wearing red. Did she have something to do with his death? - Sun Nov 15 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Well, we are looking for a purple haired female.  The one you described is most likely Mitsunara, who isn't the suspect as she was with us when the body was found. - Sun Nov 15 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: And she has an alibi. - Sun Nov 15 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Huey(LolrZ) says: Haven't seen her then..... - Sun Nov 15 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: If you find any information, I'd appreciate if you shared it us. I aim to put his body to rest after this is all over. - Sun Nov 15 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Huey(LolrZ) says: Will do. Thanks for informing me. - Sun Nov 15 02:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Let's head to the square. - Sun Nov 15 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: Cool Guitar. - Sun Nov 15 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: I like how you played and didn't do it for a girl. If you did you'd be a faggot! - Sun Nov 15 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Paine are you going to Kirigakure? - Sun Nov 15 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) entered the square with a serious expression on his face. It was odd for the monk to have such a stern expression on his face.  He'd stand to the side, taking a deep breath as he prepared his next words.

In an instant, he let his voice ring in the air, directing it towards everyone in the area. "I need everyone's attention please!  I'm looking for the last person Kyushiki was seen with. Any and all information is welcomed," he shouted.  This was the best way he could get about with the situation as the shinobi in Sunagakure were rather "odd". * - Sun Nov 15 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Kazekage. . . - Sun Nov 15 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Kiyoko needs you at the training grounds. - Sun Nov 15 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Is this in regards to Kyushiki's corpse? - Sun Nov 15 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Hey. - Sun Nov 15 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: What of a female with purple hair besides Mitsunara? - Sun Nov 15 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Hm? - Sun Nov 15 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) glanced over at Akira as the shinobi approached him.* - Sun Nov 15 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I just got the head medic to go look at the body. - Sun Nov 15 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Your guard won't let her past. - Sun Nov 15 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'll be there right away. - Sun Nov 15 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) could see what Akira meant by the fact that no one cared.  It pained him to see the very people he wanted to save, to be acting such a way.  He let out a sigh, turning his head away from the crowd now walking down towards the training grounds. * - Sun Nov 15 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: So are you good at it? - Sun Nov 15 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'd like to believe so. - Sun Nov 15 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....detective... yet you didn't identify yourself as part of the police force when I arrived? - Sun Nov 15 02:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Because again. You don't have that level of clearance. I am being polite by giving you my information now. - Sun Nov 15 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) came walking down the road to get back over towards the body. He'd approach Kyushiki, glancing over at Aoi, then at Aza and Kiyoko.  "Aoi, what's happening?  Akira said you were having difficulties," he spoke. * - Sun Nov 15 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ..... - Sun Nov 15 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yes -I do- have the clearance. - Sun Nov 15 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You are choosing not to believe I have the clearance. - Sun Nov 15 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: This lady is trying to move and disrupt the seen. The seen hasn't even been inspected for clues or evidence. And she's trying to carelessly contaminate the scene. - Sun Nov 15 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: scene* - Sun Nov 15 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Well, this isn't the proper scene. The body was already moved. - Sun Nov 15 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I am not trying to move and disrupt the scene, I'm trying to take it for an autopsy which is my job, and I have a right to it. - Sun Nov 15 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Exactly! - Sun Nov 15 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Sun Nov 15 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Thank you! - Sun Nov 15 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Right, if it was moved. - Sun Nov 15 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: There can still be evidence - Sun Nov 15 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And it's getting further and further contaminated. - Sun Nov 15 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I suggest you let her take the body, and let her do her job. - Sun Nov 15 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'll show you the scene. - Sun Nov 15 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Sir, your comments mean nothing.  - Sun Nov 15 02:47:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) turned his body over towards Kiyoko.  He had a look of sadness over his face. "I'm sorry, but I can't let you check his body just yet.  May I ask, what were you doing before arriving here? And are you able to back up your alibi for up to the last hour or two?  I don't believe you had anything to do with this, but I need to be sure.  You fit the description of who I'm looking for," he spoke out, standing infront of both Aoi and Kyushiki's corpse. * - Sun Nov 15 02:50:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Kuro I have the authority to take this body to give it an autopsy, if you really must know where I have been I was at the hospital doing my -shift-. - Sun Nov 15 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You know I couldn't have done this because you saw my condition I have been in for a few weeks now. - Sun Nov 15 02:52:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) whispers: And her injuries do not excuse her, she does have that pet beside her. He could have been following orders. - Sun Nov 15 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) stared at Kiyoko for a moment, then back at Kyushiki. She did point out valid points. He let out a sigh and took a step to the side. "Fair enough. Do you know much about Kyushiki? Anyone he's associated with? The last person he's been with? The only description of the person I have is a female with purple hair, and that was from a guard." he spoke, motioning for Aoi to move out the way.

Just before fully getting out of the way, he'd remove his cloak from Kyushiki's body and fold it, holding it along his arms.  * - Sun Nov 15 02:57:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Have you questioned the red head? Who drags a body to show it to people? Wouldn't you bring the people to the body? She likely contaminated it a great amount in doing that. - Sun Nov 15 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: It was a male that found it I thought? - Sun Nov 15 03:01:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) walked over towards Kiyoko, grabbing a pair of gloves. He put them on, then walked over towards the corpse, grabbing ahold of the upper part of the body.  "Alright, what now?", he asked.* - Sun Nov 15 03:09:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Just pick up the body together straight up and then set it down into the bag and zip it up, if you have other things to do, Aza can carry the body easily enough. - Sun Nov 15 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) nodded at Kiyoko's words as he began to take a few steps to the side, hovering his end of the body over the body bag. He'd wait for Aza's command before lowering it down and zipping it up. * - Sun Nov 15 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Right, thank you for your help Kuro. - Sun Nov 15 03:13:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: When you're done with the autopsy, I wish to cremate him and bring him back to Kumogakure to bury with the rest of my friends and allies. - Sun Nov 15 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I see, you probably won't be allowed to do that until after the murderer is caught though. - Sun Nov 15 03:14:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was watching the sparring session. He had a ominous feeling when the blade took it's shape. His eyes were latched on the two as they traded blow for blow. It was an honest spectacle of skill.  While examining, he took notice of a few familar techniques in use by Chikyu. "I wonder, who taught her that?', he thought to himself as his eyes stayed glued on the two. * - Sun Nov 15 03:46:33 2015
