<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: A necromantic blade, he said..? - Fri Nov 13 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yes. - Fri Nov 13 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: What of the sword? - Fri Nov 13 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) had his arms crossed as he was sitting down in the chair.  He had a rather relaxed expression. Perhaps all of the death and things going on in life around him have finally taken a toll on his mind.  He honestly was surprised that the female revealed to him that she was a Necromancer, then again she must not have known who or what he was.

A gentle smirk formed upon Kuro's face as his eyes looked relaxed. "You're not as hostile as the other Necromancers I've come across. Let alone, you don't seem "evil", then again, evil is a relative term." He chuckled for a moment before continuing on.

"I'm a bit surprised that you've revealed to me that your'e a necromancer. Aren't you afraid that I might attack you?"* - Fri Nov 13 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) smiled at the woman's response.  He chuckled once more. "Well, I'll be honest, but I'm not much of a fighter. Rather, I'm a pacifist looking to find peace in this world.   And excuse me for such questions, it's just that I know very little about Necromancers. Bryson and my teacher have told me some things about them, but most of the information I know is from Bryson who views them as complete evil.  But let's all be honest, there's no such thing as complete evil in this world.  There's good in everything."

Kuro paused for a moment, unwrapping his arms as he leaned forwards towards the table.  "If you don't mind, can you tell me more about the Huevo Diablo?  Oh, and I suppose I should include this, but I'm a monk from Kumogakure.  I'm just a guest in this village," he said with a heart warming smile on his face.* - Fri Nov 13 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) shrugged his shoulders as he was left with a huge problem. 

"Well, I'm sorry to say but I don't have the sword in my possession. And I got it from a Warlock who came to this village. He died after being cornered.  I tried to convince him to live a new life of peace and to honor the dead, but the villagers didn't like the idea and killed him.  The person who has the sword is a man named Fujitora.  The sword was a part of two. Apparently they both had something about them. When I grabbed one of the blades, it was just to use as a memorial for the life I wasn't able to save." The monk then let out a sigh as his expression sagged.

"Why are the majority so blood thirsty? What's the point in fighting for peace if you're eliminating those who don't think the same? It's not true peace..," he began to mutter before catching himself. "Oh, I'm sorry. I was about to go off topic. I'd appreciate the deal, but what do you plan to do with the sword?"* - Fri Nov 13 03:32:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: And- don't try to say that death caused by battle isn't natural. - Fri Nov 13 03:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: The beasts of the land fight amongst each other, and some die to feed others- such is natural. - Fri Nov 13 03:56:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Beasts of the land have a reason to kill and consume each other. It's for their own survival, but for a human such a need isn't there. It's all for selfish reasons.  - Fri Nov 13 03:58:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: People care about death, because they've lost someone the ycared about. Because that someone cannot, in their life as they are, do anything more. - Fri Nov 13 03:59:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I believe "true peace" is a peace obtained that will never disolve. - Fri Nov 13 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: If everyone has reached an understanding and are on the same wavelength, then it's possible for it to happen.  War breaks out usually becaue of greed, so I aim to eliminate the sense of selfishness and establish a sense of being. One where people aren't viewed as tools and as humans instead. - Fri Nov 13 04:05:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: To a mouse, a cat is a monster. To a human a bear is a monster, a beast. At the core, if we can understand then we can move in the right direction. - Fri Nov 13 04:06:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Someone who cannot be held in a cell, and is an utter psychopath? - Fri Nov 13 04:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: CAn you excuse letting such a person live, when they will go on to take more lives, again and again? - Fri Nov 13 04:11:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I recall Yukio mentioning that. - Fri Nov 13 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: The Light and Dark aren't exactly chakra. It's more like a natural energy that you guys can use and not experience fatigue.  It's like spiritual energy or something. Right? - Fri Nov 13 04:18:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) all day was sitting in one position, legs and arms crossed with his eyes closed. He was in a deep meditative trance. It was a usual thing for the monk as it was considered to be his "training". Yes, training..  It's not training in the physical sense, but training in the mental sense. A strong mind equates to a strong body.

As the monk continued to remain in his meditative stance, he began to exit out of his trance. His conscious was slowly returning to his body as his eyes slowly opened, revealing his azure gaze.

Kuro glanced around as he released a subtle yawn from his mouth. "Hm...What time is it?", he commented, looking over towards the sky, then his surroundings again.* - Sat Nov 14 02:39:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was watching the sparring session at first. It seemed rather harmless, thus he let himself seep into a meditative trance.  He had been in the trance for quite some time, until a loud howling cry broke his concentration.  

He glanced around in a panic, quickly noticing the downed Nina and the raging Mitsunara.  To him, it was a strange sight, one he couldn't understand.  Just a few moments ago, the two seemed safe and fine, as if no trouble were to come. But now, before him, he saw a dreadful scene.

Mitsunara was someone he thought to be harmless. Not harmless in the sense of weak, but harmless in the sense of not being an immediate threat; a person who can be reasoned with. However, with this sight before him, his initial image of the female quickly broke apart.

All he could see was Nina on the ground with a bleeding arm, and Mitsunara swinging her weapon around at the air. Indeed, it was a strange sight, one that seemed really out of place. "What happened?", he called out, jumping to his feet and approaching the Hokuma members.   He'd eye both Nina and Mitsunara, unsure of how to approach the two.  Whatever sparring session they were having had to be stopped; no if's ands or buts. * - Sat Nov 14 07:16:03 2015
