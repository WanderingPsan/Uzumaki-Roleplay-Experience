<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) walked out of the inn and saw an additional grave. Standing infront of the newly erected grave was Ai and Bryson. He saw a pained look on the trap's face.  The monk raised his hand as if he were to say something, but lowered it and instead approached the two.

He'd place a gentle hand onto Ai's shoulder, turning his head towards the youth. "Let it out," he spoke, now patting him.* - Fri Nov  6 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) tightened his grip onto Ai's shoulder just slightly, pulling the trap back. "That's enough. You don't want to see it. Allow her to rest in peace," he spoke. He understood Ai's sorrow. The feeling of being weak, the feeling of not being able to help those around them. It was an all too familar feeling to Kuro.* - Fri Nov  6 22:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was pained to see Ai in such a state. It really brought him back to when he had broken down before the graveyard of bodies at his home. It was a sad sight indeed.

He continued to rub on Ai's back, trying to comfort her/him. "Why? Because, we live in a world that doesn't value peace. They believe it's a dream that we can't gain," he began before he found himself cut by shreds of paper. His brow raised, realizing that the area was now getting pelted by multiple shards.

He held on, remaining still as the papers cut against his flesh. "You have to stop this. Do you think lashing out in rage will solve this?  Rage is never the answer," he called out, trying to get through to the distraught shinobi.* - Fri Nov  6 22:38:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) felt the shift in Ai's tone, and even the words she/he chose had the hint of blood.  He took a deep breath before releasing his own aura from his form. A spectral figure could be seen overshadowing the monk for just a moment.

"Stop these thoughts. It'll only lead to more sorrows. And no, the Necromancer was not the one who killed her. She died in an accident. A pure accident," he spoke as he allowed his aura to settle. 

"I understand your pain, but you must not let your emotions blind you. If we were to allow our emotions to guide us all the time instead of our rational minds, there would be nothing left of humanity.  So please, understand that she wasn't murdered, simply she got caught in an accident".* - Fri Nov  6 22:50:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) let out a sigh as he shook his head. "As I said before, it was an accident. Something caused a reaction in the building which caused an explosion. She was close to the source and was unable to make it," he spoke, trying to aleviate Ai's anger.

As he told Ai what happened, he'd think to himself, "I can't tell him the full truth. At least not yet." * - Fri Nov  6 23:04:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: A necromancer came into the village. We were able to corner him with Ketsuki's help. When I arrived, Ketsuki was unconscious. We, Izutora, Tetsumi and myself tried to capture the man. - Fri Nov  6 23:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Tetsumi was knocked out from the area, and Fujitora came in his place to assist us.  Izutora was quickly incapacitated from the necromancer's skills, and he made quick work of Fujitora's clones. - Fri Nov  6 23:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: The Necromancer took advantage of Fujitora's usage of his clones and made it out into the hallway of the complex. There, we had many other individuals cornering him.  - Fri Nov  6 23:15:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: With the combined efforts of us all, we were able to cease the man's assault and detain him. After we detained him, an explosion went off, injuring a few and ultimately harming Ketsuki, who was now in the hallway. - Fri Nov  6 23:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: She passed away with a smile on her face.  The necromancer was soon killed afterwards.  - Fri Nov  6 23:18:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Ai.... please - Fri Nov  6 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) just couldn't shake the ominous feeling from Ai at the moment.  He looked at Ai's back with eyes of sorrow. "I feel as though you're going to do something regretful," he spoke out, taking a step forwards towards the androgynous shinobi.* - Fri Nov  6 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: The church also forgives Brother - Fri Nov  6 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) let out a sigh as he lunged forwards, reaching his arm out to grab ahold of Ai's. "Stop this. You need to be rational. I understand your pain, and I too lost hope, but there's always a light at the end of the tunnel. If you're going to go look for revenge, then direct that hate and anger to me," he'd speak in a stern tone.  It was the first time he had such a serious look in his face. It was a sign of personal growth.* - Fri Nov  6 23:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: He needs to learn... you cant reason with shinobi... heartbreak is too great sometimes - Fri Nov  6 23:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) could see that this wasn't going to end how he had pictured it.  Upon feeling the cold stare, he built up his chakra, releasing it as an aura.  The aura wraped around his figure, bathing him in a golden hue. A buddhist figure could be seen watching over the monk.

Kuro's eyes quickly transitioned into a pale milky white as growths formed along the side of his face. "I won't let you walk down this path.  You'll only cause more pain to yourself and others. Snap out of it!", he shouted.

He absolutely didn't want to cause a fight to break out, but if there were no other choices, then he'd be forced to raise his hand.   "Think of Ketsuki. Do you think she'd want you to act like this?"* - Fri Nov  6 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was once again in a situation he didn't favor. With his doujutsu active, he had a clear view of his surroundings. Everything within an approximate 360 degree radius of himself was viewable to his eyes.  Even the forming paper which circled around the two.

He could see the faint signs of chakra being used to manipulate the papers, which saddened him. "I guess I'll have to do this," he said as he raised his free hand and quickly pressed his fingers up against Ai's torso.   

To those watching, it may look like a simple poke, but Kuro was actually striking at the shinobi's chakra pool. He'd finger jab a few points all centered around the ki center, aiming to disrupt Ai's control.  As his fingers moved towards their destination, he'd coat his hands in a yellowish chakra.

He had decided this was the best course of action to prevent Ai from going down a dark path.  Even if his initial strikes were too slow to disrupt the flow, he'd try anyway.* - Sat Nov  7 00:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) had never faced a paper user before, but that didn't matter. What mattered was stopping Ai from going down such a dangerous path.  Upon realizing his initial attempt to stop Ai was a failure, he noticed his jyuuken enhanced strike connecting with the chakra enhanced shield of paper.

Instead of releasing his chakra into Ai's body, he released it into the paper aiming to force it to crumble. Should his initial plan not work, he'd back peddle to keep out of the technique's range, just barely.  * - Sat Nov  7 00:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) saw the pages withdraw back into Ai's figure. He was really a hopeless person. "I'm not letting you leave until you've cleared your head," he spoke out once again taking an offensive stance.  

The monk would then dash forwards with all of his strength, running towards Ai at 112 mph. As he closed the distance, he'd thrust his palm out towards the male once more, aiming to deal a stunning blow. 

As a person who almost fell into darkness, he knew full well what could happen if one went down such a path. He'd seen friends walk such paths. Even though Ai wasn't anyone special or personal to him, they both held a common denominator, Ketsuki. She was a friend of his, and as a friend, he had to do what was right, thus his reasoning for stopping Ai.* - Sat Nov  7 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) once again felt his palm press up against a solid force. Just like before, he applied his chakra to disrupt the technique itself.  Seeing how Ai wasn't going to stop, Kuro couldn't play it safe anymore.

He took a deep breath, gathering his chakra into his lungs, and eventually into his throat. Once he was finished accumilating the required amount of chakra, he released a loud roar towards the shinobi. "Listen to reason!", he'd shout as his voice projected itself from his lungs to Ai.  The wave spread along the area, travelling and bouncing from object to object.* - Sat Nov  7 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: You... leave Ai be! Let him do what he needs to do... your not helping - Sat Nov  7 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) let out a sigh. "You don't see the bigger picture.  You want to let Ai go around murdering people and plunging himself into darkness? For a man of God, you're not doing your part to ensure peace.  I suppose this is what's in store for the shinobi world; a world of carnage. Those aiming to help others are only met with daggers."

He lowered his arms, feeling quite hopeless. "Tell me, are you ready to have such a heavy weight on your shoulders? The weight of another person's life? The weight of consequences that follow up on it?  What's to say someone won't come after your life for your reckless actions?  Are you ready to burn all of those bridges you've crossed, breaking through that boundary between being a human and being a monster?"* - Sat Nov  7 01:54:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was sitting on the table, patiently waiting for the wonderous meal Hanai was going to bring out.  After a few moments, he saw the youth bring out a plate of food, resting it before the monk.  Kuro smiled as he turned his head over towards Hanai. "Thank you.  I'll give it a try," he spoke, digging into the meal.  

He'd take a mouthful of the food and stuffed it into his mouth.  Inside of his mouth, the contents swished around as his teeth tore and mashed it. He then swallowed the food, licking his lips in the aftermath.

"Wow, this is pretty good," he said with an astonished expression on his face.  He'd never tasted something so delicious in his life. "Do you eat like this all the time?", he asked, directing the question over to Momura.* - Sun Nov  8 00:37:32 2015
