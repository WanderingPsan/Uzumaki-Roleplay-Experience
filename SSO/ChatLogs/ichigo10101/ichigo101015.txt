<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) cleared his throat, realizing he was now rambling about his own ideals. He blushed for a moment and turned his head, feeling like a fool. However, his desire was still the same. He wanted to achieve peace, yet didn't want to do so in such a false manner such as using violence. To him, the true method of obtaining peace was through peace itself. * - Tue Oct  6 06:26:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) let out a sigh, withdrawing over towards the mountain base. "One day, he'll see. I believe in him," he spoke as he sat down onto the ground. He'd fold his legs and straighten his back while placing his hands onto his lap. The monk folded his fingers with each other, forming a buddhist handseal. As he did so, he began to control his breathing, allowing himself to intake as much air as needed.  "I'll just meditate," he added.* - Tue Oct  6 06:43:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was hungry, and thus he decided to get some food. The youth was tired of the standard junk food that he'd find from a vending machine, and decided to get a decent meal. Thus, he found himself at the local ramen shop.  As he approached the entrance, he could hear the clamors of battle going on. At first, he paid it no mind, but upon entering he noticed that a thick plume of mist obscured his vision. "What's going on," he thought to himself as he applied chakra into his optic nerves.  

Suddenly, veins began to bulge out from the side of his face as his azure eyes turned into a pure milky white.  Upon activating his doujutsu, his vision was no longer obscured, and he was able to see exactly what was going on in the room.   His jaw dropped as his eyes laid witness to the violence between Seisuke and an unknown male. "What have you done!?" he shouted, drawing the male's attention.* - Wed Oct  7 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) stood in horror as he watched the gruesome scene unfold with his own two eyes.  The grotesque sight of Seisuke's heart being torn out, as well as the various tentacles ravaging through his body, it was enough to make his stomach and heart sink. As a man of peace, such a sight was the worst.  His initial shout was unheard, thus he opt to shout again. "Why would you do such a thing!? Do you have no shame?" he spoke with a face of pure sorrow.  His eyes were glued onto the fresh corpse of Seisuke, as its liquids continued to seep out from the mass of flesh.  There were no words to describe the emotion that Kuro felt from witnessing such a death first hand.   He wanted to get angry, and rage out at the male, but he knew reacting in such a way wouldn't accomplish anything. It would defeat his whole purpose in life.* - Wed Oct  7 00:49:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was filled with emotions after hearing the man's response. It wasn't an acceptable answer to take a life, let alone, there was no reason for another to take one's life. "And that's why you did it? Do you not feel any guilt for ending his life? Do you not wish to live in a world of peace?", he continued to speak.* - Wed Oct  7 01:10:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) hadn't realize the individual was so short, compared to him.  Perhaps it was due to the tension that lingered in the room that made his figure seem larger. Even though he was one of the few with 100% visibility, seeing the kid up close felt odd.

"Was personal gain the only reason you did it? Don't you feel remorse for your actions?", he'd reply looking at robed figure's eyes.* - Wed Oct  7 01:20:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(XenoKuthric) says: He told me  You only have two things in this world: loyalty and honesty. Loyalty to one another and loyalty to your own cause, honesty to the ones you're loyal to, and honesty to yourself that your cause is what's best for you. Stitch these words into your head. They will help you find your way."  - Wed Oct  7 01:24:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) casted his gaze upon the ground as the robed male's words sunk in. He couldn't combat such view, as it was somewhat difficult to wrap his mind around.  It was something that was rather relative.  At its core, it was an honest way to live by, but it could easily be twisted into something monstrous. Kuro was rather speechless in all honesty.  Once again, it seemed like his own views were insignificant in the larger picture.  "I should talk with Yukio and Niza..Perhaps they can give me a better insight on how to solve this crisis," he muttered to himself. * - Wed Oct  7 01:43:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) looked up and just so happened to see the conflict going on between the three.  Specifically, he noticed Kirie going after Sabo, while a drunken Amon was leaned up against a wall with a shuriken and kunai lodged in his person.   His eyes widened at such a scene. How could he not notice something like that going on? The monk quickly glanced over at Reguel, shouting out to him. "Reguel, come here! We have someone injured," he called, walking over towards Kirie. 

"Cease this violence, you won't gain anything benefitial from this," he added, now directing his sights onto the female.* - Wed Oct  7 02:02:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) stepped to the side as he put Amon's health first. He wasn't going to hinder the care of the injured man. As he allowed Kirie passage, he took notice to her Byakugan. It was the first time he saw someone else with those eyes. It was somewhat a shock, but his pacifistic nature didn't allow him to do so. 

Kuro nodded at Reguel's request, approaching the injured Amon. "Shouldn't we stop the bleeding?", he asked, unsure of what to do exactly.* - Wed Oct  7 02:30:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) wasn't sure how to stop the bleeding as he wasn't a medic or practiced medicine. However, that didn't prevent him from trying his best to help. With his doujutsu still active, he'd look around Amon's body. He figured blood flow was similar to that of the chakra network, so he placed his palm on to the male's body.  Using his knowledge of pressure points, he applied a small amount of pressure just above the shuriken wound, in an effort to prevent blood from pouring out.  "Anything else?", he asked, unsure if he was actually helping.* - Wed Oct  7 02:53:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) released his palm from the man's chest. He'd glance over at Reguel, taking notice of his low reserves. "You shouldn't push yourself so much. You'll get sick," he commented, now standing.  "Should I call for Misa?"* - Wed Oct  7 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Oh. - Wed Oct  7 03:14:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) knew something like this would happen. He let out a sigh, as he approached the now unconscious Reguel. He could see that the male was in no danger, rather his reserves were low. They'd of course return back to normal with proper rest.  "I don't think I can carry both," he thought to himself as he stared at the two unconscious individuals.* - Wed Oct  7 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) whispers: I see...I'll purchase one for you...unless you wish for it to be obtained in some other fashion? - Wed Oct  7 03:39:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was walking around Kumogakure, looking for his companions as his eyes laid upon the figure of an unknown individual. The figure had a robe, with a straw hat covering their face. He glanced at the individual, and gave out a warm smile. "Hello," he'd begin, waving a hand at the figure.* - Sat Oct 10 04:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was a bit puzzled. He definately never seen this individual before. However, that didn't stop him from having a conversation. "I've never seen you before, at least I don't believe I have. Are you a traveller?", he'd question, still showing a friendly smile upon his face.* - Sat Oct 10 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) nodded with a smile as he felt as though their conversation was kicking off. "How does it feel, traveling around various places?", he asked.* - Sat Oct 10 04:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) watched the individual think up of a response. He could tell that she was in serious thought, but wasn't sure why. Perhaps she enjoyed it, or it harbored intense memories. Either way, upon her speaking, he'd understand. "I see. I suppose everyone's travels are different.  And yes, I too share an ideal of peace and tranquility.  It's good to see like minded individuals." Kuro continued to speak, at least until he noticed the masked man from the corner of his vision. He turned his head, and glanced over at the individual. "Hello there," he'd speak, waving at the male. * - Sat Oct 10 05:17:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) turned around to face the masked man. He was rather confused about the words that flowed through his tongue and into his own ears. "What happened to Niza?", he asked, now a bit surprised and worried.* - Sat Oct 10 05:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) thinks: A girl with a flying fan? I don't know anyone like that.. - Sat Oct 10 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) thinks: I should find out what happened to Niza. - Sat Oct 10 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Do you know where and how he got injured? - Sat Oct 10 05:52:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: What are you talking about? - Sat Oct 10 05:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Nevermind.. - Sat Oct 10 06:00:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: Okay bye! - Sat Oct 10 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) walked towards where the mansion used to be. His eyes widened as he looked at the crater which used to house the large mountain and raikage mansion. "W-what happened!?", he called out, looking around for any answers. 

For the past few days, Kuro had secluded himself to focus on his mental and physical training. Thus, the events that took place just a few days ago never reached his ears. Everything that he saw was new to him, and it shocked him. He was lost for words, unable to fully comprehend the situation. Was this a dream, or was this actually happening?* - Sun Oct 11 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: The village got fucked. - Sun Oct 11 03:07:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: But now we don't have anyone really here. - Sun Oct 11 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Did anyone lose their lives? - Sun Oct 11 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Don't know - Sun Oct 11 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see.. - Sun Oct 11 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't recognize you. I'm Kuro, and you are? - Sun Oct 11 03:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Kyushiki. - Sun Oct 11 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Pleasure to meet you. - Sun Oct 11 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Same. - Sun Oct 11 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I assume there was more damage than this. The village feels like a ghost town now. - Sun Oct 11 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Mhm. - Sun Oct 11 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Have you seen Misa or Reguel? - Sun Oct 11 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Don't know who they are. - Sun Oct 11 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: They both are medics. - Sun Oct 11 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Still don't know - Sun Oct 11 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: What about Hideki, Heiwa, Niza, or Mamoru? - Sun Oct 11 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Don't know those execpt for Niza. - Sun Oct 11 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: .... - Sun Oct 11 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Have you seen Niza? - Sun Oct 11 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: But Niza is dead. - Sun Oct 11 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Saw his tombstone. - Sun Oct 11 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Dead? - Sun Oct 11 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Yup. - Sun Oct 11 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Where? - Sun Oct 11 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: How? - Sun Oct 11 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Follow. - Sun Oct 11 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was in a state of disbelief. There was no way that Niza could be dead, at least in his mind. He wanted to know what went on in the village. Was he killed, died from an accident, or did he just pass? Such questions flowed through his mind. His exterior was rather calm, while his inner self was slowly crumbling apart. 

He snapped himself back to reality after noticing Kyushiki began his pace. Kuro began to follow behind, now searching for the truth.* - Sun Oct 11 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Here he is. - Sun Oct 11 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: ... - Sun Oct 11 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) stared at Niza's tombstone, remaining silent the entire time. His heart sank. Even though he believed that the cycle of life would rebirth his soul, it wasn't the same.  Niza was gone. He was a friend, teacher and ally of peace. The two shared similar ideologies, hence why Kuro became a monk. 

Kuro remained silent, bowing his head at the tombstone. He took a step forwards and clapped his hands together, keeping the two palms connected. Afterwards, he'd lower his body onto the ground to enter a seating position. "May your next life be blessed," he prayed.  

The ninja monk's inner psychie was now crumbling. Was the method that he used to achieve peace really not worth it? Could true peace ever be achieved in such a blood stained world?  It was as though everyday in which he remained on this earth, he'd witnessed more and more acts of aggression that pulled at his beliefs.   The male's nonviolent behavior was surely but slowly changing.  For now, it was going either way. He was undergoing mental turmoil, but on the outside he looked as peaceful as ever.* - Sun Oct 11 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I'm leaving his village you know. - Sun Oct 11 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) turned his head up and looked over at Reguel. "Leaving? Why?"* - Sun Oct 11 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Because there's more of an opporunity for me in Sunagakure. - Sun Oct 11 04:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: In Sunagakure? Isn't it baren? - Sun Oct 11 04:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see. - Sun Oct 11 04:06:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I am. But I will travel the world. - Sun Oct 11 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: So you're going to rebuild this area before leaving? - Sun Oct 11 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I suppose. Perhaps. - Sun Oct 11 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: What about you? - Sun Oct 11 04:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Like I said, I'm leaving there's no point in me staying in a dead village. - Sun Oct 11 04:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Besides, there's nothing here for me. - Sun Oct 11 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I'll probably come back to visit, but no. - Sun Oct 11 04:38:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Mhm. - Sun Oct 11 04:41:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) overheard the conversation  between Hideki, who now wore a robe similar to Niza's but slightly different in color, and the unfamilar Ortho. He raised a brow over the subject of Kumogakure. "Why do you feel the need to cause violence to a village that's recovering from heavy losses? Does death and despair grant you a sense of happiness? Does it fuel your soul?", he began questioning, looking at Ortho. His usual gentle nature seemed to have changed due to recent events. His voice still remained soothing, but underneath the layer of words, there was a faint sense of anger.* - Sun Oct 11 19:14:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) just smiled at Ortho's words. He took a few steps forwards, standing behind Hideki. "If I didn't value human lives as I do, I could possibly end yours right here with minimal effort. People like you are reasons why others suffer. I've been around many, and seen the effects they have with one and another.  They all follow their primal instincts of war, which is disgusting.  Perhaps all humans have this urge to fight, which is why we've never achieved true peace before," he spoke, now glancing up into the sky.  

Those who knew him could tell that he had changed drastically, while those who he's meeting for the first time would think nothing of it. He then looked down towards Hideki, "I understand your words a bit better, from when we first met Hideki," he commented. * - Sun Oct 11 19:27:21 2015

He's seen the result of violence too many times, which ended in bloodshed.  Kuro raised his left hand and swatted at the female's incoming fist. He'd place his palm onto her hand, pushing the punch towards the right. As he did so, he'd take a step forwards while moving to the left. "Stop this before someone gets hurt," he'd call out.  Upon taking the step, he'd be closer to the female, standing in a position that would make it difficult for her to use her full strength.* - Tue Oct 13 00:42:40 2015
