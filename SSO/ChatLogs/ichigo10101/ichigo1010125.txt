<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) let out a sigh. "This is why I dislike this era. People believe that violence will solve everything.  It won't. It only causes more problems in the end," he voiced out.  The monk took a step forwards, his expression dropping.  He'd then glance up towards Mirai, then Aoi and lastly Sanoke.

"What will you do if your forces can't stop him? What if another one comes? Do you believe that you can keep fighting forever?"* - Wed Nov 25 04:01:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) turned his head over towards Izanami. His face lit up like a flame in the dark. Finally, he met someone else outside of Kumogakure who shared similar views. He'd nod his head, listening to her words.   He'd then resume his conversation with the two.* - Wed Nov 25 04:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That is why we must go beyond. If we will it, then it's possible. - Wed Nov 25 04:12:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) sat down onto the ground, folding his legs.  He'd make himself comfortable, quickly ignoring the outside chatter.  With the scroll in his hand, he'd unravel it, allowing the parchment to cover his lap.  

His eyes would begin to look down at the scroll, taking mental notes of its contents. Everything in the scroll seemed rather gibberish, mostly due to the fact that he'd never seen the technique or understood the method behind it.

After all, he wan't entirely versed in the subject of doton. Kuro continued to read the scroll, his eyes remaining glued to it's pages.  His fingers curled and motioned along the edges, pushing the scroll further as he progressed through its contents. He'd pause for a moment, resting the scroll along his lap, raising his hands up to his chest.

Kuro began to slowly follow the instructions that were enscribed into. His fingers weaved together, forming multiple hand seals. Each one was executed slowly as to get the feeling and accuracy.  Upon executing the final hand seal, he began to gather up the chakra that rested in his abdomen. It slowly transistioned from his stomach, to his chest, and then the rest of his body. 

The chakra moved alone his system, reaching the focal point of the jutsu. However, instead of releasing it, he ceased the flow. In his mind, he didn't feel as though he understood the technique enough to execute it. Thus, he continued to read the scroll in order to get a better understanding. Once he understood the concept, then he'd try, but for now, all of his attention was directed to reading the scroll. * - Wed Nov 25 05:21:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) focused on his own training. After reading the scroll, he understood the technique and how to use it. It was now time for practice. He sat in the sand, bringing his hands up to his chest as he quickly weaved his fingers together. One by one, his hands pressed together, then parted, each time forming a different seal.  He was sure to do it as meticulous as possible, allowing for his brain and body to remember the seals by heart.  

Chakra began to swell from within, starting from his abdomen, and slowly transitioning itself around his figure. After executing the final seal, he placed his palms onto the ground, causing its sturdy solid form to transmute into a liquid like substance. The fluid like properties quickly spread around the monk, dragging him down into the ground like a pond.  

His entire body was covered in the dirt. It wasn't mud, and it wasn't water. It was some unique substance. Kuro took advantage of the property change and dove down into the ground.  He began to "swim" underground, expelling his chakra to mold and shape the sub terrain.  It was as if he were swimming in water.  His movements were fluid.  Quickly, he rose up from the ground, jumping back onto the surface.  Upon exiting the transmuted ground, it returned to its original property. The ground became hardened once more.

"So it's just like the scroll said. It hardens when I get out," he spoke to himself.  He then began to throw together another set of handseals. One by one, his accuracy with the technique increased. Once again, upon completing the seals, he threw his hands onto the ground. The ground beneath him began to move and rumble slightly before taking the properties of liquid.  "Again," he said to himself as he began to tinker with the technique. Instead of diving in, he tried to extend its reach, allowing for the jutsu to take in other objects in the area, trees, rocks, etc.  They slowly began to sink into the ground, similar to a quicksand effect.  He nodded his head, "I can work with this. The more I experiment, the more I'll be able to use this in a non-lethal way," he added.

The monk then rose from his seat, allowing his chakra to flair. He'd dig his hands into the soil, sending waves upon waves of chakra all throughout the area.  The ground beneath him continued to shift, taking fluid like properties. Almost as if he were playing in quicksand, the ground began to swallow up all of the trees and rocks nearby.  He halted its spread, containing its radius and strength. The objects weren't fully swallowed, only partially.   After seeing the outcome, he released the jutsu, spitting the swallowed objects out and returning them back to their original positions.* - Thu Nov 26 10:16:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) motioned over towards the mat, dusting himself off before resting his rear upon it. He'd cross his legs, aligning his back into a proper stance. His hands rested upon his lap, folding together to form a single seal. "If you have worries, or feel aggitated, rest and meditate. You'll find that with a calm mind, will open new doors," he spoke.* - Thu Nov 26 17:37:16 2015

I'd expect you to be at least somewhere near the same boat as me," he commented. His head then shifted over towards Kinami. "If you're in a dangerous situation, and you can't keep your head calm, then what do you believe will happen? I've seen many lose their lives because they weren't able to remain calm. Keep that in your mind, it'll help one day," he said with a smile. He wasn't trying to sound condescending  or anything. He just wanted to share some of his life experience to the shinobi. Even if their views at the core were different, he wanted to prevent at least one more person from dying in the future.* - Thu Nov 26 17:46:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) looked down at the metal sign etched into the ground. He had seen it before, but chucked it as a prank of some sorts. It wasn't until now that he actually started to pay close attention to it. His eyes were glued to the slab, examining each and every letter that was ensribed. "The person who wrote this has their heart in the right place, but you can't achieve peace through violence. It's like trying to start a fire with water. It won't work." 

The monk let out a sigh, raising his head up from the slab. Suddenly, he began to get an ominous feeling from the slab. He wasn't sure why, but he just got a bad feeling from it.  The feeling seemed slightly familar, yet foreign.

"Do you know who wrote this?", he asked, turning his gaze over towards Ivel.* - Thu Nov 26 20:02:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Sounds like a plan. - Thu Nov 26 20:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) stared at Ivel for a moment. He recognized the kid, but couldn't put his finger as to who he was related to. Was it Hassan, or maybe Fujitora? Or someone else. He crossed his arms, cupping his chin with his right hand for a brief moment, remaining silent as his mind unraveled the labrynths of his inner conscious to recall the memory.

Suddenly, he spoke out with an "Ah!", eyes widening and mouth opening. "You're related to Fujitora aren't you? I remember you calling him dad or something," he spoke out, now lowering his arms.* - Thu Nov 26 20:09:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) turned his head around upon hearing Sanoke's voice.  His eyes scanned the man's form, raising a brow. "Why would I reconsider my view? I still believe all lives are precious, and that as humans we should try to talk our way out of our problems rather than use violence," he responded, now shifting his entire body towards the male.* - Thu Nov 26 20:18:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) was walking along the path leading out from the village's Eastern wall. His hands were holstered inside of his robes, and his bokken hanging from the side of his waist.  He had not a care in the world, or at least that's what it seemed to be. 

As he descended further down the road, his scarf fluttered in the air. "It's an alright day I suppose," he whispered to himself as he gazed up at the sky. The further down, the more he began to hear odd sounds.  "Hm, must be my imagination," he thought, chucking the sounds to be that of nature.   He continued to stroll down the road.* - Fri Nov 27 02:20:22 2015

He raised a brow, unsure of what he was currently hearing. "Is there a fight nearby?", he thought, glancing around.  However, with the current enviornment,  it was fairly difficult to see things.

However, he did notice off in the distance a few individuals fighting it out.  It looked rather too aggressive to be a sparring session. Curious about the situation, he began to send a constant stream of chakra into his optic nerves, enabling his doujutsu. 

Using the might of the byakugan, he got a better view of the area, quickly catching the glimpse of Momura, Paine and an unknown individual.  Multiple signals began to go off in his head as he began to rush over towards the scene at full speed.* - Fri Nov 27 03:04:44 2015
