So, he decided to look around the village to examine it's beauty. Besides, he heard the village had a waterfall, and he wanted to check it out. 

As he approached the area, he noticed a few familar, and unfamilar faces. "Oh, this is unexpected," he spoke out, waving at the individuals in the area.* - Tue Oct 20 18:26:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: So is your answer no? - Tue Oct 20 19:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Then I ask you one final question. Does this promise include protecting someone, or taking another's life? - Tue Oct 20 19:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I hate killing if thats what your asking, but if it becomes a necessity I don't hesitate. To put it simply, its to protect. - Tue Oct 20 19:13:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Excellent. - Tue Oct 20 19:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) let out a yawn as he placed his palms onto the ground beside him. He applied a bit of strength as he hoisted himself up from the ground, now standing upon his own two feet.  The monk dusted himself off, realizing that his cloak was rather dingy and torn.  He chuckled to himself as he simply removed the tattered cloth from his person, folding it up and laying it onto the ground in an orderly manner.

He then turned his body around towards the female and began walking. He stopped just a few feet away from her, turning his body towards her direction. The monk smiled and bowed to the woman, a sigh of respect and honor, as it was customary to greet a training partner.

Once he lifted his head, he'd part his legs to a shoulder's with and extend his right hand out with a limp motion. His left leg swept behind him, causing the right side of his body to edge towards Lera. 

"May I have your name before we begin?", he spoke.* - Tue Oct 20 19:18:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: I want to see what you can do. - Tue Oct 20 19:28:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Alright, I suppose. - Tue Oct 20 19:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) nodded as Lera gave the monk her name. "Pleasure to meet you as well," he spoke.  He'd eye the female's frame, taking note to her weapon as well. He'd never seen a large blade such as that since the time he watch Reign's head get lopped off.  

He closed his eyes for a moment as he recalled the dreadful experience of watching a man get beheaded right before his eyes. His eyes slowly opened up,  bringing him back to the present.  The weapon that Lera held was nothing more than a blunt weapon, a large one, but a blunt weapon at that.  The most it could do is break bones, but he was confident that he could content against such a weapon.

A smirk formed on his face as he rushed forwards towards the woman. It was somewhat odd of him, but he wanted to see just how well she could react and move.

As he approached Lera, he'd pivot his right leg forwards, pushing his body in said direction, while sending his right palm towards the female's solar plexus.  The locomotion of his stride, and movement all worked in unison, providing additional support behind the palm strike. * - Tue Oct 20 19:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) halted his attack as he noticed the female wedging her weapon between the two.   He lacked the proper strength to charge though, so he took a step back to readjust his method of attack.  

As he pivoted to the right, in an effort to circle around her, he noticed the mud rising up to form a wall. Out of pure reflex, he halted his stride, looking at the wall which was now before him.  There was little he could to in the face of the wall. 

"This is rather unexpected," he thought to himself as he took a few steps back to reorganize himself. * - Tue Oct 20 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) saw that the situation was going to get a bit hectic with the two clones. From his previous encounter with clones, he'd sumize that with enough force they could be dispelled. However, the trick was to figure out which ones were clones and which were real.  

He took a deep breath, calming himself down as he relaxed his muscles. From the female's initial response, it was safe to assume that she didn't fight in close quarters often. To him it was strange since she carried a large weapon. Then again, she could possibly be learning how to use the weapon.

Various thoughts cycled through his mind as he once again rushed forwards. Instead of going towards one of the Lera's who were positioned to his left and right, he himself went for the one who remained stationary. 

The monk quickly closed the distance between the two, cocking his arm back once more. Upon reaching close proximity, he'd thrust a palm strike once again towards the female's frame. However, unlike prior, he aimed to strike at the chin.* - Tue Oct 20 20:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) didn't have eyes on the back of his head, so the incoming mud wave was a surprise to him.  He'd quickly find himself treading through the mud as his speed slowed.  His legs felt rather heavy as the mud poured through. 

He was rather surprised to be honest. He'd never seen such a technique like this, and his experience when it came to actual combat was rather limited.  He'd turn his body around to see the two clones, interested in what they'd do next.

He srunched his face up for a moment as he began to form a series of handseals. His chakra started to bubble up from his abdomen, rising up his body and into his hands. Upon completing the seals, crackles of energy began to roar between his fingertips.   

The energy poured into the crevices of his hands, slowly taking shape into a white orb. The orb of course was condensed chakra which crackled with energy around his hands.  The orb grew larger and larger, eventually halting at the size of a sports ball. With his hands occupied, he raised the ball into the air before tossing it at the clone on the right. * - Tue Oct 20 20:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was trying his hardest not to resort to his eyes, but the current situation seemed to be a bit too much for the monk. He instantly focused his chakra into his optic nerves, causing for his mutation to take effect. The azure color of his eyes instantly diluded into a milky white as veins protruded alongside his face.   This all happened in an instant as the male watched his technique become negated.

As the gust pushed against his form, he felt the grip of his legs loosen.   He smiled, feeling the freedom once again.  Even though he was knocked off balanced for a moment, he readjusted himself and quickly began to spin his body as fast as he could.  As he did so, he'd release chakra from all around his figure, forming a protective dome of sorts. The mud that lingered around would most likely get pushed back as the incoming raiton ball made contact with his chakra shield. 

The condensed chakra would slam into the spiraling dome of chakra, pushing it  away if not dispeling it.  As for the clone which formed behind Kuro, it would most likely be pushed back due to the fact that the mud was also pushed away from Kuro's defensive maneuver.* - Tue Oct 20 20:38:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) now had stable footing as the ground around him was clear of mud. With that in mind, he quickly turned around and dashed at the female.  He'd pivot to the side, evading the incoming shots of mud as he circled around the real Lera to position himself to her left.  In a flash, he'd launched another open palm strike towards the female's frame, now aiming for the arms as he aimed to strike at one of the numerous chakra nodes located in her arm.

Suddenly, he halted his attack, stopping just centimeters before making contact as he dispelled his doujutsu. "This was rather beneficial. I'm sorry, but I'm to cut this short for the time being.  It's been a pleasure to perform such meditative practices with you," he spoke, now lowering his arms.  He'd take a step back and give the female a bow before walking off, if he was allowed to anyway.* - Tue Oct 20 20:53:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was on his way to leave the village. He stopped as he saw a crowd at the gates. He stood there for a brief moment, watching, then finally they left.  His head turned to Kirie as he gave her a warm parting smile and wave.  "See you soon," he spoke, walking out from the village gates.* - Wed Oct 21 02:47:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was hugging against the moutain's base, or at least what was left of it. He was quietly sitting down in his usual meditative stance. His eyes were closed as he was in a light trance.

Slowly, his lids opened upon hearing the voice of Khalil. His azure eyes looked forward, locking onto the male's feminie figure. "Hello, it's been a while. I didn't notice anyone near," he spoke, curlingh is lips upwards for a smile.* - Wed Oct 21 20:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Party. . ? -- <*Turns to face Kuro*>? - Wed Oct 21 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) chuckled to himself. "I'm sorry if I scared you. I didn't mean to.  And it seems so..Whenever I return back here, it's almost like a ghost town. I suppose to death of Niza really had a toll on everyone in the village," he'd speak.  He'd lower his gaze for a moment, showing a hint of sorrow in his eyes. He'd then return his sights back to Khalil, shaking off the saddening feeling he recalled.* - Wed Oct 21 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: A party? I don't think things work that way.. - Wed Oct 21 20:20:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Well, I don't know... seems like we will have to do something in-order to get this village back up. - Wed Oct 21 20:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: We'll need to wait for the village to rebuild itself. - Wed Oct 21 20:22:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Kuro! - Wed Oct 21 20:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was poked in the nose. He honestly didn't have any idea on how to bring people into a village. From his own experiences of traveling, he saw that those in charge were often the reasons for people to come. Especially in such times where most of the prominant shinobi villages are in a state of disarray, stability was needed.

He crossed his arms, looking down as he began to think. "Hm..Well from my journey around the various villages, I'd say the key is to rebuild.  With a village in rubble, no one would want to come. So the first step should be to rebuild. Then after that, we need stability.  People flock to Sunagakure and Konoha because their villages are stable, and the leaders are active in maintaining order and productivity.  Kumogakure on the otherhand, doesn't have productivity, nor an active leader to push for it." Most of the words that flowed from his lips were off the top of his head. He wasn't really thinking, just going with the flow.* - Wed Oct 21 20:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyu&#39;Mc(Sorasen) says: .....So what you're saying is that the village is completely fuck'd? - Wed Oct 21 20:49:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) walked down the mountain top of the newly rebuilt village. His gaze swept the area, making various mental notes. As he reached the base of the mountain, his visage locked upon the form of Kyushiki, a familar yet unfamilar shinobi. "Hello," he spoke with a gentle smile and wave.* - Sat Oct 24 23:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) walked back into the village after being away for quite some time. As he neared the base of the mountain, the so called 'chill out spot' of the village, he felt a sense of dread.  The village felt abnormally dead, and void of a populace.   Something just felt off to him.

"It's too quiet," he muttered to himself, drawing chakra into his optic nerves, rendering his doujutsu active.  Upon utilizing his monotone eyes, he came to a shocking discovery. There were hundreds upon hundreds of corpses all scattered around, buried down into the soil beneath him.

His eyes widened as he rushed over towards the base of the mountain, frantically looking around with his improved vision for any signs of life. Alas, it was for naught as every inch of sentient life was snuffed out. 

Beneath his feet, thousands of troops laid in the ground dead. He understood the history of the village, but these corpse were fresh, and he recalled many of the faces there.  

A sense of dread washed over his figure, causing the pacifist to fall onto his knees.  He'd keep himself up with just his hands, as his eyes began to water. "H-how can something like this happen!?", he'd say to himself.

Tears would descend down  his face, falling onto the ground. He was in a sense of disarray. Never in his wildest dreams would he come to believe that his home would be the scene of such carnage. What was he training for? Was his ideals for peace not enough? 

It was another scene in which he wasn't around to prevent. First it was Niza, now it was the majority of the village.  His heart was cracking with each sorrowful moment. Once again, his ideals felt as though they were failing him.  

The monk then wondered if he were present, would anything change. Would it be possible that he could of saved those lives, or if he would have died along with them.   

The tears just kept on rolling as he sobbed to himself quietly on the ground. The various memories he'd form over the years in the village were now painted over with such a barren sight of carnage.  It was a whole new level for him.  The monk buried his head into the ground as the tears kept on coming. There seemed to be no end to the sorrow that this era has brought forth.* - Sun Oct 25 20:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) picked himself up from the floor after his tears had dried up. His eyes were red from the constant pouring of his emotions.  "I should find Yukio," he said to himself, wiping his face clean. 

The monk looked up into the sky, seeing that nothing had changed in the clouds. What had changed, was the ground which was now covered in blood.  

Kuro looked over at the graves and clasped his hands together, making a prayer then bowing his head in respect.  With no village left, he walked off to head to the Lightning Temple, hoping to find a haven of sorts for his distraught heart.* - Sun Oct 25 21:13:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) walked into the town square of Sunagakure. He didn't have any trouble getting in, as he was already allowed passage from his previous visit. However, unlike before, the youth had a look of despair written all on his face. It was as if he had lost everything of value to him.

His body was covered in dirt as he tread along the sands to reach his destination. He looked around at the people around with a dead look in his eyes. "......," he didn't speak a word, instead he walked over towards a vender and purchased a bottle of water.

He drank the water as if he'd never had water before, guzzling it down to it's last drop. After he finished his drink, he turned back to the others and asked a single question, "Where's Yukio?" His voice was hoarse, and if one listened carefully, they'd be able to tell that he wasn't in his write state of mind. Rather, his voice hinted at a great deal of pain.* - Sun Oct 25 21:22:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was still around, curled up into a ball as he sat in the dirt. The light in his eyes had faded as the world around him became corrupt.  It was if his very soul and being were crushed, and the flames that once burned from within were now extinguished.   The monk rocked back and forth, with despair written all over him.   It wasn't difficult to not notice him as his aura just gave a background feeling to it.

The youth would repeat the singe phrase over and over to himself, "Where's Yukio?".* - Mon Oct 26 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) looked up towards Reguel with dead eyes. His face looked of despair, then suddenly he lashed out at the male, grabbing his shirt and pulling himself closer to his friend. Suddenly, his face began to distort as tears came pouring out from his eyes.

"They are all dead! Everyone! The entire village! The bodies! All of the bodies! I couldn't save them...I couldn't do anything. I was too late.  First it was Niza, now the entire village. Why have I been searching for peace like this when it's brought me nothing but sorrow and pain? I don't want to lose anyone anymore! I just can't.   Why can't people just find peace? Is it so hard to do? Is peace truely impossible to find?  Is it human nature that dictates us to cause death and destruction because of indifference? Tell me Reguel, tell me! What have I been fighting for this entire time!?", he'd shout with hearfelt emotions.  His voice was all distorted from his crying.  Never before had he cried infront of people.

The recent events that he'd watch had indeed taken a great mental toll on the monk. Even though he was a rather peaceful and composed individual, deep down, he was still a 16 year old teen.

Kuro was honestly feeling the weight of the path he'd chosen.  Everything that he'd fought and held up was crumbling down minute by minute.  His ideal of obtaining peace was slowly getting farther and farther. For every 10 steps he made forward for his goal, the ideal of peace would jump back a thousand steps.  It seemed impossible to achieve. Everything that those who doubted him started to sound true and it truely pained him. 

The loss of many were tearing this pacifist down like a wrecking ball.* - Mon Oct 26 02:36:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was at a lost for words. He never thought of suicide, and it was never an option for him.  The monk just looked down at the kunai which was embedded in the soil. He remained silent for a moment, eyes locked on the dagger. 

"......"

Suddenly, he felt his leg ache in pain as Reguel unleashed a kick upon him. He curled up, gripping at his leg as he fell backwards into the dirt. He looked rather homeless. His clothes were dirtied and tattered, and his face was covered in dirt and tears.  He literally looked as though the life was sucked out of him. 

He couldn't do nothing but listen to Reguel's words, pierce through his ears and reach his mind. They rang like a bell, echoing throughout his entire being. It was then that he snapped out of his depraved daze.  His head lowered as he let out a smirk, before laughing out loud.

He'd laugh louder and louder as if he'd lost his mind. "I'm such an idiot!", he'd shout, wiping the dirt and tears from his face. "What have I been doing?" he muttered, raising from his downed position. He glanced at Reguel, now with a small ember in his eyes.

"I'm going to end all of this pain and suffering. I'll continue on with Niza's dreams, and those of our fallen friends."  The monk thrusted his finger up into the air, pointing directly at the sky. "From here on, I, Kuro, will fight until my dying last breath to bring peace to this world. Never again will I allow such tragedies to befall people again.  First, I'm going to find who did this to Kumogakure and change them!", he announced with a new resolve.* - Mon Oct 26 03:15:50 2015
