<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Two explosions, one triggered from a ninjutsu and the other, a secondary explosion likely created to kill anyone who investiagted, triggered by the Sunagakure's on 'Pop Sand' an older type of explosive material - Wed Nov  4 18:52:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) held the materials in his hands.  He'd look at it closely while using the utmost percision.  From what he had gathered so far, he was able to tell that they were high quality explosive materials.   Furthermore, after looking into it more, he'd see that the chakra didn't match the two suspects.

"It's not Katsune or Trilliam. It's someone else. These are some high quality explosion tags," he'd say, giving them back to Yan.* - Wed Nov  4 18:56:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Perhaps it was someone who was originally from here - Wed Nov  4 19:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: There was an explosion, so the first suspects were those two. - Wed Nov  4 19:18:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's process of elimination. That's why he was a suspect at first. - Wed Nov  4 19:19:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) could only shake his head in disapointment. "Why did you do it?", he'd ask, taking a few steps forwards.* - Wed Nov  4 19:48:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Lera, I didn't expect you back so soon. - Wed Nov  4 19:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was kind of saddened from the turn of events. He waved at Yan, and then began to walk off. "At least no one was hurt, right?', he spoke just before departing.* - Wed Nov  4 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Noone there...I left a message though - Wed Nov  4 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah. - Wed Nov  4 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) sat down on the bed which laid in the center of the small room. He positioned himself onto the center of the mattress, folding his arms and legs into a proper meditative stance. Once he finished setting up his stance, he locked his hands together into a singular seal and rested his hands upon his lap. 

It had been days since he had last tried to train this technique. As it was a powerful technique, it had its disadvantages. The most prominent being the fact that Kuro couldn't use it properly. Every time he tried to use the technique, he'd feel as though all of his reserves would vanish. Thus, he is here training.

In his meditative stance, he began to channel his chakra which rested in his abdomen. Unlike the chakra of others, his held a unique quality, which was the Gift, a natural like energy unique to the Lightning Temple monks.  The Gift was a unique energy that lingered in his body. As he continued to focus on his chakra, he began to guide it towards his throat.  The chakra steadily moved through the proper channels, building up in intensity every second.

The moment he started to guide his chakra into his throat, he had also began to mix it with the Gift. Unlike other techniques, this had required concentration to use properly. Yukio and Niza had great skill in the shout, but in Kuro's current state, he was leagues behind the two. As the next head of the Temple, he had a responsibility to reach the status of the two, and so he'd train and train.

Kuro continued to focus on his chakra control, mixing his own with that of the Gift's. The two were well acquainted with each other as Kuro often bathed himself in the Gift's chakra. Upon feeling the completion of the mix, he continued to guide it to his throat. Inside of his throat, he began to feel as though a ball was resting behind his vocal chords. The ball would grow larger and larger as more chakra was poured into the technique. After amassing a good quantity of chakra into his throat, he released it all in the form of a yell.

His chakra reached out from his mouth and spread across the room, reaching every corner of the dormitory. The effects of the technique weren't present as there was no one but himself residing in the room, but he did feel himself becoming more accustomed to its strain. He smiled as he began to focus his chakra once more.* - Wed Nov  4 21:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) continued with his training, allowing for the Gift's chakra to coat his very being.  The chakra mixed well with his own as he began to push it upwards from his stomach, through his chest, and finally up into his throat.  The chakra pulsated with life as he gathered more energy.

Unlike prior, he decided to hold the chakra in his throat for an extended period of time.  He wanted to allow for his body to become accustomed fully to the force of the shout. Even though the technique itself caused no injury, there was strain to his body upon using it.  

Every time he'd shout to use the technique, it would take large amounts of his reserves, leaving him weakened and fatigued. It was just a small obstacle to pass for his end game. Kuro continued to hold the Gift's chakra in his chest and throat. It pulsated with power as he could feel his own reserves draining. Eventually, he was no longer able to hold on, and was forced to release the shout. 

This time however, the shout was rather weak compared to the first one.  Its radius was lowered, and the energy used was more or less wasted in the process. There were however, room for improvement. * - Wed Nov  4 21:43:02 2015

He'd then tilt his body slightly as he pressed his palm Mana's approaching fist, guiding it away from his form and into the air, all while pushing her off balance.

As he did so, he'd take a step forwards, snapping his hand outwards as if he were to strike her. He instead tap her upon her back.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) decided to help with the search. If a murderer was on the loose, then it would be bad to let him continue to do stuff.  The monk began to direct chakra into his optic nerves, enabling the activation of his doujutsu. Upon activation, his azure eyes turned into a milky white as growths began to form along his face reacing from the corner of his eyes to his temple.

"I'll help out," he spoke out as he began to roam the village.* - Fri Nov  6 03:00:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) had made his way into the room shortly after Tetsumi's transformation.  With his Byakugan active, he'd notice the odd change in Tetsumi. "Is he alright?", he thought as he turned his gaze towards the swordsman. 

Just as he thought everything was fine, he'd notice Tetsumi hurling over towards his direction. The monk quickly took a side step to the side to evade the incoming mass. Once he had readjusted himself, he'd notice a dark aura seeping out from Macbeth's person.  The aura itself seemed familar, but foreign at the same time.

It wasn't until a few moments later that he realized what it was.  "Is this the Dark energies that Yukio spoke about during the training?', he thought to himself.  As if by pure instinct, he quickly raised his arms to enter a fighters stance.   Upon completeing his stance, he began to draw energy from deep within, causing his body to emit a faint glow. The glow would intensify around the male's hands, causing his palms to glow a yellowish golden hue.

"I wish not to resort to violence, please stop this at once," he spoke out.* - Fri Nov  6 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) watched in horror as he saw Izutora's leg and stomach getting impaled by the necromancer.  The words the man had spoken had registered in his mind, but in such a dangerous situation, it was best to keep his eyes focused on what was before him.   

Watching Macbeth swiftly strike out at Izutora made the monk fearful of the damage that could happen. He wasn't fearful for his life, rather the life of others.  Scenes over the years began to flood his mind. The image of the various corpses and killings he'd been too weak to prevent started to pop up in his mind. 

The monk gritted his teeth in anger. "Why are you doing such a thing? What is there to gain?  Stop these senseless acts of violence before it's too late!", he spoke out. * - Fri Nov  6 04:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) had a bad feeling about this. The man just ignored his words, and it all began to remind him of the time when the merc named Reign attacked Kumogakure.  He too ignored Kuro's words, and opt to kill those who were present. However, everyones lives save for Reign himself were saved.  The monk didn't want to go through such an experience again, watching someone die when there could of been a peaceful solution. 

Just as he was ready to try again with his usual peace talks, he noticed Fujitora bursting into the room with his own assault.  Kuro thought it was foolish and only shouted at the man. "We can solve this peacefully!"   Upon having the words slip from his mouth, he found himself slowly losing his footing as the man rushed forwards and distorted the gravity of the room.

Never in his life had he encountered such a situation in which he now found himself being pushed back against a wall. In addition, he no longer had the support of gravity to keep him tethered to the ground.  As all of this was going on, he'd notice Trilliam's chakra coating several objects which began to head towards his way.

The monk had recalled Trilliam's style of combat and knew that the incoming objects equated to danger. With no ground to keep him stable, Kuro quickly began to rotate his body as fast as he could. Even with the void of gravity, he found the strength to turn his body 'round and 'round.  While spinning, he'd expel his chakra from his pores, causing a dome of dense chakra to form. The dome  would push the incoming spiders away from him, scattering it around the room. "Stop this!", his voice echoed from the sphere.* - Fri Nov  6 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was still being heard with deaf ears.  It was saddening him, but he couldn't let it get to him. If the man continued to go on his rampage, the monk would have no choice but to go on the offense. He wasn't confident in his skill, but he was confident in his heart. 

As his rotating speed settled, he found himself being blessed by the touch of gravity once more. Before he knew it, his feet were on the ground. "Not again," he whispered to himself as he quickly looked over towards Izuora and Ketsuki. 

Fearing for the worst, he rushed over towards the unconscious female, unsure if her life was on the line. He'd hover over her, placing his arms on the female shaking her awake. "Ketsuki, wake up! You have to get up!", he called out.

The unconscious female was a priority as Izutora was still conscious. He didn't think much of the hallway as there were plenty of shinobi to prevent the man's escape. His only concern for now was to ensure that Ketsuki and Izutora were alive. Once he confirmed their state, he'd join the others in hopes of stopping the bladesman. * - Fri Nov  6 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) whispers: (i was icly holding onto consciousness because i knew if i didnt patch up my wounds i'd die.) - Fri Nov  6 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) whispers: (i'd die if i fell unconsicous, basically) - Fri Nov  6 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) smiled as he saw Ketsuki's awoken face. "Good, you're still alive.  As for that man, he's still around. He's in the hallways right now.  The guy who spoke about youth is over there in the corner bleeding. If you can, can you help stop his bleeding. I'm going to go help the others in stopping this man. We can't let him continue on, otherwise people will die.." The male fell silent for a moment, casting his gaze down towards the ground. He had a face of regret, but quickly he washed it off. 

"I didn't train this hard for the people around me to suffer. Stay here. I'll get some medical help, and I'll let you know when it's safe out," he spoke. After sharing his thoats, he rose from his kneeled position and headed towards the hallway.* - Fri Nov  6 04:57:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't believe in taking a life. I'm going to end this on my terms. - Fri Nov  6 04:59:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Good Luck...Hrm? - Fri Nov  6 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah.. you're alright then, yeah sir? - Fri Nov  6 05:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) smiled as he followed after Macbeth from the room. He'd give Izutora and Ketsuki a thumbs up as his back faced the two. "I'm going to prove that being a pacifist doesn't always mean being powerless," he spoke to the two as he exited the room.

Upon exiting, his eyes would fixate themselves onto the bladesman who had skillfully evaded and parried the initial attacks that were sent to him. It was as if he were playing with the group. "Watch out! He's fast with those blades and he can disrupt gravity!", the monk shouted as a warning to the others.  As he spoke out the warning, he began to prepare himself in case.* - Fri Nov  6 05:09:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) once again saw the result of the man's technique. Unlike his first encounter with the technique, he wasn't caught up into it. "Huh?", he thought as he noticed the multiple chakram floating in the air.  It was as if they were all going to experience death of some sorts.   It just gave off a bad feeling.

He quickly diverted his gaze back towards the male, examining him for any openings. Should he be given the chance, he was certain that he would be able to help stop the conflict.  However, there was a problem and that was approaching the male.

From his prior experience, the instant he'd step into the foe's striking range would mean the end for him; Izutora being a clear example. The only option Kuro was able to come up with was to disarm him, as it seemed he relied more or less on his blades than actual taijutsu. 

The monk shouted towards the others, hoping that they'd get on the same wavelength as the youth. "Don't get too close to him. He's dangerous with those blades of his. I saw him easily dispatch someone in just a fraction of a second. Don't make any reckless moves." 

Kuro still felt as though he could communicate with the necromancer, so he once again tried to converse with the man. "Why don't we stop this before any more people get hurt. I'd rather we all leave here with our lives and our health in good order. That includes you, me, and everyone here. We should be spreading peace, not violence."* - Fri Nov  6 05:37:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) upon seeing the continued violence, he decided to step in. No more was he going to let people die before him.  As his eyes watched the man lunge towards Koji, and Koji beginning his own counter, the monk finally stepped in.

"Enough!", he shouted, projecting his voice using his diaphram.  Using the gift, he continued to coat his hands with it's unique chakra. Those with the ability to see chakra were able to spot the yellow gold hue emitting from his hands.   He had seen enough and didn't want to watch anyone die infront of him, even if it was a necromancer.

The monk dashed forwards, extending his hand out to grab ahold of the foe's clothing,pulling him back if slightly. In the depths of his mind, he didn't want to see the male suffer from any life threatening wounds.* - Fri Nov  6 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) pulled the man onto the ground, quickly tossing his weapons away from arms reach.  He'd look up towards the ground and began to shout, "Get a medic! Quick!" His voice became unstable as the memories came pouring into his mind.  

Thinking quick on his feet, the monk tore off some fabric from his scar to quickly tie around the male's arm to help slow down the bleeding. his eyes once again would direct themselves towards Koji. "Open up some of his points so that he won't die. Even if he did wrong, he doesn't deserve such a death. Let him live with his sins so he can redeem himself," the monk spoke. * - Fri Nov  6 06:43:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) could see the anger in Koji's eyes, but that was where their difference in beliefs lied.  Kuro was a pacifist at heart, while Koji was a shinobi. He had a dejected look, but quickly wiped it away after further assessing the foe.  

He saw that the man's chakra points were partially closed, about five percent of his chakra was unusable.  However, unsure if dark 'chakra' was able to travel even through closed tenketsu points, he pressed upon a few which were around the abdomen area. 

Instead of disrupting the circulation, he aimed to go towards the source, where a large portion of chakra resided; the "ki center".  Unlike Koji, Kuro coated his hands in the Gift's chakra to ensure the Necromancer would have a difficult time using his chakra.  It was all for the safety of others.  

Upon completion, he'd strike a few more points to prolong the mans life, or at least attempt to.  "Why did you choose this path? You could have lived a life without taking another's life," he asked, trying to gain answers from the man.* - Fri Nov  6 07:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) stood up from his downed position, standing before the man. "I refuse to kill you. All lives are special. We as humans shouldn't have to kill each other for such reasons.  Put your weapon away Fujitora, if not for me then do it for Yukio.  Would he want to know that a friend of his has killed another? This man can repent for his crimes through living with the weight of those he killed.  Taking this man's life will not do anything but continue to churn the gears of hate," he proclaimed. 

As he continued with sharing his beliefs, he noticed surges of Trilliam's chakra all around the area.  Noticing an incoming reaction with his Byakugan, he quickly grabbed ahold of Macbeth once more and began to rotate his body as quickly as possible. He'd generate an immense amount of speed all while expelling chakra from his body, pushing away whatever volitile material that was near.   

No matter what the result being, he'd continued to spin his body with all of his might, aiming to save not only himself but the life of the necromancer.  As he did so, he began to pray in his mind, "Please make it out, I can't die here, not yet..I've still have to bring peace to this era,"* - Fri Nov  6 07:34:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was in a pickle. Off in the distance he could see Ketsuki's bloodied body, however before him lied Fujitora who was aiming to take this man's life.  This caused a sense of rage to bubble up from within. 

"You speak of saving people, yet you're aiming to take this man's life while Ketsuki is over there in pain?  Set your priorities straight Fujitora!," he shouted.  This was the very first time Kuro expressed rage such as this. It wasn't a blind rage, or any normal sense of rage, just anger.   This was something he wanted to prevent, the death of others, yet it happened even when the fighting stopped. 

"Now is not the time to be fighting, rather we should be tending to the injured. If you wish to pursue this, then-" he began to speak imtil he was cut off. He saw an incoming wave of chakra infused sand approaching the two. Like his previous attempts, he rotated his body to expell chakra out in a forceful manner. He wasn't letting anyone take the man's life.* - Fri Nov  6 07:55:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was getting fed up with the sensless actions. They all seemed more occupied on the state of Macbeth, rather than on the dying Ketsuki. It made him angry, but he set that anger aside.   The monk kept his grip upon Macbeth, trying his best to preserve hsi life.

"Why must you take his life? If anything, imprison him. Look what has happened. Trilliam's careless actions led to Ketsuki's injuries," he spoke out, not realizing that the female had died. 

As he spoke, he began to gather his chakra from abdomen and direct it up towards his throat. As he did so, he mixed the Gift's chakra along with his own.The more chakra he focused, the greater an aura he began to display.  Suddenly, a spectral buddhist figure appeared behind his back, almost as if it were watching over the monk.

Once he had gathered enough chakra, he expelled a shout from his mouth, "Come to your senses!". The roar echoed throughout the hallways, carrying itself an unnatural feel to it.  * - Fri Nov  6 08:13:13 2015

He'd then walk out of the mansion, but not before looking over at Trilliam, "I don't know what compelled you to put everyone's life in danger, but the next time you do so, I'll make sure you'll never be able to do such a thing again.  No, I'm not threatening your life, simply stating that I won't accept your blatant disregard for those around you.  I don't believe in taking another's life, but I do believe that karma will come after you," he spoke before leaving.* - Fri Nov  6 08:55:53 2015
