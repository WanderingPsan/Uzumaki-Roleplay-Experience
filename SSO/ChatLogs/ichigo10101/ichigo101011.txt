<br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was sitting on the ground meditating. He was in a tranquil state, allowing his body to take in the ambient energy that nature provided. Upon hearing the female's voice, he opened a single eye and glanced at the woman.  He let out a gentle smile and motioned for her to join him.

"I am meditating, trying to keep my mind at peace. I'm trying to become one with nature to better understand myself and the world. Care to join me?", he replied with a soft and gentle voice.  The male's azure colored eyes glistened in the sun's rays as he opened up both.* - Tue Sep 22 01:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'm Kuro by the way. And you are? - Tue Sep 22 01:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) nodded with a smile remaining on his face. "Indeed. If only everyone could partake in such activity. I believe the world would turn out for the better," he spoke. 

His legs remained crossed, and his figure steady. The genin placed his hands side by side, folding his fingers in between each other as they rested upon his lap.  "Do you do this often?", he asked, shifting his head slightly towards Misa's direction.* - Tue Sep 22 01:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) chuckled at her comment. In a gentle tone he replied, "Both", and began to ease his breathing.  Air began to flow in through his nostrils, filling up his chest, then slowly started to be released from his nose.  He'd continue the process, further matching his breathing into a soothing rhythim.  As he did so, the youth began to give off a rather peaceful aura, almost as if he were completely harmless.* - Tue Sep 22 01:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) cracked an even wider smile. His cheeks even pushed towards his eye lids, curving the slits. "You're a rather kind and caring person.  You're a shinobi too, right?", he questioned. The male straightened his back and continued to breath in the soothing rhythim that he provided himself.  Had he not been talking, he'd probably be in a deep trance, or in the process. However, it didn't really bother him since he had pleasant company next to him to speak with. After all, generocity goes a distance.* - Tue Sep 22 01:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) only focused on relaxing his body and mind. Even through the vocal communication, Kuro was able to feel at ease with himself. He could hear the ambient noise of nature; the whispers of the wind, the rustling of the dirt, the slapping of vegetation.   His eye lids slowly began to descend upon themselves, further diving him deeper into the meditative state he was aiming to achieve.

"I see, that explains a lot. Medics are usually those who care for others, and often at times risk their own lives to save people left and right. It's a rather heroic task for a human being, don't you think?", he spoke.  * - Tue Sep 22 01:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) let out a soft laughter. "No, I'm not a medic, sadly. I honestly don't know what I should consider myself since I don't believe I fit into any normal category. I'm just a man who tries to stay away from unnecessary violence.  I don't practice ninjutsu for honor, valor, or for the sake of taking a life. I practice it for the sake of meditation.  If I were however, to put myself into a valid category, it would most likely be a generalist I suppose.   Personally, I don't think that I have what it takes to learn and utilize medical ninjutsu.  It would be pleasant to know how to, but as I am now, I don't see that happening anytime soon." 

The male opened his eyes once more, revealing the azure color of his iris. He glanced up into the sky, slightly shifting his chin up. "I bet it sounds odd for me to not follow the medical path, yet speak about aiming to help end violence."* - Tue Sep 22 02:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) raised a brow at Misa's words. He was surprised that a medical shinobi didn't know of any medical ninjutsu. "How come? Isn't that the very bread and butter of your training? " He was honestly surprised. He had always imagined that all medical shinobi knew at least one or two medical jutsu.  "If you don't have jutsu, do you perhaps use the old fashion way of bandaging?"* - Tue Sep 22 02:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) once again revealed a soft gentle smile upon his face. "I don't think it's weird. Prior to when ninjutsu was discovered, people used such methods.  And you don't need to force yourself to show me a secret you are unsure of.  If you feel as though you can put your trust in me, follow the instinct. If you are unsure, then follow with it as well. "  He then felt his arm being poked by the woman's finger. He lowered his head, bringing his gaze over towards Misa. 

"Just remember, it's your decision and no one else's. Follow your beliefs," he whispered in his soft spoken voice.* - Tue Sep 22 02:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) started to laugh as he felt the female push up against his figure. "I don't think I'm wise. Even I find faults in my own ideology, but I aim to mend these faults.  I'm  just as average as anyone else. And I suppose I've been like this for as long as I recall. I've seen what war can do, and I've seen what death through another man's hands can do as well. It brings out the worst in humanity.  I just learn from my surroundings and try to find another way."* - Tue Sep 22 02:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) smiled as he unwrapped his hands and raised his left for a genuine wave. "It was a pleasure meditating with you. I don't often converse like this with people. It's good to know that there's like minded people here. Get home safe," he spoke in a gentle tone.* - Tue Sep 22 02:42:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was sittting on one of the seating mats that was inside of the Raikage's mansion. His legs were folded, and his body stood straight. The male's arms draped along his lap as his eyes were shut close. He spoke not a word. To others looking at him, it seemed as though he was a sleep, but in reality, he was in a meditative trance.* - Tue Sep 22 18:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) continued to remain in his meditative trance. His mind's eye had covered the world around him in a veil of white, silencing anything that would break his concentration save for the most extremes. His breathing was that of a soothing ryhtim. The male exerted not an ounce of malice.* - Tue Sep 22 19:01:07 2015

"Why hello there," he spoke, addressing those in the room. He released the meditative handseal that he formed, and stretched his arms out like a child just waking up from their nap.  "Did I disturb you?", he asked, tilting his head slightly.* - Tue Sep 22 19:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) opened his eyes slowly, revealing his azure gaze. His eyes circled around the room, taking a glance at those who were present. "Hello there," he began, slouching his back slightly. His initial ridgid form was now lowered, taking place now a relaxed figure. "Did I disturb you by chance?', he added, tilting his head slightly.* - Tue Sep 22 19:10:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) let out a gentle smile as he watched Mamoru leave the room. Out of curiousity, he stood up from his seat and began to trail behind the shinobi.  If a physical conflict were to arrise, he wanted to prevent it using wise words.* - Tue Sep 22 19:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Did you not see him? - Tue Sep 22 19:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) noticed the man who had recently stomped and stormed out of the Raikage's mansion.  Interested in the situation, he approached the man with a warm gentle expression on his face. "Is something the matter?," he'd ask, allowing his azure eyes to rest upon the male.* - Tue Sep 22 19:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) thinks: So. - Tue Sep 22 19:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) thinks: He wants to get revenge. - Tue Sep 22 19:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) thinks: Against Lord Niza. - Tue Sep 22 19:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) thinks: I'll end this before he gets troublesome. - Tue Sep 22 19:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) had a difficult time understanding everything that the male said, but he did understand the emotion behind his words. The male was hurt, and wanted to do something to heal this internal pain.  Kuro just gave a sympathizing smile as he stepped up to Maloth and placed a gentle hand onto his shoulder.

"I may not understand everything that you said, but I do understand that you're in pain. You've lost someone dear to you and it hurts a lot.  Revenge won't solve this chain.   If you were to kill or harm 'Chief',  then 'Chief's' family and friends would feel the same way that you do.  Then someone would probably follow with what you're doing and go after you.  Don't feel hatred for this individual, would Amai want this? I think not.  I assure you, this moment is painful, but think of all of the good times you've had with your friend.   Don't cry for what has been lost, but cry for what has been.  Live life remembering your friend, and honoring their memory," the youth spoke. His voice was gentle and soothing. It even sounded like he too felt the pain that Maloth felt from his loss. * - Tue Sep 22 19:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) looked saddened by Maloth's words. He stepped infront of the male, spreading his arms out. "Do you really think revenge will settle anything?  You will just tarnish the image of your friend. Do you believe that they'd want this for you? To travel down a path of darkness where you may or may not recover from?"* - Tue Sep 22 20:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) could see that his words weren't reaching Maloth. He let out a sigh as his face became saddened. "I see..," he muttered, casting his sight upon the ground. "If you are going to continue down this path then I will give you one piece of advice.  You will not be punished for your anger, you will be punished by it. I do hope that you see the truth of the path that you are currently walking.   I honestly hope you see it before it's too late." 

The youth let out another sigh, lifting his head to look at Maloth. "Have a safe journey, and may you return one day with an enlightened mind," he added, speaking in his usual soft and gentle tone. * - Tue Sep 22 20:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) had no intention of stopping Maloth. He'd came to the conclusion that this was a trial that Maloth himself had to overcome. No matter how many words he spat at the male, none would reach him.  As he watched the man walk away to begin his story of revenge, Kuro let out one last comment, "No one saves us but ourselves. No one can and no one may. We ourselves must walk the path."* - Tue Sep 22 20:36:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) shifted his body towards Mamoru, now that Maloth had departed from the village. "What will you do, now that he's left? Will you go after him while bearing the flag of Kumogakure,  or will you do as I and let him walk the path he so desires?" The genin took a few steps forwards, meeting his gaze with Mamoru's.  * - Tue Sep 22 20:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I will let him follow whatever path he wants to take. - Tue Sep 22 20:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: The only thing that will make a difference in my course of action. - Tue Sep 22 20:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Is if his path intervenes with mine. - Tue Sep 22 20:47:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: What do you consider honor? - Tue Sep 22 20:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Is it the recognition of those of power? The self fulfilment of your own achievements? Or is it something else? - Tue Sep 22 20:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Honor. - Tue Sep 22 20:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Is the protection of one's ideals. - Tue Sep 22 20:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: One's morality. - Tue Sep 22 20:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I will live and fight for those ideals. - Tue Sep 22 20:58:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: May I ask, what are these ideals that you are willing to stake your life upon? - Tue Sep 22 20:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: My ideal is the protection of my family. - Tue Sep 22 21:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: That is Kumogakure. - Tue Sep 22 21:02:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So your honor is revolved around the village? - Tue Sep 22 21:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Yes. - Tue Sep 22 21:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Then let me ask a question, if the village were no more, would your honor be no more as well? - Tue Sep 22 21:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: The village will never be no more. - Tue Sep 22 21:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Because the village is its culture. - Tue Sep 22 21:09:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: For instance, should the village be taken over and all instances of our 'culture' removed and destroyed, what would be left?  - Tue Sep 22 21:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Will the village's culture still remain? - Tue Sep 22 21:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Its people would. - Tue Sep 22 21:15:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: But in this instance, the people, culture, and village would be no more. They wouldn't be considered as 'Kumogakure's', but as the opposing force that took over.   Would your honor still be rooted into the original culture known as Kumogakure, or would it change into this new culture that overshadows Kumogakure?  - Tue Sep 22 21:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Rooted. - Tue Sep 22 21:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) crossed his arms and rested his chin upon a single hand. He let out a hum, and made a face as if he were deep in thought. "So that means you'd be one who opposes such radical changes.  You aren't such a hasty character, rather a dutiful one who puts the village's interest before your own. " He let out a smirk as the words flowed out from his mouth.* - Tue Sep 22 21:28:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: That scroll. - Wed Sep 23 00:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) calmly rested on the side of the road. His legs crossed, and his stance erect. He looked like a peaceful monk as he sat on the road. "Hm..I should learn how to live off the land," he thought to himself.  His eyes scanned the area around him, looking for various vegetation that could be edible.  If he wanted to pursue his study, looking for different ways to obtain food and water would be the best thing to learn. 

As he began to look around, he took notice to Misa who appeared beside him. "Oh, hello Misa. How are you doing?", he asked.* - Wed Sep 23 13:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) could sense a bit of frustration from Misa's words and her body language.  As the philosophical peace loving  individual he was, he wanted to help aleviate this frustration any way he could. "Is something the matter? You can always talk to me about your problems."* - Wed Sep 23 13:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) raised a brow in confusion from the woman's words. "Mutated? Is such a thing possible?"* - Wed Sep 23 13:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) just nodded his head. He understood that the female felt a sense of disgust towards this Hanabi individual, but he himself felt that this emotion was misplaced. "You shouldn't judge a book by it's cover. Perhaps this individual was born that way, or suffered a terrible accident?" He let out a gentle smile as the words flowed out of his mouth. * - Wed Sep 23 14:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: A lycan? What is that? - Wed Sep 23 14:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was taken a back by the comment. An individual who could transform into an animal sounded rather interesting. In his mind he imagined Hanabi following and examining snakes for long periods of time.  "This Hanabi person must be a dedicated animal lover to be able to do something like that. Don't you think?"* - Wed Sep 23 14:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see. - Wed Sep 23 14:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: But guess what. - Wed Sep 23 14:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: What? - Wed Sep 23 14:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Even better news. - Wed Sep 23 14:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Better news? - Wed Sep 23 14:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) wasn't sure what Misa was going to do, but he trusted her. The genin nodded his head. "Sure."* - Wed Sep 23 14:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) allowed his gaze to travel to Misa, then over to her hand, which was now emitting a green hue.  He was rather confused at what it was she was doing. As he had never seen medical ninjutsu up front, he wouldn't be able to accurately tell it from a glance.   He did however, feel a soothing sensation upon his shoulder which caused him to hint at the idea of a special jutsu.  "Could that be what I think it is?"* - Wed Sep 23 14:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: mhm - Wed Sep 23 14:25:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: !* - Wed Sep 23 14:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You did? Who? - Wed Sep 23 14:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I never heard of her. Is she good? - Wed Sep 23 14:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: She's decent for now. - Wed Sep 23 14:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yep. - Wed Sep 23 14:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I've been meditating for a while. I also tried to stop a shinobi from leaving the village and going down the path of revenge, but my words didn't reach him. - Wed Sep 23 14:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I just hope that he finds the light before it's too late. - Wed Sep 23 14:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Besides that, there hasn't been anything new. - Wed Sep 23 14:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I tried to. I didn't stop. But I honestly hope the departing words I gave him stuck. - Wed Sep 23 14:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It was someone named Maloth. Apparently he was displeased with recent events within the village. From what I understand, it was due to the death of a friend. - Wed Sep 23 14:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So he is looking for the men who took her life. - Wed Sep 23 14:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: that's saddening.... - Wed Sep 23 14:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Indeed it is.  And I hope so too.  - Wed Sep 23 14:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) let out a saddened sigh as he cast his gaze upon the sky. He was worried about Maloth, and the village as a whole.  Who knew how many other people would be swayed by their own sense of justice and revenge.  Thinking of such an event emotionally hurt the youth.  He understood where such people came from, as pain could change a person a lot. However, it was through the teachings that he recieved, that he learned that causing similar pain to others would only create an endless cycle of misery.

With a worried expression on his face, he glanced down over at Misa, "Do you think I made the right choice?"* - Wed Sep 23 14:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) chuckled at Misa's words. "I wouldn't have fought him. That would just make things worse.  I mean, should I have tried to persuade him further with words? I feel like I could have done more," he commented, glancing back up into the sky.* - Wed Sep 23 14:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: theres only a certain amount of talking one can do. - Wed Sep 23 14:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: But to resort to violence would push everything back. - Wed Sep 23 14:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Mhm. - Wed Sep 23 14:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So, what does this teacher look like? - Wed Sep 23 14:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: black hair, rather pretty...i don't know...really... - Wed Sep 23 15:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: omit - Wed Sep 23 20:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was just meditating prior to Niza appearing before him. He opened his eyes, revealing the azure spheres that rested in his sockets. His gaze swept over towards Niza's direction, examining his figure. A gentle smile cracked on his face as he waved hello to the male. "Hello there Raikage," he spoke.  He had never seen Niza before, but he automatically assumed that the male was the Raikage due to his choice in clothing. * - Wed Sep 23 20:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Hello. - Wed Sep 23 20:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Pleasant day, is it not? - Wed Sep 23 20:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I believe it is. - Wed Sep 23 20:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Care for a seat? - Wed Sep 23 20:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: No, I'm fine. - Wed Sep 23 20:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) pats down at the open plot of land beside him. He turned his eyes to where his hand was, giving off a friendly smile to the Kage.* - Wed Sep 23 20:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Oh, alright then. - Wed Sep 23 20:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So, what can I do you the honor for, Lord Raikage? - Wed Sep 23 20:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Ah...Well...I was just looking for someone to pass missions out to. - Wed Sep 23 21:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Care to take part? - Wed Sep 23 21:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Sure. - Wed Sep 23 21:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It would help me with my meditation greatly. - Wed Sep 23 21:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) accepted the scroll. He let it rest in his hands, slowly opening it to reveal it's contents.  After reading it, he smiled and closed the scroll, stuffing it into his kimono. "May I ask, where are these visitors?", he questioned.* - Wed Sep 23 21:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: They should be settled outside of our shopping complex I believe. - Wed Sep 23 21:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Seemed like the best place to begin. - Wed Sep 23 21:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) nodded his head. "I see. Then I'll check," he commented.  He slowly closed his eyes, applying a small current of chakra into his optic nerves.  The nerves began to pulsate as the color of his iris began to fade from his usual azure, to a milky white.  As the process took place, veins began to bulge out from the side of his eyes, some which were hidden by his midnight blue hair.   Alas, he opened his eyes to reveal his doujutsu.

"Thank you for the information," he spoke in a gentle tone as he glanced over towards the direction of the shopping center.  His vision began to magnify beyond tenfold, granting him vision beyond the norm.  His gaze traveled for quite a distance until it reached the shopping center where he could see a foreign looking individual. "I've found him," he added, releasing the strain of chakra that powered his optic nerves. In just an instant, the protruding veins recieded back into his face, and his eyes returned to their natural azure color.* - Wed Sep 23 21:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Is there anything I should know about this visitor? I wish to make his trip here as pleasant as possible. - Wed Sep 23 21:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: He's a simple man from what I recall. You could probably show him a rock and he'd be astonished by it simply because it's foreign. - Wed Sep 23 21:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see. Then I shall show him the wonders of the village, and intrigue his mind. - Wed Sep 23 21:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Good. - Wed Sep 23 21:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) rose up from his seat and patted himself down, removing whatever dirt that clinged to his clothing. He smiled once more at Niza, then bowed his head and began to walk off to meet the visitor. After all, it was rude to have someone waiting long. "I shall be off then. Thank you for granting me this opportunity," the genin called out.* - Wed Sep 23 21:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) arrived into the Kumogakure's shopping center after following where he last saw the foreigner. As he arrived, he saw the man once more. He was a frail looking individual with bizzare clothing, at least compared to this region.  He wore rather heavy long sleeved clothing, with multiple layers.  It was obvious that he came from a region where the temperature was rather low.

Kuro smiled at the man and approached him, "Hello there. Are you the foreigner I'm suppose to escort?", he asked with a gentle tone. The man turned around, hair swaying as he moved his head. The man had pale skin, a mushroom cut and thick round spectacles.   Almost as if he was surprised, he pushed his spectacles up and inched his head forwards towards Kuro to confirm his identity. 

"Oh yes.  I am Minato, a traveling novelist. I go from village to village looking for writing material. Now that the war is over between the ninja villages, I can finally relax and continue on with my life's work."

The kumogakure shinobi let out a faint laugh at the man's response. He wasn't expecting a novelist. In his mind, he pictured a foreign prince or a diplomat, not a travelling novelist. It was a refreshing sight which easied his mind. After all, he didn't want to be around a closed minded dignitary who'd go into a fit at the trop of a hat. 

With a sigh of relief, he extended his right hand outwards, motioning for the friendly shake. "I'm Kuro. I will be your escort for today. I'm pleased to begin your tour around the village.  If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. Now, is there anywhere you'd like to go specifically?", the genin asked in a gentle tone. 

The novelist paused for a moment, making a face that could easily be decifered as a face of thought. He was silent for a few seconds, then finally he opened his mouth and broke the silence. "Well, my next book is based upon a monk. So I'd like to see some monk like locations around the village, especially since you're known to have ninja monks."

Kuro smiled once again at the male's request. "Very well then. I shall take you to a field where there's various mountains. You should get a sense of a monk from the ambience there. Will you follow me please?", he asked, begining his stride to direct the man to the intended location.* - Wed Sep 23 21:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) arrived at the location he wanted to show to the foreigner. Shortly after arriving, the foreigner came trodding along.  He looked to be out of breath, slouching over in his bulk of clothing. "Are you alright?", asked Kuro. 

Minato continued with his heavy breathing, straightening his stance up and giving Kuro a thumbs up. "I'm alright. This is nothing. The life of a novelist is hard work. You must go through various trials and tribulations to get a best seller. Now, is this the place you were talking about Kuro?", he spoke.  Kuro nodded and replied with a simple "Yes."

"This area is rather calm. A lot of people come here to meditate, such as myself. It gives a serene feeling, and it allows one to feel at ease with the world. Would you like to try meditating here? You may feel at peace,and even gain some ideas," the Kumogakure shinobi spoke. The foreign novelist twisted his face for a brief moment, then took a step infront of Kuro. He placed his things on the ground and sat beside them with a thump.

"So, how do you meditate?", Minato asked, shifting his head towards the shinobi. Kuro lowered his body and sat onto the ground as well, crossing his legs and straightening his back. "Alright, you begin by putting yourself into a relaxing position. Usually people straighten their backs and cross their legs. Just don't get too relax, or you'll fall asleep.  Next, you close your mind and listen to the nature around you. Try to feel the life energy of the world. Open your mind's eye and feel the life around you. Feel the breath of nature," he explained as he too began to slip into a state of meditation.   As he explained the process, he formed a single meditative handseal and rested both hands upon his lap.

Minato on the other hand tried his best to emulate Kuro. He'd look back occasionally to mimic the shinobi. He had never done such a thing before, so it wasn't odd to feel well, weird.  He too followed the steps that were broadcasted, and eventually he found himself drifting into a meditative trance.  He felt the ambience brush up against his skin. It felt rejuvinating.

After what felt like hours, he two ceased their meditative session. Minato stood up from his seat and smiled at Kuro, prompting the genin to do the same. "Thank you for showing me such a great place. I feel like I can write for an eternity now.  I will be off now. Thank you once again for giving me this opportunity. It was fun and informative. Farewell Kuro, and I hope that you go far in whatever it is that you wish to do."

Kuro smiled and bowed his head replying with, "You're welcome. I too thank you for this time. I learned much from being around you. I wish to see your work one day. Perhaps, even I may write my own novel in the hopes of reaching the hearts of many."  As he said those words, the foreigner waved farewell and began to make his way to the village gates, where a caravan laid waiting for him.  With his mission complete, Kuro headed off to the Raikage's mansion for his report.* - Wed Sep 23 22:11:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) calmly walked into the Raikage's office. Upon arrival, he took notice to a few faces he had yet to familarize himself with. He smiled and began to greet himself, "Hello there, I'm Kuro."  As he said those words, he approached Niza and handed him back the mission scroll that he was tasked with. "I've completed the mission. The foreigner was rather interesting. I showed him a great time around the village."* - Wed Sep 23 22:16:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: She -is- pretty dangerous, and still on the run I presume? - Wed Sep 23 22:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: She was returned to the Gezo, as it was our goal of the mission. - Wed Sep 23 22:33:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) understood what Niza meant. He just nodded his head and replied with his usual gentle smile, "I understand. I'll be cautious."  His eyes then glanced over towards the woman who remained silent for the duration of the group's vocal communication.  She had flowing ebony hair, and was rather on the attractive side.  He squinted his eyes, feeling a sense of deja-vu towards the woman.

"Why does she seem familar?", he thought to himself, staring at the woman for a brief moment. It wasn't until a few seconds in that the gears of his mind turned, causing the light bulb in his head to emit a light. "Ah, I get it. She must be the one Misa was talking about. Black hair, sort of pretty..What was her name though? Marie? Hm..No. I guess I should ask her," he continued to converse with himself mentally.  

The genin took a few steps forwards, positioning himself infront of the female. With a gentle expression on his face, he extended his right hand out, "By any chance, do you know of female by the name of Misa?", he spoke.* - Wed Sep 23 22:51:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) thinks: I bet Misa still hates me after our last encounter... - Wed Sep 23 22:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) thinks: I did leave in the middle of the night... - Wed Sep 23 22:56:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Yeah, I taught Misa a medical technique. - Wed Sep 23 22:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) bowed his head at Mariana with a smile on his face. He was finally able to meet the esteemed teacher that Misa talked about.  He was honestly happy for her friend.  It was then that he suddenly recalled information that he was provided.  He directed his sights over towards Niza as he began to speak, "Do you perhaps know of someone named Hanabi? Misa mentioned her before, and how she was able to grow scales upon her body similar to an animal. "* - Wed Sep 23 22:57:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: No. I said that this Hanabi person can grow scales. - Wed Sep 23 22:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Although... We can assume the worst....Knowing Hanabi she probably did the same thing she did to me, to Misa. - Wed Sep 23 22:59:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) directed his sights over towards Hideki. He was in awe as he watched the scales grow upon his body, and his eyes transitioning from that which looked human, into a snake like visage.  "Does it hurt?", he asked, unsure of the transformation process.* - Wed Sep 23 23:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: It happened while I was...In another village. - Wed Sep 23 23:03:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: No, it's not your fault for it's her own. It is a man's own mind, not his enemy or foe, that lures him to evil ways. - Wed Sep 23 23:05:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: And after that, couple more days go by and your body chemically starts to change. - Wed Sep 23 23:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: However, with meditation and a clear mind, I'm sure you can find the light behind the scenario.  - Wed Sep 23 23:08:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: After you see your father murdered in cold blood, right infront of you. Kind of stops you from being a pacifist.. And going down another path... - Wed Sep 23 23:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So you gave into your anger? - Wed Sep 23 23:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I gave into whatever helped me gain vengeance. - Wed Sep 23 23:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: But was that vengence worth it? - Wed Sep 23 23:12:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Proven by the rather large snake she summoned within Konohagakure. - Wed Sep 23 23:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Although.... - Wed Sep 23 23:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: As for this Hanabi individual, is she someone dangerous? - Wed Sep 23 23:17:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I wish to learn how to utilize it properly, not as a weapon to harm others, but as a deterrent to those who may wish harm. - Wed Sep 23 23:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) shook his head no. "I do not. What is it exactly?", he asked in a curious tone. He'd never heard of the technique, but from it's name he guessed it created some sort of sphere comprised of lightning. However, names could be decieving so it was better to ask about it.* - Wed Sep 23 23:28:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) nodded at the explaination and then took the scroll. He'd open it up to read the contents of the parchment His eyes began to scan the scroll, examining everything that he currently could about it.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was too into reading the scroll that he didn't catch what was going on beside him. He didn't know who Hanabi was, at least not by face or voice. He continued to read the scroll, placing it onto his lap as he began to mimic the hand seal formation that was displaced. One by one, he slowly formed the seals while gathering the chakra that rested in his lower abdomen.  

The chakra that rested in his stomach began to flow through his veins, raising up his chest and dividing into his arms, then finally resting in his hands. As he formed seal after seal, the chakra circuit connected, bringing about a small emission of raiton chakra.  His own proficiency in the usage of raiton natured chakra wasn't great, in fact it was rather poor, however that didn't stop him from learning let alone trying. * - Wed Sep 23 23:43:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) lowered the scroll, placing it onto his lap. He then turned his head towards the group. "Excuse me, does this Erebus person have a connection with someone recently deceased named Amai, and another individual by the name of Maloth?"* - Wed Sep 23 23:46:33 2015
