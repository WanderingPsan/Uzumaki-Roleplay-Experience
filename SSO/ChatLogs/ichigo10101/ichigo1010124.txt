<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) brought his left hand up to his mouth as he released a yawn. The monk's eyes drooped around as he approached the Sunagakure training area. As of late, he'd felt as though his body were drained, almost akin to that feeling of squeezing toothpaste from an almost empty bottle. 

As he entered the training grounds, his eyes instantly began to follow into motion; keeping track of the various orbs which bounced about in random movement.  He was confused and opt to stand to the side, away from the general area, as he didn't want to intrude on the training sessions of the group. However, he was being too optimistic. A few globes found their way towards his direction, hurling themselves into his vicinity.  He was one who was quick on their toes, so he took a step to the left, then the right.  

The solid spheres swept pass the monk's frame, only to rub up against his arms.  It was his failure of judgment that granted him such injuries. They were minor, but injuries none the less. He let out a sigh, crossing his arms shortly before leaning up against the stone wall.* - Sat Nov 21 00:23:28 2015

"Hello Momura. I didn't know we'd have a guest. Do you need anything?", he'd ask. * - Sat Nov 21 05:32:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) glides over towards the stove after he offered to make tea for the party.  A smile formed along his face as he reached over towards an empty tea pot.  He'd open the lid and sit the pot under the sink, turning the water on.

The faucet rang with the sound of running water descending down into the empty kettle.  Its sound reverberated slightly as the water continued to fill. A few moments passed and he turned the faucet off, moving the kettle over the currently off stove.

"Let's see...Oolong, Green, Black..Ah, I'll just go for Green Tea," he mumbled to himself just seconds before reaching out into the upper cabinet. The monk grabbed ahold of a small jar filled with crushed, condensed leaves.  His hand hovered over its cap, gripping it and prying it open. 

A nice fragrance emerged from the released jar. A single whiff brought the monk at peace. A smile befell his face as he turned around to glance over at the two. "You don't mind Green Tea do you?", he'd ask as his hand motioned towards the stove's switch.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Green tea will suit me just fine. - Sat Nov 21 05:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) nodded as he poured some tea leaves into the open kettle.  He'd switch the flame on, heating up the underside of the kettle.   Kuro turned his gaze over towards the two just as he closed the lid, allowing for the flavors to settle and spread out. 

"Chikyu, how well would you say you can use a sword?", he'd ask.* - Sat Nov 21 05:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: 9rip - Sat Nov 21 05:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: May I ask, why the sword? - Sat Nov 21 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: My dad wanted to train me to be a strong warrior, and I wanted to be just like my dad. - Sat Nov 21 05:56:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Anyway, I ask about the sword because I've grown an interest in it. - Sat Nov 21 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Well, I'm no good at teaching. And, I don't think my dad would teach you anything. If you want any basic info, I can tell  you anything you want. - Sat Nov 21 05:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I've seen rather graceful and composed moves from swordsmen.  They don't allow their emotions to sway their judgement.  - Sat Nov 21 05:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't plan to learn the sword for combat reasons, rather for meditative reasons.  My training with Yukio has been quite difficult, and I've been convinced that by taking up the sword I may be able to concentrate more and build up on my physical attributes. - Sat Nov 21 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) raised his hand to his chin as he began to chuckle at the actions of the two. Just as he began to laugh, the kettle screamed.  His eyes turned to the pot, lifting it from the grill and placing it upon a cooler one.  He'd then turn the stove off and allow the pot to rest for a bit. 

Shortly after, the monk would take out three ceramic cups and set them on the counter side by side.  "I'd appreciate that," he'd retort.* - Sat Nov 21 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) thinks: This is pretty funny. - Sat Nov 21 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) saw that the tea had cooled off a bit. He'd raise the kettle and pour the contents into the three cups.  After filling each cup carefully, he'd sit the kettle down and bring two of the cups over towards the seated females. "There you go. It's still hot, so be careful."* - Sat Nov 21 06:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Thank you.  I used to make it all the time at the temple. - Sat Nov 21 06:18:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) would nod his head just before reaching for his own cup. He'd walk over towards the empty seat in the couch and sit onto it. "Yep, the temple.  I'm a monk, didn't you know?", he questioned as he turned his head towards the female. Kuro would slightly tilt his head, giving Chikyu a questioning look.* - Sat Nov 21 06:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't? I thought I did.  - Sat Nov 21 06:23:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) looked down at his own wardrobe, gripping his kimono. "I guess not. I did base my clothing on Yukio's a bit, but with more of a traditional appeal. Guess it doesn't translate," he'd chuckle.* - Sat Nov 21 06:25:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: The question? Well, how to obtain peace.  I thought my initial views from when I was in the temple would suffice, but I've seen hardships and not everyone is willing to share my views. - Sat Nov 21 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: W-Well easiest w-way to peace.. - Sat Nov 21 06:32:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hmm... that sounds all pretty complicated. I'll just keep on protecting those who I care about. - Sat Nov 21 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Everyone believes that they can obtain peace by cutting down their opponents, but that's not true peace. That just leads to an eternal linegae of bloodshed and agony. - Sat Nov 21 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: But, I'm not chasing peace. I'm chasing to protect what I can while I'm alive. - Sat Nov 21 06:35:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So you're willing to take a life to protect what's yours? - Sat Nov 21 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Even if taking said life will rob another of the ability to protect what's theres? What if someone comes for revenge? Will you keep taking lives after lives until you have nothing left? - Sat Nov 21 06:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Well, the world I wish to create, you won't have to worry about such a problem.  Everyone will be able to coexist together and not have to fight for resources, and protection.  - Sat Nov 21 06:44:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Taking a life is never a good deed, no matter how you justify it. However, is not sitting back just as wrong. When you can help someone to the best of your ability. I'm here to be a good person to my friends, and thats all I can offer in my life thats of value. Other then that, I'll selfishly protect those around me. I'm not good at creating peace or anything like that. But, if you can do that I'll be really happy. Because, I won't have to fight anymore. - Sat Nov 21 06:45:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) finished his cup of tea and sat it onto the table before them. He'd then hoist up his legs, pressing them up against his body as he folded them. He'd place his palms into the center of his body, creating a single seal. 

"So, what have the two of you been doing lately?", he'd ask, turning his head towards the two females.* - Sat Nov 21 07:12:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) just ignored the two as he closed his eyes and entered a meditative trance. He was already in a stance, so it didn't take much for him to drift into such a state. "I'll meditate for a bit, so make yourself at home, " he'd comment as he allowed his mind to drift further into his mental world. 

He quickly found himself in a white void where only two figures stood. Himself, and a phantasmal being surrounded by a golden light.  He'd explore this wolrd in the meantime until the two finished whatever it was that they were about to do.   Besides, he couldn't admit that he was a bit nervous around two topless females, so meditating was his form of dealing with it.* - Sat Nov 21 07:35:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) kept his concentration, even though his mortal body had it's face stuffed into bare chests. The mental Kuro continued to remain in the void room, glaring at the giant golden statue that rested in the center.  He'd extend his hand, touching the statue for a moment.

"If only I was stronger," he muttered, as he too took on to a meditative pose.  The inner Kuro clasped his hands together as it's form began to flow a golden hue.  Golden specks of light began to surround his body, as his mortal form began to radiate with a faint golden hue.* - Sat Nov 21 07:46:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) continued to meditate, focusing on his relationship with Kannon. Eventually, he'd exit out of the meditative trance, and hear the voices of Chikyu and Momura. He stood up from his seat and glanced at the two, looking at them with a blank expression. 

"It's good to see you guys are having fun," he'd mutter.* - Sat Nov 21 08:07:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) chuckled at the group as he rose up from his seat. He'd look over by the door and grab his scarf which draped along a hanger. He'd wave the scarf around his neck, wrapping it around just as he exited from the house.* - Sun Nov 22 00:12:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) walked into the square and saw Marco near by. He'd approached the tan skinned male and wave a friendly hello. "Hey there," he'd begin.* - Sun Nov 22 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Evening. - Sun Nov 22 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I've a request. I'm not sure if you recall our previous conversation about the bokken. - Sun Nov 22 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: How much would one be? - Sun Nov 22 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Oh. I have one already made, I suppose. - Sun Nov 22 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was quite surprised at how fast it was pulled out. He honestly didn't expect to see what he wanted in such a short time. A grin formed on his face as he extended his hand over towards the wooden katana. His fingers wrapped around it's durable frame as he reached into his kimono and pulled out a sack of Yen.  He'd  stick the bokken into his obi sash as he began to count the currency, equating to a total 1,000 yen.  He'd hand the money over towards Marco and let out a graceful smile. 

"Thank you," he'd say as he bowed his head. He'd then stuff his pouch back into his kimono.* - Sun Nov 22 05:49:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was just about to depart for his own training when he noticed Koji. His eyes flashed a look of shock as he hadn't seen the shinobi in quite some time. He had assumed he departed on a long mission or something. 

He'd approach the shinobi and wave a gentle hello. "It's been a while Koji," he began. He'd allow his arms to fall limp, dangling along his sides.* - Sun Nov 22 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see. I suppose that's expected. - Sun Nov 22 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I guess it would be a bit too much to ask for your assitance. Well, more or less your guidance. - Sun Nov 22 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Hmm? My guidance? - Sun Nov 22 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yes.  To be more exact, I wish for you to teach me a technique. I've spoken to you about it prior. I'm not sure if you recall. - Sun Nov 22 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: I remember lets go talk. - Sun Nov 22 06:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) crossed his arms and nodded. " I see. It makes sense.  The only thing that binds us together are our eyes.  As for jutsu, I don't have much to trade, at least things that I can teach to others," he'd retort.   He understood fully what Koji was going through. In fact, he shared such a bond with Yukio. * - Sun Nov 22 06:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) remained silent as he listened to Koji's words. They weren't bad, but to adopt the name of another family, that was a big step.  His own roots were tethered back to Kumogakure.  It was indeed a difficult choice to make.

He kept his arms crossed, his azure eyes piercing forwards into Koji's frame.  "I'll have to think about it. As you know, Sunagakure isn't my home. I also don't feel much at home here either. My views clash with many of the shinobi here. It's akin to being the black sheep surrounded by wolves.  I do appreciate the offer, but I'd have to give it some thought. It's a life changing decision after all,"he'd respond with a weary smile. 

In all honesty, Kuro never had a "family". He had friends and allies, but no one whose name he shared. In terms of bonds, Yukio was akin to his only relative. However, as of late, he's come to understand the term of family.  For now however, it was a difficult decision for the monk.  

"I've a question. If I were to join your family, what then? Will I have to stay here in Sunagakure? Will I be forced to abandon my identity as a resident of Kumogakure?", he added.* - Sun Nov 22 07:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) continued to listen to Koji's words. They made sense.  He'd smile and then nod his head. "Sure.  It won't hurt to be part of a family. What would we consider each other? Cousins? Brothers?", he questioned.  His initial nerves were washed away.* - Sun Nov 22 07:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Wait, the family is the police force as well? - Sun Nov 22 07:47:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: What should I know about the clan? - Sun Nov 22 07:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Well, naturally having respect to others is the main rule. Grandmother always stressed that and never go anywhere without telling someone. We want to know where you are at all time so we can find you if you're in trouble. - Sun Nov 22 07:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That makes sense. - Sun Nov 22 07:57:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: I would like them to be the head of the family if it seems appropriate at the time. It will truly mark the rebirth of our people. - Sun Nov 22 08:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: 'Well, since we are family now I guess I have the power to allow you passage into the Lightning Temple if need be. I'm the heir to the head monk position there. - Sun Nov 22 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So if anything happens, you can always come to the temple. - Sun Nov 22 08:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: I understand, they happen to be around often in my presence. Thank you Kuro but I wouldn't want to foil your traditions. There's blood on my hands. I could never. - Sun Nov 22 08:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Tainted hands or not, we help those in need. It's our way of life. - Sun Nov 22 08:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: But! Hokuma, Kuro it's time to have your initiation! It shall be learning the technique you asked for! - Sun Nov 22 08:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Ok. I'm ready. - Sun Nov 22 08:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) thinks: The Temple be swag? Huh? - Sun Nov 22 08:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) observed Koji carefully.  The basic stance that the male took was unique, yet easy to get a grasp of. Perhaps it was due to the fact that he himself utilized the same style that he was able to  get a better grasp.

Kuro's eyes trailed along Koji's form, memorizing each and every bodily movement he made. He'd nod after listening to his explaination. It was akin to the explaination he gave to Niza when he tried teaching him the Gentle Fist.

"I think I get it," he'd retort, as his eyes transitioned into a milky white. Weird growths formed along the side of his face, reaching down to his ears. Steadily, he'd emulate Koji's movements.

Kuro slid his legs apart, lowering his center of gravity just as he began to extend his left and right arms apart. "This seems like it," he thought to himself as he began to imagine the flow of water.  He allowed the image to overtake his mind, guiding his movements like so.

"Begin," he'd say to himself as he slid his hind leg forwards, lunging his body in said direction. In an instant, he'd jab out into the air with one limb, then quickly follow up with another. He'd poke out at the air, tapping the imaginary opponent he formed before him.  The first set of strikes were done, then he took another step forwards, striking out faster than before.

He'd emulate Koji's movements just as he saw, striking fast and efficent for a total of 64 consecutive strikes. Had this been a live body, the individual would have been in quite the situation, however this was not. 

Bursts of chakra were expelled from Kuro's palms and fingers as he attacked the air. He held no malice, only precision.  He knew just how well a mistep would hinder a human being, so to properly learn and emulate the technique would prove to be an advantage in the long run.* - Sun Nov 22 08:48:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: The mind is key in eveything we do. - Sun Nov 22 08:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It is..I have Yukio's training to thank for it. - Sun Nov 22 08:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Yukio seems like a good person, then. Well I hate to cut our time short but I'm a bit tired  from the day's work. - Sun Nov 22 09:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's understandable.  - Sun Nov 22 09:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'll let you go to bed. In the mean time, I'll focus on more of my techniques. - Sun Nov 22 09:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Alright cuzo don't stress yourself. Proper rest accompanies a great traning regime! - Sun Nov 22 09:04:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) felt weird as he departed from the weapon smith.  He had never purchased a weapon before, let alone a blade.  He had good intentions, but he had to make do with what was around. 

As of late, Kuro grew a fascination towards kenjutsu. He wasn't interested in the sword itself, but rather the movement and elegance of the practitioners, specifically Mitsunara.  She was an enigma to him, but the one thing he knew for sure about her was her skill with the blade.   She held a deep admiration for its style and technique, which in itself captivated Kuro's eyes.

Even though he was a monk, it wasn't unheard of for a monk to utilize a weapon. However, in Kuro's case he just wished to learn the sword to use as a meditative tool.   His training in the art of the Gift and harnessing Kannon's power has opened his eyes to just how physically weak he was. He'd run out of juice rather quick when utilizing its energies, so he figured the best option would be to build his own stamina reserves and physical strength.  Thus, he came to the conclusion of the sword.

He'd of course would be starting from the very beginning, learning everything on his own. That in itself would be quite challenging. He had no teacher in the field, and his only aid was his memories of previous practitioners. 

The wooden bokken he purchased prior dangled about in his obi sash.  It rested along his hip in plain view. It was a finely crafted piece which had little to no lethality to it. The monk reached for the weapon and drew it, pulling it out from the sash and clutching it into his hands.  His fingers wrapped along the handle of the weapon, raising it directly in front of his body. One hand rested over the other, fortifying his grip. It was only natural to hold such a weapon with two hands, especially after witnessing many users of the blade.

Kuro closed his eyes for a moment, as he dove into his memories to recall all of the scenarios in which he witnessed a blade in use. The earliest being back from when he still lived in Kumogakure.  He recalled Mamoru and Reign using blades, same with Hideki to an extent and then there were plenty in Sunagakure. He took deep breath as he calmed himself. It was actually the first time he held a "weapon" in such a way.  To him, the bokken wasn't a weapon but a meditative tool, one that would be used to fortify both the mind and body.

"Alright, I just follow the memories," he thought to himself as he tightened the grip around the bokken. He'd begin his practice by emulating a traditional stance. His left and right legs were parted slightly, only spreading as far as his waist.  He'd then slide his right foot forwards, rearing the left to an anchored position.  Just like his meditative sessions, Kuro allowed his mind to focus and become blank.  His objective was not to think, but to feel and react as natural as possible. The first step to learning the sword was to gain a natural understanding of it.  Such a stance felt natural, yet unnatural at the same time. Perhaps it was due to his body not being accustomed to such stances.  He felt his balance remain steady, but the action of transitioning from a basic stance to an action seemed a bit rocky.

The very first practice he'd conduct on his own was to swing the bokken. It sounded fairly easy, but in reality it was not. Playing the images in his head over and over, Kuro duplicated the move sets as best as he possibly could. He'd pivot forwards using the left leg as a starting point. As his body propelled forwards, he'd raise the blade and bring it crashing down in a single movement.  Quickly, he'd pivot back to his initial position, resetting the posture of the blade. Performing said action felt natural, but there indeed was something off. As someone learning on their own and with no formal training, the movements were rather ok. But, it held many gaps which could easily be broken.   That in itself wasn't much of a problem as he never intended to use the training for combat, rather for the sole meditative purpose.* - Sun Nov 22 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) stopped for a moment, catching his breath. He never knew swinging a bokken took so much energy, but that was the whole purpose of this training.  It was to strengthen both the mind and body. His eyes remained sharp as he continued on with his training.

The monk remained in said stance, keeping a tight hold on his bokken.  From what he recalled, the stance was rather basic and allowed for versatility, which he could see from the get go. He was no combat expert, but he understood the body and how to defend one's self.  Kuro pressed onwards, taking another step forwards as he swung his sword in the air.  A loud snap could be heard from the speed of the strike cutting through the air.  It was quite beautiful in all honesty.

The blade cut through the air like butter as he allowed its tip to descend from one corner to another.  He kept his form and focused on the aspect of swinging. With each swing, he'd become more and more accustomed to the blade, at least he hoped. Kuro took a step back, gliding the blade from left to right in a single movement. His torso contorted like a spring, allowing his muscles to work together for the smoothest of movements possible.  It wasn't a perfect swing, but it was a swing none the less.* - Mon Nov 23 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) lowered his blade and sheathed it back into his sash.  Night had risen, and he had grown tired. His head shifted towards the epicenter of the village. "Hm..," he muttered just before departing.* - Mon Nov 23 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: She doesnt even look like she has that much chakra - Mon Nov 23 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: Maybe I should her before she hurts herself - Mon Nov 23 01:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) noticed a large crowd in the training fields.  He raised a brow as he took a few steps into the fields. His eyes glanced at those around, assessing the situation and what not. "Is something important happening?", he thought.  

Just as he was about to turn upon his heels, he noticed Aoi and Mirai in the vicinity.  Instead of leaving, he approached the two. A friendly wave to Aoi, and another to Mirai.

"Hello," he'd speak in a gentle tone.* - Mon Nov 23 01:57:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) sat on the side lines, observing the bout between Chikyu and Chikuryunaki.  He was more focused on Chikyu's movements. Everything she did in response to her foe, her movements, attacks, everything, he paid close attention to.  He was absorbing it like a sponge.* - Mon Nov 23 02:23:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) stolled into the department store for just a few items. As he entered, he noticed Kiyoko and "Osuda". He'd wave at the two just before reaching the store counter.* - Mon Nov 23 02:32:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) didn't pay much attention to the conversation between the two. He did however have his guard up after the situation with Yukio.  Upon finishing with his purchases, he turned on his heels and began to walk towards the exit.  He'd shift his head towards "Osuda" and wave a gentle farewell moments before departing.* - Mon Nov 23 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You as well. - Mon Nov 23 02:44:16 2015

He'd step with grace.  His haori jacket fluttered in the wind with each step he took.  He held a serene air about him, one which seemed far stronger than before.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) found himself in a rather secluded area of Sunagakure. It was the perfect place to train his mind and body. For today, his objective was to become accustomed to rapid movement. Prior to arriving, he'd set up a makeshift obstacle course. There were multiple wooden dolls positioned around the monk. They were all around him, covering a 360 degree radius.

He took a deep breath, calming his nerves and allowing his mind to become still. Chakra began to gather from within, quickly motioning towards his ocular nerves. In a fraction of a second, his azure blue eyes transformed into a monotone white. As the transition took place, veins began to bulge from the side of his face, extending from the corner of his eyes down to his temples.  His vision increased dramatically as he gained a clear dimensional awareness. 

The monk spread his legs partially, halting the progress at about a waist's length. He'd then extend his arms far apart, lowering his torso to enhance his center of gravity.  His eyes swayed back and forth, taking account of everything in his attack range. "Here we go," he thought to himself as he took a single step forwards, jabbing his right hand forwards into one of the wooden structures.  He'd strike not with a fist, but with finger jabs and palm thrusts.  

There were no sound from the resulting impact as he didn't utilize strength, rather speed and precision. He'd quickly sweep his left foot, inching his body closer to his next target, the second dummy. Another strike was executed, hitting the center of the dummy's "chest".  "Two," he counted, taking another step forwards. He'd glide pass the second dummy, positioning himself to the third.

Kuro's hands jolted forwards, tapping the dummy twice. In a single motion, what looked to be one strike transitioned into two. He took another step, nearing himself to the forth dummy, sending another barrage towards its frame. This time, four strikes. "Six," he continued.

His foot slid against the ground once more, almost as if he were dancing. His movements were calm and peaceful. Every step he took, he moved with grace and accuracy. His hands motioned and made contact with a few more dummies. Their bases rattled slightly from the force, but not so much. "Nine," he counted.

Kuro by then had attacked about six dummies thus far. He had quite a ways to reach his quota. However, the closer he got to his mental quota, he faster he began to strike. Weaving to and fro, he'd slide through dummy after dummy, striking various areas on their bodies. Some suffered a single strike, others multiple.  The monk's hands moved like lighting, striking everything and anything in range. "Twenty."

The monk was about a third complete with his training. His breathing became heavy, but he continued. He'd lunge forwards, using his footwork to get maneuver around the multiple dummies in the area. His hands continued to sweep through their silhouettes, pressing into the various points.  To him, it became child's play as he became more and more accustomed to its usage.  It was only a matter of time until he became proficient enough to the point where he'd be satisfied.* - Tue Nov 24 01:38:08 2015
