<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) rolled the scroll up and placed it into his kimono. He then stood up from his seat and approached Hanabi.

Does it drive you?", he began to speak, trying to get an understanding of Hanabi as a character through his own perspective.* - Thu Sep 24 00:29:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) let out a sigh, casting his sight downwards for a moment. He then raised his gaze back over to Hanabi. "Is there a reason as to why you should cause pain and trouble for others? Does it not bother you that you're causing emotional and physical damage to others?  If you continue down this path, I'm sure you will cross the wrong person and be unable to see the light. Does such a fate not scare you, or even remotely cause you to think of your actions?", he spoke. His voice was gentle yet stern. He harbored no hatred for Hanabi, nor ager. Rather, he wished to provide her with the teachings that he was bestowed, hoping that his words may reach her and guide her to a better path than the one in which she traversed currently.* - Thu Sep 24 00:42:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was walking into the room when he halted his movement in an effort to avoid a collision with Misa. "In a hurry are we?", he said in a playful manner, stepping to the side.  "I see you're feeling much better than before," he added.* - Thu Sep 24 21:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) nodded his head, coming to an understanding of the female's wellbeing. "Then I shouldn't keep you. If there's anything you want to talk about, I have an ear open. Just don't push yourself too much," he spoke in his usual calm demenour.  He then formed a smile upon his face, glad that his friend seemed to be in good health and spirits.* - Thu Sep 24 21:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) is comparing her appearance from their prior engagement.* - Thu Sep 24 21:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) just kept an eye on Misa as she strolled out of the room. As his eyes were fixated on her, he began to notice her movements becoming sluggish and her steps lacking in energy.  Worried about the female, he started to approach her once again.  It was then that he saw her puke onto the ground.

"Misa!", he called out in a frantic voice. He hurried over to her side as her illness began to take over.  When the female landed onto the ground, he quickly scooped her up, carrying her in his arms.  

The genin wasn't entirely sure as to what to do. She looked sick, and he was sure that the treatement from the other night worked perfectly fine.  "Does this have to do with Hanabi?", he thought to himself as he walked back into the Raikage's room, glancing around the area for Mariana. * - Thu Sep 24 22:02:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) follows Mamoru out of the the Raikage's mansion in search of meeting with Yukio.* - Thu Sep 24 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I can't over-state how dangerous Tetsujin is..  - Thu Sep 24 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: ... - Thu Sep 24 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) stopped infront of what seemed to be an enclosed area. He turned over towards Mamoru and began to speak, "Is this the place?", he questioned, peering at the man with his azure eyes.* - Thu Sep 24 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Yes. - Thu Sep 24 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: You can come in. - Thu Sep 24 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was astonished by the sight of the large wall which opened with a single movement. He could feel the virtue from the gates.  "Wow..What an astonishing sight," he muttered under his breath. He took a single step forwards and bowed his head before continuing pass the gates.  

He noticed a man who he could only assume to be Yukio. He knew nothing except that the man was a priest and followed a virtuious life, which he himself found to be something worth following.  

Upon walking passed the gates, he bowed his head once more and began to speak. "Thank you for allowing us entrance. I'm to assume that you are Yukio? I am Kuro, a follower of peace. I've come here in hopes that I can obtain some knowledge and wisdom from a man such as yourself."* - Thu Sep 24 23:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) felt a sense of happiness upon hearing that he would become a pupil to a monk. Through such interactions, he was sure that the teachings that he held dear would fortify and grant him an even greater insight to life itself.  The youth bowed his head again and responded with a simple thanks.  

He then rose his head and continued his stride down the large temple grounds. His eyes would glance from one place to another, taking in and experiencing the culture and energy that was being produce by such synergy. 

"It's a pleasure to be under your tutilage. I will do my best to retain the knowledge and wisdom that I gain from this experience." Kuro spoke, stopping just a few feet before Yukio.* - Thu Sep 24 23:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) nodded his head. "I understand. I myself live a non-violent life and believe that a life mustn't be taken under any circumstance. When I heard that there was someone with similar beliefs, I just had to meet them, and thus here I am.  I will not disappoint you or cause shame to your teachings."  The genin spoke in a serious tone. It wasn't tense, in fact it displayed how serious he was and just how much he was willing to broaden his mind. 

Kuro began to follow along with Yukio, absorbing his every words like a sponge.  In the face of Yukio, Kuro was just a child who longed for a means to spread his ideals across. Thus, the temple seemed like the perfect place to cultivate his philosophy.* - Thu Sep 24 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) didn't like the idea of taking another's life, but the words that Yukio spoke were true. Sometimes there were scenario's in which the only means to end it was to take a life. However, that would only be the utmost last option when no other options are available.   He paused in his stride for a moment, trying to think of a response to his words.

 "What do you do after everything is done? I've never thought of taking a life to be an option, even if there's no more options that are infront of me.  How do you live with the burden of knowing that you've stained your hands?"* - Thu Sep 24 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) got a better understanding of Yukio and his teachings. He indeed seem like a vitruious man. He nodded his head once more. "You mean the Raikage? I've met him a few times before. And what exactly is this kempo? I understand it's a martial arts of some sorts."* - Fri Sep 25 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) thought to himself, "So kempo relies on reaction rather than action." He nodded his head to the explaination. "Does that mean that the stronger an opponent is, the more effective the style becomes?"* - Fri Sep 25 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) nods his head, coming to terms with the explaination. "I understand. So it relies on misdirection. I get why you study such skills. May I ask, when shall we begin?"* - Fri Sep 25 02:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: You begin now. - Fri Sep 25 02:41:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) thinks: What reserves does he mean? Does he mean my chakra? - Fri Sep 25 02:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) wasn't sure what Yukio meant, but he did understand the concept of meditation. He'd perform  the task numerous times on his own to clear his mind. Just like all the other times he sat himself down onto the ground, folding his legs together. He straightened his back, making it erect to straighten his stance. He then lowered his arms, wrapping his fingers together to form a single seal for the purpose of meditation. 

As he prepared his stance, he began to take deep breaths of air into his lungs. He'd inhale through his nose and exhale through his mouth. His breathing held no rhythim at first, but as he delve deeper into his meditative state, the breathing took a soothing approach. 

Slowly, his lids began to droop down, sealing themselves shut to allow his mind to further dive into his meditative trance. The soothing sounds of nature flowed through his ears, drifting him into a temporary peace.  The world around him turned white as he began to search through his inner world, looking for a sense of inner peace.* - Fri Sep 25 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) continued to ease his mind as he focused on his meditative trance. He sat upright like a statue, doing nothing but staying in a trance. The world around him felt small, yet large.   Every second he spent in his meditative trance, he felt as if he was becoming one with the world, and that the world was becoming one with him.  The idea of one's self and the chains of personal greed started to loosen around his body. 

Whilst in his meditative state, he began to think of life as a whole, and various other universal ideologies. Even his own ideology was being put to the test. * - Fri Sep 25 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) Kuro stood still in his tranquil state of meditation. While in this state, the concept of time escaped his grasp, causing him to lose his sense of time. Had it been five minutes, an hour, or even two since he began this session. He didn't know, nor did he really care. Meditation was a means of training and relaxation for the young pacifist. It became a daily ritual for him that served many purposes. It served to rid his mind of worry and doubt, anger and suffering, and various other sins of the mind and body.  He believed that a constant regiment of meditation at a daily pace would purify both the mind and following with the body.  

As he continued to maintain his focus, the ambient noise of nature continued to wrap around his figure. The sense of unity was strong between him and the area. It wasn't only because he was deep in meditation, but also due to his location. The temple was a perfect place to meditate. It was a beautiful location, and there was an abundance of positive energy radiating from every crevice of the temple. Alas, all good things must end eventually.  

After what felt like a brief moment, the genin slowly opened his eyes to awake from his meditative trance. His eyes glanced from side to side, looking for Yukio but he was nowhere to be found. Perhaps his teacher had went to bed, or went to do his own training. Either way, it gave Kuro the perfect opportunity to catch up on some of his own training.   He maintained his sitting position and reached into his kimono with one of his hands.  His hand searched around for an inner pocket for a brief moment. Inside of his kimono, he felt a small cylindrical object. It was soft and thin, almost like a film. He grabbed ahold of the item and pulled it out from his kimono, revealing a small rolled up scroll.  The scroll had a buckle attached to it, allowing it to keep closed until further use. With a flick of his thumb, he released the buckle and opened the scroll.

The small scroll rolled open upon his lap and revealed its inner contents. It was a scroll detailing the usage of the Lightning Ball technique. He'd read the scroll prior, but hadn't spent enough time to fully understand everything that the scroll offered. His azure eyes skimmed the characters that were written on the scroll, searching for where he last left off.  After a brief moment of searching around, he found where he had last read.  It was a section detailing the hand seals of the technique. It didn't require much, let alone a large amount of chakra to utilize, however it still seemed to be a difficult technique to learn.  He himself wasn't particularly talented when it came to the utilization of elemental chakra.   He knew how to draw chakra, but converting his raw base chakra into something akin to electricity would prove to be a challenge.

The genin took a deep breath as he began to imitate the images upon the scroll. It displayed a small sequence of hand signs in which he slowly chained together. The scroll rested on his lap as his hands slowly came together to for different formations one after the other. There was no circulation of chakra, just a steady flow of hand movement.  He didn't bother applying chakra to the technique as he wanted to get the hand sequence down pack first.   The genin continued chaining his hands together over and over for what felt like hours.  His fingertips began to blister, hands became sore, and his fingers cramping up. The constant utilization of his hand muscles with no rest began to cause slight pain to him. It wasn't anything debilitating, in fact it seemed more of an annoyance.   Kuro let out a sigh and ceased the formation of the hand seals.  He gripped the scroll that laid on his lap and began to read it once more; this time from the top.

As he allowed his hands to rest, he began to educate himself onto the utilization and direction of the technique. From the scripture, it described the technique to be a basic example of lightning chakra. The technique was one in which chakra was gathered at a focal point and magnified, transitioning the raw chakra into that of lightning. Then the lightning chakra would rest at the focal point, transitioning into a sphere of electricity. It was then dependent upon the user how the technique was to be executed. A user could channel it into a conductive weapon such as a blade, or release it outwards as a simple blast. The results varied from user to user, but the outcome were generally the same.

Kuro continued to read and read, over and over, trying to grasp a better concept of the technique. After taking enough time to rest his fingers, he began to execute the seals once more. However, unlike prior he decided to use his chakra the same way that it was advised in the scroll. He began by gathering the chakra that rested in his lower abdomen, and slowly have it travel throughout his chakra pathway, up his chest, and finally down into his fingers.  The chakra rested all in his hands, extending from his palm all the way down to his fingertips. A faint warmth lingered around his hands as he began to form the seal one after the other.  After completing the final seal, he parted his hands just a few inches away from each other to allow for the pent up chakra to take form. 

Sounds began to emit from his hands, resembling faint crackles and pops. The noise grew slightly louder as a faint orb began to take shape in between his palms.  The orb's shape wasn't perfect, in fact its shape moved around haphazardly almost as if it wasn't under control. The crackle continued as the orb grew larger and larger, taking a more dynamic shape. The orb itself began to crackle in his hands, displaying a bright light blue hue.  Occasionally, trails of light escaped the orb's form and traveled in and around the shinobi's fingertips. The warmth that he initially felt in the beginning intensified as the jutsu took shape.  

A small ball of lightning was being contained in the palm of his hands. It did nothing but flicker back and forth as trails of light crackled around his hands. If anything, one could compare the ball to that of a stun gun.  As the orb maintained form in his hands, he began to apply more chakra into it. The ball crackled with energy resulting in even more flairs of light to fly away.  The ball's form even began to expand rapidly from his grasp.  At first it looked as if the technique were to work, but then Kuro realized that it was a dud. If he were to apply any more chakra into the technique, it would backfire causing the already channeled lightning chakra to spill out upon his person, causing him bodily harm if anything.  Almost by instinct, he ceased the constant flow of chakra he applied to the jutsu and slammed his palms upon the ground before him.  As a natural conductor, he used the ground to dispel the jutsu.  

The genin let out a sigh as he once again failed his attempt to utilize the jutsu. However, a single failure was never the end. Through his teachings, he'd learn that failure was but the first step to success and that giving up was akin to surrendering to a sin. Thus, he began his lesson once more from the top. With the scroll on his lap he began to read the contents again. He gained a sense of what to do, but he felt as if there was something missing.  

As he backtracked his steps, he began to form the required seals for the technique once more. He allowed his chakra to rest in his fingertips as his hands began to mold the orb of energy. The now familiar sounds of crackling surfaced once more as lightning natured chakra formed. Unlike prior, he decided to create a smaller sized orb in an attempt to gain better control so he'd obtain a better understanding of the jutsu. 

The small tennis ball sized lightning orb crackled with energy. It let out faint noise, indicating its life force was still kicking. Kuro kept a stoic face, maintaining the jutsu's intensity and form. He didn't want the technique to backfire like prior.  As his mind was dedicated to one thing, he continued to pump out a constant and steady flow of chakra into the technique. "This should do," he thought to himself as his eyes glued themselves upon the lightshow that was being nurtured in his hands.

After holding the technique in place for a few minutes, he extended his hands forwards, aligning his edge of his palms together. Upon doing so, he pushed his hands forwards, sending the small orb out. The lightning ball traveled a short distance from his hands, slowly fading in size and output. Eventually, it burnt itself out before it could even make contact with anything. "I guess I put too little in," he muttered to himself, now staring at his slightly burnt hands.* - Fri Sep 25 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) awoke and found himself sitting in the training hall of the Fire Temple. His eyes glanced from side to side, realizing that there weren't anyone present.  He lowered his head, closing hsi eyes for a brief moment. As his eyelids shut, he began to apply a steady supply of chakra into his optic nerves. A pulsating sensation overcame his eyes, causing him to grip both with his hands. "Ugh, what's this?", he muttered to himself, feeling an intense pressure rise behind his eyes.  

Unlike his prior utilization of his doujutsu, this instance felt different. The protruding veins didn't surface upon his face, instead his vision seemed oddly different.  It was almost as if he could see everything, but not everything.  His sight was more detailed than when his Byakugan was active, which caused him to question what he saw.

Spectrals of light were scattered all around the area.  The spectres had humanoid form, but they felt different. He could see the chakra of the individual, but there was also another light that he saw. This light seemed ghostly in nature, which confused him.  Viewing such an event as fatigue, he dispelled his doujutsu and rubbed his eyes.   There has been a lot that has happened to him over the last few days, most noticeably the beginning of his training under Yukio.

The genin decided to just get up onto his feat and return back to the village. * - Sat Sep 26 00:50:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) smiled with a gentle expression on his face.  "That's good. So your life isn't in danger anymore?" Kuro then shifted his gaze over towards Niza. "I see..I leave myself in your care. Please teach me well."* - Sat Sep 26 01:20:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) just sat there, listening to the bickering between the group. He let out a disappointing sigh. Feeling slightly fed up with such behavior, he clapped his hands together as hard as he possibly can in an effort to draw their attention. 

"Is this really something that we should fight about? Misa has been through a lot these last few days. Do you really think that forcing people to choose will be the most benefitial choice. Think not of yourself, but of Misa and her well being and goals." Kuro spoke.* - Sat Sep 26 01:30:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) thinks: Possibly. - Sat Sep 26 01:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) shook his head in disbelief. "We have much to learn as humans," he whispered to himself. The genin took a few steps forwards, stopping directly infront of Mariana. His usual smiling facial expression was washed away and what remained was one that seemed slightly saddened. "Why are you pushing her away? Is your relationship that fragile to be cast aside in such a way? Don't you understand the emotional pain that you're causing to the vulnerable Misa?"* - Sat Sep 26 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Anyways. - Sat Sep 26 01:46:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Because, I know she is. Besides, Hanabi is with her. - Sat Sep 26 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I thought you were against her being with Hanabi. - Sat Sep 26 01:49:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Yes. - Sat Sep 26 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: So far, each used a particular style that seemed to be unique to those with eyes like that. - Sat Sep 26 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I was wondering if you happened to know of this style? - Sat Sep 26 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Do you mean a martial arts style? - Sat Sep 26 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Indeed. - Sat Sep 26 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yes, I utilize such a style that benefits from my eyes. - Sat Sep 26 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: But it's purely for meditation and self defense. - Sat Sep 26 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: At least, that's how I see it. - Sat Sep 26 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I see. - Sat Sep 26 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Why do you ask? - Sat Sep 26 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I was wondering if you could teach me this style. Simply because it didn't seem to be so...rash and offensive. - Sat Sep 26 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: But what of Kempo? - Sat Sep 26 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: It's useful yes, but not applicable in all situations. - Sat Sep 26 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I enjoy it for its defense, but I feel I would require other means to apply as well. - Sat Sep 26 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see..Well, I suppose I should explain to you the style I use. - Sat Sep 26 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) took a deep breath, allowing air to travel through his nose and build up into his lungs. He then released the pent up oxygen out from his nostrils as he began to limber his body.  The genin took a step back away from the desk, making sure that he had enough room to spare.  He then raised his right arm forwards as he slid his left leg back. His left arm bent slightly, with his hand resting slightly infront of his chest.  Both of his hands were positioned upwards, palms forwards. As he completed his stance, he applied a steady supply of chakra into his optic nerves, causing his doujutsu to awaken.

Veins surfaced upon his face, just lateral of his eyes. The azure colored eyes that he was so known for became diluded into a milky monotone white.  With both his doujutsu active and his stance up, he'd display to Niza his gentle fists.* - Sat Sep 26 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: With these eyes, I can see the chakra of other people. - Sat Sep 26 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I can also clearly see certain points on the body. This style is defensive in nature like Kempo, but it can also be abused and turned into something offensive. - Sat Sep 26 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'll show you. - Sat Sep 26 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I see... - Sat Sep 26 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) looked over at Niza, who was standing beside him. His eyes scanned the male's body, trying to figure out where to demonstrate the technique. "Hm.. Can I see your hand? I want to show you what I mean," he asked, extending his own hand out.* - Sat Sep 26 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) gripped Niza's wrist with his left hand, pulling it closer to his body. With his free right, he balled his fist save for his index finger. The genin hovered his index finger over Niza's open palm and lightly tapped it. As his finger made contact with Niza's palm, he released a faint amount of chakra into the shinobi. Niza would feel a sense of nothingness from his palm, almost as if it went numb.

Kuro then tapped Niza's palm once more. This time when he removed his index finger, the numbness would fade away.* - Sat Sep 26 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) thinks: Since he can - Sat Sep 26 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) thinks: 't use his other hand. He can't make handseals. Should snipe him while I have the chance* - Sat Sep 26 03:08:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) noticed the other people in the room, so he decided not to continue further on the subject. "You understand what I meant earlier about it?", he questioned, releasing Niza's wrist from his grip.* - Sat Sep 26 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I do indeed. - Sat Sep 26 03:11:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Of course. - Sat Sep 26 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Thank you. - Sat Sep 26 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) recieved the scroll from Niza. He looked at it, then rolled it open to reveal it's contents. His eyes slid across the information that was displayed in the scroll.  "What's the message I'm suppose to deliver?", he asked, turning his gaze voer to Niza.* - Sat Sep 26 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Have a great day. - Sat Sep 26 03:37:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Indeed. - Sat Sep 26 03:40:35 2015
