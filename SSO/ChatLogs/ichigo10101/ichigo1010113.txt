<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: This world does need change.  Too many lives have been lost due to nonsense.   Do you think that we can obtain peace through violence and bloodshed? No.  That doesn't bring out peace, rather it brings out more malice to the world. - Wed Oct 28 18:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yet you're too much of a pacifist to make an attempt in starting this change. Yes? - Wed Oct 28 18:20:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I have a question. Has Hideki spoken to you before he passed, about his goal? - Wed Oct 28 18:28:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: In turn, we take over their source of funding. - Wed Oct 28 18:29:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Well he spoke of me about his desire to strip the Gezo of their power, a view that I share. I don't wish for war, rather I wish for a change. To depower  their authority and begin to transition the views of us being nothing more than tools and weaopns, to that of actual people. - Wed Oct 28 18:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: In that regard, I believe that the Gezo is a major fault in our way of life. As for a political take over, that seems like the best option as it won't result in violence.  - Wed Oct 28 18:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: At least I hope it doesn't. - Wed Oct 28 18:32:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So you're planning on amassing arms? - Wed Oct 28 18:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That'll not only benefit us from having to depend on the Gezo, but to have one of our own help us- - Wed Oct 28 18:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Correct. - Wed Oct 28 18:39:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That movement alone would cause the Gezo's influence on armory and weaponry to halt. - Wed Oct 28 18:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Cutting out a good portion on their influence on major villages. - Wed Oct 28 18:40:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Then I suppose we are two men aiming for the same result in the end, peace. - Wed Oct 28 18:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: We may travel different paths, but I hope neither of our paths involve bloodshed. - Wed Oct 28 18:52:48 2015

"Paine, how have you been?", he asked shortly before turning his gaze over towards Kilm. "What do you mean?"* - Wed Oct 28 21:57:58 2015

"Sure, just lead the way," he spoke.* - Wed Oct 28 22:09:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) decided to just sit down into the sand. He lowered his body, resting his posterior upon the sediments of dirt that rested beneath his feet. As he did so, he'd fold his legs together while resting his hands upon his lap. The monk's hands would press together, creating a singular handseal for meditative purposes. His back was set straight, allowing for his stance to become refined and structural.  

He was interested in watching the sparring session, but he wasn't going to allow himself to slack up on his own training. Thus, the monk began to focus on his chakra from within, mixing it in his esophagus with that of the Gift. The two chakras swirled inside of his body, creating a unique blend between the two.  He maintained the sensation in his throat, before allowing it to recede back into his abdomen.* - Thu Oct 29 01:35:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) continued to sit in his meditative state. He allowed his mind to waver, allowing it to focus solely on the energy from within his being. Ever since he resumed his training with Yukio, his entire sense of being became more aware. It was if a door had been opened in his mind, granting him a better sense of self. 

In reality, this was all due to his meditative training, and harnessing his gift. As Kuro continued to ease his mind of its worldly troubles, he began to take control of the gift from his inner being. His chakra cycled throughout his body as he began to tap into the gift.    The monk's body began to exhibit a faint yellow hue, one which was barely noticeable with the naked eye.  

The yellow chakra wrapped around his figure, condensing itself as it seeped into his skin.  As it did so, his body itself began to feel rejuvenated and lighter. All of his senses felt as though they were being reconfigured, but in reality they weren't. It was due to his training that he had become more at peace around nature. * - Thu Oct 29 01:51:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) held his chakra together, swirling it inside of his physical form. As the monk continued to meditate, he'd slowly transition the mixed chakra up into his throat, practicing the very feeling of storing power in his voice.  

Quickly, he forced it down his throat and back into his abdomen, as he almost released the pent up energy from his mouth.  The monk felt a bit shocked, but he didn't express it with his emotions.  He continued to focus on his mental training as he'd periodically gaze at the two sparring.* - Thu Oct 29 02:01:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) kept up with his training. In all honesty, it seemed quite weird of him to do so in front of so many people, but to majority of the world it seemed as though he was just meditating. Of course, he was, but that was all in an effort to train not only his body but his mind.  

As a monk, he had to remain vigilant in regards to his emotions and principles. It was a basic teaching amongst those of the temple. As the successor, or at least that's what he assumed he was going to be, he had a lot on his plate.  The very first being was to practice the state of thoughtlessness.  He had been able to clear his mind before, but he was needed to repeat the process multiple times.   In all honesty, he wasn't sure as to why he needed his mind to be clear of all thoughts, but if it was needed to progress to the next stage, he would continue. Kuro remained stationary with his arms and legs folded as he continued to dive through his mind.

With a friendly smile, he waved and kept on walking.* - Thu Oct 29 02:56:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Fuck yo room hoe! This is mine! -omit- - Fri Oct 30 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) as per his daily regiment, he found himself a nice open space for his training. Today it was a random bench that rested in the center of Sunagakure's square. The monk casually walked over towards the bench and sat down. His legs would then cross followed by his hands, which rested on top of his lap.

Unlike his usual stances, he was sitting upright on top of a stable structure. Usually, he'd be sitting on the floor or a mat, but for some reason he decided a bench. As his legs crossed, he lifted them up, allowing his entire form to rest on the wooden bench. 

Since his stance was complete, he only had to focus on his mind, rather his body. The monk slowly closed his eyes as he began to block out the world around him. For as long as he could remember, he'd always meditate whether it be for recreational, stress, or even educational purposes. No matter the reason, he'd meditate. 

As he allowed his mind to dive deep into his subconscious, he began to feel nature take place around him. His ears listened tentatively to the sounds around him. They picked up the breathing of those close by, the swooshing of the wind, the rattle of objects being brushed by the wind.  His nose detected the scent of the desert. Never had he imagined being able to tell the scent of dirt before.  Even his taste became finely tuned as he concentrated on being thoughtless.  To him, the action of being thoughtless was rather, the action to become one and all. 

In order for one to achieve a sense of one and all, they had to open their mind's eye and observe the natural order of life. They had to see the daily motion of things, from the chirping of birds, the exchange of words between people, and the passage of time. All of these things were needed to grasp the notion of life. It was only through meditation and observation would one be able to grasp its concept.

The monk continued to channel his inner energies, synchronizing it with the gift that flowed through his veins. He even allowed his body to take in the ambient energies around him. As per Yukio's explanation, Kuro has been linking the gift with the energies of nature. By treating the two similar, yet different, he was able to gain a better understanding over the mystic energy.

His body would emit a faint yellow aura as his mind focused on meditating. In his inner conscious, there was nothing. Any thought that he had previously had become part of the endless void. It was in order for him to allow Kannon to enter into his soul. With a clouded mind, he wouldn't be able to fully accept the power, but with a clear mind, it was possible. A clear mind thought with rationality and with a leveled head; a clouded mind with emotions and haste.  

There was no way he could afford to make a mistake in clearing his mind. From his instructor's description, the ending result of the training would become a blessing or a curse.  It was all dependent on one's perspective and will.  Kuro wished not for his training to bare a curse, rather he wished for a blessing. Thus he pushed harder to focus his mind.  For multiple days, he'd do nothing but meditate in an effort to lessen the time it took for his mind to become void. 

With each successful attempt, he'd try to retain the feeling longer. It was only a matter of time until he would become ready, but that wasn't up to him. It was up to Yukio and the source of the Gift.* - Fri Oct 30 06:03:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) remained silent as he kept up with his mental training. For those who lack any type of sensing capabilities, they'd see a single male sitting on a bench with his arms and legs crossed. His hands were conjoined together, forming a single handseal. However, those with even a hint of sensing capabilities could feel an off aura emitting from the male. It was rather weak and gave off a serene sensation. In fact, it was incredibly difficult to detect. Either way, he continued with his training.

All of the trials and tribulations he had went through were of no worry to him anymore. In his mental sanctum, he'd reach a state of being which was neither superior nor inferior. It was just a state of mind which gave him peace. 

The power radiating from the gift left an imprint onto his soul. Its essence stuck with him as his mental self hovered around in a white room. The room was spacious, yet confining. There was nothing there but walls.  Prior, there were images of his life and various events that took place, but they soon blended into the monochrome walls.

Kuro's mental version of himself rested in the center of the room, also in a meditative position. Unlike his physical self, his spiritual self had a radiating aura coming from its being. Whether this was from his training or not, mattered very little. The spiritual Kuro sat down in silence, swirling around his energies into a steady form. The energies would circle his figure like a barrier, slowly taking shape. It was difficult to tell what it was turning into, but from the portion that was formed, it looked humanoid.

The real Kuro, who rested in the physical world remained in his initial location, meditating and investigating his inner worlds. The faint chakra that wrapped around his body ceased from expelling from his form, rather it now tightened itself into his body. The sound of his meditative, yet rhythmic breathing could be heard from those nearby.* - Fri Oct 30 06:31:15 2015
