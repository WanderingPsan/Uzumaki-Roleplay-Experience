<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) rose up from his seat, bokken danging along his side, sand clinging to his clothes. He patted himself down then turned around, moving himself towards the northern walls. "It shouldn't be too far," he'd comment.* - Wed Dec  2 02:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm.. So I guess.. - Wed Dec  2 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Draw your sword. - Wed Dec  2 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Alright. - Wed Dec  2 02:08:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: And show me how your holding it. - Wed Dec  2 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) Kuro stood still before Mitsunara.  He took a deep breath, motioning both his left and right hands towards the bokken which was holstered onto his hip. His left hand slightly pressed up against the bokken, securing the sash that it was tethered to. His right motioned towards the handle, gripping it tightly as he drew it from his side.

The bokken was light and easy to wield. "Just like before," he thought to himself. His eyes trailed down to his feet, making sure to incorporate a basic stance.   As an individual not accustomed to fighting other people, he did utilize a few stances.   With his lack luster information on the sword, he adopted a stance similar to the gentle fist.

His right foot was positioned ahead while his left was placed towards the rear.  They were about a shoulders width apart and were perpendicular to each other.  His overall stance seemed lacking, and a bit frankenstienesque.  The monk held the bokken infront of his chest with both hands on the handle, left over the right. "Is this good?" he'd ask, unsure if his stance was suitable or not.* - Wed Dec  2 02:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) nodded his head as he listened to Mitsunara's teachings.  "So the foot work is alright, but the upper portion isn't? Alright," he replied.  He'd quickly begin to emulate the female's form, keeping his afformentioned foot work generally the same as before.

He'd adjust his eyes between his own form, and Mitsunara's. It was slightly odd to get the hang of understanding the basic stance. He was used to hand to hand martial arts, not weapons, but this was a change. 

He continued to balance his posture, lowering his arms down to his waist, and holding the bokken forwards. It's tip pointed diagonal towards the sky. "Alright, so I should practice between this and the over head?", he asked, raising his arms above his head. 

It was a strange feeling, and he could instinctvly tell the disadvantages of such a pose. It was more offensive and held little to no defense or reaction. The previous one however, had more motion and control. He nodded his head upon realizing the different.

"I think I'll stick with the waist stance," he spoke.* - Wed Dec  2 02:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Your Chakra control is really damn good, right? - Wed Dec  2 02:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's alright. Why? - Wed Dec  2 02:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) continued to observe Mitsunara. "Ah, I see. Well, yeah, I have alright chakra control. It's nothing fancy," he said, releasing a hand from the bokken and reaching outwards. He'd open his hand, revealing his palm. In the center of the palm, chakra began to mold and take shape. He quickly closed his hand, causing the chakra to disapate. "Is that good enough?", he questioned, placing his hand back onto the bokken to resume his training.* - Wed Dec  2 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: So long as you have at least Genin level control, we're good. - Wed Dec  2 03:09:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: You pump chakra through your arms and into the blade to push it faster, moving the weapon with more speed and force to strike near isntantly. - Wed Dec  2 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Ah. That doesn't sound too complex. - Wed Dec  2 03:11:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: It's a lot harder to avoid lethally injuring someone with a sword, than it is with your bare hands. - Wed Dec  2 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: With a Taijutsu blow, you simply avoid critical regions and hold back slightly... - Wed Dec  2 03:13:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: But- yeah. That basic stance, and that one move. All I got for you- my actual techniques are all.. yeah. - Wed Dec  2 03:23:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yes. I would like to know about it. - Wed Dec  2 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) nodded once more.  "So no matter where you swing, it'll always have that crescent arc to it? Interesting," he spoke.  He then took a step back, realigning the blade to the front of his body.  He held the bokken tightly in his grip.  In his mind, he replayed Mitsunara swingthing the blade over and over, enough to emulate it slightly.

Starting from a neutral position, he lowered the tip of the bokken towards the ground. Slowly, he pulled his left arm, and motioned with his right, allowing for the bokken to motion towards his left.   "So, like this?", he asked, swinging it along in a horizontal motion.  Upon finishing the motion, he held the bokken to his right, with the tip facing upwards.* - Wed Dec  2 03:49:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Well, I think that's enough for today. I want to let you rest. But it was nice to have this one on one demonstration. - Wed Dec  2 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: A'right, then. - Wed Dec  2 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) sheathed his bokken back into his sash, and then bowed his head to Mitsunara. "Let us do this another day," he spoke, walking away.* - Wed Dec  2 03:58:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Oh, hi Koji. - Thu Dec  3 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't think I'm actually popular. - Thu Dec  3 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: And it has been a while. - Thu Dec  3 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Enough time to teach something new haha. If ya want. - Thu Dec  3 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Um, sure. - Thu Dec  3 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Oh oh wait, Kuro. Before you go the other day you were talking to someone about a Bokken? How do I get one of those? - Thu Dec  3 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Oh. I purchased one from Marco. He's over there. - Thu Dec  3 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) pointed over towards Marco's direction.  "He's the blacksmith of the village."* - Thu Dec  3 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Oh~ cool thank you~ - Thu Dec  3 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) followed after Koji.* - Thu Dec  3 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) carefully observed Koji's movements. He didn't know what he was going to be taught, but he figured it would be something benefitial to him in the long run. His eyes and ears were tuned to Koji, listening and watching everything he did. Everything down to even the minute movement, he watched as if he were a hawk.

Upon hearing his words, he took to the side, allowing Koji to display the technique he prepared himself for. It seemed odd, but he quickly understood it's usage. Those who possesed the Byakugan held the ability to expel chakra from their body, as well as seeing it and disrupting it through various methods. Such a technique fell under such category. 

His eyes followed behind Koji's movements, now glancing over towards the rock which seemed to be in his projected line of sight. In just moments, the rock crumbled into pieces as if being hit by an unforseen force. 

"Ah. I see. That makes sense..And that would be pretty interesting to see in the future," he replied.* - Thu Dec  3 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Mhm, the idea came to me when I was talking to my little sister. She's not a fighter so I wanted to invent something that would help her. But, not only her you as well. I understand fighting isn't your first option. - Thu Dec  3 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: But lets see you do the Air Palm. The best part is it's sneaky haha. - Thu Dec  3 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) nodded his head. "I appreciate that you've taken the time to develop something that's a deterrent to fighting.  Also, to taking the time to teach it to me," he spoke in a humble tone. He bowed his head, lowering it for a bit. Upon lifting his head, multiple veins began to bulge and protrude along the side of his face, while his eyes had transistioned into a monotone white.

"So, you gather chakra in your palm," he repeated, opening his left hand and bringing it up to his chest.  He began to concentrate on his chakra reserves, drawing energy from his pools and directing them towards the center of his left hand.   A faint glow of blue began to form in the center of his palm.  As he continued to pour more chakra into it, the hue intensified.  "Do I give it shape, or do I just expel it out as is?", he asked, glancing up at Koji. * - Thu Dec  3 04:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) opened his mouth and replied with an "Ah, I see." He continued to focus the chakra that lingered in his hand, allowing it to swell up.  His entire palm radiated with the stored and compressed chakra.  He quickly aimed his palm away, releasing the pent up chakra. 

A loud bang echoed as the chakra shot out.  It was akin to an explosion, but there was nothing to show proof. The area he had aimed his palm at had suffered no damage or anything. In fact, the chakra he had directed to the ground never made it's mark.

The moment he released his chakra from his palm, it exploded almost like a gas ball. The pent up energy just splattered, moving nowhere but everywhere.  The disburstle of the chakra resulted in a rather wek force.

He looked back at his hand, keeping silent. "What could have gone wrong? I thought I had it," he thought to himself.  He had visualized the gathering of chakra, but he failed to visualize a path. What he visualized was the chakra going forwards, but it resulted in the chakra itself being wasted.

He quickly understood his mistakes as he was watching his own chakra circulation during the entire situation. "I'll try this again," he spoke, cupping his palms together. Unlike prior, he decided to try his second attempt using both hands, like Koji had hinted at when he demonstrated the technique.* - Thu Dec  3 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) had his hands cupped as he once again began to gather up his chakra.  Similar to the protagonist of a certain series which included aliens and wish granting crystals, he began to gather up into the center of his palms.  A faint blue hue began to form in the center, slowly growing and intensifying with more energy diverted into it.  

He slowly brought his hands to his chest, pulling them apart from each other. He contained the chakra, and quickly turned over towards the side, away from Koji. "This should work," he muttered, throwing his palms forwards.

As he did so, he visualized a straight path from one point to another, with his chakra following the route. His chakra flowed from his palms, pushing their way down to the ground.  The force wasn't large or anything, rather it was contained.  At the end of the path, there was an indentation in the soil, proof that his chakra expelled outwards as a malleable force.* - Thu Dec  3 05:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: A wall? - Thu Dec  3 05:38:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So, something like rotation, but without having to rotate yourself? - Thu Dec  3 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Mm possibly. I'll need to put more thought into it. - Thu Dec  3 05:41:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) quickly realized that the item was a scroll. He opened it and began to read it, trying to understand the content inside.  His eyes trailed along each line, memorizing and absorbing the information that was written into the scroll.  He didn't understand everything, but he kept on reading anyway.

The more he read, the better of an understanding he got from the scroll.  His eyes were glued onto the scroll, retaining it's information. Whatever it was, it had to be something of interest, seeing how it was a gift from Koji. 

Even though he's read so much thus far, he still didn't have a clue as to what it was that he was reading. He understood the words, but it's context felt like jumbled words.  He let out a sigh, lowering the scroll to take a brief rest. After a minute of rest, he began to read the contents once more.* - Sun Dec  6 03:08:35 2015

"I'll get her," he spoke, standing up from his seat. "I live with them," he added.  He once again looked down at the scroll, reading it again.  "Ah, I get it!", he called out, finally understanding the nature behind the technique.* - Sun Dec  6 03:11:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) nodded before turning his head towards Koji. A smirk arose on his face, followed by a friendly bow. "Thank you.  This means a lot," he called out. "If you'll excuse me for a moment," he added, heading off to search for Momura.* - Sun Dec  6 03:12:00 2015
