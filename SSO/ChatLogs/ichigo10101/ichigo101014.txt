<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Right...Raikage, are there any leftover medical scrolls you can lean me? I need to self study. - Thu Oct  1 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I've no idea. - Thu Oct  1 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I leave that knowledge to the other medics. - Thu Oct  1 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: ...Right. - Thu Oct  1 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) nodded his head at Misa's words upon finishing up with the scroll. He rolled it back up and placed it into an inner pocket of his kimono. "Why do you ask?", he quaried.* - Thu Oct  1 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It is. - Thu Oct  1 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'm also being trained by Yukio. The two have taught me a lot, and helped me see things in a wider perspective. - Thu Oct  1 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Well lucky you. - Thu Oct  1 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'm training to be a monk. - Thu Oct  1 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: With Yukio we do meditations, and with Niza, we practice self defense. - Thu Oct  1 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm. - Thu Oct  1 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Self defense. - Thu Oct  1 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Well. - Thu Oct  1 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Shall we begin, Kuro? - Thu Oct  1 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Sure. - Thu Oct  1 01:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) rose from his seat and looked over at Niza. "The usual spot?" he asked, dusting himself off.* - Thu Oct  1 01:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Of course. - Thu Oct  1 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Shall we be off? - Thu Oct  1 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Yes. - Thu Oct  1 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Are we going to practice Kenpo? - Thu Oct  1 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Yes. - Thu Oct  1 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I shall show you the first two techniques. - Thu Oct  1 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'm ready when you are. - Thu Oct  1 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) took a deep breath as he adjusted his eyes onto Niza and Niza only. He'd become focused on details, trying to absorb the techniques that are to be handed to him.  As the student, it was his job to pay attention, thus that's what he'd be doing today.* - Thu Oct  1 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) watched Niza perform the technique carefully. It was the very same technique in which he told him to learn just days prior.  He nodded after finally seeing a master of the technique using it. "So I was right in how it was to be used," he commented to himself in reference to the instructions that were written in the scroll.

Kuro too extended his right hand forwards with an open palm.  Just like Niza, he sweeped the hand to the left, redirecting an invisible force from his person.  It was indeed a simple technique, but compared to Niza, his skill in the technique was lacking.* - Thu Oct  1 02:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) nodded once again, He observed the technique carefully,  Unlike misdirect, he was never given the scroll beforehand, thus this was slightly uncharted territory.  He repeated after Niza, keeping his right hand forwards. "Alright, so I just do it like so," he whispered.

Kuro pressed his fingers together into a knife like shape.  Just as Niza demonstrated, he too invisioned an enemy before him. He raised his hand, displaying the back of his hand towards the figure and then swiftly let out a swinging motion. His hand motioned out in a cresent shape, smacking into the imaginary figure's throat. The force and speed were all out of sync, but the fundimentals of the technique were there. 

"Like this right?", he questioned.* - Thu Oct  1 02:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) bowed his head before Niza. "Thank you. I shall practice these techniques and master them. " He spoke, not even noticing Reguel's appearance in the area.* - Thu Oct  1 02:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Good. - Thu Oct  1 02:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: In our next session, I will test you to see your prowess with these two techniques. - Thu Oct  1 02:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm, maybe I should've been a monk. - Thu Oct  1 02:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Very well. - Thu Oct  1 02:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) began to train almost immediately after the session ended.  He'd take a step forwards and swing his arm outwards, with his hand in a knife like shape.  The hand cut through the air and made contact with the imaginary opponent that was positioned infront of him. The technique itself wasn't difficult, rather it's utilization was what increased it's difficulty.  

Kuro took a step back and returned his hand to it's initial position.  His eye glanced around, trying to determine the best way to perform the technique.  He was told that it was a rather effective technique which was used to create an opening, but as a pacifist, he wasn't entirely used to battle. Let alone, battle tactics.  Thus, he decided to use this training as a means to develop said tactics. * - Thu Oct  1 03:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Watching you two is interesting. - Thu Oct  1 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Is it really? - Thu Oct  1 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: No. - Thu Oct  1 03:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Then what do you find interesting? - Thu Oct  1 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Just learnin' about self defense, I gotta have some taijutsu knowledge as a medic. - Thu Oct  1 03:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) thinks: Of course, Kuro gets more training. - Thu Oct  1 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Oh.. - Thu Oct  1 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Perhaps you should speak with the Raikage about teaching you the basics? - Thu Oct  1 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I should. - Thu Oct  1 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) turned around and saw Black Star and Tsubaki. He gave off a plesant smile towards the two. "Hello Mamoru, how are you feeling?", he asked, waving at both Mamoru and Chiharu.* - Thu Oct  1 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Sorry I can't heal ya. - Thu Oct  1 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: . . . . . - Thu Oct  1 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) did notice the injuries, and he did hear that Mamoru had a broken jaw, but he wasn't exactly sure how serious the injuries were. At least compared to Hideki, he seemed alright.   The genin took a few steps up towards Mamoru, stopping just a few inches away.  "It'll be alright. Just meditate on it. Train your mind while your body is recovering. I wish I could help with your recovery, but I lack the medical knowledge to do so. The most I can do is assist you when I see you're in trouble." He then looked over at Chiharu, giving her a gentle smile. "I don't think we've formally met. I'm Kuro," he spoke as he extended his hand out to the female for a friendly shake.* - Thu Oct  1 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I'm Reguel. - Thu Oct  1 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) thinks: Long as I don't strain myself too much and only use my arm muscles I should be okay. - Thu Oct  1 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Pleasure to meet you as well.  I see that you and Mamoru are rather close. - Thu Oct  1 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: . . . . - Thu Oct  1 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Uhuh, we're partners. - Thu Oct  1 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) thinks: I wonder if I can scare someone someday by talking in katana form. - Thu Oct  1 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was taken aback by the sudden transformation into a katana. "That's an interesting technique," he whispered. His eyes rested upon the katana that Mamoru held. There were many questions to be asked, specifically, how did she do that, and why was Mamoru conducting such strainous activites during his recovery time.  "Are you sure you're able to do such activites?", he questioned.* - Thu Oct  1 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I require all currently available shinobi capable of combat to be on guard at all times. - Thu Oct  1 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Those that are injured, I would like to get to a safe location. - Thu Oct  1 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Kumogakure will now be preparing itself for defense. - Thu Oct  1 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Right. - Thu Oct  1 04:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: . . . . . - Thu Oct  1 04:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Which is why I want to study taijutsu. - Thu Oct  1 04:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I'd indulge in teaching such, but right now there is little time. - Thu Oct  1 04:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Then I'll focus on working on Medical ninjutsu for the time being. - Thu Oct  1 04:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) just watched as Mamoru continued with his swings. "Won't you cause your injuries to worsen?", he asked now contiuing with his own training.   He extended his right arm forwards, facing it towards an imaginary foe. His hand rested limp, then raised, forming an open palm.  

In his mind, the imaginary figure lunged at his location. The figure sent a straigh punch towards the genin, and with a simple motion of his hand, he pushed the incoming attack away.  His hand made contact with the oncoming arm, pushing it aside, causing said punch to miss it's mark. 

In his mind, this seemed like a battle going on. On the outside, it just looked like Kuro was practicing waving his hands around.  He readjusted his position, starting it right back from the very beginning.  Once again, he visioned an imaginary figure to be his opponent.  However, this time he imagined multiple foes in the area, all surrounding him.  "It should go like this," he thought to himself. 

There were imaginary men at all four of his cardinal directions. The shinobi closed his eyes and began to calm his breathing. He listened for the steps of the imaginary men, and felt their presence.  One lunged forwards at him from behind. Kuro took a step to the left, allowing the man to pass through. The foe quickly turned around and launched a kick towards the genin's chest.  Kuro pressed his hand upon the incoming kick, grounding it.  

The figure from the east charged at the genin throwing a fierce punch in his direction.  Kuro tilted his head, watching the incoming attack. He lifted his hand once more, taking a step back from the punch and placing his palm onto the back of the opposing individual. He then applied a light push from behind, causing the individual to lose their footing.  

The other two individuals, the figure from the north, and the figure from the west, both charged forwards at the monk in training.  Using the knowledge he'd gain thus far, he thrust his palms forwards,pushing up against their oncoming punches.  Their arms lifted up, allowing for Kuro to make an opening. Just as he was about to make his next move, it was then that he realized that he looked the fool during his mental training session.  

He halted everything he was doing and looked at the others, then bowed with a flushed expression on his face.  "Excuse me for a moment," he spoke, walking off to a secluded location.* - Thu Oct  1 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) looked at the female who just entered. He raised a brow, noticing her choice of ninja assesories.  "I wonder if something happened to her eye," he thought to himself as he gave the woman a friendly wave.* - Thu Oct  1 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) thinks: Questionable. - Thu Oct  1 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Now then. - Fri Oct  2 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: We should practice. - Fri Oct  2 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Yeah. - Fri Oct  2 00:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: "It" as in physical power... by the way. - Fri Oct  2 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) thinks: The only thing he didn't do was regulate his physical strength... - Fri Oct  2 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) had been continuously training both his mind and body ever since becoming a disciple to Yukio. For the last few weeks, his own ideals became reinforced, and his mind fortified. The monk in training rose up to his feet from his seated position. He dusted himself off, swiping the dirt and dust that cling to his clothing.  "Time to begin," he whispered to himself as he spread his legs to a shoulder width. 

Kuro extended his right hand in front of his chest, forming a knife like shape with his fingers. He stood silent, looking at his knife hand for a moment before he began to imagine a spectral figure before him. The figure stood the same height as Kuro, and had a physical build quite similar to him as well. The spectral remained stationary as Kuro twisted his wrist, prompting the back of his hand to face forwards. He took a step forwards and swung his hand in a crescent motion, striking the neck of the target.  His hand went through the imaginary figure, but in his mind it made contact.

He'd reset his form to the beginning, raising his hand once more in preparation for the technique. His hand kept its knife shape as he motioned it once again at the neck. A blur of his arm followed as he lashed out with a knife hand.  The shinobi repeated the process multiple times over, eventually stopping for a brief rest.  He took a deep breath, now feeling his skin cling onto his wardrobe. "This seems more offensive than defensive," he though as he looked at his open right hand. 

The shinobi stared at it for few seconds before returning to his physical training routine.  He wasn't the most physically fit, but he wasn't a push over either. Kuro pressed his fingers together on both hands, forming knives. He raised his arms up, glaring at the imaginary figure that remained in front of him. He took a step forwards, snapping his arm out, striking the edge of his dorsal upon the figure's neck.  His hand bounced off from the imaginary flesh, causing said spectral figure to grasp upon his own neck.   The monk's imagination was rather vivid for someone who favored the path of peace. 

Kuro once again stepped forwards and snapped his other hand out at the figure. Just like before, his hand rammed into the mental image's throat, forcing the Adam's apple to push back. He then repositioned himself into a default stance, preparing to repeat the movements once more.  As he continued with his training, he ignored the two others who were in the area. It wasn't by choice, rather he was so adamant about mastering such basic techniques that he failed to realize anyone was there.* - Fri Oct  2 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) followed after the two, seeing how Mamoru collapsed. He halted his own training just to check up on the shinobi. As he arrived into the mansion, he glanced over at Chiharu and Reguel. "Is he going to be alright?", he asked with a worried expression on his face.* - Fri Oct  2 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) thinks: I never did learn anyone's names. - Fri Oct  2 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That's good then. - Fri Oct  2 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm, well I can't really use healing ninjutsu now, but I can certainly numb his pain for some time. - Fri Oct  2 01:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: The only reason we were able to train was because he was using pain reliever.. is it safe for him to have more medicine already? - Fri Oct  2 01:45:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) turned his gaze towards Reguel after hearing his comment. "I thought you were learning medical ninjutsu from Misa, what happened?", he questioned. A worried yet questioning expression formed on his face.  The shinobi monk leaned forward just slightly, so that he'd be able to better hear Reguel's words.* - Sat Oct  3 03:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Well Marianna is still injuried, at least as far as I know. I haven't seen her yet. So the best choice for now is Misa.  - Sat Oct  3 03:12:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) fixed his seating position as he placed a palm on the ground. He then hoisted himself up from his seat, standing upon his own two feet. He dusted himself off then looked over at Mamoru. The words that flowed out of the shinobi's mouth and in to his ears failed to register in the monks brain. "Huh?", he spoke out in a blank expression. * - Sat Oct  3 04:41:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) clenched his fists upon finally registering the news into his mind. His own beliefs being put to the test. Personally, he felt sadness from hearing about the death of a friend, but he also felt a sense of anger. It was a life that was put to waste that didn't have to expire.  Sure, he was one who was understanding of death and the cycle of life, but the act of suicide was a rather controversal topic.  To him, it meant defeat and the unwilling desire to continue on.

Given the situation, the entire matter could have been handled differently. Now, due to the selfish choice of one individual, three people have paid the price. Kuro remained silent for quite some time,casting his sight to the cushion below his feet. "Where are the graves, and the child?", he asked, lifting his head up. His usual gentle smile and expression was replaced with one a somber sorrowful one.* - Sat Oct  3 04:50:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) turned his head over towards the door, glancing over at Niza and the individual known as Reign. He remained silent, only listening to the words that the two spoke to each other. "Where did this man come from?", he questioned himself, continuing to observe the situation.* - Sat Oct  3 05:21:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) watched the situation further, that was until Reign went on to the offensive.  His movements shocked the monk, causing him to take a step back. It wasn't by fear, more or less it was due to the surprising nature of the man. He reminded him of Tetsujin, but to a lesser extreme. Tetsujin was a man of self glory while this Reign character seemed more of a intellectual or spiritual type. It was difficult to tell from a first glance.  

As the pacifist that he was, he refused to enter the fray. Of course, it was a situation of life or death, but he believed that there was possibly a way for this entire situation to end without any violence or bloodshed.

"Why do you wish to attack us? We've done you no wrong," he spoke out, trying to reason with the man. * - Sat Oct  3 05:44:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) felt his stomach churn from the man's words. Everything that spilled out of his mouth sounded like something a demon would speak.  Kuro lowered his gaze for a moment, then brought it back upon Reign's figure. "Do you not value life? We are humans before shinobi. We all share cultures, beliefs, and ideals. Not everyone can see eye to eye, but to think of the lives of shinobi as nothing more than tools of conflict..I just can't agree.  Haven't you ever felt the love of a loved on?  There's more to life than to just snuff out the essence of life from one and another. We are humans before anything else. We've the capacity to understand compassion and each other.  Why do you think humans were given the ability to talk and to communicate? It's to solve our differences and unite using peaceful means." Kuro continued to speak his idealogies onto the man. * - Sat Oct  3 06:00:57 2015

Never in his life had he witnessed a life being taken, nor did he wish to witness such a gruesome scene.  The youth took a deep breath and looked way over towards Mamoru and Chiharu. He gave the two a weary smile then approached the corpse.

"Did you really need to take his life?", he spoke, kneeling down before the fresh corpse. "He could of changed his mind, I was sure my words would have reached him..He had the capacity to understand, I'm sure of it," he continued, reaching his hand out to grab ahold of the head. 

"Let's at least give him a proper burial. Misa, would you help me?", he asked, turning his head around towards the blind kunoichi. He'd wave his hand over the corpse's face, closing it's eyes to at lease give him the sense of peace that he deserved.* - Sat Oct  3 06:25:42 2015

Even with his monk training, he still believed in the back of his head that he wouldn't need to use his knowledge to take another's life. It just seemed impossible for him to even do.

"Anyone wish to help me bury this man? He at least deserves that respect rather than to have his corpse rot on the floor like an animal," he spoke out, still retaining the bifuricated head in his grasp. His midknight blue kimono was dyed in the crimson red of the man's head.  * - Sat Oct  3 06:35:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) turned his head over towards Heiwa, a surpsing sight. " I will cremate him, and bury his remains in the soil of our village. At least in his next life, may he see a different path than this.  Or, be born into a world in which we aren't viewed as weapons for our own genocide..," he spoke in a soft voice.  His heart ached for the man. He wasn't at fault for what had happened to him, rather it was in the world and era that he was born in. The current system was one that promoted such views, thus it was the norm for many to view their lives as nothing more than weapons to further another's goal.

Kuro took a deep breath, staring at Heiwa. "I've decided on what it is that I must do.  i will change this corrupt system that we live in. I'll create a new world, one of peace and understanding," he spoke out in a serious tone.  He was adament about his new found goal, and from this point forwards that was all he'd work to achieve.* - Sat Oct  3 06:42:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) stated a valid point. That single point was something that he constantly thought of, as it was the only hole in his ideals.  "We just have to start from the source of this corrupt system.  We'll fight with compassion and understanding. It'll be a long process, but eventually they will come to terms. A village isn't built in one day.  We must spread compassion and understanding to each other if we have any hope in achieving this peace.   But first, we must achieve inner peace before we can challenge this world's system.  It is only then, that we can truely stand against this bloodstained era. We must have people realize their self worth, and that they aren't weapons, rather they are human beings."* - Sat Oct  3 06:53:00 2015

"I'll let you hold onto this, while I handle his body," he added, placing the head onto the child's grasp.  Afterwards, he walked over towards the headless coprse and scooped it up with his arms, carying it out of the estate.

"If anyone wishes to follow, please do. I will bury this man like a human," he spoke out before completely exiting the building.* - Sat Oct  3 07:04:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) approached the gravesite of Hanabi. With the beheaded corpse of Reign in his hands, he looked over at Heiwa. "You may disapprove of me for this, but I believe that we should bury all of the dead over here. Let it be a reminder of our bloodstained era. From the ashes of the deceased, may we breed peaceful flower buds," he spoke, kneeling down to the side of the tomb stone. 

"I've a question for you. What do you think of our current era?", Kuro asked, setting the body to the side after marking the location to bury the corpse with his foot.

The corpse was set to the side, out of the way for the two to prepare for the ceremony. * - Sat Oct  3 07:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) let out a gentle smile, then nodded his head. "It's natural to feel this way. Remember it well. Now then, let's begin the preparations," he spoke. The monk in training lowered his body to the ground and began to dig up a hole. He used a kunai he'd found to dredge up the dirt.

After a lengthy duration, he looked over at the child, "I'm sorry about your parents..It must hurt a lot," he began, tring to start conversation while grasping for the boy's character.* - Sat Oct  3 07:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) understood the pain that lingered in the young child's heart. It wasn't easy dealing with the loss of a loved one, especially two. "You should meditate from time to time,  it may make you feel better," he spoke, still working on the burial of the corpse. Once the hole was large and deep enough, he turned his head back towards Heiwa.

"Do you wish to say anything about this man?", he added, now placing the corpse and it's head into the hole.* - Sat Oct  3 07:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) nodded and replied, "I see. It's expected." He then began to fill the hole up with dirt. When he finished, after a lengthy time, he rose up onto his feet. His eues casted d own upon the lump of soil that housed the corpse. "I'll say something," he began, clasping his hands together to pray. "May his soul find a new vessel to thrive in. Perhaps this new one will be given a chance to see life in a new light.  I blame not you for your actions, but the world that molded you into such a being. I'm saddened for the lost of your life, as there could have been a different, peaceful outcome. However, this is what remains of what has transpired.  May your soul find inner peace," he spoke, lowering his head to finish his prayer.

After finishing the prayer, he stuck a wooden plank into the soil, using it as a grave marker for the man.* - Sat Oct  3 07:57:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) had a somber expression on his face as he walked into the Raikage's mansion. The events that unfolded the night prior had put a strain on his mind. His own thoughts ravaged in his mind, trying to find reason behind the whole ordeal.  The only reason he could pit the event on was only due to the current era.  

Kuro knew that not everyone saw the world in the same light as him, and even more so the amount of individuals who fight just for the sake of shedding blood. He however, chose to snuff out such a world, which began to weigh on his mind.   The monk in training slowly walked over towards an empty cushion beside the duo, sitting himself in silence.  He glanced at the two and let out a friendly smile, but on the inside he was filled with grief and sorrow. It was not for the death of the man named Reign, or the way in which he was killed, it was for the fact that the majority who were present saw nothing wrong with the fundimental system behind the entire situation.  

He let out a subtle sigh, mumbling under his breath "Why must we be born in an era of bloodshed and weaponized thought?".  The monk then slouched his body into the seat, allowing his form to sink into the fabric.* - Sat Oct  3 17:40:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Bye.. - Sat Oct  3 17:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) walked off to a secluded area after leaving the Raikage's mansion. His head was filled with ideas on how to rid the world of such a corrupt system of life. Everyone viewed their lives as nothing more than weapons, and it pained him to see the results. Due to recent events, he started to believe that people began to think of him as nothing more than a man who spoke of futile peace, one who was too ignorant of the world at large. They were somewhat correct in his ignorance, rather he refused to believe in the act of taking one's life.  His own ideals of peace were riddled with holes in the aspect that it couldn't protect anyone, thus he came to a clear decision to create a way.

The current world views ninjutsu as weapons rather than a shield. His own style of combat revolved around his passive nature, and even the training he partook in fortified such ideals. He himself practice the shinobi arts only for his own meditation, but it soon became obvious that his words of peace weren't enough. If he wanted to fully spread his message of peace, he'd have to create a means to spread this peace physically, as to prevent individuals from dying. 

Kuro took a deep breath as he applied a steady flow of chakra into his optic nerves. A slight pressure was felt behind his eyes as veins began to protrude across the side of his face. Even his beautiful azure colored eyes transitioned into a milky color.  His vision increased by tenfold, granting him an almost 360 degree vision.   Slowly, he extended his right palm forwards as he took in the gentle fist stance. The monk then slid his left leg in a clockwise rotation, using his right as a center point.  His leg continued to slide along the ground, slowly picking up speed. As he did so, he began to channel the chakra that rested in his abdomen. Its energy soon started to travel all around his systems, eventually expelling from all of his chakra points.  

The monk continued to spin in a clockwise motion, expelling his chakra into a physical stream. The speed gradually picked up, soon reaching a point where the chakra started to take shape. A torrent of chakra swirled around Kuro's form, shaping into a dome of sorts. As the monk continued to spin, the torrent became stronger, kicking up dust from the ground into the air.  The usual pure like mist chakra that the average shinobi produced, was now turned into a thick barrier by Kuro.  His chakra continued to pour out from his orifices, applying layer after layer to the rotating barrier. * - Sat Oct  3 18:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) halted his rotation, stopping only for the sole reason of fatigue. It was a new technique he'd developed, and it was known to take a toll on his body. He didn't have any abnormal reserves of chakra, rather it was probably average or even below average.  The technique itself used a large portion, mainly due to the fact that it required the individual to expel chakra from all points of the body.

The monk leaned over, looking down at the ground which was now excavated from the tornado of chakra.  He began to breathe heavily, placing his hands onto his knees as he took a period of rest. Beads of sweat began to roll along his face, slightly wetting the collar of his kimono.  After an elapsed period of time, he straightened his back and began to continue his training.  Just like prior, he slid his foot along the dirt as he began to rotate. At first the speed was rather weak, but as he continued to spin his body around, the speed picked up. Eventually, he became a blur while a blue mist circled around him. The mist's speed also picked up, soon forming a dense wall of blue.   As Kuro continued to spin, the wall became thick and soon formed a revolving dome around the monk. The dome cut into the ground, digging a hole around with Kuro as the epicenter. The sheer strength of the dome continued to become fortified through the constant supply of chakra. * - Sat Oct  3 19:55:31 2015

As he arrived to the scene, he witnessed some sort of conflict going on. He wasn't sure if it was for training purposes, or if there was a hint of blood lust involved. Either way, he stepped up towards Niza and began to question him about what was going on. "What's going on?" * - Sun Oct  4 05:21:16 2015

He glanced over towards the unfamilar faces that lingered around the group. "Who are these people?"* - Sun Oct  4 05:35:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) walks off to do monk things.* - Sun Oct  4 18:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) walked off to an area in which he wouldn't be disturbed. Over the last few days, he'd been slacking on his physical training, and felt as though he was behind in his studies. The monk thus decided to spend the entire day on training his body and techniques. The majority of the techniques that he had at his disposal were rather in poor form, equivalent to that of a beginners. It didn't bother him so, but since he was a disciple to both Yukio and Niza, there was a level of expectation that he had to fulfil. 

The genin spread his legs out to a shoulder length, his feet sliding across the red dirt that rested beneath his feet. As he did so, he extended his right arm forwards and slightly the left. With his arm out, he began to press his fingers together into a spear like shape with his right.  After adjusting his hands into the right position, he snapped his arm out like a sharp blade, striking at the adam's apple of the invisible foe. 

Instinctively, he took a step back and brought his right hand up towards his chest, while retaining its shape.  His eyes glanced forwards at the invisible foe, lunging forwards and swinging his arm again in the same direction.  After swinging his arm, he twirled around on the ball of his foot, bringing the dorsal of his left hand into contact with the imaginary foe's throat. It was a spectacular backhand combo. * - Sun Oct  4 18:39:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) runs into the area, shouting "Stop the violence!" He then flees. -omit-* - Tue Oct  6 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) clasped his hands together, gathering up a significant amount of chakra into his disposal. The chakra pool that resided in his abdomen began to surge throughout his body. It spread out, reaching every nook and cranny in his very being. As he prepared himself, he took a step forwards, digging his right foot into the dirt. With his left foot, he'd slide it back, enough for an even spacing and for his balance to remain. 

He closed his eyes, allowing for nature's voice to whisper into his ears. The wind brushed up against his skin, and the ambience of the Kumogakure Mountains eased his tension. He began to ease his breathing, developing it into a soothing rhythm. In, and out; he breathed.  Once he'd relaxed his body, he extended his right arm forwards, palm open, and rested his left against his chest.   He contained the constant flow of chakra that wrapped around his body internally.  In just a fluid motion, he slid right foot to the side, and began to rotate his body.  Around and around he went, picking up speed as his body revolved. As he was doing so, he'd begin to emit chakra out from every pore from his body into a fine stream. The stream soon took shape as Kuro continued to spin, wrapping around like a streamer.  

In just moments, Kuro's form was obscured by a thick veil of chakra that cyclone around his body in a condensed dome like shape. The chakra continued to pour out of his pores, continuing to mold into the revolving dome. Due to the sheer speed of the rotation, a gust of wind soon formed with Kuro as the epicenter. Anything that were to get close would be pushed back or even harmed.  The ground beneath him became damaged, creating a small trench like crater.  

The monk continued rotating his body at a fast speed, keeping the jutsu up for the time being. Even more chakra began to pour into the revolving dome, increasing its effectiveness.  Soon enough, he began to slow down his speed. Fatigue was washing over his body, decreasing the rotation and eventually halting the jutsu. What remained from where he stood, was nothing but a foot deep crater. The radius was about 5 meters, with Kuro standing in the center.  His breathing became tense, as his lungs fished for oxygen to reinvigorate his reserves.  Kuro slouched over, placing both palms onto his knees as he began to rest and catch his breath.  He had a long ways to go in mastering such a taxing technique. It was both defensive and offensive in its usage, yet he failed to bring out the full potential of the jutsu.  For the time being, Kuro tossed himself onto the cool soil, spreading his legs and arms out. * - Tue Oct  6 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) remained on the ground, legs sprawled out and arms now on his lap. He'd regained some of his stamina after resting for an elapsed period of time.  As he continued to rest up, he began to move his arms back and forth as if he were guiding water. The motion reminded him of the misdirection technique that he was taught. 

It had been weeks since he'd learn the technique, yet he failed to actively pursue mastering it. He never really felt the need to master such a technique, since he didn't believe himself to enter any sort of combat. However, with the way things were going at the moment, he had to at least master the technique.  People were dying left and right around him, and he needed a means to protect himself while at the same time, not harm anyone.  His entire combat style revolved around that very notion, but he never practiced it.

Since he was resting up, he decided to take the initiative to build up on his skills. The monk raised his right hand, resting it outstretched in front of his chest. His left was parallel to the right. He'd then begin to wave his arms back and forth, bending them into a 90 degree angle.  The arms would swish back and forth, motioning just like passing waves.

He'd push with one arm, and pull with the other, while moving an imaginary force. The principle behind it was exactly the same as the misdirection technique, moving a force from one direction to another. It was a rather basic movement, which was very easy to train.  His arms continued to sway back and forth as he began to apply motion into his shoulders and torso.  Kuro's body would move alongside the movement, applying more direction to the technique.  Prior, had a punch been redirected, part of the energy would have been lost. Whereas incorporating his entire body from torso to shoulders, the energy provided from the foe would remain, allowing for a greater chance to counter. 

Even though Kuro wasn't a fighter, he still understood and practice the technique. His body moved like the water, changing its movements wherever it saw fit. One moment he'd direct an attack in one direction, the next in another. His movements were fluid and graceful. Even while he sat, his execution of the techniques were flawless.  

After remaining stationary for a period of time, he rose up onto his feet and stretched his limbs out.  Instead of ceasing the training, he continued on. Unlike prior, he'd now use his entire body to direct the imaginary strikes. He'd take a step forwards, getting into the enemy's zone, while pushing onto the foes incoming arm with his right, while guiding it with his left. As his body moved in such a fluid motion, he'd twist around to use his shoulders and upper body as a support, further pushing and directing the attack to come.   

The execution of the technique felt refreshing and new.  He'd never put his entire body into pulling it off, and upon this newfound light he was actually happy for the result. It never crossed his mind to use that much force, yet so little effort. Perhaps this was the true purpose of the technique, rather than to direct with the arms. Kuro smiled and continued with his training. He'd take another step forwards, using his hands to push and pull another imaginary attack, all while using his body's momentum to further direct the opposing force.  As he performed the technique numerous times again, he began to think to himself. "Perhaps, I can now cease the constant battles that take place in the village now. No more will I stand on the side and watch everyone tear at each other. This world needs peace".* - Tue Oct  6 05:59:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) walked up into the base of the mountain top. He had a new aura around him, almost as if he'd come to a revelation. The monk smiled and nodded at everyon who he passed. However, as he walked by Maloth, he paused in front of the behemoth. "I see, you've returned. Have you ceased your path of revenge?", he questioned, speaking to the giant with his usual calm and gentle tone. * - Tue Oct  6 06:08:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) glanced over at Lyala upon hearing her refer to Maloth as 'brother'. "A sister?", he thought to himself, somewhat surprised that Maloth had a sister who looked like, well her. He then smiled at the female, extending his arm out. "I'm Kuro. Pleasure to meet you," he spoke. Afterwards, he'd direct his sight back to Maloth. "I see..So you're still on that dark path. I do hope that you find the light before it's too late. We lose too much as it is with the way this corrupt world is functioned," spoke the monk. Kuro then took a deep breath, glancing up into the sky as he thought to himself, 'Why must this world be filled with violence and such?'* - Tue Oct  6 06:11:37 2015
