"Hm? What's going on?", he thought to himself as his eyes took notice of the roadblock ahead by the gates.  He could see Koji and Bryson interacting with a few people who he had never seen before.  

Kuro calmly approached Koji and let out a simple friendly wave. "Hey, what's going on? Visitors?"* - Fri Dec 11 13:10:08 2015

A light smile formed along the face of the monk as he took a step forwards. "Another person from Tenryuujotei, it's nice to see others. My teacher is a Bishop in the organization, you might know of him," he spoke out.* - Fri Dec 11 13:30:36 2015
