<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) had much more to do in regards to fully materializing Kannon. With his training so far, he was only able to bring out partial fragments of the avatar Kannon. In his current state, he was able to bring out the avatar itself, but had difficulties in bringing out the arms and maintaining them for a set period. 

The only option he knew as to how to get over such a hurdle was for him to meditate and refocus his energies. Thus, he began that. The monk sat himself onto the ground of his temporary housing, folding both arms and legs in to a proper formation. His fingers folded together, creating a single hand formation, using said form as a focal point.  His hands were rested right in front of his abdomen, suspended above his lap. 

The monk began to take deep breaths; breathing in and out in a steady motion.  He kept track of his breathing, choosing not to waste any unnecessary movement in the wake of such spiritual progress. Once his breathing was on par, he'd close his eyes to focus on the mental aspect of his training. 

In the recesses of his mind, Kuro was once again drawn into the white room.  It was a blank space in his psyche that he was well accustomed to. It was almost like a void of sorts, as there was nothing yet everything inside of this vast space. In the center of the space was a single entity sitting down in a familiar position. Their arms and legs were crossed and they were sitting rather calmly.  The figure had a tranquil feel about them, almost as if they were out of this world. Upon a closer inspection, it was none other than Kuro himself.  It was his inner self, one which he had tamed over the years, and more so in the last few months. 

The inner Kuro sat on the ground in silence, maintaining a composed form as he continued to meditate.  A golden like aura radiated from his body, blanketing his entire frame.  The aura also gave off a tranquil feeling, as though it had a calming effect.  As he continued to remain still, the golden aura that surrounded him began to move and take shape almost as if it too were alive.

The aura swirled around Kuro's form all while flaring up. Its intensity grew as he kept his mind in synch. The golden energies began to rise up from the ground and collect together into a single form. The given form of the figure was none other than the avatar Kannon. Its initial appearance was hazy and incomplete. The avatar rested above Kuro's meditating body and it too took up the same stance. The moment it did so, a basking light radiated from its body. 

As the events continued to unfold in Kuro's mind, his physical form began to exhibit the same changes as well. A golden light radiated from his body, giving birth to an appropriate sized Kannon who loitered over Kuro.  It was silent and had a compassionate face, ceasing to be corrupt by the vices of man. Kannon's appearance caused even more of the mystic chakra to spill out from Kuro. However, the chakra kept itself contained and blanketed over Kuro's body, creating a protective shroud of sorts. 

Visible sweat and fatigue could be seen on the monk as the technique itself as quite difficult to maintain.  He had become acclimated with the taxing practice, and extended its usage thus far.  The most he was able to do was bring out a fraction of its arms.  Multiple arms formed along the silhouette of the avatar, all resting still in the air; a total of 22. 
Kuro slowly opened his eyes, feeling the immense strain of maintaining Kannon on his shoulders. After all, it was a difficult and dangerous technique, one that required the utmost care and precision to properly utilize. He escaped from his voided room, recalling his conscious back into reality.   The avatar lingered above Kuro's profile and continued to mimic his moves.   Kuro broke his seal, raising his left arm up into the air and cupping his hand into a knife.  The 11 arms on the left side of Kannon too raised their arms up.  Eleven muscular arms of compassion raised themselves up into the air following Kuro's movements.  He'd then swiftly lower the arms and proceeded to raise the other eleven. The exercise was repeated a few more times, each with subtle variations of movement. 

The monk had wanted to get a better feeling of operating Kannon, rather than displaying him out in the open. It was for the best, and it was also a form of mental training. He had to master the technique if not, then become well accustomed to the point that it was useable in a real life situation. Kuro continued to wave his arms about, imprinting the feel into both his body and mind.* - Wed Nov 18 17:15:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) let out a sigh as he looked over towards Trilliam. "You need to realize your mistake. It may have been an accident, but what's done is done. Your misuse has caused the death of a beloved individual.  You may not have meant it, but your actions were the cause of her  death. Please reflect on what you've done, and learn from it," he spoke.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) instinctvly took a jump back, keeping from Trilliam's range.  He raised a brow as he was completely in shock and confused. Did he do something to warrent such behavior? "Threaten you? I don't recall such a thing. I'd have no reason to threaten you.  If you believe me as a threat, then I'm sure you can see many things wrong with such a thing," he added, with a slight chuckle.  

He found it funny to even be seen as a threat to someone as Trilliam. He was one of the most passive individuals in the village, let alone the ninja world.  He'd never hurt a soul, and even those who consider themselves enemies to Kuro receive his compassion.  So he was quite literally shocked to hear Trilliam's words of Kuro being a threat to him.* - Thu Nov 19 06:03:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was in utter confusion. His arms rested inside of his kimono as he crossed them, glancing over at Trilliam as he walked away. "This is very strange," he thought. He'd continued to watch the child walk off, now turning his own body around to return home. 

"I wonder if I should go back to my journey again..But then again, Yukio told me to protect Sunagakure, but from what? Themselves? Or does he mean Necromancers?", he thought as he trailed off.* - Thu Nov 19 06:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Well yeah, I've been doing things---not with any girls mind you. - Thu Nov 19 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) had his head slightly lowered as he entered the Hungry Ant.  He'd glance up, inspecting the place for a moment before he let out a sigh. His head would shake left and right subtly for a moment before he'd turn around on his heels, facing the door. Before he took a step forwards, he turned his head over towards the two sitting down, "Excuse me,  I don't mean to bother you but, do you know where Momura and Hanai are? The owners of the Hungry Ant?", he'd ask.* - Thu Nov 19 06:20:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) casually walked into the vicinity of the village square. His thin frame was covered in shades of blue clothing. The sleeves of his robes dangled along the side as he allowed his arms to rest in the center folds. His hands drooped from the openings. As he walked in, his eyes glazed across the surrounding area, taking in everything that his eyes perceived.  

"Ah, just the person I was looking for," he voice, centering his sights upon Marco's silhouette.  He'd take a few steps up to the famed blacksmith and nod his head with a warming grin. "Hello there," he'd begin, positioning himself beside the man.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) ceased his casual expression, shifting it to one of worry. He'd glance over at Hatsujin and Hiroshi, raising a brow at the two. Hatsujin's cries for help forced him to take a step forwards, heading towards the two.

The monk moved his arms about, returning them back into the sleeves of his kimono.  His white scarf fluttered about as he stepped closer to the two.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) walked off for some self training.* - Thu Nov 19 09:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) entered the residence he was currently residing in and quickly glazed the interior with his eyes. He saw nothing to be callous about, and decided to seat himself on a vacant sitting mat.  The monk made himself comfortable as he quickly entered a traditional meditative stance.

His legs were overlapped with each other and his arms rested upon his lap. As per usual, he'd intertwine his fingers together to form a Buddhist seal which situated itself in front of his abdomen. Kuro's lids gradually settled down until they were shut. His mind became focused on one thing and one thing only, Kannon. 

By now, he'd obtain a sense of bringing out the avatar Kannon, and utilizing its energies. However, he still held difficulty in fully mastering the sacred technique. If Yukio was able to master and teach it to Kuro, then it wasn't that far of a stretch for Kuro to in turn master it for himself. 

The entire concept of the Welcoming Approach technique was to visualize Kannon and materialize it into the mortal plane. If one were to look at it as a whole, they would see the task to be quite demanding. Yet, broken down, the task became much straightforward.  Thus, for one to master the technique, they needed to understand the steps to bring about the full potential of the skill.

Kuro, being one of the few fortunate enough be born with the Byakugan, understood many of the simpler principles of bringing forth Kannon. His training in the Gentle Fist allowed him to cultivate and polish some of the practices required. Such included expelling chakra from the body, and pinpoint control.  These were some of the basics needed to properly grasp the concept.

The youthful monk remained inert in his seat, wasting not a single ounce of energy on careless or surplus movement. His breathing was serene and systematic.  There was nothing off with his form or movement. He was akin to a statue frozen in time.   It was as if someone had taken a picture and denied time to progress. There was nothing to break his concentration, only the pure silence of his domicile.  With Momura and Hanai away, there was no way he'd be unable to master his technique.

A faint hue of gold began to expel from Kuro's body. It laid across the ground, stretching about a foot away from the epicenter.  The hue motioned back and forth, almost as though it were animated. It slowly began to recede back into Kuro, only to circle and wrap around his physique. His body itself began to radiate with this mystic golden hue. 

Suddenly a large golden specter emerged from the meditating monk's build. Its body was blanketed in a majestic dazzling golden beam that eclipsed the light radiating from Kuro. The visible features of the specter were scarce, but well defined.  The figures face held features apparent in both men and females, making it difficult to determine which gender it possessed.  It held qualities of a caring mother and a protective father.

The avatar Kannon's features began to intensify as Kuro began to pour more chakra into its formation. The initial ghastly manifestation became more flushed out and vivid. It began to look physical rather than spiritual. The avatar Kannon levitated above Kuro's frame, resting in a meditative stance. Its body was clad in white drapery that hung around its form.  Various jewels and ceremonial necklaces were worn by the avatar, fortifying its saintly visage.

A basking ray of light emerged from Kannon's back, spreading along from the center to its sides. The rays slowly began to take form, transitioning into what appeared to be numerous arms.  The arms opened one by one. At first they looked phantasmal then they took physical form as a golden aura wrapped around them.

A total of 44 arms sprawled from the avatar. Each arm extending from the idol's base. Kuro raised his left hand up into the air, causing the 22 arms on the left side of the idol to raise up too. He then lowered his arm, prompting the avatar to mimic his movement.  Every movement he performed, the idol did so too.  The more he moved, the easier manipulating the avatar became.  However, with his skill and chakra reserves, he could only do so much.* - Thu Nov 19 18:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) whispers:  Bend over and cough -omit- - Fri Nov 20 00:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) could be seen off in the distance, approaching what remained of the village known as Kumogakure. He stood at about 5"6, covering himself in various robes to protect him against the environment.  Half of his face was obscured by his long scarf which wrapped around his face and dangled behind his back, fluttering in the wind.

The traveler said not a word as he approached the ravaged lands of Kumogakure. An overwhelming emotion began to take over, as the long passed cherished memories came back into the monk's head.  He shifted his gaze away for a moment, then returned them back into the vast graves which were scattered along. 

The village itself was in the same state as he left it. It was as if it were frozen in time, untouched by human hands. All around the area, he could see nothing but the countless graves he personally dug for his companions.   

"Such a shame for the world to be so ruthless," he muttered to himself. As he continued to walk  forwards, his eyes caught glimps of a red haired youth around the same age as himself.  His brow raised shortly before approaching him.

"Hello there, are you honoring the departed too?", he questioned, forming a friendly smile upon his face.* - Fri Nov 20 00:23:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) let out a smile as his gaze trailed off towards the grave of Maloth. "There's still hope," he muttered to himself before returning attention back towards Takuma. He'd extend his left hand out, holding it out at about chest level. "I'm willing to help if you need anything," he called out.* - Fri Nov 20 00:31:34 2015
