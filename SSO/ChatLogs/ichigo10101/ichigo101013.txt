<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) just watched the exchange of words. No one was getting harmed, let alone in the process of getting harmed.  All that was going on between the two were an exchange of words, which ended without violence erupting. He let out a sigh of relief. He glanced over at Tetsujin, a man who he'd heard was the complete oppsite of Yukio. He didn't understand the man's motives or his thought process, but he was interested in trying to understand him. Even if their views didn't match, he had to at least try to understand him even if it was just a little. 

He took a deep breath and began to speak, "Tetsujin was it? May I ask, why do you wish to find Yukio?"* - Sat Sep 26 05:21:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) couldn't concentrate on his meditation as the sounds of flames and lightning caught his attention. He opened his eyes, revealing his azure gaze upon the scene before him.  He'd see Mamoru and Ushinawa combating a masked man. The genin didn't know what caused the situation to start, but he felt a duty to end it.  

Kuro unfolded his legs as he stood up from his seat, taking a few steps forwards as to not be in immediate danger.  "Why must we fight? What reason is there for such senseless violence?", he called out, trying to draw the attention of the trio.* - Sat Sep 26 05:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) noted the blanket of mist that was being spewed from the masked shinobi. He wasn't sure if the individual was going to flee or if he was going to pursue with his attack.  The genin let out a sigh as he applied chakra to his optic nerves, awakening his doujutsu.  

In an instant, his vision increased dramastically, granting him improved sight. Everything was within his view ranging from chakra, to fine details, he could see it all.  Even the inside of the mist became visible to him. 

"Stop the violence, it's useless. What are you going to gain from this", he shouted.* - Sat Sep 26 06:18:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) could see that his words were being ignored. At the moment, there seemed to be little that he could do.  He clenched his fist in frustration and suddenly began to charge forwards towards the fighting trio. Just as he was about to throw himself into they frey to use his own body to stop the fighting, the masked figure's form disappeared into a cloud of smoke.  He stood there confused, disengaging his dojutsu and scratching his head.

He surely was confused, but he was happy that the fighting ceased.* - Sat Sep 26 07:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) decided to return to his meditative state to refresh his mind. The events that took place were indeed odd. He figured meditation would clense his mind of the confusion and to eventually reveal the truth.* - Sat Sep 26 07:21:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) had an ominous feeling about what was going on, thus he began to concentrate his chakra into his eyes.  A slight pressure was felt behind his eyes as his doujutsu was activated.  In an instant, his vision was increased by ten fold, allowing him to see just about anything and everything.  Everything from chakra, down to fine details was all within his grasp of vision.  His azure gaze became a monochrome milky white, and veins protruded from the side of his face. * - Sun Sep 27 21:08:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) stopped his stride, feeling the presence of about eight or so people. Out of the eight only two of the chakra signatures he recognized.  One being Maloth, the other Hanabi. "There's something up ahead. There's nine people, and Maloth and Hanabi are amongst them," he cautioned. * - Sun Sep 27 21:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was following behind Niza after he stopped for a brief moment. He could tell something bad was going on just at the end of the path heading towards the Hokage's mansion. As he arrived to the scene with his companions, his eyes glanced around the area, confirming everyone who he sensed were around.   Out of the individuals around, he was only able to recognize two, Hanabi and Maloth.

In addition, there laid a sea of snakes around Hanabi who seemed to be source. His eyes then locked onto the shinobi as her body fell onto the ground with a sense of limpness.  With just a single glance, he was able to figure out her situation.  The shinobi let out a sigh and shook his head, then clasped his hands together and let out a single prayer.

"Why must this world be so cruel?", he muttered to himself.* - Sun Sep 27 21:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Those damn snakes... - Sun Sep 27 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Who would've thought.. - Sun Sep 27 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: This is in your name, my lord.. - Sun Sep 27 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Another sinner sent to your gates.. - Sun Sep 27 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) felt saddened for the death of Hanabi. He himself wasn't particularly close to her, but he held some type of connection to her. He was more saddened by the fact that one of his friends has lost a close companion. "I wonder how I will explain this to Misa..Either way, I'm going to have to tell her in a way so that she doesn't try to get revenge on the culprit," he thought to himself. 

He turned his head over towards Hideki, then Niza. "Remember, violence is not the key," he muttered to himself in regards to the two. He wasn't sure what type of relationship they had wtih Hanabi, only that they went a ways back.  He wasn't as concerned for Niza as he was for Hideki, who seemed to be the more emotionally driven out of the three of them.* - Sun Sep 27 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: And go back - Sun Sep 27 22:06:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: But I've never been driven to such an extent... - Sun Sep 27 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Because I hold the highest tolerance... - Sun Sep 27 22:07:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) calmly listened to Erebus' words. He nodded with everything that the man said. He understood some of the reasoning behind his words, but he didn't particularly agree with the notion of murder for said belief.   He was a man of devoted faith,but even with such conflicting ideologies, he was still willing to listen and understand.* - Sun Sep 27 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You don't seem to understand. I've heard Kilm state some motto of Ride or Die and he'll do anything to protect the one he loved; Katsune.. - Sun Sep 27 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: How is that any different from me defending my lord's honor and name..? - Sun Sep 27 22:12:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Is it a battle you came for? - Sun Sep 27 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I came not for a battle... - Sun Sep 27 22:13:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) glanced over at Maloth. He could see that the man was still alive. He took a few steps up towards the male and let out a friendly smile. "Have you found the path of light yet?", he questioned.* - Sun Sep 27 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: He expressed his feelings for you and even requested that you go untouched. - Sun Sep 27 22:28:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) turned his head over towards the two who were arguing. He chuckled and began to direct his attention towards the two. "Violence is never the answer. You two should be more meaningful of the other, and try to gain an understanding of each other."* - Sun Sep 27 22:31:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) took a few steps forwards, halting his stride before Misa. "Ignorance is the greatest sin a man can commit. You should be much more mindful of others," he commented before making his way to Niza. He'd stop mid way to turn to Taiga, "I shall remember your name, Taiga. I am Kuro," he spoke as he continued his stride to exit the parimeter.* - Sun Sep 27 22:39:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Where should we go for it? - Sun Sep 27 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: We can attend to the training yard. - Sun Sep 27 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Ok. That seems like a good place. - Sun Sep 27 22:58:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: So, where was it we left off? - Sun Sep 27 22:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) had to give the question some thought. He placed a finger on his chin as he looked through the archieves of his memory. A light bulb flashed in his mind, triggering him to remember exactly where they left off at. His facial expression revealed he revelation perfectly.

"I remember. I was explaining to you what the gentle fist is. You recall when I touched you with my finger, your hand felt different?", he began.* - Sun Sep 27 23:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That's just one of the things you can do with the style. - Sun Sep 27 23:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: To be honest, I'm not sure if you'll be able to accurately use it as I am, since it revolves around my eyes. - Sun Sep 27 23:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I see. - Sun Sep 27 23:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I believe I could still emulate such to some extent. - Sun Sep 27 23:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I suppose it's possible. - Sun Sep 27 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Well, the entire theory behind the style is combating while attacking one's pressure points. - Sun Sep 27 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Hm...I see. - Sun Sep 27 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: And attacking these, disable various points of the body? - Sun Sep 27 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's more of an internal rather than an external style of martial arts.  If used properly, it can limit an individual, and if used offensively, it can possibly deal irreversible damage to an individual, even death. - Sun Sep 27 23:44:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was interested in what was going on, so he activated his Byakugan and followed shortly after Niza.* - Sun Sep 27 23:58:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Kuro. - Mon Sep 28 00:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: We may return to our training. - Mon Sep 28 00:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: Yeah Kuro, resume your training! - Mon Sep 28 00:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Ok. - Mon Sep 28 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) could already see what type of character this Misa was. He decided to just ignore her words for the time being, and head back to where the two were to resume their training.* - Mon Sep 28 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Ok, back to what we were doing before. Do you have any questions thus far? - Mon Sep 28 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: None. - Mon Sep 28 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) nodded his head as he took a rather basic combative stance. "You see, this stance has openings and it doesn't allow flexibility in it's movements. You're constricted in how you move and with what you can achieve," he spoke, addressing the primative fighter's stance. It was lackluster and was one that many if not all shinobi knew. It was akin to a default stance that's programmed into everyone's mind by instincts.

He then lowered the stance and took a more limber one. His right arm was stretched forwards with his left arm bent slightly, and the hand resting just infront of his chest. He twisted his body, allowing for his rightside to face fowards and his left to act as support.  The stance looked somewhat weak, but in all honestly it was a rather sturdy and flexible one.  It exhibited very few openings and allowed for the most movement possible.

"This is the gentle fist. It's a flexible style that grants you more possibilities to act than most styles.  Your movements become fluid like water," he commented. * - Mon Sep 28 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) noted Niza's form. He then proceded onto the next step. "This may be difficult to you, but try to get the feeling down. Usually, one would send faint pulses of chakra with each hit towards a point, but we are going to take this slowly," he spoke as he began to move his body.  He first started to move his arms, showing Niza how to strike properly from the initial stance.

He'd send an open palm forwards with his right, before taking a step and to strike with his left finger tips. "As you can see, I don't use fists. I use my palms and fingers. My fingers are used to 'jab' and strike pressure points with accuracy, and my palms are used to deflect or even stun an opponent. I can even strike a pressure point accurately with a palm strike." Kuro explained, as he allowed his body to send strike after strike into the air infront of him. He was accurate and steady in how he allowed his body to move, giving Niza a better view of what the style had to offer.* - Mon Sep 28 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) continued to display the proper form of the stance. He was considerate of Niza who was watching. Al of his moves were slowed, but fast enough to be effective.  "Alright, now I'll tell you effective locations to strike to debilitate an opponent.  There's different types of pressure points to be noted; pain, break, hyper-extension, and blood and blood pressure," he began to explain. 

As he began his explaination, he lowered his stance to further explain the theory. " I'll begin with explaining pain points. When struck, they can briefly immobilize an individual or even distract them.  The main locations to focus on for these points are muscles, tendons, ligaments, and such.  Sometimes the pain point can be referred to as the reflex point because they can sometimes be use to cause involuntary movements. " Kuro began to point out on his own body the location of tendons, muscles, and the likes.  After pointing out the locations, he continued onto his next explaination.

"Next are break points. The name is rather obvious. If a skillful enough strike is applied to such an area, it'll cause the bone to break. A simple area to remember are the floating ribs, the side of the knee and the philitrum."  He then pointed to the areas; the sides of the knees, the tip of his nose, and the lower sections of his ribs.

"As for the blood and blood pressure points, it's mostly around the neck. More accurately, it's on the side of the neck and head.  If you apply pressure there you can lower an individual's internal blood pressure causing them to suffer the effects of dizziness, weakness, or even fainting."  Just like the prior explainations, Kuro pointed to the side of his neck and head where his carotid artery was located.

"Now for hyper-extension points, those are the joints. If you strike at a joint with enough skill, you can potentially tear it, or cause it to hyper extend. Be cautious of this as you can cause permanent damage to an individual," he added, once again pointing at various easily accessable joints around the body.  He then ceased his talking after asking Niza the following question, "Do you have any questions?"* - Mon Sep 28 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) smiled at Niza's response. "I see. Then let us continue," he commented. "Alright then, now we are going to focus on the defensive aspect of the style.  You'll need to be quick on your feet, and ready to react at a moment's notice," he added, taking a few steps closer to Niza. 

"Remember, you're to move like water and to react accordingly. Since you know how to strike, it shouldn't be as difficult to parry and block. Are you ready? I'll be on the offensive. We will switch roles so that you can better grasp the feeling," Kuro spoke as he raised his arms up and resumed his combative stance.* - Mon Sep 28 01:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) retained the activation of his Byakugan as it had become second nature to him when utilizing the gentle fist style.  He took a step forwards with his right foot, bringing him into arm's distance of Niza.  Kuro swiftly let out a palm with his right hand, aiming it towards the center of Niza's chest.  He'd quickly follow the strike with a finger jab towards his lower right ribs using his opposite hand.* - Mon Sep 28 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: . . . - Mon Sep 28 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was happy that Niza was getting the basics down of the technique. He quickly readjusted his finger jab, transitioning it into a palm to swat away the opposing hand. With his right , he'd pull the hand back after missing it's mark. "Good, good," he muttered to himself. He'd then take another step forwards as to restrict Niza's movement.  As he took the step, he sent another finger jab towards his thigh.* - Mon Sep 28 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) found his stike negated as Niza's hand slapped his away. A smile cracked on the genin's face, feeling like the training was starting to bare it's fruits. He kept a calm mind throughout the entire ordeal, using his doujutsu to look for any vulnerable points.   With his eyes matched with his taijutsu, he was able to accurately come up with a plan of action.  The shinobi slid his left leg forwards snapping his torso like a whip, and sending out a palm strike with his left hand towards Niza's  upper arm. * - Mon Sep 28 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) slid his right leg forwards, while instinctivly pulling the left back. He'd see Niza's attack coming towards him as his own attack was dodged.  The monk in training bent his right knee, allowing his body to lean to the side, narrowly evading the blow.  He'd then readjust his position while taking a step back. 

"I think this should be alright for now. You're picking up really quickly. I can suggest striking with your palms and fingers at a wooden dummy in your spare time. It'll help a lot. Even if it doesn't stike anything, keep training and remember this feeling," he spoke, releasing his stance and dojutsu.  His breathing was heavy from the exchange of fists. He wasn't used to sparring with people as he usually practiced such things alone.  With a smile on his innocent harmless face, he bowed his head towards Niza, "Thank you for this opportunity."* - Mon Sep 28 03:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Indeed it was.  Speaking of training, I wonder what Yukio is up to. - Mon Sep 28 03:50:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Alright. I'll forward to the next session. - Mon Sep 28 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Hm... - Mon Sep 28 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: For you to get a headstart however. - Mon Sep 28 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I shall you leave you this scroll. - Mon Sep 28 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) grabbed the scroll and looked at it. "What's in it?", he commented, examining it in his grasp.* - Mon Sep 28 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: A defensive taijutsu maneuver known as the misdirect. - Mon Sep 28 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Very simple and easy to use. - Mon Sep 28 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see. - Mon Sep 28 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'm to assume it's a simple technique that shifts an attack? - Mon Sep 28 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Indeed. - Mon Sep 28 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Well. - Mon Sep 28 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I shall be returning to the center now. - Mon Sep 28 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Thank you once again for the lessons. - Mon Sep 28 03:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You're welcome. And thank you for giving me this opportunity. - Mon Sep 28 03:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: No problem. - Mon Sep 28 03:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) interested in what was in the scroll, Kuro opens the sealed item in his hand with a flick of his thumb. The scroll rolled open, revealing it's hidden contents deep from with in. He began to read the scroll in an attempt to understand and grasp it's concepts.* - Mon Sep 28 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) continued to read the scroll. From what was told to him, it was a taijutsu technique which redirected an individual's attack. He was quite interested in the concept as it mimic his own style of combat. It was said to be the first step in learning about the Kempo martial arts. 

The genin had his eyes glued onto the scroll, occasionally mimicing the instructions himself. * - Mon Sep 28 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Kuro... - Mon Sep 28 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) walked over towards the base of the mountain where he spotted Mamoru and Hideki. He waved hello to the two before sitting on the ground, entering a meditative stance. His legs were crossed, arms limp, hands resting on his lap, and his back straight.  * - Mon Sep 28 23:45:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was deep in his meditation that he failed to realize Misa arriving. He opened his eyes and glanced at the female after she spoke. "Oh, when did you get here?", he asked, feeling a bit embarassed for asking.* - Tue Sep 29 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) started to laugh too at her odd joke. It may or may not be true, but it was rather out of the ordinary which added to the humor. "I doub't you'd have enough patience to watch me meditate for hours. Anyway, have have you been feeling since before?", he questioned, readjusting his seating position to be a bit more laxed.* - Tue Sep 29 04:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) thinks: I wonder if she knows.. - Tue Sep 29 05:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) thinks: I wonder if she knows.. - Tue Sep 29 05:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) scooted over a bit closer to Misa as he placed a gentle hand onto her shoulder. "It's alright. It's natural to feel this way inside. But please, don't let yourself be swallowed up by this sorrow. I was there during her last moments, and it didn't look pretty. I don't know the entire situation, since I arrived at the very end, but I do know that she passed while in combat.  I'm not sure if anyone told you the complete details, but promise me that you won't follow the same path as Maloth, seeking revenge.  It won't bring anything but death and misery."

Kuro spoke to Misa with a calm tone as he rubbed her shoulder, hoping to console the emotionally torn woman. He held compassion in his eyes as every word that flowed from his lips held truth.  Misa was one of his close friends, and he cared for her deeply.* - Tue Sep 29 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) released his hand from Misa's shoulder and rested it upon his own lap.  He let out a smile upon hearing her words. The fact that she wasn't chasing after a sense of revenge, and was trying to deter from it made him happy. After all, he's seen what revenge and selfish actions resulted in. "I'm happy that you're trying to stay away from the path of revenge.  Don't think of being passive as being weak, think of it as being strong with a high sense of self control. The moment we lose ourselves to selfish desires is the moment we stop being humans, and turn into animals.  Just remember, I'm here for you if you need anything," he spoke, continuing his efforts to console his friend.* - Tue Sep 29 05:20:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: But I haven't seen her recently. - Tue Sep 29 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) noticed Mamoru walking in. He leaned over the counter and sent out a friendly wave towards his direction. Afterwards, he returned to his initial seating position. "So you haven't been training with her as much since?", he questioned.* - Tue Sep 29 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Why not? - Tue Sep 29 05:38:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Perhaps she's waiting for a time to teach you. - Tue Sep 29 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: That...or she just doesn't want to teach me anymore... - Tue Sep 29 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's similar to my monk training.  I'm learning things in steps. - Tue Sep 29 05:42:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) let out a sigh as he stood up from his seat. He took a few steps up towards Hideki and stared at him for a moment. Suddenly, he lashed out at the male, sending a karate chop onto his head. "Fool!", he shouted.  This was the first time he 'attacked' an individual, and there was good reason. Hideki had also became one of his friends, and the fact that he ran over to Erebus who was the one to kill Hanabi just seemed foolish.

"I thought you weren't going to follow the path of revenge?", he spoke, returning the volume of his voice back to normal.  * - Tue Sep 29 06:06:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Because there's a satisfying quenching of hunger, as well as a good feeling within the mouth. - Tue Sep 29 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was in fact, angry. He wasn't steaming, just mad at Hideki's choices.  He took a deep breath, calming himself down so that he wouldn't act rash.  "No thank you," he replied to Mamoru, rejecting the offer.

"You may follow your own path, but as a friend, I'm here to keep you on the right path. The path that's more benefitial to you. What do you think will happen if you were to die in your pursuit of revenge? The rest of us will feel the same way you felt about Hanabi.  Then someone may try to do the same thing you are, and it'll just repeat over and over, an endless cycle."* - Tue Sep 29 06:12:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Their both injured, Hideki more than Mamoru, but Mamoru has a rather bad jaw injury. - Wed Sep 30 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Also not that long. - Wed Sep 30 05:44:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Mamoru had a jaw injury and Hideki felt like he had a few broken bones. - Wed Sep 30 05:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm, he also had bruises all over his body. - Wed Sep 30 05:47:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Explain. - Wed Sep 30 05:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: A few days ago, we lost an individual who was close with a few of our shinobi. Some have taken a dark turn, others are still trying to find a way to cope. - Wed Sep 30 05:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I see. - Wed Sep 30 05:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Hideki is one such who I fear may get himself harmed by losing his sense of rationality. - Wed Sep 30 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hm. - Wed Sep 30 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I just hope he sees how dangerous this path is that he's taking. - Wed Sep 30 05:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Why don't you tell him this? - Wed Sep 30 05:58:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You're a shinobi right? - Wed Sep 30 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I'm aiming to become a medic. - Wed Sep 30 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Sadly I never got to learn the basics so all I can really do is use senbons. - Wed Sep 30 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I know someone who is similar to you. - Wed Sep 30 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Do you? - Wed Sep 30 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yep. Well I know of two medics. Marianna and Misa. Not Ushinawa's sister Misa, the blonde haired Misa. - Wed Sep 30 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Marianna would be your best bet to learn from, since Misa is learning from her. - Wed Sep 30 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm alright. - Wed Sep 30 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm are the girls cute? - Wed Sep 30 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I guess. They both are attractive. - Wed Sep 30 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Well that's good. - Wed Sep 30 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Marianna is taken for. As for Misa, I'm not sure. - Wed Sep 30 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Eh, I'm not looking. - Wed Sep 30 06:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Oh, I thought you were. - Wed Sep 30 06:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Well not now. - Wed Sep 30 06:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: So here's my question, Kuro. - Wed Sep 30 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yes? - Wed Sep 30 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Was this the cute blonde you were talkin' bout? - Wed Sep 30 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Misa? Yes, this is her. - Wed Sep 30 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: . . . - Wed Sep 30 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm, well now I'm bored. - Wed Sep 30 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) crossed his legs as he usually do, preparing himself to enter a meditative stance. As usual, he staightened his back and allowed his arms to rest upon his lap, forming a singular buddhist handseal in the process. "Why not meditate?", he asked, looking over at Reguel. He then glanced over at Misa, worried as to why she remained silent this entire time. "Is there something wrong?"* - Wed Sep 30 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'm guessing you've been with Marianna? - Wed Sep 30 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Or have you been with Hideki and Ushiwara? - Wed Sep 30 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see. Well, have you met Reguel? He too is a medic. - Wed Sep 30 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) motions his hand over towards Reguel, who was sitting right beside him. "Perhaps the two of you can learn from each other," he added.* - Wed Sep 30 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Well Hideki is injured, like I stated already. - Wed Sep 30 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: . . .. .  He is? - Wed Sep 30 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Where is he... - Wed Sep 30 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Laying down. - Wed Sep 30 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Where. - Wed Sep 30 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I'm the one who carried him here. - Wed Sep 30 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: In the other room, it's best to let him get some rest. - Wed Sep 30 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Mamoru is also injured, not as sever as Hideki. - Wed Sep 30 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't know, and Reguel doesn't seem to know either.  I just found out not too long ago about their conditions. - Wed Sep 30 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: . . . . - Wed Sep 30 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: You're asking a lot of questions, but you've yet to introduce yourself. - Wed Sep 30 06:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: The edge, it hurts. - Wed Sep 30 06:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: .... - Wed Sep 30 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I mean, if I was there before this stuff happened, or much much later I probably wouldn't let my friend all this far into depravity. - Wed Sep 30 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's a difficult situation. - Wed Sep 30 06:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You can't force someone to listen and change. They need to do it themselves. All we can do is try to get him to realize what he's doing. - Wed Sep 30 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: My point still stands. - Wed Sep 30 06:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: As his friends it's just as much your fault for him getting injured than his own. - Wed Sep 30 06:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Are you to say the same to a mother when her child is out? - Wed Sep 30 06:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Me? Probably. - Wed Sep 30 06:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see..So you believe the fault lies on the mother rather than unforseen circumstances. - Wed Sep 30 06:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: It depends. Is it the mother's fault that she didn't protect her child or reach out for them when they needed it most? Or is it the unforseen circumstances? - Wed Sep 30 06:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It can be either or.  Sure, a mother should watch for their child at all times, but there's a time where the child must grow and experience things on their own. - Wed Sep 30 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: True. - Wed Sep 30 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: In our situation, Hideki must realize it himself that the path he's walking is a dark one. No one saves us but ourselves. No one can and no one may. We ourselves must walk the path.  - Wed Sep 30 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Or just beat him, but maybe taking this beating is worth it. - Wed Sep 30 07:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Violence only breeds more violence. - Wed Sep 30 07:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's how we got into this situation in the first place. - Wed Sep 30 07:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Well I'm just an outsider lookin' in. - Wed Sep 30 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That is true. - Wed Sep 30 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You'll eventually see. - Wed Sep 30 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Yeah whenever I start makin' friends. - Wed Sep 30 07:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You've already made a friend. - Wed Sep 30 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Have I? - Wed Sep 30 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) lets out a gentle smile after speaking.* - Wed Sep 30 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yes. I consider us friends now. - Wed Sep 30 07:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) arrived into the room and sat down onto an empty seat. Upon walking in, he took a glance at everyone, Hideki, Mamoru, Reguel, and Chiharu. He let out a sigh as he sat himself onto the seat, shaking his head like a disappointed parent.

"Did you go after him?", he asked as his eyes shifted towards Hideki's direction.  * - Wed Sep 30 23:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: .... - Wed Sep 30 23:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Mamoru, what happened with the two of you? I heard you both suffered serious injuries. Was it because of Erebus? - Wed Sep 30 23:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm. - Wed Sep 30 23:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) let out a sigh as the two remained silent. He then turned around to look at the new person, Chiharu. "Do you know what happened with these two?", he questioned.* - Wed Sep 30 23:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: No. - Wed Sep 30 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see.. - Wed Sep 30 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) let out a sigh since his questions still remained. Since the two were unresponsive for the time being, he reached into his kimono and pulled out a small handheld sized black scroll.  He placed it onto his lap after opening it up. Inside the scroll were various character detailing the information that was inside.  His eyes scanned the letters over and over. By now, he'd gotten familar with reading the scroll, since it gave intensive detail of the subject at hand, which of course was connected with his monk training.

"It's similar to how I thought," he muttered to himself as his eyes became glued to the scroll.  He placed the scroll down and began to imitate the movements, moving his arms to and fro. At first, it felt off, but after multiple attempts, the movement started to feel more at ease.  "Is this it?", he thought to himself as he read the scroll once more.  

In all honesty, he wasn't entirely sure if he was performing the technique properly. After reading the scroll's contents and repeating the steps that were written down, he still felt like there was something off. Thus, he looked up and turned his gaze back to Mamoru.  "Mamoru, did Niza teach you a kempo technique that can be used to change the flow of battle?", he asked, trying to make the question sound as vague as possible, but at the same time trying to make it connect home with Mamoru.   Personally, Kuro didn't know if the technique itself was secretive or not, but he didn't want to take any chances, especially since he was the student.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Kuro, you never ddi tell me what you wre studying to be. - Wed Sep 30 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) let out another sigh, feeling the weight of being ignored. "That's rather rude of him," he muttered, now turning his gaze over towards Reguel. "Hm..Well I guess you can say that I'm studying to become a monk. I'm receiving training from Yukio and the Raikage in that regards. I aim to one day be able to travel the world and spread these teachings to others," he'd speak before returning to his study of the scripted scroll. * - Wed Sep 30 23:56:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) was deep in concentration as his eyes scanned the scroll over and over. He looked up after realizing that Misa was adressing him. "Yeah, I've been meditating, and practicing martial arts. " He then looked over towards Hideki, "I think this is the best condition he can be in at the moment. It'll give him time to meditate and expell the dark thoughts in his mind."* - Thu Oct  1 00:34:59 2015
