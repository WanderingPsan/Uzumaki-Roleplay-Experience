<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuda(Booty Eater) shifts amongst the sandy terrain of Sunagakure now, letting his eyes draw out across the eroded soil. It was hot, as usual in Sunagakure, although this made no difference to Yuda as he removed his spear from his backside, letting the strap of it un-clip. His hands were now equipped with a lethal weapon, one that he was trained to use.

Utilizing his skill, he dropped into his wild stance as he let his eyes view the area ahead of himself. Yuda dropped low, compared to how most of his opponents would fight and proceeded to steady himself with spear in hand. Eventually, Yuda made circling motions before eventually passing on his way to the nearby stone.

A couple of shifted movements and Yuda was aligned at what he believed to be the center of the stone. Rather than striking from above, he came at it straight on, stabbing several times at the general body of the rock. His spear went immediately for the center before beginning to span out and strike in a central zone. The tip of his spear moved rather quickly. With ease it weaved in and out as he struck several points in a short, rapid motion.

Eventually Yuda stepped back, giving space for a split second before diving back into the motion of things. Immediately, his spear was cracking against the rock. Each strike creating a resounding sound that represented iron and stone. The clash being rather beautiful as the durability off the two created sparks, sending them flying throughout the air with little to no problem whatsoever.

As Yuda continued to move fluently and perfectly with the spear in his hands, he weilded as though it was an extension of his body. Each strike being done effortlessly as he moved around. In other words though, his body would stop between strikes to simply create a spinning motion with the weapon at hand. His face showed determination, discipline, and most importantly honor.

Yuda's body had conjured up a storm of sweat, letting beads of it all rest upon his brow and the occasional one slipping past. Those that escape the grasp of his furrowed brow would bring a slight sense of pain to his eyes, although he continued to avoid them without much of a problem whatsoever. Quite easily, his skills had improved--even if he was considered a master in the use of his weapon.

An endless barrage of strikes continued to be produced by yours truly. He was puncutring the rock after a while. These holes had become markers for where to strike. With them in place, Yuda slowed his roll. His blade moved at a more steady pace and dug into each hole with little problem. When he got the rhythm and pattern, Yuda picked up on his speed once more. His movements coming in rather fast compared to the normal shinobi.

With his extended reach, he made no problems to leave his mark on the rock without getting up close and personal. Although, Yuda then proceeded to step back or a while. The reason for this being that he wished to take a short break--no more than five seconds. Looking upon his savage act, he spotted a painting. His art correcting the face of the rock with some simple points and the art of a spearman. 

Stepping forward again, Yuda's spear jutted outwards and jabbed immediately into the rock and left him with nothing more than a much deeper, and larger hole. His eyes settled in on this one as he applied his spear to his back immediately afterwards. The training was over and he developed his spearman skills without any outside interference. Next, he'd have to take into account what else he needed to develop.* - Fri Nov 27 18:18:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuda(Booty Eater) stared blankly for a moment, listening to the task at hand. For a moment, he felt a little insulted. He wanted a mission where he could stab something, but did nothing to argue against the given task.

Rather, Yuda simply took up the necessary goods and made off to the first site. "Easy."* - Sat Nov 28 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuda(Booty Eater) moved quickly through Sunagakure, pulling his weight along the way as he came across the sandy pathways. His village, had been quite expansive and the recent attacks had left them in a state of destruction and sadness. His eyes traversed the surrounding area as he passed by, feeling some guilt for not being capable enough of defending his homeland. However, all he could do now was be glad that they pulled through and work to better himself.

The spear that Yuda utilized remained strapped to his backside, jolting lightly at each movement he made. It wasn't enough to hinder him, but he did hear a light clinking as it tapped against his backside. Obviously, he needed to either tighten the straps or get a spear with a thicker shaft. Regardless though, he motioned onto the first site. His eyes scanning out across the scene.

He could see several men, hard at work with rebuilding Sunagakure. For a moment, he simply watched them, feeling as though he should drop what he was doing and run off to join them. Yet, he held back and simply moved on to the drop off point. Taking up the first set of supplies in hand, he simply announced his arrival by stating, "Supplies herre. Beverages, food, you name it."

With only a few seconds, nearly everyone came and collected whatever they felt necessary. Yuda himself moved on back towards the cart, taking it up in arms as he began to push. His arms kept a tight hold on the handles. Not only was he pushing, but he had to lift just to keep the cart rolling. And as he did so, he proved that he wasn't tired in the slightest. His movements bringing him forward to the next drop off point.

This time, on Yuda's trek, he let his eyes stay forward. He didn't want to get sidetracked and felt he'd be better off with focusing on the task at hand. Although, as he moved through the streets he noticed children and people trying to get by with what they had. Playing with rocks and what not. It brought a warm feeling to Yuda, although he showed no sign of comfort with it.

Yuda came down upon the second scene now, finding the builders here were on some sort of break. Although, he could hear their gripes and moans. Each one of them individually complaining about the lack of nourishment. Luckily, Yuda was on the scene with his cart, abundant with food and beverage for Sunagakure's hardworking forces. 

Bringing the cart to the sidelines, the workers moved before Yuda even spoke. Although, he continued to imitate his efforts at the last stop. Yuda whom remained still, raised an arm and simpyl stated, "Supplies here. Food and drink for all our hard workers. Keep up the work." Then his task only asked that he remained still, until they finished.

Afterwards, Yuda pushed on to the next location, taking the cart up without a problem. His legs moved in tandem with the cart, rolling it onwards to his goal. Eventually, he came across the third stop and found a crew of workers. The difference between this one and the others seemed to be the fact that they were rather lazy. Yuda stared at the individuals and thought about leaving without giving them their dropoff.

Yuda then proceeded onwards, coming across the fourth group. This one being like a group from a children's show or movie. They worked in sing-song, doing things in a rhytmic pattern. Their work seemed more like a musical than actual work in reality. And with some respect, Yuda left their dropoff safely. No words spoken for the sake of letting them keep their intuitive motions and not wanting to destroy their well put together show.

Now, Yuda was onto the last stop. This one seemed as unintersting as the first. They had no complaints but did nothing to show exemplarary work. It was average, mediocre at best. This didn't make Yuda think lowly of them, but it surely let him realize that originality and enjoyment was seldomly seen within Sungakure. Regardless, he did just as he did to the first and called out, "Supplies her." He then left the cart, moving on to find the Kazekage now. His work was done.* - Sat Nov 28 02:46:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuda(Booty Eater) allowed himself to make a hasty approach to the gates of Sunagaure. As he moved, he allowed one hand to move behind his back and adjust the spear that settled on it. It seemd a bit uncomfortable considering her hadn't adjust the straps in a while. Although, upon his arrival he released his grip and allowed himself to extend his hand to the visitor at the gates. "Welcome to Sunagakure." was all he said as they shook hands.

After completing this action, Yuda proceeded to walk into the village, raising a hand and making a 'follow me' gesture. "Come, I'll show you the village." A light chuckle left him as he said this of course, showing some sense of humor. What was funny, nobody knew. Although, the first stop Yuda decided to bring the visitor to was Sunagakure's most famed restaurant and bar, The Red Ant or so he believed it was called. "Best food and drink you'll probably get around here. Maybe."

Eventually though, he moved on to the next goal and brought himself and the visitor to the Academy district. When they arrived, Yuda gestured towards the arena structure and simply stated, "This here is the arena where our shinobi spar and practice their techniques. A lot of our teaching goes on out here for deomonstration purposes." Then his hand motioned to the academy. "In there is more or less where we read and take tests. The more intellectual side of the learning."

Once that event had been completed, he guided the visitor directly from their to the Kazekage mansion. Pausing, he allowed them to look at the expansive square before it and then moved on to gesture at the actual mansion itself. "Here, the Kazekage conducts most of their duties. From discussing with the council to handing out missions. The area out front is normally where people get together."

Moving on from there, Yuda searched for the next location, simply wondering where he could possibly bring them next. Eventually, he snapped his fingers as he thought about where to move onto. His legs seemed to move a bit faster as he traveled towards the residential district. This was the palce that most had wanted to see, especially when contemplating on moving to Sunagakure. "This is where everyone lives. Every house used to be filled but some guys moved out or died, so there's plenty of free space now."

The next location was deemed to be the prison of Sunagakure. Yuda brought himself forward to this location and remained wary. He hadn't wished to be brought in for causing trouble, especially when he wasn't. Regardless, when he arrived with the visitor at his side he simply stated, "Hey, so. This is the prison of Sunagakure. We haven't really had that much crime within the walls so there aren't many prisoners."

Lightly nodding before going onwards, Yuda then came down to the shopping district. This was another famed area for visitors. "Here, you can buy pretty much anything. Mainly clothing. If you're a shinobi, then some weapons maybe." He walked around with them for a bit before opting to move on to the next location, and the final at that.

Bringing the citizen alongside himself, they soon found their way unto the Inn. This was the final stop because it allowed the visitor to rest prior to doing anything else.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuda(Booty Eater) thinks: Fuckin' did that yesterday... - Mon Nov 30 23:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuda(Booty Eater) made his way towards the gates with Hiroshi. As they moved, Yuda seemed a bit agitated. Not at his partner, but due to the fact that he'd basically been a tour guide for the past two days. He wanted a mission where he could put his spear into play. Regardless, when he arrived at the gates alongside Hiroshi, he remained silent to avoid screwing up his partner's work ethic.

When they finally pulled off, Yuda seemd to hang back a bit, only to keep a majority of the area in sight. When they passed by the training yard, he smirked a bit, elated at the fact that someone was actually getting some training in. Although, it disgusted him that he couldn't participate. Eventually, he set his eyes back on the escort target, making sure to follow after Hiroshi's lead.

The second stop didn't do much for Yuda really, although as he came to a pause with them, his hand motioned to adjust the spear on his back. A light cough came from him when he looked to the older man. Yuda was noticably observing for any expression he could build off of.

Hiroshi had lead Yuda and the older man to the next destination though. A smirk drew out on Yuda's face simply for the fact that he enjoyed how Hiroshi conducted his tour. It was the same format Yuda had utilized. Yet, it was when they were inside that Yuda was required to speak. In response to Hiroshi, he only nodded. It wasn't until after their meal that he actually spoke up. "Now that we're past all that...We've got this amazing manor for the Kazekage." And of course, Yuda lead them there, raising his arms as to make a grand show of the large establishment. "Our Lord Kazekage resides here and conducts business here as well."

Oddly enough though, Yuda didn't waste time there and moved towards where he liked to leave his tourists. The Inn. He conducted himself in a sort of giddy fashion and soon, when they all arrived, he raised his arms in a showy fashion once more. "The greatest place to stop and rest. Complete with bed and breakfast. It's the Sunagakure Inn!" He then waited, remaining still as he expected some grand response of suprise and relief. Of course though, he'd revert to  a normal stance regardless and simply beckon, "What's next?"* - Tue Dec  1 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: We have finished Sanoke. - Tue Dec  1 00:07:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I might pass..Or just watch. - Tue Dec  1 00:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuda(Booty Eater) had never recieved a mission to exit the village before, although a delivery was nothing new for him. The only change now would be the scenery. Along with the materials he had, he found his way to the gates with Hiroshi. For a moment, he paused to listen to his statement.

When Hiroshi had completed his explanation, he allowed himself to pass on through the gates, following the blue-haired shinobi's lead. Yuda himself was rather excited to see something other than sand amongst the shinobi world now. As he moved, he did his best to keep a comfortable and composed movement.

Inside of the forest however, Yuda had to pause alongside Hiroshi. It seemed that they were to take a break, and without protest, Yuda gave in. He placed down the materials he personally carried, unsure of how well his partner was holding up. Yuda however was running off pure excitement. "Yeah, it is."

After their break, Yuda continued onwards and followed their pathway to their destination, keeping himsel steady. So far however, the only thing taxing was how he had to hold the equipment rather than the weight. The combination of his spear and such somewhat throwing him off. Yet he found himself making way to the Samurai Settlement as well.

Upon entering, Yuda looked around and felt a bit uneasy. It was probably due to the choice of weapon he had. Although, he remained silent to avoid conflict. Regardless though, Yuda followed direction and opened up his own box, showing the contents to the client. Afterwards, he gave a wave goodbye, assuming that was all they needed. Eventually, he'd make an exit, expecting Hiroshi to come along. Of course, this was to return to Sunagakure for any further tasks.* - Tue Dec  1 00:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuda(Booty Eater) remained ready and prepared for the next mission. Yuda simply listened in on the details of their final mission. Of course, figuring he could do it without much of a problem. The fact that they had to head out to another village had impressed him greatly once again. There was indeed some trust from the Kazekage here.

Regardless though, Yuda made his way towards the forest alongside his comrade. It didn't really take much just to get there, but when they did, he observed the tree with awe. They were indeed the largest he'd seen in his entire lifetime. Regardless, he moved on to the opposing side of the tree for them to begin.

When handed the one side of the saw, he made sure that he worked in tandem with Hiroshi. His pulls being timed with his push. His push being timed with his pulls and so on. They worked together, like a real team just to get through the task together. Yuda however, was tiring a bit quickly from this. Although, in an attempt to avoid letting his teammate down he simply stated, 'I'm good!" His ambition carrying him through.

Eventually, after a long conjointed effort they finished. The tree itself had come toppling down and Yuda looked at it, panting a bit. Of course, afterwards he'd simply state, "Break time..." The result of this being Yuda settling down for a few minutes, resting himself as he waited to regain his strength, unsure if Hiroshi needed a break as well.

After some time, the two would've collected the tree, doing the best they could to bring it in to their client. Yuda struggling sliently considering he wasn't the best in terms of a physical build. Regardless, ambition to help had driven him forward. Eventually they delivered the tree, "Here...you go..." Eventually, they would return to Sunagakure obviously to turn in the mission.* - Tue Dec  1 01:03:34 2015
