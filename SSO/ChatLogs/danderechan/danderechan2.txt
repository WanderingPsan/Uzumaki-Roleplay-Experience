<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: I'm..Alive uh.. - Thu Nov 26 02:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) nodded. "I know.." She murmured her response. She unraveled her arms from around Ai, removing her orange-zippered jacket, as well as her scarf, wrapping both around Ai. She leaned down in front of Ai, turning her back to her and clasping her hands. With a simple application of strength Mizora pulled Ai onto her back. She'd look toward the Kazekage.

"I'd participate in the battle but..." She looked back to Ai, wordlessly implying that she had 'someone' to take care of. The burning heat emanating from Ai was hard to endure.* - Thu Nov 26 02:19:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: But...If it wasn't for it..I would have been dead by now.. - Thu Nov 26 02:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Voice..? What'd it sound like? - Thu Nov 26 02:28:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Really? - Thu Nov 26 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Yeah... - Thu Nov 26 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Mizora...I'm sorry I almost died on you... - Thu Nov 26 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) lay Ai onto the bed.

"You don't have to apologize.. you're alive right..?"* - Thu Nov 26 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Yeah.. - Thu Nov 26 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: A-Are you okay..? - Thu Nov 26 02:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Y-Yeah...Just...Really hot.. - Thu Nov 26 02:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) peered at Ai with a look of concern. "Maybe a bath'll help? Come on and take those torn up clothes of---... you can't move.. can you?" She questioned.* - Thu Nov 26 02:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: N-No I can't.. - Thu Nov 26 02:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) nodded lightly. She began to strip away at Ai's clothing, until she was bare naked. The black and white-haired Hokuma entered the bathroom, starting the tub up.

The Hokuma returned to Ai, picking her up and carrying her into the bathroom. Mizora would then place her down within the water, turning the nozzles so it'd stop flowing.* - Thu Nov 26 02:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) smiled. "I love you too.. and it's fine." She'd say, taking a cloth and squeezing out a decent portion of body wash onto it. She began to scrub Ai's back, gently just in case it'd cause pain.* - Thu Nov 26 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) nodded lightly. She continued to scrub Ai's back briefly, before beginning to scrub other areas of Ai's body, kneeling down beside the bath tub as she did so.* - Thu Nov 26 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) cleansed Ai's body, though she showed some signs of discomfort while cleaning Ai's groin region.

"I hope it doesn't hurt.."* - Thu Nov 26 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: H-Hm? - Thu Nov 26 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: You don't have to finish me off.~ - Thu Nov 26 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) looked to Ai, concern consuming her features.

"Are you sure..? It doesn't look like you've completely recovered.."* - Thu Nov 26 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Gonna take a while..Oh god.. - Thu Nov 26 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) handed her the cloth.

"Sure.. but if you need anymore help don't be afraid to ask. Um, are you hungry? I could cook while you're bathing."* - Thu Nov 26 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) stood up from kneeling beside the tub. She began to walk out of the bathroom, peering back at Ai briefly with pursed lips.* - Thu Nov 26 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) came back into the bathroom to check on Ai, moving forward.  Her right arm hovered over Ai's shoulders, while her left was out in front of Ai, her frown prominent on her facial features as she confronted Ai, nervous about her condition.

"Why didn't you call for me so I could help you get out of the tub? Come on.. I'll help you." Her confronting inquiry was replaced by concern and the feeling of wanting to help Ai.* - Thu Nov 26 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) crouched down at Ai's side, her arms still in place. She partially embraced Ai.

"Try not to exert yourself... you might be like this for a few days.." Chakra flowed to her eyes as she discerned Ai's chakra network.

<I wonder...> She thought to herself.* - Thu Nov 26 04:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) thinks: That odd chakra.... - Thu Nov 26 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: I'll be careful not to draw it out. - Thu Nov 26 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: -mischan- - Thu Nov 26 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) thinks: I'll be careful not to draw it out. - Thu Nov 26 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) smiled.

"I know how to resolve this.. it might be painful though. Well.. -definitely- will be painful.. I think."* - Thu Nov 26 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: .... - Thu Nov 26 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I'm listening.. - Thu Nov 26 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mmm... - Thu Nov 26 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Long story short, the Hokuma focus on sealing tenketsu with their raw chakra.. because they can see it. - Thu Nov 26 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: ..... - Thu Nov 26 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Go on.. - Thu Nov 26 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Anyways... we can also unseal tenketsu.. and increase chakra flow by dilating them with our own chakra. - Thu Nov 26 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: But..? - Thu Nov 26 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Your body is weak because your tenketsu are extra tight. - Thu Nov 26 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: With that being said, I'll dilate them and see if that works on giving you a full recovery. - Thu Nov 26 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Now that I think about it.. it won't be painful. - Thu Nov 26 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) pulled her left arm back, bedning it then thrusting it forth. She efficiently poked him several times with her pointer finger, lacking the necessary physical force to hurt her as she did this. The -massive- amount of chakra invested into this action would course throughout Ai's frame, dilating all 361 of her tenketsu to the point that her chakra would begin flowing at it's normal rate. The chakra flowing to her hands would halt, and after she observed that what she did was successful, so did the chakra flowing to her eyes.* - Thu Nov 26 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) coiled her arms around Ai, returning the affectionate embrace.

"I'm glad it worked!" She said excitedly.* - Thu Nov 26 04:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: I should put some clothes on.~ - Thu Nov 26 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: Hehe.. that'd be a good idea. - Thu Nov 26 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: N'awww, don't like Ai naked uh?~ - Thu Nov 26 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: Er... - Thu Nov 26 04:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Hehe, don't worry, I'm only joking. I'll put some clothes on. - Thu Nov 26 04:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: Okay.... - Thu Nov 26 04:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Wait on me outside. - Thu Nov 26 04:44:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) pecked Ai on the lips, before exiting the bathroom.* - Thu Nov 26 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: ...? - Thu Nov 26 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) sat on the edge of the bed, combing her hair and looking into the mirror.* - Thu Nov 26 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Hm? About to sleep?~ - Thu Nov 26 04:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Hm? I'm not sure. I was planning on training.. maybe. - Thu Nov 26 04:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Oh? I see. - Thu Nov 26 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: What about you? - Thu Nov 26 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I'm gonna report back to Hassan then take a long nap. - Thu Nov 26 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mm.. there's food on the table, by the way. I covered it up with plastic wrap. - Thu Nov 26 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Alright, I'll tackle it real soon. - Thu Nov 26 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: I wonder if I'll become a Chuunin.. - Thu Nov 26 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Hm? Through the exams? Maybe. - Thu Nov 26 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: I don't want to participate in those exams..mm.. - Thu Nov 26 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Eh..Maybe then. - Thu Nov 26 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Hassan would want to see what you can do first though. Pass his 'exams'. - Thu Nov 26 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) removed her pants and jacket. She ran her hands throughout the shelves. The black and white-haired female pulled on a pair of black yoga pants, in addition to a loose-fitting blue gi-esque shirt, fitting a maroon sash to her waist.* - Thu Nov 26 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Hm? - Thu Nov 26 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Eh... no color coordination.. - Thu Nov 26 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) unfitted the sash, pulling off her shirt, fishing through the drawers and pulling forth a shirt of the same style, just black instead.* - Thu Nov 26 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: ... - Thu Nov 26 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Er.... - Thu Nov 26 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) pulled forth yet another sash and shirt, which were literally the colors of the original, just reversed.* - Thu Nov 26 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Gonna take a while uh.. - Thu Nov 26 05:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mmkay.. this is g-...mm... - Thu Nov 26 05:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Ai... should I wear red sandals or black boots..? - Thu Nov 26 05:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Boots. - Thu Nov 26 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mmm.. but the sandals.... - Thu Nov 26 05:22:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) yelped. She scowled, looking over at Ai.

"I wasn't done..."* - Thu Nov 26 05:24:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) flowed chakra to her ocular nerves, beginning to perceive Momura's underground travel. Her gaze would drift toward Kuro.

"Hm? Um.. I saw him yesterday in the southern border of the village. He's either asleep or at the prison right now."* - Thu Nov 26 18:44:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mm...hm.. - Thu Nov 26 18:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) tied her hair into a long, flowing ponytail. She'd then stand a reasonable distance across from Kinami. "Ready when you are."* - Thu Nov 26 18:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: You may start us off. - Thu Nov 26 18:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Hm..? Okay. - Thu Nov 26 18:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Should I hit at full strength or..? - Thu Nov 26 19:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Nevermind, I'll ask you that later on. - Thu Nov 26 19:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) intersected her wrists, then threw her arms aside, allowing chakra to immerse them in a sudden burst. She shot at Kinami, jabbing with her right palm at the female with intentions of testing out her reaction time.

With the intensity of the momentum put behind Mizora's attacks, her attacks were hard to interpret for the naked eye. While it looked like she was attacking with her right palm, one with keen enough sight would be able to interpret that she brought her right arm back and shot her left forth only moments before she was about to connect with her blow.

<I'll see how she goes up against Gentle Fist. Then I'll see how she deals with hand-to-hand combat.> Mizora thought.* - Thu Nov 26 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: (17 AS.) - Thu Nov 26 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: (aiming for your left arm. it'll do 10 internal damage, nothing more.) - Thu Nov 26 19:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (17 as also) - Thu Nov 26 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: (damage?) - Thu Nov 26 19:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (25 holding back) - Thu Nov 26 19:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) wasn't new to this level of speed, but none the less she intended to take the hit, just to see how far or close Paine's pupil was to her. The byakugan wielder allowed the strike to land, her head reeling backward naturally. Her head slowly lowered as she smiled at Kinami, seeming as though she took no damage.

<She's good at kicking, that's for sure.>

In several rapid thrusts she attempted to palm strike Kinami numerous times for a total of three hits, before jumping back and coming to a skidding halt. The chakra immersing her hands faded away. She balled her gauze-covered hands into tight fists, bending her arms and placing her fists in front of her face, her knuckles facing Kinami's direction.

"Come on."* - Thu Nov 26 19:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: (27.6 / 28 durability over here after being doubled from 13.8, btw.) - Thu Nov 26 19:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (30 damage this time) - Thu Nov 26 19:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) rushed forth as Kinami did. She aligned her own strength with Kinami's, thrusting her right arm forth with intentions of colliding her knuckles against her foe's. She quickly perceived the upcomign jab from her other arm, attempting to parry that with her other hand by catching the jab. She applied a little more strength to both of her fists, attempting to wrap the fingers of her right around Kinami's, trying to bind both of the female's fists to hers.

Attempting to thwart Kinami's own intentions, she tried to lunge forth as much as possible and thrust her right leg into bending position, trying to knee the female before she could be kicked, that is, if they weren't too close for such a kick to happen. Mizora was noticeably less quick with her attacks when she was using normal hand-to-hand combat, as she'd refined her Gentle Fist fighting style much more.* - Thu Nov 26 19:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: (30 damage for punching ya'fist, 35 for grabbing both of them.) - Thu Nov 26 19:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: (39 for the knee) - Thu Nov 26 19:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: (15 AS in general) - Thu Nov 26 19:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (52 dura total, 39 damage holding back) - Thu Nov 26 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) was caught off guard by the sudden dropkick onto her chest. She was knocked back abit, gasping as she released Kinami's fists from her grasps. The byakugan wielder had yet another thing up her sleeve. Directly after releasing her fists, Mizora intersected her palms as she leaped to Kinami's right and her own left, unclenching her left hand while keeping her right balled into a tight fist.

Chakra started coursing to her left hand and lower forearm. In addition, a green shine was slightly visible beneath the gauze concealing her forearms. Suddenly, small wind blades tore the gauze to shreds, revealing a pair of black elbow gloves, with red gloves that had black metal bands around the wrist and the cuffs of the gloves, which ended near the lower part of her wrist. Where her outer knuckles would be located lie the source of the green illumination, green gems.

Fuuton chakra had seemingly immersed her fists, specifically the gloves covering them.

"Let's do this."* - Thu Nov 26 19:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) thrusted forth, throwing her left arm forth with intentions of palm striking Kinami in the arm, while attempting to punch her in the jaw with her right fist. Mizora would continue this pattern, all the while throwing her left arm below her right, or above it, or completely vice versa to confuse her opponent with the seemingly constant alternation of fighting styles.

Once landing this same method two to three times she'd attempt to shoot to Kinami's side and aim to punch and palm strike her in the side at the same time.

"Bang!"

A 'blast' of chakra thrusted from one of her tenketsu within the centre of her palm, aiming to knock the female back with the powerful blast. All the while, it wasn't lethal, as throughout this method of attack she only aimed for the female's arm, non-vital areas of the chest, and her cheeks.* - Thu Nov 26 19:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: (19.4 AS, 50 damage per physical hit, ofc 10 static damage per gentle fist strike. not aiming at any vital areas.) - Thu Nov 26 19:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) allowed the Fuuton chakra around her gloves to halt, in addition to the chakra around her left hand. Normal chakra immersed her hands as she crouched down beside Kinami, pressing her hands to any area that she struck and unsealing the tenketsu with efficient jolts of chakra applied.

She smiled lightly, pulling out gauze from the confines of her backpouch and re-wrapping her gloves.

"That last style of fighting that I used on you is my own special style, hehe.~" * - Thu Nov 26 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Hehe, I'll have to learn and master that one day. To my own extent, at least. - Thu Nov 26 19:58:56 2015
