<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) formed a total of three handsigns. From her mouth spewed a gathering of water, which spread outward and aligned the shape of it's form to match hers, before taking on the entirety of Mizora's appearance in every same manner. The water-based clone strolled away, with intentions of taking care of the shop cleaning while Mizora took care of the duty of searching for a pig.* - Wed Dec  2 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) formed the Ram handsign as she sprinted along. The black and white-haired Hokuma activated her doujutsu, proceeding to pay close attention to the vicinity that she could sense and see within using her Byakugan. She immediately spotted the pig, strolling about amidst the sandy environment.

The girl shot in the direction where the pig was located, but unexpectedly said pig began to start running away. Whether it was the small being's instinct that a predator was coming or it was just trying to do something odd, she couldn't let it escape. Unfortunately the pig was slightly quicker than she was.

With the range between herself and the pig she'd be unable to capture it on foot. The girl removed a kunai knife from her backpouch, running a massive amount of Fuuton chakra throughout it's blade and causing it to shimmer and sharpe. She pulled her right arm back, still sprinting at the pig while it skipped away eagerly, perhaps unaware of her presence.

At breakneck speeds she whipped the kunai forward, watching as it thrusted right by the pig. Lucky for her that it missed, because the pig had to be captured without damage. The girl grit her teeth, forming the Ram handsign and slamming her eyes shut. She surged her chakra, then she thrusted forth at nearly three times her normal speed.

Her boosted momentum kicked her in the ass right when she reached her destination, a few inches behind the pig. She dropped into a crouched position, woozy as hell and dizzy at the same time. The pig -still- skipped away, unaware of her presecne so it seemed. The black and white-haired Hokumna stood up, dashing after it.

She suddenly broke into acceleration that she never thought she'd possessed. She zoomed in on the pig, taking the net that she received to perform the mission. With good strength behind her throw she threw the net over the pig, removing four kunai knives in a matter of moments and pinning the net to the ground, with the pig below it. She'd proceed to use a medicine she was given to use on the pig, stabbing a syringe into one of it's hooves and watching as it fell asleep from the drug. She formed three handsigns, forming a water clone whom picked up the sleeping pig and carried it back. Mizora herself started to head back as well.* - Wed Dec  2 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) 

Her water clone entered the shop, only to see pure havoc. Clothes were casted on the heavily dirty floors of the shop. The clone immediately showed off her mission scroll to the shopkeeper, then she took a broom from the storage room behind the counter. She left said storage room, adorning a gray apron as she went down ailes and ailes of clothing.

The girl picked up the clothing, finding -exactly- where they went. Shortly after doing so, the white and black-haired Hokuma's clone began to sweep up garbage that lie on the floor. She picked up wrappers and of the like that were thrown aimlessly. The clone looked around the store some more, taking note of the fact that the windows were uncleaned.

She placed the broom back in the storage room, exiting said storage room with a rag and some window cleaner. The girl sprayed the window cleaner onto the windows after opening them up, going on the outside of the windows and proceeding to wipe down the window and cleanse it of the gook.

Mizora's water clone continued to scrub down each window one by one, then it retrieved the window cleaner and placed it within the storage room, in addition to the rag she'd used. Lastly, the black and white-haired Hokuma's clone began to re-align the clothing on the racks within each aile. It was clear as day that jackets were put where pants should've been, and so on.

She re-arranged the racks so that the clothing in the ailes actually matched the labels upon the metal-bars that they were hung on. The girl's clone bowed to the shopkeeper, placing the gray apron in the storage room once more and leaving. Once otuside, her clone formed the last handsign that it was made by, turning into a small puddle of water.* - Wed Dec  2 05:20:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) sat on the rooftop to her house, her legs folded and her arms folded together. She passively coursed lightning kneaded chakra throughout her body. Becuase of this, blue sparks danced across her physique periodically. The centre of her long thinking process was invested into this method of meditation, as well as her personal life.* - Wed Dec  2 20:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) aligned the tips of her fingers. She generated an easily flowing current of whiteish blue chakra to her palms, transmitting the chakra beyond said palms to the vicinity between them. A small sphere of flickering, compressed Raiton-based chakra manifested itself between her palms. The Hokuma simply smiled at her succession of producing the technique.

"Lightning Ball!" Mizora fired off the sphere of whiteish blue essence. The spherical mass soared forward at an efficient momentum, The sphere traveled outward at a decent distance, and she observed as it did so, standing on the roof of her home. The sphere soon dispersed, the chakra scattering at such a rate that it eventually vanished from visible appearance.* - Wed Dec  2 21:02:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) 's eyes went agape, so did her mouth. She peered at the note, her irises running across the inside of the box. Mizora looked up at Ai, tears welling up within her eyes. "Y-Yes..." She murmured. Her voice was weak. She lunged into her arms, hugging her and yelping her ecstatic response. "I will... I'll marry you.." She whispered, embracing Ai tightly.* - Thu Dec  3 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) pressed her head to Ai's chest, her embrace growing slightly tighter. "I-I'm glad... glad to be the one you love.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) pressed closer to Ai in reaction. She lifted her head, attempting to lock lips with Ai and embrace her closer. "Mmm.." There was nothing at all that could hinder the level of comfort that she had at the moment. "Hold on.." She stated, one of her arms moving from behind Ai as she removed her sky blue contacts; she wanted Ai to see her actual eyes. Her pearl-like white eyes, displaying her blood allegiance with the Hokuma Clan, went along with her milky white skin tone, and her jet-black, as well as white hair.

It turned out that her white eyes accentuated her looks more than the eyes she had with contacts did. The girl looked up at Ai, seeking a reaction.* - Thu Dec  3 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) smiled even though there wasn't much of a reaction. She peered into Ai's irises... they were almost like an endless abyss that she could look into and forever get lost into. "Your eyes... they're.. captivating. Mine are just bland.. there's no vibrance to them." The black and white-haired Hokuma remarked. Her statement contrasted with her colorful wardrobe.* - Thu Dec  3 04:48:51 2015

She inspected it's contents with her only intentions being to attain the information that lie within it. The black and white-haired Hokuma looked up briefly to spectate the vicinity. Mizora then looked back down at the innards of the scroll, continuing to read about the technique that it provided information on.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) walked across the sand wearing her sandals. She slowly removed the scroll once more, peeling it open.

The girl closed the scroll, exhaling lightly.* - Thu Dec  3 21:13:36 2015

Mizora formed several handsigns, conducting Raiton-based chakra which coursed throughout the appendages of her thin fingers. From her fingers fired thin bolts of whiteish-blue current.* - Thu Dec  3 21:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) twisted her lips about and pressed them together, displeased with the results of her efforts. She formed multiple handsigns again and conducted yet another current of Raiton chakra to her hands. She threw her arms forth, extending them outward and firing off several tendrils of whiteish-blue chakra that zapped at the air and made an intense sizzling sound as they thrusted forward, only to fade from her sight soon after their quick-progression forth.* - Thu Dec  3 21:19:34 2015

The girl just had to keep on trying until she could finally get it right, she assumed. The black and white-haired Hokuma would run through a few handseals, showing off the dexterity that her hands had to offer. The girl ran Raiton chakra through her hands again, throwing her arms out once more as she fired off a series of whiteish-blue rays that flickered outward at a nice rate of acceleration!* - Thu Dec  3 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) yawned, cupping a hand over her mouth in boredom. No matter how many tries she gave at using the technique, none the less she was still insuccessful. The black and white-haired Hokuma slowly pressed her hands together vertically, forming several handsigns and coursing chakra kneaded into Raiton to her hands, at which point she extended her arms out agilely and shot multiple tendrils of whiteish-blue, thin bolts once more. Unfortunately they still didn't possess the power she felt they should.* - Thu Dec  3 21:35:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whimpered at the word 'hate'. Her arms lightly wrapped around Ai's shoulders. Her pair of big, pearl-like irises looked up to Ai. "I don't hate her... she just has... so many ways about her that I don't like. And she's dramatic... making a big deal out of stuff.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) looked over at Saika, easily capable of recognizing that aura of gloom. She once had it too. "What's your name, miss?"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) sighed.

"Mm... don't go somewhere popular if you want to seclude yourself from others. I won't leave you alone because you'll never climb out of that abyss of emotions of yours without help. Disliking people doesn't mean you won't talk to them, you know that yourself, or else you wouldn't have come to a ramen shop, where it's necessary to interact with staff if you want food."* - Sat Dec  5 00:21:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) leaned toward Ai, pecking her on the cheek.

"Mhm... something to take care of." She'd remark.* - Sat Dec  5 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) shrugged.

"Nevermind."

She began to leave briskly, heading for the village gates. She whispered something to Saika.* - Sat Dec  5 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: The solution to your negative emotions is love. Find it, and you'll be fine. - Sat Dec  5 00:30:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) stepped forth rather slowly. She formed handsigns at a rapid rate of momentum. She gathered a surge of chakra from the innards of her chakra pool. as the chakra piled toward her palms, she began to knead it into Raiton chakra. She stopped at a sufficient distance away from the abundance of people in the training field. The female thrusted her arms out in front of her.

Mizora allowed the Raiton chakra to thrust from her palms. Said chakra was in the form of a gathering of whtieish-blue tendrils of electric. A zapping and hissing sound resonated throughout the air. The bolts of lightning zig-zagged and thrusted forth at the area in front of her. The illuminated tendrils eventually dissipated from visage.* - Sat Dec  5 01:10:24 2015
