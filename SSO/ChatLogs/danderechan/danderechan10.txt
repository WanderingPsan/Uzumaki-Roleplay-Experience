<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Alright. - Sat Dec 12 22:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) huggled Ai closely.

"Mmmmm..."* - Sat Dec 12 22:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Mmm..~ - Sat Dec 12 22:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Nyaaa...~ - Sat Dec 12 22:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) rubbed the top of Ai's head. She'd clasp Ai's hands, urging her to reposition the both of them on the couch. Mizora would lay on her back, sprawling out and attempting to tug Ai on top of her.* - Sat Dec 12 22:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) moaned lightly. She embraced Ai, tugging her closer. Mizora's breasts pressed up against Ai's chest. The woman felt Ai's warmth immerse her frame, being stimulated and urged to do more.


"A-ah..."* - Sat Dec 12 22:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) threw her head back, her body tensing up as Ai pleased her in the ways that she yearned for, for two years. Mizora's arms remained loosely wrapped around Ai's frame, her fingers digging into her back. Once noticing what she was doing, Mizora would pry her own hands away, allowing her arms to fall to her sides. She closed her eyes, her mouth agape as she moaned lightly to her own senstiive spots.* - Sat Dec 12 22:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whimpered in pleasure as she felt Ai's knee. Her hands grasped at the sofa pillows. Her arms wrapped around Ai again, her fingers running through her hair. Mizora's moans grew a little louder, her breasts being fondled with and her neck being suckled upon. It was overwhelming, but also gratifying.

"Nnnh... feels... so good... "* - Sat Dec 12 23:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) frowned lightly when AI stopped, but none the less she coiled her arms around Ai and embraced her semi-tightly. "Injured or not.. you still know my sensitive spots..~" She'd murmur her response, then kiss Ai on the cheek. "I love you so much... and we can stop for now... you -do- need to rest up.."* - Sat Dec 12 23:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) felt her eyes widen. She looked to the left briefly, smiling shyly as she came clean. With a firm nod of confirmation she agree'd with Ai's statement.

"I was really worried... but... I realized that I had a daughter to take care of, and I couldn't just abandon her out of selfish anxiety. You had to do what you had to do...~"

Mizora's voice was soft and understanding. She had learned to stop herself from going anywhere near the amount of sadness she suffered from before she hit it off with Ai over the years. She cupped Ai's face between her hands, smiling brightly.

"There's no need to apologize for doing your job... and you're here in one piece right?" * - Sun Dec 13 00:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) ran her fingers through Ai's black locks. She smiled lightly, embracing Ai passionately.

"I love you so much, Ai... I'm so happy you're back.."* - Sun Dec 13 00:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Mmm..~ - Sun Dec 13 00:43:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) //

"Follow me."

She started to head off to the training fields.* - Sun Dec 13 16:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Okay, do you know the Mizubunshin and.. or Mizuame Nabara jutsus? - Sun Dec 13 16:45:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Okay, pay close attention. - Sun Dec 13 16:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) formed a couple handsigns in under a second. She spewed prematurely Suiton-kneaded chakra from her mouth in the form of water, which would initially appear as goop, but stretch and knead itself, manifesting a perfect clone of Mizora out of it's substance.

"This is the Mizubunshin no jutsu.. and this.." Mizora nodded toward the clone. Said clone formed three handsigns. The clone bent it's back, maintaining the last handsign as it puffed out it's chest and cheeks. From it's maw fired a thick, syrupy, sticky, translucent turquoise substance which would cloak the earth in front of it, spanning outward slowly and cloaking an eighth of the training field in the goopy, water-like substance.* - Sun Dec 13 16:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Is the Mizuame Nabara no Jutsu. - Sun Dec 13 16:48:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Actually... could you show me three taijutsu techniques rather than two? Trust me... it'll be worth it. The Mizubunshin no Jutsu is kind of... an advanced technique. - Sun Dec 13 16:50:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) sprinted forth, getting some momentum before she'd spin around. She threw her right leg out in a low-range strike, proceeding to yank her foot back and spin once more. Mizora would fire her left leg out after performing the gyration, aiming a bit higher then reeling said leg back and spinning once more.

She had already elevated off the ground, having built up inertia from the barrage of attacks. With the second last spin she kicked higher. She thrusted her right leg down, axe-kicking the air in front of her, having prematurely spun for the last time.* - Sun Dec 13 17:15:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Awesome! I've never sparred you before. This should be something.~ - Sun Dec 13 17:30:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) ran forward at a decent speed, her arms shooting to the earth as she balanced her body while firing a rapid, firm kick directed to the air, getting a feel for how she'd use the technique that was shown. She stood up straight once more, forming a 't' shaped handsign and producing a perfect replica of herself from a plume of smoke.

She positioned herself behind her clone, proceeding to leap off of the earth. Her clone did the same. While this activity looked silly to onlookers, it was more important than it appeared. The female attempted to align herself with the shadow clone, only to find that she didn't properly position herself in the right manner.

She and her shadow clone descent. She repositioned herself closer to the shadow clone, once more leaping into the air with it. This time she aligned herself with said clone nearly perfectly. It was a difficult technique to grasp, but one way or another she could've worked on mastering it.* - Sun Dec 13 17:31:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: I'm a bit rusty, go easy on me Kinami-san. - Sun Dec 13 17:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Sure. Lets move down a bit. There's babies over here. - Sun Dec 13 17:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: Right. - Sun Dec 13 17:32:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Not yet. - Sun Dec 13 17:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Was planning on laying down a little since nothing is going on around the village at the moment. - Sun Dec 13 17:36:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: What are your plans for today now? - Sun Dec 13 17:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: I wanted to master those two techniques as soon as possible, I'm not sure though. - Sun Dec 13 17:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Go ahead and master them sweetie. - Sun Dec 13 17:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Are you sure? - Sun Dec 13 17:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Mmmmhm. - Sun Dec 13 17:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: You're pretty quick, you'll finish them in no time. - Sun Dec 13 17:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: True.. - Sun Dec 13 17:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: I'll be back soon in that case. - Sun Dec 13 17:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Alright. - Sun Dec 13 17:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) pecked Ai on the cheek, before walking away.* - Sun Dec 13 17:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) accelerated forward. At a qucik rate of speed she would move to spin around and slam her foot into the bottom fo the boulder. She yasnked her leg back and spun again, kicking higher, then spinning again, only to kick even higher. Having built up inertia, she would spin one last time, performing an axe kick as she slammed her foot into the top of the boulder. She was holding back because she didn't want it to shatter.* - Sun Dec 13 17:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) continued to kick rapidly at the boulder. Though she had no problem with spinning like a ballerina, she pondere dif she could do the jutsu in another manner. She leaped back, then accelerated forth once more. This time, she didn't spin at all. Instead, she took a leap upward, kicking at the rock at a low range, then kicking at it with her other foot at a higher range, then using the foot she initially used for the highest. Her last attack was an axe-kick as usual, but the movement didn't seem as... fluid. It was stale, if anything.* - Sun Dec 13 17:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) ran forward at an expeditious rate of speed. She'd spin around, gliding across the sand with her feet then proceeding to whip her left leg outward. A whirlwind of sand pushed back around her as she smashed her foot into the rock, chipping it and forming a small crater where she struck near the bottom. She glided her heel across the rock's surface and spun once more, slamming her right heel into the medium-height surface of the boulder.

The Ryutou would gyrate once more, slamming her left leg directly into the boulder again and forming yet another crater as she did so near the top. Having gained inertia, the woman would perform one last spin, having stretched her right leg over her head and shot it down, axe kicking the boulder with great force behind the strike. The boulder cracked at the top in several places, but because she was holding back it didn't completely shatter.* - Sun Dec 13 18:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) formed a ' t'shaped handsign. From a plume of smoke emerged a kage bunshin. The kage bunshin and Mizora woudl shoot up into the air, moving high upright within it. After doing so, Mizora attempted to align herself with the bunshin. She -almost- aligned herself with the bunshin, until the bunshin strayed away while descending downward.

She and the bunshin landed on the ground in a crouched position. This technique was tough, but Mizora knew that she could manage to use it at it's full efficiency if she properly applied it. The girl would leap up into the air with her kage bunshinonce more, proceeding to align herself with it again. This time, she latched her arms around the kage bunshin, keeping it in place!

Mizora broke away from her bunshin, landing on the ground in a crouched position again. This was getting very tedious, to her in the very least. None the less, she had to keep trying or she would be unable to get anywhere with her efforts. The female would leap up along with her bunshin, aiming to align herself once more!

She and the bunshin would continue to ascend high in the air head-first. Having been close enough to the kage bunshin, Mizora would latch onto it, wrapping her arms around it. Normally, this would've been premature to Front Lotus or Peregrine Falcon Drop, but none the less she knew neither of them, and she was sure she could break her neck trying to use them. The girl broke from the kage bunshin, landing on the ground in a crouched position!* - Sun Dec 13 18:16:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) looked at the pills.

<Eh..?>* - Sun Dec 13 18:48:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) pecked Ai on the cheek, cotninuing to snuggle with her.* - Sun Dec 13 18:58:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) kissed Ai's forehead. "I got back awihle ago..~"* - Sun Dec 13 19:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Ooooh? I seeeeee..~ - Sun Dec 13 19:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Finish with your training? - Sun Dec 13 19:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mhm. - Sun Dec 13 19:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I see. - Sun Dec 13 19:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Climb up. - Sun Dec 13 19:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) crawled atop Ai, looking down at her with a smile, her cheeks red.* - Sun Dec 13 19:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) shrugged her shoulders lightly, smiling at Ai. "I'm feeling good, how about you?" She'd question, seemingly curious of Ai's physical condition due to the messiness of her hair and lack of tidiness within her current wardrobe.* - Sun Dec 13 19:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) simply smiled lightly before she leaned downward and embraced Ai tightly, cuddling up against her affectionately. Her breasts squished up against Ai's chest, her body practically fitting with Ai's. Her eyes closed as she intended to press Ai's lips to hers, grinding up against her lightfully, as well as playfully. "You're so warm.." She'd remark, immersed in Ai's body heat and the blankets' heat.* - Sun Dec 13 19:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) slipped her tongue into Ai's mouth, looping her tongue around Ai's. Her arms slowly lowered as she lightly clenched Ai's butt, while intimately kissing Ai. She'd recognize Ai's submissiveness, proceeding to slide partially off of Ai's form. One of her hands glided along Ai's hips to her groin. Mizora lightly glided the tip of her pointer finger along what she'd assume to be Ai's member, while gazing at her tauntingly.* - Sun Dec 13 20:16:48 2015
