<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) shrugged lightly. She readjusted her own position so that she was laying next to Ai.

"It's your decision.. but it'd be safer for you to sit out.."* - Sat Nov 21 00:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Mhm. Rather not have Mizora crying for me. - Sat Nov 21 00:51:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) snuggled against Ai's form, her arms wrapping around Ai. The black-haired girl bit her lower lip when Ai began nuzzling her nose into her bosom. Mizora couldn't pick up on Ai's necessity for comfort; doing this out of desire for close contact with her lover.* - Sat Nov 21 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) squirmed a bit, showing her astonishment. "Mmmnnh.." She uttered while her pair of large breasts practically smothered Ai. Her right hand stroked at the back of Ai's head. The black-haired girl attempted to lure Ai into a new position, where she'd be on top, while Mizora was laying on her own back against the sofa's surface.* - Sat Nov 21 01:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) had her arms wrapped around Ai's shoulders. She looked up to her, smiling genuinely. She pressed herself against the couch when Ai clutched hold of her sensitive breasts. A shade of red immersed her face and her smile quickly became one of nervousness.* - Sat Nov 21 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) eagerly ascended her head, nibbling on Ai's lip in return to her action. Her embrace on Ai tightened. The black-haired female was allured by Ai's actions, her face flushed with expectation and even glee to an extent. A soft moan exited Mizora's mouth.* - Sat Nov 21 02:34:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) entered the training grounds with a nonchalant look on her face. The female broke into the typical Gentle Fist stance, though her gauze-covered hands were balled into tight fists. Slowly, a bright green illumination from beneath the gauze near where her knuckles emanated. She slid her left leg back, bending her right knee. The Hokuma suddenly rushed forth, thrusting her leg upward as she kicked the air rapidly.

Mizora thrusted her right leg out in the momentum of a jab, then pulled her leg back, her sole slamming against the ground. Without delay her other leg shot up, as she pivoted on her sole and kicked the air. The black and white-haired female continued to kick at the air in the same manner, though she seemed to be attempting to quicken her pace. With no avail to her attempts, she simply continued to kick.* - Sun Nov 22 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) ended the barrage of kicks with one sidekick, before slamming her foot to the ground and leaping back on her soles.* - Sun Nov 22 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) bent her knees. She looked forth intensely, then she rushed forward eagerly. She pivoted on her foot when she neared the wall. Mizora then proceeded to thrust her left leg out, smashing the heel of her foot directly into the wall. With the force provided, a wide crater was left where she struck. Seeing that her full power wasn't enough to do the damage that she figured it would do, this was her perrfect training "partner".* - Sun Nov 22 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) slowly removed her boots. She placed said boots on the sand off on the sidelines, then she backed up, hopping freely. The Hokuma lunged forward, thrusting her right leg upright. Even though it was partially bent, she still kicked the wall, leaving an imprint of her sole. She pulled her leg back, bending it then extending it outward as she pressed her sole to the floor.* - Sun Nov 22 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) whispers: Bend over and cough. -omit- - Sun Nov 22 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) smiled lightly; this training proving to be beneficial to her. Mizora bent her knees a little more, attempting to balance her stancing. She extended her left leg out, kicking off the earth and accelerating forth, thrusting her right leg outward when she was a sufficient distance from the wall. With pure strength alone she drove her foot through the crater, piercing the wall at least three feet deep before her foot coming to a standstill. She yanked her leg out from the wall, sitting on the earth and swiping sand off of her foot.

Mizora placed her boots back on, then she stood back up, sliding her hands across her ass to remove any sand on it. The Hokuma then began to exit the training fields.* - Sun Nov 22 05:39:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) extended her right hand out, intending to place it upon Izanami's head, then continue to whisper with a small smile.* - Sun Nov 22 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: I'll be here for you if you need me. Maybe I can treat you to some food sometime around, just ask me and the deed'll be done. - Sun Nov 22 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see. I suppose that's expected. - Sun Nov 22 06:44:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) slipped her hand away from Izanami's head, leaving after murmuring one last whisper.* - Sun Nov 22 06:46:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: o-oh...umm..a-alright - Sun Nov 22 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) bent her knees, sliding her left leg back, her heel elevated off of the earth as she leaned forward. She rushed forth, chakra swarming to her forearms.

The black and white-haired Hokuma started off with none other than a basic palm strike directed for the region of Paine's side from Mizora's right palm. 
Almost without delay, her left arm flung outward, her second strike aimed for Paine's other side.

(17 Attack Speed)* - Sun Nov 22 21:26:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I was kinda holding back what I can actually do. - Sun Nov 22 21:36:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Mmhm. - Sun Nov 22 21:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) seemed to immediately have her actions defied by Paine's performance. None the less, when Mizora thought that she could make a counter with her left hand, that was immediately trumped as well. Before she could react she was tripped by Paine's leg sweep. If there was no followup to this leg sweep, Mizora's only intentions were to allow the chakra to fade from around her hands as she produced the Ram handsign, intending to speed away from Paine.

The only that was going through her mind was the fact that Paine seemed to be as impressive as she observed in earlier spars that she was involved in. She barely maintained footing, mainly because she was dizzy from performing the Shunshin technique in such a small frame of time no less.

<I... can't do that again.. nor will I have the opportunity to hold back anymore.>* - Sun Nov 22 21:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) inhaled, then exhaled. Her right hand jabbed to her left forearm, unraveling bandages to expose an odd pair of gloves. She did the same with her left hand to her right arm, exposing a matching pair of gloves. Mizora extended her legs out under, bending them slightly and allowing chakra to swarm her left, open-hand, the back of her palm close to her chin.

Her right arm was extended outward, and balled into a tight fist, while slightly stretched. Her sky blue eyes were set upon Paine. "I'll be going all out quicker than I thought." She'd state. The green gems on each glove near where her outer knuckles would be while wearing them shined brightly. Fuuton-based chakra immersed the gloves.

She slid her left leg back then lunged forth eagerly, throwing her right arm forth while extending her left arm out as well. She intended to simply jab with her right fist, while with her left hand she rapidly thrusted forth, her left arm moving as though it was a rapier. This was honestly her first time doing this in combat, but none the less it was a seemingly perfect combination of Strong Fist and Gentle Fist thrown into one fighting style; Switch Fist.* - Sun Nov 22 21:58:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) clenched her teeth as her fist collided with Paine's. She skid backward, suddenly being confronted by Paine's intense speed. Reluctantly, the female was able to track her movement.

She definitely didn't have enough time to perform the Revolving Heaven technique! With quick thinking her left hand shot to her stomach region, her open palm remaining there as though she intended to catch the foot directed to her stomach.

She knew that her opponent trumped her in taijutsu, thus it'd be costly if she didn't take the opportunity. The moment Paine was in close enough distance Mizora would thrust her right arm outward, her chakra-infused, gloved fist aiming to punch Paine in the cheek.

In the meantime, Mizora's left hand intended to pump chakra into the female's foot, aiming to debillitate her leg with the pulsing chakra. This would only be possible if she'd managed to block the attack, even if it managed to damage her hand in the process.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) was kicked by every last attack, being debillitated by each. Blood gushed from her mouth, but none the less she was getting even more exilerated from this fight. She didn't wanna take -too- much damage to be damaged beyond the ability of repair, or inability to fight. Mizora perceived Paine's movement well, but the problem was that she had -such- little windows of opening.

Her only advantages were when Paine wasn't doing consecutive attacks in small time frames. She hoped that she'd gain a few more windows of opening like that, practically hoping her foe didn't notice this yet. When the moment of Paine's inteniton to elbow her in the back came around. Mizora twisted her body in midair with difficulty, not being a specialist of aerial combat but still doing the minimum she could.

She aimed to whip her body around, lashing her left leg out with intentions of thrashing her heel into Paine's side, if not  the arm that was being used for the elbow strike. If her hit landed, hopefully it would've created some distance. Mizora would try to remove an indigo pill from the confines of her jacket and gulp it down as she sustained her resistance while falling from the air at the same time.* - Sun Nov 22 23:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) was struck by the elbow shot regardless, being hit in the rib cage and sent shooting toward the ground. Mizora slam into the ground on her stomach, standing up slowly while coughing up some blood. It was at this time she'd attempt to consume the healing pill.

The Hokuma tried to stand to her feet, though she was barely on them. She peered at Paine. She slowly got into her stance once more, halfway exhausted from this fight.

<I might have to start using Ninjutsu... unless that's not a good enough crutch.. to fall back on.>* - Sun Nov 22 23:47:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I've been doing okay. Today's another dull day, though. - Sun Nov 22 23:51:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Right? - Sun Nov 22 23:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) allowed her arms to fall and dangle at her sides. She stood up straight, nodding. The chakra immersing one of her hands had faded away, as she uncoiled the one fist she had tightened. Mizora nodded, still breathing mildly.

"Yeah, sure. Good fight.." The Hokuma said with a small smile. The pain immersing her body was slowly letting up from the pill she consumed. She wiped the blood from her chin and lips. <Ugh.. I wonder how many bones I broke..>* - Sun Nov 22 23:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) allowed the chakra flowing to her eyes to fade, the sky blue contacts concealing her actual eyes dimming abit. She returned the genuine smile.

"I will. Thanks for the spar." She'd state, sighing lightly.

"Mmm... I'm gonna visit the hospital." She started heading to the hospital.* - Mon Nov 23 00:06:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) lay on the bed, moaning in pain a little bit. She returned the affection by attempting to get in a quick kiss when Ai aimed to peck her lips.

"That... was an intense turn of events." She remarked.* - Mon Nov 23 00:16:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Okay. - Mon Nov 23 00:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) //

Nurse came in and began to patch her up, applying bandages and what not.

She was discharged, willingly of course.* - Mon Nov 23 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Er.. - Mon Nov 23 00:55:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov 23 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) was picked up bridal-style. She giggled lightly, before pressing her head to Ai's chest and scrunching up against her as much as possible, obviously exhausted.* - Mon Nov 23 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Strip down. - Mon Nov 23 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: H-huh? - Mon Nov 23 01:06:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) thinks: He wants to do -that- when I'm injured..? Nnnh.... - Mon Nov 23 01:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) slowly but surely removed her double-pair of gloves, as well as the gauzse around them, in addition to her orange-zippered jacket. She was only wearing a black, open jacket, as well as a pair of pants, with maroon underwear at this point. She sat on the edge of the bed, her face a shade of maroon.* - Mon Nov 23 01:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) couldn't help but raise a brow in confusion. None the less she removed her black pair of pants, as well as her jacket. Lastly, she unhooked her bra and panties, exposing her soft, supple-looking breasts for Ai to feast her eyes upon. Mizora's legs were pressed together, as she remained sitting on the side of the bed. The girl slowly scooched up onto the bed completely, laying on her lean stomach to expose her not to big or too small butt.

<I'm so cold right now...> She thought to herself, stuffing her face upon a white pillow. Her palms rested on the sides of the object.* - Mon Nov 23 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) arched her back forth, biting her lower lip when Ai kissed the centre of her back. "O-Oh.." She stuttered, her voice muffled by her face in the pillow. Mizora buried her face deeper in the pillow, being soothed by Ai rubbing her body down with what she assumed to be lotion.

"I have no problem with it.." She said, lifting her head out of the pillow as she practically gave Ai permission to continue. She remained sprawled out, laying on her belly. There wasn't a single blemish or mark to impair the softness of her pale, slightly-tanned skin. Her body shuddered slightly whenever Ai ran her hands over one of the many curves of her frame.* - Mon Nov 23 01:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) couldn't help but smile at Ai's comment.

<I already expected it..>

She started to giggle lowly, but that was suddenly cut off by the pressure applied to her shoulders. Her shoulders tensed up, before untensing. She let out a small moan of pleasure. "Nnh... that feels... so... good..." The black and white-haired Hokuma said between huffs of pleasure, her chin resting on the pillow while her hands dug into it.

"O..oh.. my.... nnhhhh.. d-deeper.." Her moans grew greater in volume and reflection upon how much she was truly enjoying this.* - Mon Nov 23 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) practically cringed at the pleasure that was emanating from her frame. She twisted and writhed on the bed, her medium-volume moans slowly becoming louder. Her mouth remained agape and her eyes were slammed shut. The irresistible feelings made her not want Ai to stop.

"A..Ahn... m-motto.."* - Mon Nov 23 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) writhed a little more, clenching the pillow tightly in her fists. She'd sink her head into the pillow, breathing lightly but loudly. "Nnh... s-so good.." She said in a muffled tone. The sweat coming off of her body was hard to identify in parts of it that wasn't already covered in the odd lotion. * - Mon Nov 23 04:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) rolled onto her back, remaining sprawled across the surface of the bed. Her left leg was bent and the sole of her left foot was pressed to the side of her right ankle, giving decent sight of the pink, shaved region between her pair of curvaceous, well-proportioned legs. "Five.. out of five.." Mizora said, heaving lightly though frequently.

She shifted her head over to Ai and smiled a genuine smile.

"Wow.."* - Mon Nov 23 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Thank you.. - Mon Nov 23 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) thinks: I shouldn't have laid on my back should I? - Mon Nov 23 04:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: No problem.~ - Mon Nov 23 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Ya should probably wash it off of ya.~ - Mon Nov 23 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mmmm.. I should..  infact... - Mon Nov 23 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) slowly slid out of the bed, roaming through the drawers for sufficient clothing; pajamas. She roamed over to the bathroom door, heading on in.* - Mon Nov 23 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) turned the nozzles, allowing the steaming hot water to flow freely down upon her, drenching every last inch of her body. She ran her hands down her frame, admiring her curves briefly with her eyes closed and a look of bliss on her face. She soon noticed what she was doing, and stopped. Picking up the bar of soap, as well as the pink cloth on one of the bars of iron below the shower head, she began to scrub her body down.

Cleansing herself of the 'lotion', in addition of any dirt or sweat that brought filth to her body, she scrubbed herself down then washed the water off, ringing her rag out. She then washed her hair with a cherry blossom-scented shampoo, as well as a scent-matching conditioner, before washing her hair off and exiting the shower. She coiled her pink towel around her frame, tucking it in so it wouldn't fall free. With a bounce from her every step, she exited the bathroom.* - Mon Nov 23 04:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) left the bathroom with a pink towel concealing most of her torso, save for her cleavage and her lower hips. She'd roam throughout the drawers, placing the pajamas back in and bringing forth a simple white blouse. The female folded up her towel after removing it, pulling the blouse on. The black-and-white haired Hokuma entered the bathroom once more with towel-in hand, exiting shortly after without it. She sat on the edge of the bed, picking up a comb and beginning to run it through her head with a handheld mirror in her grasp. She shifted her head to observe the results.* - Mon Nov 23 04:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) finished combing through her hair, even though the action was pretty useless since she was about to fall asleep. She checked what she could do with her hair briefly, before running her hands through it and finally sliding into the bed without distracting Ai's rest. Mizora scooted toward Ai, coiling her arms around her and snuggling close to her; the Hokuma's head buried into Ai's bosom as she too began to fall asleep.* - Mon Nov 23 05:10:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mm.... - Tue Nov 24 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mmmm... that's.. not good. - Tue Nov 24 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: He withdraw'd. - Tue Nov 24 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) twisted her finger around a bundle of Ai's hair, releasing it. Her hand drifted to Ai's head, beginning to stroke it. Mizora looked down at her with a small smile, her other partially clenched hand resting on her cheek.

"I'm half and half with not knowing you went into battle until you returned.. I would've been worried sick if I knew.. and on the other hand I don't know what I would've done if something happened to you.."* - Tue Nov 24 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) averted her gaze, looking to the left. The chakra flowing to her eyes faded. She removed her hand from the top of Ai's hand.

"Yeah..." She muttered. The unappealing factor of shinobi life for her was that she never knew when her loved ones were guarantee'd to die.* - Tue Nov 24 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) jumped a bit, not noticing she'd disregarded Ai. She looked down, smiling half-heartedly. "I'm not depressed.. I just got.. lost on a train of thought. Sorry.."* - Tue Nov 24 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mmm.....hmm.. - Tue Nov 24 05:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Alright. - Tue Nov 24 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: If you want to talk about something, don't be afraid to talk with me. - Tue Nov 24 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) cuddled up against Ai, snuggling close to her. It appeared she didn't want to talk anymore.

"G'night.."* - Tue Nov 24 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) pressed the tips of all of her digits together, gathering white-ish blue Raiton chakra to her hands. The kneaded essence coursed between her gauze-covered hands. The sheer intensity, coupled with the volume of the chakra being manifested, allowed the chakra to become visible in the form of a flickering blue-outlined, otherwise white sphere of compressed electricity. Sparks flickered around the circumference of the sphere.

"Lightning Ball!"

Mizora allowed her fingers to part, pointing the front of her hands forth to the vicinity in front of her. She released the sphere of lightning from her palms, watching as it fired off, moving at a momentum that she assumed was sufficient for her experience with Ninjutsu. The sphere of Raiton-composed chakra pressed against the earthen, dull-ish brown wall. The black and white haired Hokuma allowed her sky blue eyes to fall to a narrow, observing as the ball grinded against the earth, the raw friction of it's collision with the wall enough to grind a small part of the wall to dirt, leaving a very small crater.

Otherwise, the lightning sphere basically dissipated with contact.* - Tue Nov 24 22:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) exhaled lightly after noticing the inefficient results of her use of the Lightning Ball technique. Mizora stood up straight from her focused stance; her knees were bent and she was leaning forward some. Mizora began pushing her hair back with her pointer finger. She slowly strolled toward the exit of the training fields.

The white and black-haired Hokuma pondered where she could go next for Raiton assistance. She already intended to go to Sanoke for assistance with Fuuton, maybe even Suiton. Mizora sauntered upon the light-brown pathways of sand that lead her back to the courtyard.* - Tue Nov 24 23:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm? What is that a topic that strikes fear into your heart? - Tue Nov 24 23:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) came into the courtyard. She looked about briefly, identifying those that she was familiar with. Mizora walked about, coming to a stop beside Ai. She addressed Ai with a small nod and a smile, followed by a low murmur.* - Tue Nov 24 23:05:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: It's a long one, it's about a boy.~ - Wed Nov 25 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) quirked a brow. The story pique'd her interest. She scooched up into Ai's lap, not facing her. The back of Mizora's head rested upon her chest.

"Nope.. part two." She was a delightful listener.* - Wed Nov 25 00:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) was hit by a wave of realization. Her head raised as she attempted to look up at Ai.

"Does.. the boy.. happen to be you?' The black and white-haired Hokuma questioned, flabbergasted by the density of this story and the emotions that lie behind it. It captivated her attention.* - Wed Nov 25 01:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) turned around to face Ai. Her face was engulfed with several emotions; pity, genuine understanding and sadness coupled together. Her arms coiled around Ai as she scooched closer to her, pressing her head to Ai's chest. Mizora spewed words from her mouth without thinking, and it was only til'after that she may've interpreted how Ai would've took them.

"I'm.. sorry.." She whispered; a few moments of silence from her. "I'm sorry that you've had to go through what you've dealt with. But.." Mizora lifted her face from her chest, her right hand pressing to Ai's cheek softly. The corners of her glossy lips curved upright, though her eyes were watery, as though she was holding back tears, tears that came from hearing such a sad 'story', which wasn't just a story, but the life of her lover.

"I.. won't abandon you.."* - Wed Nov 25 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) nodded.

"If it comes to the point I'll resign from being a kunoichi again so there's less risk of me dying. I want to see you happy."* - Wed Nov 25 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: ---.. - Wed Nov 25 02:24:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: As do I...I'm here for you...To protect you...I want to assist you..Through thick and thin you know...I love you so much..I'll do as much as I can for you. - Wed Nov 25 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) leaned forward, kissing Ai affectionately on the lips.* - Wed Nov 25 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) kept her lips locked with Ai's for a few more intimate moments, before pulling back, looking up to her.

"Want to stay like this..?" She was referring to the way they were hugged up against eachother.* - Wed Nov 25 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) nodded, having honestly forgot. "Mhm... let's do that then." She'd state, breaking away from Ai and standing up.

"Mmmmm... start up the water and get comfortable.. I'll come in soon."* - Wed Nov 25 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) mentally prepared herself. She stripped down, before heading into the bathroom.* - Wed Nov 25 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) approached the bath tub bare naked. She settled down across from Ai, only the upper half of her head visible. Her face was clearly red. Despite the fact that she'd mentally prepared herself for this, she was still a little anxious.* - Wed Nov 25 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) flushed a little more from Ai's comment. Mizora lifted the lower half of her own head from the water. "Thanks.." She was slowly relaxing abit more..* - Wed Nov 25 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) stood on her knees in the bath, scooching forward.

"The water's great.. turn around." She'd state, squeezing out some shampoo onto her hands.* - Wed Nov 25 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) glided her hands along Ai's bundles of hair, her fingers coursing through her hair and scrubbing the soap in.

"After we're out I'll blow dry your hair for you.."* - Wed Nov 25 03:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) continued running her hands along Ai's hair, taking note of how stubborn it was, despite it's soft exterior. Mizora applied a little extra strength in an effort to straighten out her hair, but not too much to cause pain.

"Wow.. I see why you were having so much trouble.." She remarked. The Hokuma rested against Ai while continuing to cleanse her hair and attempt to straighten it, her breasts pressing against her back. The girl wasn't even aware that she'd done it.* - Wed Nov 25 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) "Huh..?" She stated, suddenly noticing that her breasts were pressed against Ai's back. She lurched back, stretching her arms out. The black and white-haired Hokuma continued to scrub at Ai's hair. She eventually allowed her hand to glide over to the handheld shower head, rinsing the soap from Ai's hair.

'Sorry.." She murmured, her face flushed red.* - Wed Nov 25 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) raised her brows. She nodded lightly, "O.. okay." She stated, scooching forward and hugging up against Ai.

"Can you wash my hair now..?" She asked.* - Wed Nov 25 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) turned around, still sitting in Ai's lap.* - Wed Nov 25 04:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) tensed up her msucles as she felt what she figured was poking her back. "E-Er..." She murmured, staying quiet otherwise. She planned on enduring it until Ai finished washing her hair.* - Wed Nov 25 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) shut her eyes as well, pressing her back against Ai and schooching a little closer. She bit her lip as she felt Ai's member press against her more. She was oddly relaxed, though. The girl slowly felt her consciousness shifting away from her, and before she knew it she was silently asleep in close proximity to Ai.* - Wed Nov 25 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: I'm worried.. - Wed Nov 25 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hey. - Thu Nov 26 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: I-I can't fight that..e-either.. - Thu Nov 26 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) arrived at the vicinity where she scanned a plethora of Sunagakure shinobi in the southern area of the village. Her eyes went agape when she noticed that Ai appeared to be fighting with fellow comrades. She wasn't sure what to do in this situation, as getting involved could get her caught in the crossfire. The girl pressed her back against the wall nervously, biting her own lower lip.

<Can I even help..?> Mizora would think to herself. She pressed her lips together, looking distressed. The black and white-haired Hokuma had never seen her like this; she was on all fours and... even feral to an extent. The monstrousity of chakra immersing Ai's form intimidated her. 

"A-Ai! Snap out of it, please!" She exclaimed without a second thought, resisting her immense urge to run in and stop this physically.* - Thu Nov 26 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: This again.. - Thu Nov 26 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: K-Kazekage-san...is so s-strong.. - Thu Nov 26 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) thinks: ... What is he doing!? Is he trying to kill him..? - Thu Nov 26 01:24:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: I-Is she fine? - Thu Nov 26 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) crouched down, embracing Ai.

"I don't know what happened... but.. don't harm eachother anymore. We're all comrades." Mizora murmured.* - Thu Nov 26 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: I only do your wishes Hassan. - Thu Nov 26 02:10:33 2015
