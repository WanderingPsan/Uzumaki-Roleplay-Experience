"I'm glad I stayed awake.."* - Wed Dec  9 05:08:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) shifted her pearl-like gaze over to her daughter, sharing the same genuine smile. It seemed the little girl inherited her beautiful voice.

"Oh really? What was your decision?" Another inquiry followed, but it was much more important; to Mizora at least.* - Wed Dec  9 21:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mm.. in that case when you're a little older I'll start training you. I'm sure daddy will, too. - Wed Dec  9 21:09:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) approached the kitchen while speaking in a slightly louder voice. "Anything you'd like in specific? Takoyaki, ramen, dumplings..?"* - Wed Dec  9 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) nodded lightly. Mizora would put on a white apron that fit to her form, before she pulled out a big bowl and several ingredients. She sifted sugar, salt, baking powder and flour in the large bowl.

In another bowl for the wet ingredients, she whisked one egg, as well as a decent amount of butter and milk too.

She poured the bowl with whisked up eggs, butter and milk into the first bowl. In the mean time she placed a skillet on the stove, oiling up the inside and letting it heat for five minutes. While waiting out the minutes she added a few extra ingredients to enhance the flavor of the pancakes, while maintaining a certain degree to said ingredients for the sake of not causing any risk to Ketsuki when she consumed what Mizora was making.

She added batter to the inside of the skillet, allowing it to cook. The female placed a few chocolate chips on the two partially cooked pancakes, allowing them to cook over the stove. She'd take out a plate, as well as a plastic spork. Once the two pancakes she made were done, she used a spatula to remove them from the skillet, placing them on the plate and drizzling them in syrup.

One pancake was half the size of the other, the half-sized one being atop the full. She left the kitchen, placing down the plate of syrupy, chocolate-chip having pancakes on the dining room table. "Breakfast's ready.~" Mizora briefly re-entered the kitchen, cleansing any dishes that she used, and cleaning up her mess. The black-haired female settled down back on the couch, her soft, small hands clasping together.

It seemed she was deep in thought.* - Wed Dec  9 21:50:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) wrapped herself up in the blanket, folding her legs and resting on the couch, stretched out across it. She'd wave Ketsuki on over. "Come and cuddle, Ketsuki-chan.~"* - Wed Dec  9 22:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) ran her fingers through her daughter's hair, embracing her and pulling her into a close snuggle beneath the blanket.* - Wed Dec  9 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) giggled abit. "I love you too, Ketsuki-chan.~ Your father's always busy because he has a more important job as mine. He's higher-ranked than I am, you see." She'd remark.* - Wed Dec  9 22:59:24 2015
