<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Not like you asked for a sperm donation or something. - Sat Dec  5 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: ... Sperm donation? - Sat Dec  5 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: It's this weird thing. - Sat Dec  5 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Did someone ask..? - Sat Dec  5 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Kiyoko asked me if Sanoke could donate sperm so her and her girlfriend could have a kid. - Sat Dec  5 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) was half-surprised half-understanding of the situation. Though, this mention reminded her of her past interactions with Mirai; she was always talking about something. Mizora lifted her head, moving forward and attempting to embrace her closely.

"That's.. a pretty silly thing to ask."

The black and white-haired female remarked, her voice weakening momentarily. She was restraining herself from crying out of guilt for what she said; she was completely unaware she had such toxic in her own words. It was evident that she'd already teared up.

"I'll try not to misinterpret things anymore."* - Sat Dec  5 04:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: They want Ai to donate. - Sat Dec  5 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: --- - Sat Dec  5 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) embraced Mizora tighter, though it was involuntary. She loosened up and pulled away completely. "Sorry... just.. the thought.." The black and white-haired female drifted her pearl gaze to the ground.

"I really hope she doesn't think that's happening.."* - Sat Dec  5 04:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: -Mirai*- - Sat Dec  5 04:33:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I thought she asked you. - Sat Dec  5 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Maybe they are close friends or something. - Sat Dec  5 04:35:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Excuse me? - Sat Dec  5 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) neared Ai, embracing her tightly.* - Sat Dec  5 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Hehe, not too tight, you might break me.~ - Sat Dec  5 04:47:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiko(Lostlolidragon) says: Did you ever get my letter? - Sat Dec  5 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: Let's go home so you can rest up. - Sat Dec  5 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Aye.~ - Sat Dec  5 04:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) clasped Ai's hand, guiding her from the location of the arena.* - Sat Dec  5 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Meeow.~ - Sat Dec  5 04:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) stroked the top of Ai's head. Her back rested on the board of the bed. She was practically guiding Ai to rest her head in her lap, subliminally of course.* - Sat Dec  5 04:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) pressed her fingertips to Ai's head, giving her a head massage. Mizora smiled down upon her, her pearl-like irises never seeming to drift from her.* - Sat Dec  5 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) immersed her hand in chakra. With a few brief pokes she revitalized Ai's chakra system with Gentle Fist. She allowed the flow of chakra to halt directly after. "Are you hungry?"* - Sat Dec  5 05:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Um.. are you okay? I thought what I did before when you got exhausted like this would work. - Sat Dec  5 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) was concerned for Ai's well being at this point. It was odd. Her pupils became more distinctive, and veins protruded beneath her pearl-gaze. She attempted to designate just what was wrong with Ai, chakra-wise. None the less, she couldn't find anything, and thus the veins faded as quick as they appeared. Her pupils became less discernable in addition.* - Sat Dec  5 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) clutched Ai's sides as though she was a cat, lifting her up and resting her so that her face was closer to Mizora's. The white and black haired female leaned forward, kissing her on the forehead.* - Sat Dec  5 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) coiled her arms around Ai lightly, allowing the female's head to rest within her bosom. One of her hands clenched her butt briefly. "Your body's so feminine.." She remarked.* - Sat Dec  5 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) nodded. Some may have considered this appalling, but to Mizora it was intriguing. Her fingers ran through Ai's locks of hair. "Mm.. you got the best of both worlds, gender-wise." She'd state, referring to Ai's assets, as well as her member. The girl began to stroke Ai's head again with one hand, while the other continued to toy around with her silky bundles of black hair.* - Sat Dec  5 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) lit up like a tomato. "Well.. I wouldn't say -owe-. Let's just relax for tonight." She stated, pulling the blankets on the bed over herself and Ai. With the position Mizora was in, she'd be comfortable regardless if Ai moved.* - Sat Dec  5 06:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) began to fall asleep as soon as she noticed that Ai did; she wanted to make sure that she could rest.* - Sat Dec  5 06:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: When? - Sat Dec  5 18:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: She is coming back right? - Sat Dec  5 18:52:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Let's act like this is the Chuunins. - Sat Dec  5 18:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Crimson Cresent(Crimson Cresent) thinks: Don't tell hideo. But, Kick his ass Momu. - Sat Dec  5 18:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-Are you sure? - Sat Dec  5 18:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Yes. . .I owe you that much. - Sat Dec  5 18:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) thinks: Oh she's going to go in on bro's face... I hope he's ready. - Sat Dec  5 18:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) formed a multitude of handsigns, her forearms bent. She'd proceed to extend them out, allowing whiteish-blue Raiton based chakra to shoot from her palms in the form of tendrils of electricity that illuminated her relative area and made a consistent zapping noise as it danced across the air in a zig-zag sense pattern.* - Sat Dec  5 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) bent her knees, throwing her arms back. She thrusted forth, proceeding to glide up the wall. Rather than using the surface-walking technique, she was relying on her pure stature in hand-to-hand combat. The female bounded off of the earth, backflipping throughout the air and whipping three kunai knives forth. 
Mizora formed several handsigns, producing a current of whiteish-blue tendrils of Raiton from her palms, which trailed far behind the kunai knives, moving at half the speed of the weaponry. Mizora twirled throughout the air, her back curved slightly. She landed in a crouched position, bending her knees as she pressed her fingers together and produced a sphere of whiteish-blue lightning, firing off said sphere.* - Sat Dec  5 19:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) exhaled lightly. She'd enough of training this technique for now. Mizora retreated to the wall, leaning against it as she sat down on the sand. The blacka nd white-haired female pulled out a scroll, proceeding to peel it open. Almost like a sponge, the prodigy began to absorb the information that was provided by what was written within the scroll.* - Sat Dec  5 19:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) removed her scroll. She placed it within the confines of her clothing. The black and white-haired girl stood up, clasping her hands together. She built up a rather significant plume of chakra; but that was only because she could. Using her monstrous levels of chakra reserves, she kneaded her chakra into Raiton and immersed the neabry air around her with several zapping, whiteish-blue sparks.* - Sat Dec  5 19:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) discerned the level of Raiton chakra that was displayed around her. It wasn't sufficient enough, and not only that, but she also drained more chakra than she intended. None the less, she still had lakes-full of chakra within her system, so naturally she could continue. Mizora clasped her hands together again, surgfing her chakra as she built it up to knead into Raiton. Thin sparks of whiteish blue lightning jolted around her again.* - Sat Dec  5 19:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: I-I see... - Sat Dec  5 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: I cannot hold back. - Sat Dec  5 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) peered over at the pair of individuals. The girl opened up the scroll. From that point she read the information once more, interpreting it as precise as she could. Mizora would roll up the scroll, throwing it into the confines of her clothing. She was easily capable of acknowledging the fact that she had managed to learn to use the technique at full efficiency. However, she could only use it like a newbie for now.* - Sat Dec  5 19:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) formed the Ram handsign. Shortly after, the doujutsu wielder became more attuned with her surroundings. She gained three hundred and sixty degree vision, in addition to limited ability to not just sense a wide range, but also -see-. In addition, veins protruded beneath her eyes, and her pupils became more distinctive to those that looked at them.* - Sat Dec  5 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) allowed chakra to swamp her left hand. Her right hand was balled into a fist, while her left was simply a palm. She stretched her legs out, distancing htem from one another as she extended her right arm out in front of her, the knuckles to her left hand near her chin while her left arm was more bent. Her right arm was slightly bent.* - Sat Dec  5 19:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Heheheh I need more stamina. . . . I get tired too fast. . .  - Sat Dec  5 19:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) formed several handsigns rapidly upon seeing that this idiot of a girl decided she wanted to slam someone's head into the ground from several feet into the air. The girl allowed a thick flood of syrupy liquid to exit her mouth, cloaking the ground beneath their location. The liquid itself was highly unmalleable, meaning it was unable to be pierced. The specified form of the liquid was far too gelatin-like to be hard to land on. At the very least it prevented Hiroshi further injury from such an attack that was performed recently.

Mizora simply addressed Momura with a displeased frown at this point.* - Sat Dec  5 19:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Oww. . .Damn. . You hit hard Momu. - Sat Dec  5 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) approached Momura, jetting her right arm out with intentions of socking Momura in the jaw. "Try that again, I dare you."* - Sat Dec  5 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: You lack common sense, that's what that was for. - Sat Dec  5 20:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: What're you doing drilling someone's head into the ground from several feet in the air in a spar? - Sat Dec  5 20:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: H-He said..n-not to hold back.. - Sat Dec  5 20:02:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: I don't care how burly the person you're doing it to might be, it's a -spar-. - Sat Dec  5 20:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) flicked a small indigo pill from the top of her thumb into Hiroshi's mouth. "Don't chew it." She looked toward Momura. "That doesn't mean you throw him head-first at the ground. It's still a spar." She'd state, grasping Momura's hand and lifting her to her feet.* - Sat Dec  5 20:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: A healing pill. - Sat Dec  5 20:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: I don't like pills. - Sat Dec  5 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: But fine. - Sat Dec  5 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: *chews pill* - Sat Dec  5 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) forcefully did said action, it ain't even matter if she rejected it.* - Sat Dec  5 20:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: ... - Sat Dec  5 20:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) pulled out yet another pill, flicking it toward Momura's grasp; maybe her mouth, either or.

"Try to avoid rash moves like that, we want -less- casualties." She'd remark.* - Sat Dec  5 20:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: F-Fine.. - Sat Dec  5 20:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: You can get to the hospital on your own right? I advise getting your injuries checked out, I'll be staying here. - Sat Dec  5 20:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: I gotta go to the hospital? - Sat Dec  5 20:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Nah I am fine. - Sat Dec  5 20:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Sigh... good luck with that mindset. - Sat Dec  5 20:10:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: I-I have? - Sat Dec  5 20:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Yup, I could easily avoid your attacks last time we sparred. *laughs* - Sat Dec  5 20:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: I have some more training to do. - Sat Dec  5 20:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: I-I guess.. - Sat Dec  5 20:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: *shrugs*  I can't wait to train with Sensei again. - Sat Dec  5 20:21:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Do you know why she went to Konoha? - Sat Dec  5 20:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) walked forth slowly. Mizora smacked her palms forward. The girl emitted whiteish-blue chakra asround her form. She parted her palms, seemingly unimpressed by her usage of the technique this time around. The girl clasped her hands together again, surging her chakra and building it up. She kneaded it into Raiton right before she released it into the area around her in a small condensed range, whiteish-blue sparks zapping around her.* - Sat Dec  5 20:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: D-Dunno. - Sat Dec  5 20:24:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: S-Soo. - Sat Dec  5 20:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) initiated yet another clasping of her hands. She clasped her hands together, gathering a surplus of chakra. She kneaded said chakra into Lightning-based chakra, surging it even more. Having taken necessary preparation, the black and white-haired girl released a surge of chakra around her frame, allowing white-ish blue sparks to flicker around her figure, zapping at the air loudly.* - Sat Dec  5 20:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Soo? - Sat Dec  5 20:36:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) pressed her fingertips against eachother, generating a reasonable source of chakra within her palms. She kneaded the chakra into Raiton, then she proceeded to produce a sphere of pure Raiton from the surge. The black and white-haired female would extend her arms out from their bent position, firing off the sphere and watching as it shot forth at a reasonable speed.* - Sat Dec  5 21:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) pressed her fingertips together again. She proceeded to generate the same amount of chakra, though she applied more control to the voltage. She gathered the chakra rapidly, surging it and kneading it into Raiton with the finesse of an experienced ninjutsu specialist. Soon after, Mizora threw her arms outward once more, firing yet another sphere of Raiton-based chakra.* - Sat Dec  5 21:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: wut not even crow? - Sat Dec  5 21:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) bent her arms and balled her hands into tight fists. The girl bent her knees, rushing chakra to the outer area around her. She kneaded said chakra into Raiton, so when it left her body it rippled around her presence in the form of whiteish blue sparks. In the right hands the technique would've been powerful, but she was more proficient with taijutsu, thus it was weak... for now.* - Sat Dec  5 21:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) clasped her hands together, standing up straight this time. She generated an overwhelming amount of chakra, beginning to knead it slowly. Once the entirety of the chakra around her body was kneaded into Raiton, the female would surge it around her once more. With the surge came yet another flickering essence of whiteish-blue sparks around her.* - Sat Dec  5 21:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) wasn't really focused on Sanoke and Momura's spar. Rather, the female's attention was more geared toward her training with Lightning. The black and white-haired woman would press her fingertips together, generating a rash pulsation of whiteish-blue chakra which resonated through the entirety of her palms, generating a sphere between them in a very quick fashion!

Mizora stopped bending her arms, allowing them to extend out completely as her fingers parted. The sphere fired off from her palms, shooting forth at a rapid rate of speed. It was at this point that Mizora was confident that she'd completely managed to accomplish mastery over the Lightning Ball technique. The ball thrashed into the wall, grinding away at it while eventually the zapping noise it made toned down as it diminished.* - Sat Dec  5 21:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) yawned lightly, unsure whether or not she wanted to continue. Her training was almost complete though, she could tell. Her eyebrows creased as she clasped her hands together, producing a surge of chakra. She manifested Raiton by kneading the chakra, thus generating a jolt of whiteish-blue electricity with decent range around her frame. This was a very basic Raiton technique, so naturally she was already very experienced from it.* - Sat Dec  5 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: You have this Momura! - Sat Dec  5 21:54:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) removed a total of four kunai knives from an inner coat pocket. She whipped the kunai knives forth, watching them jab into the wall. Mizora then formed several handsigns, building up chakra as she threw her arms out in front of her. She surged said chakra and kneaded it into Raiton, allowing a wave of whiteish-blue tendrils to thrust outward and run along the blades of the kunai knives.* - Sat Dec  5 22:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: 9riven - Sat Dec  5 22:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) pressed her fingertips together. She generated a decent pulsation of chakra within her palms. She kneaded the chakra into Raiton, shortly after. Mizora would fire off a sphere of Raiton-based chakra generated by constantly surged and well-formed chakra. The sphere shot forth, eventually fading when it made direct contact with the earthen substance in front of her.* - Sat Dec  5 22:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) formed the same amount of handsigns that she performed before. She conducted an immense amount of chakra to her palms, kneading said chakra into Raiton-based essence. From that point, the black and white-haired female would execute her actions, firing off just four tendril-like bolts of whiteish-blue lightning from her palms and mostly her fingertips. Each bolt struck the kunai knives singularly, running electric across the iron-composed blades.* - Sat Dec  5 22:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) bent her knees, proceeding to leap up into the air. She performed one quick backflip while in the air, otherwise pressing her fingertips together and generating a surplus of chakra. With that surplus, it was kneaded into Raiton-based chakra, as she fired it in the form of a sphere that shot from between her palms after her fingers parted and her arms extended out in front of her.* - Sat Dec  5 22:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) walked across the sand very slowly, taking a simple glance at the spar going on between Momura and Sanoke. Mizora would settle down with her back pressed against the earthen wall, sitting down. The black and white-haired girl would remove a scroll from the confines of her inner pocket to the coat wrapped around her frame. She peeled the scroll open, reading up on Lightning Release ninjutsu.* - Sat Dec  5 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh! Do you surrender? - Sat Dec  5 22:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Phew. Was about to wrestle her down, and hold her face into mud. - Sat Dec  5 22:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) performed one last set of handsigns. She'd immerse her palms in Lightning-based chakra, then she threw her arms out in front of her. Shortly after this action was performed, the white and black-haired girl would fire off a wave of white-ish blue Raiton. Said wave was actually several bolts of electric-based chakra which was concentrated into thin tendrils which ran along the metal of the kunai knives, running small sparks across their perimeter.* - Sat Dec  5 22:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeah. You said I'm too strong. - Sat Dec  5 22:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) glanced at Chikyu, a single brow raised.

"Do you need medical attention?" She questioned.* - Sat Dec  5 22:59:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) pulled out a key, unlocking the door and pushing on in with it.* - Sat Dec  5 23:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) placed her shoes down at the door, pattering across the floor and peering into the fridge as she opened it and looked in.* - Sat Dec  5 23:10:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) took out a plethora of vegetables, especially those that she knew were good for rebuilding vitality and strength. The girl found a clean knife within the drawer, beginning to cut the vegetables thinly then place them in a bowl. In the mean time, some type of meaty-broth boiled in a pot on the stove. She poured the vegetables in shortly after peeling and cutting up potatoes.

The female added multiple seasonings, then resolved to simply stir the stew. The woman roamed throughout the kitchen, grasping a pair of bowls from within the shelf nearby. She poured some stew into each bowl, covering it back up with a lid. The aroma of the food immersed the innards of the home, and the outside of it to a degree. She carried the bowls over to the table, setting one down behind Mitsunara and the other behind Chikyu, with utensils as well.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) didn't really want to be dramatic when she was performing the first technique. Mizora would bend her right arm, allowing chakra to swamp over both of her arms. She focused an immense level of chakra to her hands, gathering it to her palm. She released said chakra in the form of a compressed blast, which had enough range on it to counter a basic technique such as the Great Fireball technique. It would be -very- useful...

"Now then.." She formed three handsigns, spewing water from her mouth. The water built itself into a clone that copied her appearance. She smiled lightly, getting into the necessary stance. The black and white-haired female was taking this training -very- serious, especially because it would be a massive advance in her experience with Gentle Fist. "Hakke: Rokujuuyon Shou!" Mizora rapidly assaulted the water clone in front of her, so fast that she was striking it when it was just water, having revert after the first hit.

Every sequence of the attack was stronger than the previous, and by the sixth sequence she'd taken a large step forth to complete it!* - Sun Dec  6 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: A true prodigy! You're skillfull haha. - Sun Dec  6 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Thanks, want me to show you my Eight Trigrams technique, now? - Sun Dec  6 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: mm... - Sun Dec  6 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) formed three handsigns, producing a water clone. "Watch closely. It's practically Revolving Heaven, but only using one tenketsu instead of all three hundred and sixty one." She'd state. The girl fired an immense amount of chakra from one of her tenketsu, the water clone dispersing and forming into water instantly.* - Sun Dec  6 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Good job! - Sun Dec  6 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: And.. I assume that's Tsukinomi? - Sun Dec  6 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Yep, I can't believe you guys haven't met. I thought you taught her that move.. And thanks it's resourceful. It's similar to a new move I just created. - Sun Dec  6 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Oh? You made another Eight Trigrams technique? - Sun Dec  6 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mmm.. by the way what're your elements? - Sun Dec  6 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Mhm, hopefully I'll be able to share it with you soon! - Sun Dec  6 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Hmm? Just water. - Sun Dec  6 04:21:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Hmm, I know Water Prison, Syurp Trap, and water gun - Sun Dec  6 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: The only thing I can teach you is the Mizubunshin no Jutsu. - Sun Dec  6 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Hmm, I hear that's a pretty advanced technique from my studies. I don't think I'm ready quite yet. - Sun Dec  6 04:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Alright. - Sun Dec  6 04:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: But, I'm going to take my little sister home. If ya need stop by anytime. There's another one of our clansmen in prison. You have authority to visit him if you want. - Sun Dec  6 04:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Another clansman? - Sun Dec  6 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Yes, we don't know much about him but he has connections with Edge. So, he isn't quite fond of us. - Sun Dec  6 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Hm, I see. - Sun Dec  6 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Would you like help with taking Tsuki home? - Sun Dec  6 04:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Sure, company is always welcomed especially family. - Sun Dec  6 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) moved forth, turning her back to Koji and Tsuki, pulling the girl onto her back so that her arms would be over her shoulders. She'd of most likely inherited Mizora's aroma, which was the scent of mint, by the time they got back to Koji's place.* - Sun Dec  6 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) smiled.

"I've been well, and I see you have too. What's Tsuki like? I wanna know before I meet her, when she's awake, that is." Mizora would state, her fingers running through the little girl's locks of hair.* - Sun Dec  6 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Hm, another medic huh? Mirai's interested in that field too. - Sun Dec  6 05:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Oh yeah, Mirai is learning that they'll probably be spending a lot of time together. - Sun Dec  6 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mhm. - Sun Dec  6 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: I'm spending time learning more about our clan arts and getting better at Ninjutsu. - Sun Dec  6 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: I have a decent knowledge of ninjutsu, but I'm more concerned with advancing our jutsus. I might study fuinjutsu.. I have an idea I want to implement but we'll see. - Sun Dec  6 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Hm.. - Sun Dec  6 05:33:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yes. - Sun Dec  6 07:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) invisioned a Eight Trigrams circle within her field of vision, then she proceeded to rapidly palm strike the wall for a total of sixty four times, separated into six segments, each segment being progressively faster than the last. She took a step forth on the sixth segment, proceeding to end the barrage of attacks with a chakra combustion emitted from her last palm strike!* - Sun Dec  6 16:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) invisioned yet another Eight Trigrams circle. She initiated sixty four more palm strikes to the wall, this time doing it quicker with more finesse and more chakra invested into the technique. The Hokuma assaulted the wall with her six segmented strikes, her last being her quickest and most powerful, causing her to need to step forward. Mizora's last and final attack concentrated a plume of chakra into her palm, which burst as she made contact with the wall one last time.* - Sun Dec  6 16:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) took a penny from her pocket. She rested it upon her thumb, proceeding to flick it high up into the air. The black and white-haired female then took a step back, firing off a dome of extensive chakra from her open palm right when the penny was lateral with the centre of her palm. The penny thrusted forth throughout the air, it's momentum powered by this blast of chakra that Mizora fired.* - Sun Dec  6 16:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Bang. - Sun Dec  6 16:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) watched as the penny... or whatever amount of yen that equates to it, smacked dead into the wall. She removed yet another five yen coin, flicking it into the air and then waiting. Without usage of her Byakugan, and just pure reaction time, as well as sight, she fired off yet another wide-shell of chakra from the focal point of her palm, watching as the coin shot forth rapidly.* - Sun Dec  6 16:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) gathered chakra to her forearm, then gradually to her palm. She'd attempt to only extend her index finger out, pointing her thumb upright while keeping her other digits inward. She intended to compress the chakra and direct it to the tip of her pointer finger, then fire off the chakra. Unfortunately, this was something she -couldn't- do... the Vacuum Palm technique was naturally a wide range technique, meaning that it wasn't the Vacuum Palm technique without the range it normally covered. The compression completely ruined said range...
