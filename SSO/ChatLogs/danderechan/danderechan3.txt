She twirled mid-air with massive difficulty, before dropkicking the ground with her other foot as she pulled the previously used one back.* - Fri Nov 27 23:48:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm, in that case..Go ahead. - Sat Nov 28 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) formed a total of three handsigns in a decent rate of dexterity. After doing so, she spewed water from her mouth, producing a total of four water-based clones out in front of her, which formed out of the water that she'd allowed to drain from her maw. Despite the fact that they were weak, they'd be an efficient difference from what she usually trained with; the wall.

All four of the water clones took on the Gentle Fist stance, while Mizora remained standing straight.* - Sat Nov 28 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: We'll train later someplace afar. - Sat Nov 28 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Cool! - Sat Nov 28 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) sprinted forth at the same time her clones did. She'd proceed to bound off the earth from her heels, throwing her right leg upright and slamming the sole of her foot directly into one of the four water clone's faces. The pure strength put behind the attack forced the clones to disperse into a mass of splashing water as she struck it.* - Sat Nov 28 02:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) slammed her foot upon the ground, proceeding to balance on it as she leaned forth and shot her leg back in a lashing, rapid motion. She smashed her heel and lower sole into the frame of yet another clone. Two of the clones formed two handsigns, releasing a translucent blue goop toward the sand below, aiming to bind her in place. It was noticeable at this point that wrists were pressed together because the gauze was tied around both.* - Sat Nov 28 02:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) was binded. She simply smiled briefly. The female suddenly tore herself free from the sticky bind, shooting directly for yet another clone. The clone's attempted to distance themselves, but alas, they weren't very sufficient at escaping her clutches. She immediately bursted forth in a decent application of speed, flying sidekicking yet another clone in the throat, making it disperse into a blast of water.* - Sat Nov 28 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) frontflipped directly for her clone, stopping after performing two frontflips. Her foot glided only a few feet from the clone's face. She suddenly confronted it with a quick bounce forward, followed by a sudden dropkick that drove her right heel directly into, and through the clone's shoulder as it unsolidified and became water.* - Sat Nov 28 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) smiled lightly. The female took note of her efficient training, despite the taxing chakra that it applied to it. The white and black-haired Hokuma raced out of the training grounds. She removed a scroll from the innards of her backpouch, opening it up and revealing factual information that she'd read from a book and wrote within it. With said scroll, she studied the efficiency of kicks, and how powerful they could be if she learned how to perform all of them.* - Sat Nov 28 02:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) came to a stop from her light jog, placing the scroll within her backpouch. There she stood, in front of a tall, rather chunky looking boulder. The girl hopped forth with her right leg bent and prepared. She fired her leg off at a speed that could be comparable to a cannon ball shooting from a catapult; it even had the damage to go with it. Her foot smashed against the boulder, providing a small shake, in addition to a few cracks where her strike landed.* - Sat Nov 28 02:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) bounced up and down a little bit while standing straight up,  having placed her foot back down. Her arms were partially bent in front of her, still binded by the gauze wrapped around them. The girl took a slightly bigger bounce than initially. "More momentum! More power! Less holding back due to lack of burliness for tanking the impact of doing this!" She told herself, spinning around and launching her left leg, slamming her lower thigh and upper ankle into the boulder to cause a few more cracks to form.* - Sat Nov 28 02:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) pulled her leg back, slamming her foot onto the ground. She began to circle the boulder, moving at the highest speed that she possibly good, which wasn't really much to boast about. The female threw her leg forth, balancing on the leg that wasn't being used as she smashed the sole of her foot firmly against the base of the boulder. She -immediately- slammed her foot into the ground and began to shoot toward the boulder's side again. "Lastly, flexibility to my movements!"* - Sat Nov 28 02:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) met the side of the boulder, smashing her foot firmly against it. She raced to the other side of it via. running toward the back and curving the arc of her movement. The female pivoted on her feet one hundred and eighty degrees, smashing the base of her foot into the other side of the boulder. The girl ran toward the front of the boulder, though she was moving a little more diagonally.* - Sat Nov 28 02:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) met the front of the boulder, but she was at least four feet away from it. She rushed forth, taking a jumping leap and using the chunks of the boulder sticking out as her leverage and her stepping stones. She leaped off of the edge of the top of the boulder, proceeding to do a quick, sloppy somersault before thrusting her leg downward. "The hardest kick of all of them, the axe kick!" She -smashed- her heel directly into the top of the boulder, watching as fissures ran halfway down the side as the structure itself began to tremor.* - Sat Nov 28 02:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) bounded off of the top of the boulder, landing on one foot in a slightly crouched position. She placed her foot on the ground, bouncing back some. The female shoved herself forward against the resistance of the wind, shooting her leg up as she smashed her foot directly into the boulder, watching as more fissures formed. "It needs to be... stronger! More damage!"* - Sat Nov 28 02:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) pulled her leg back. Breathing lightly. She collapsed onto her ass, pressing her back firmly against the sand. She was very exhausted from this activity, but that didn't stop her from continuing her ambination to perform it. The girl removed the scroll that she read from within her backpouch. She began to read the scroll. "Next.. a spinning roundhouse kick... all this spinning.." She stated, partially dizzy.* - Sat Nov 28 02:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) was so tempted to just straightup punch the rock right now, which was the reason why she binded her own two hands together with gauze. After recuperating some of her stamina, the female put the scroll back in her backpouch. She raced directly at the boulder, spinning a total of two times for seven hundred twenty degrees rotated, having began to swing her leg outward when she was around the two hundred degree mark. With the built up momentum, she smacked her heel into the boulder, making more fissures form.* - Sat Nov 28 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) backed up a bit. She needed to take a moment to calculate just how efficient her next move would be. "Mmm... a jumping dash kick.. I'm good at those." The girl leaned forward then began to sprint forward, taking a leap upright. She curved her torso back and bent her left leg, tucking it beneath her right leg while extending said leg out. Her sole and the boulder clashed, fissures forming upon contact. The boulder finally shuddered a couple more times before crumbling into several small stones that she stood on top of.* - Sat Nov 28 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) dashed off out of the area, removing the scroll once more. She began to read it again. "Mm.. kicking at the same speed that I punch.. doesn't sound too promising when there's a difference between the speed of a kick and a punch... though, that's what I'm training for, haha.." She thought to herself. The girl was slowly nearing the area of the next boulder.* - Sat Nov 28 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) breathed heavily. She placed the scroll within her backpouch, launching herself toward the boulder. Now it was time for the toughest task at hand. She bounced forth with her legs partially bent and her body facing her right, with her head tilted to the left, where the boulder resided. She suddenly launched her leg outward, aiming to kick at the boulder quickly, attempting to kick as though her leg's a rapier, similar to how she does her palm strikes.* - Sat Nov 28 02:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) needed to apply more levels of training that she'd previously mastered the usage of. By doing that, the femlae began to gyrate around the entirety of the boulder's structure. She'd shoot behind the boulder, lashing her right leg out and proceeding to attempt to kick at the speed of a typical rapier thrust. Unfortunately, she wasn't exactly as proficient as she wanted at kickboxing yet, and thus she only did it at a tenth of the speed she should've.* - Sat Nov 28 02:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) did up to five more kicks, before slamming her leg to the ground. She shot to her right, proceeding to thrust her leg out and kick rapidly at the surface of the rock, causing fissures with each strike that she landed. Mizora backed up abit then launched herself forward, throwing her leg outward and smashing the base of her sole into the rock, causing a small crater to form. "I'm almost there..!"* - Sat Nov 28 03:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) dropped down, one knee planted on the ground and the other suspended in the air while she was standing on one knee, practically holding herself up with it. She breathed heavily, thinking about how much training she'd done. It was intense... and it definitely never had the intentions of being easy. But this..? This was nearly too hard for her. "The axe kick... the sidekick... the flying side kick... I've learned so much.." She stood up slowly. "I can't give up yet.." She murmured as she rose to her feet, backing up slowly.* - Sat Nov 28 03:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) leaned forward then she began to shoot forward in a sprint, her arms thrown behind her. She shot into the air, spinning around then driving her right leg forth. She smashed her foot firmly against the base of the chunky boulder. Mizora immediately thrusted her next leg outward, beginning to kick the rock with this one. Suddenly, she began to kick rapidly iwth both of her legs, causing tremors and fissures alike to form along the structure of the boulder. She was halfway to the speed she wanted!* - Sat Nov 28 03:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) smashed both of her legs into the base of the boulder at the same time. With key timing she backflipped off of the top of the boulder, landing on the ground. She charged forward, her arms still thrown behind her, she'd long ago broken the gauze without noticing. The girl threw her leg forward, kicking rapidly in a series of strikes. Despite her heavy breathes she step going on!* - Sat Nov 28 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) backed up, breathing heavily. She ran forth sluggishly, throwing her left leg up. She removed an indigo pill from her backpouch, biting down on it. Somewhere in her mind she figured that if it was a healing pill that it could revitalize her stamina and not just her bones and/or muscles. The black and white-haired Hokuma rapidly struck the boulder with a barrage of kicks.* - Sat Nov 28 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) pulled her leg in, slamming it onto the ground then rushing to the side of the boulder. The female launched her other leg up while balancing on the previously used one, kicking the boulder rapidly with great momentum and power put behind each barraging kick. She was easily nearing the speed of a typical rapier strike when it came to the speed that she kicked at the air!* - Sat Nov 28 03:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) smashed her foot firmly against the boulder one last time before bounding away, bending her knees completely and intersecting her wrists. The girl looked from between her wrists with her sky blue eyes. She shot forward with her arms thrown back behind her. She bounded off of the grund, spinning rapidly then proceeding to thrust her leg downward, aiming to dropkick the boulder.* - Sat Nov 28 03:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) smashed her heel into the surface of the boulder. She pulled her leg back...  and let loose. Both of her feet smashed into the surface of the boulder. She suddenly began to smash her feet into the surface of the boulder, her right leg bending as her left leg jolted out and struck the surface of the boulder. She went from left kick to right kick, then to left again and right again. She continued barraging the surface of the boulder, bending her right leg completely in as she struck the boulder with her left leg for the last time. She then jolted her right out, smashing her sole directly into the boulder and making it shatter into small stones. The girl dropped onto her knees atop the gathering of boulders, breathing heavily.* - Sat Nov 28 03:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) stood up after taking a fifteen minute break. She very slowly walked back to the courtyard with achey and shaky legs, and heavy breaths.* - Sat Nov 28 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Hey Mizora. - Sat Nov 28 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) waved, almost breathless. Her legs ached so much...

"Hey.." She stated.* - Sat Nov 28 03:23:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) bent her knees ever sos lightly. She extended her right arm out in front of her, which was arched as well and balled into a tight fist. Her left arm was bent completely, the back of her palm to her left palm in close proximity to her chin, while her open palm faced Kinami. A dense amount of chakra coursed to her left hand.

The chakra kneaded into a veil of Fuuton-based chakra, and the same veil immersed her right, balled up fist. The wind particles coursing around her forearms tore apart the gauze around them, revealing black elbow gloves along with red, puffy gloves with shining green gems where the outer knuckles of each fist would be located.

She rushed forth, aware that she could dish out her full strength since she was familiar with Kinami's burliness. Her intentions were to throw a very quick jab from her right fist, directed to the female's left shoulder. Her goal was to shift the entirety of the female's body to the left. If this was successful, the black and white-haired Hokuma was given an opening to her side, where she'd strike with a generic palm strike.* - Sat Nov 28 04:48:25 2015
