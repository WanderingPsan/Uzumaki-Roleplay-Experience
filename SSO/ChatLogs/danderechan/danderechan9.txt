<br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) says: Hrm..? Ahhh! Floweys! - Thu Dec 10 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) seemed interested by Ketsuki's coloring scheme. Do black flowers actually exist? That was something that Mizora lacked the knowledge on.

"Mm.. which color do you like the most out of all of them?" She'd question, giving her daughter a wide variety of answers she could choose, since she used so many colors in the first place. It was certainly vibrant.* - Thu Dec 10 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) flickered her eyes from Ketsuki's finger to her face. She'd set her gaze back down on the page, trailing her own finger along the colored flowers, until she stopped at a flower colored dark blue. "Hm, you like golden yellow? I personally like blue." She'd remark.

"Neither me or Ai have taught you your colors, have we?"* - Thu Dec 10 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: MM... - Thu Dec 10 21:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) picked up whatever box containing the utensils she was using to color.

"This is. . . " She would proceed to point to each utensil and inform her of which color was which. ". . . And that's all of them."* - Thu Dec 10 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Hey, I have to teach you the basics, don't I? - Thu Dec 10 21:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: You're welcome though, Ketsuki.~ - Thu Dec 10 21:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) briefly left Ketsuki's side, coming back with paper. She pat her lap upon sitting down, as she proceeded to place the paper down on the table. "I'm going to teach you a majority of what you should know before I start teaching you stuff about being a kunoichi, is that alright?"* - Thu Dec 10 21:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) plucked a dark-blue utensil from the box, beginning to write down all the letters in the english alphabet, as well as all romanji and kanji. She'd teach her about vowels and all that great stuff in a matter of days, considering that time was highly sped up for now (OOCly at least).* - Thu Dec 10 21:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) taught her some extra things, considering she was demonstrating the intelligence that she seemed to inherit. Of course, honorifics were something that Mizora had featured to her daughter as well.* - Thu Dec 10 21:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) offered Ketsuki a seat in her lap. "Come on, I'll braid your hair.~" She'd state, a comb on the table in front of her. This was several days after the final dose of education she gave to her daughter.* - Thu Dec 10 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) giggled lightly. "It will." She'd promise, proceeding to comb through Ketsuki's long bundles and locks of black-hair, straightening it out.

"On second thought.. I have something better."

The process in which she was doing took a couple hours. By the time she was done, one long hair tie was stressed out to tie the back of her long, flowing hair beyond the nape of her neck into one bundle brought together by the tie. It diagonally ran along the surface of the hair, and a small bundle was left at the end, basically a small ponytail.

She adjusted Ketsuki's bangs so that they were pushed off to the left side of her face, with the hair pin Chikyu gave to her years ago keeping them there.

"Like it?" Mizora would show Ketsuki her hair with a small, handheld mirror, shifting her hand around to show her more parts.* - Thu Dec 10 22:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mhm, who else could it be other than you, Ketsuki? - Thu Dec 10 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: You're beautiful. - Thu Dec 10 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) says: Ah... - Thu Dec 10 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) says: I'm not so sure.. - Thu Dec 10 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: You are, trust me! - Thu Dec 10 22:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) says: Ah... thank you. - Thu Dec 10 22:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) embraced Ketsuki, kissing her on top of her head while hugging her from behind lightly.

"You're welcome, my cute child.~"* - Thu Dec 10 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: A few days after your fourth birthday I'll start training you, be ready! - Thu Dec 10 22:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) thinks: It'll be basic stuff, though. - Thu Dec 10 22:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) says: Ah, Hai! I look forward to it! - Thu Dec 10 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Hm. Are you in the mood for a game? - Thu Dec 10 22:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) says: Hahh! Sure! - Thu Dec 10 22:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Have you heard of chess? - Thu Dec 10 22:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: -omit- - Thu Dec 10 22:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) stood up, placing Ketsuki on the pillow as she went through the shelves, bringing out a chess board and placing it down on the table. She'd sit across from her daughter, taking out the pieces. As she took out the pieces she explained which each did.

"Are you ready?"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) hugged her knees to her chest as she wrapped her arms around her ankles, pressing her head to her thighs. A muffled yawn emitted from her.* - Fri Dec 11 00:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Go mess with mommy, tickle her on the left, I'll take the right, alright?~ - Fri Dec 11 00:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) was confronted by a sudden frenzy of tickles, first from her left. After an unexpected kiss she started being tickled on her right as well. The female yelped, suddenly giggling uncontrollably as she succumbed to her own tickilishness. That definitely woke her up.

"Ahahaha... !"* - Fri Dec 11 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) continued to giggle uncontrollably. She'd came to actually enjoy this; given the opportunity to interact with her family. This humored her so much that she was on the verge of tears, her stomach hurting from laughing so much. Between fits of laughter she begged for it to stop.* - Fri Dec 11 01:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) embraced both of them. "That woke me up, that's for sure.." She'd remark with a small chuckle.* - Fri Dec 11 01:16:22 2015

"I love you, Ketsuki." She'd remark, kissing the top of her head.* - Fri Dec 11 01:44:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) says: Ah.. that sounds about right! What's.. Genjutsu? - Fri Dec 11 02:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Illusions and stuff. - Fri Dec 11 02:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Messing with people's five senses. - Fri Dec 11 02:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) says: Ah.... - Fri Dec 11 02:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Your five senses are your sense of touch, feeling, hearing, seeing and tasting. - Fri Dec 11 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) says: Ah! - Fri Dec 11 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: It's not typical for the illusions to toy around with hearing, touching and tasting. Usually sight and feeling are the only ones hindered. I'm sure there are advanced enough specialists out there. - Fri Dec 11 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: I don't know any genjutsu, but your father may. - Fri Dec 11 02:37:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Taijutsu's hand to hand combat, Ninjutsu's like.. using your spiritual energy, chakra, to shoot fireballs, walk on water.. and other stuff like that. - Fri Dec 11 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) says: Wow! That sounds cool.. - Fri Dec 11 02:38:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) says: Ah... so long..? Okay.. - Fri Dec 11 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) nodded lightly, a look of gloom covering her face. She'd murmur, "Stay safe.." She had no response to the kiss received.* - Fri Dec 11 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) thinks: I know he'll come back, but still.. - Fri Dec 11 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) says: Ah... - Fri Dec 11 02:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mm.. I'll be right back, let me know if you need me even earlier.. - Fri Dec 11 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) kissed Ketsuki's forehead, before standing up and entering the bedroom.* - Fri Dec 11 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) sat on the edge of the bed, sinking her head as she looked down at the floorboards with her partially remorseful, half-lidded gaze. "He'll come back..." She murmured, seemingly struck by anxiety. It pained her emotionally whenever Ai needed to leave.. she was still afraid of the possiblity of something happening.

"He just came back.. and he's going again.. but still.. is it reasonable to wonder if he'll never come back someday.. whether he decides not to... or.. just.. goes..? Or... is it just paranoid..?" She thought.* - Fri Dec 11 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) popped her own cheeks briefly, allowing a shy smile to form on her face. It became more genuine as she thought about the things she has now to appreciate that she didn't have in the past. "I can't get all gloomy.. I have a kid to take care of.." She'd remark in a chipper tone, having grown to repair herself emotionally over the years. She was a woman afterall..~

Mizora closed her eyes, simply smiling as she rose to her feet, heading out of the bedroom.* - Fri Dec 11 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) left the bedroom, the trace of gloom immersing her seeming to have dispersed completely.

"Ketsuki what do you want to do right now?" She was curious.* - Fri Dec 11 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mm.. - Fri Dec 11 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) says: Ah.... Hrm.. what do you think..? - Fri Dec 11 03:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mmmmm.. I'm not sure. - Fri Dec 11 03:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Hm? Sure. - Fri Dec 11 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) moved forth, extending her right arm out with an open hand.

"Let's go. Want a piggyback ride?~"* - Fri Dec 11 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) exited the home, of course locking the door.* - Fri Dec 11 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) arrived at the ice cream parlor. She'd purchase a triple-scoop strawberry, chocolate and vanilla ice cream cone for Ketsuki, handing it to her and making her get off her back.

"Chakra is essential to even the most basic technique; it is the moulding of the physical enenrgy present in every cell of the body and the spiritual energy gained from the mind. Once moulded, it can be channelled through the chakra pathway system, which is to chakra as the circulatory system is to blood, to any of the 361 tenketsu in the body. Through various methods, the most common of which is hand seals, the chakra can then be controlled and manipulated to create an effect that would not be possible otherwise, such as walking on water, exhaling fire or creating illusions."

"Through the process of nature trransformation; chakra can be converted into a number of different natures. Most ninja have a natral affinity to one chakra nature, but they have the capacity to use natures apart from their own affinity. There are five basic natures, but in addition to these, certain genetic traits allow multiple natures to be combined into new natures; for example, it is possible to mix Water and Wind into Ice. While many ninja can use more than one chakra nature, very few are able to combine them in this manner."

"Tenketsu are simply nodes from which chakra can be released. There are 361 tenketsu in the body, eachone being a checkpoint on the Chakra Pathway System. Though ninja use chakra regularly, very few ninja possess any chakra control over their tenketsu. Even of jounin, the vast majority are only capable of releasing a small amount of chakra through their hands or feet to increase the power of punches, jumps, or kicks."

She obviously took breathes while saying this stuff.* - Fri Dec 11 21:14:49 2015

She closed her eyes, allowing the chakra flowing to her eyes to fade, and allowing her chakra flow to completely come to a halt.

By that point she'd be experienced enough with chakra control to manipulate her chakra with finesse required at her age and skill level.

Speaking of daughter's, she noted the fact that Fujitora wasn't around but Izanami was... again.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) skid to the left, exhaling and puffing her chest up, arching her back as she puffed her cheeks up as well. Mizora would part her lips, allowing a series of small spheres of wind to exit her mouth and cover an expansive range? Their target(s)? All of Booty warrior's clones. There was literally one blast of Fuuton-based chakra for each clone.

She originally planned on attacking Booty Hulk first, but Geo Dude was occupied with him.* - Sat Dec 12 00:08:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) bent her knees. She'd shoot forward with intentions of attacking Booty Hulk. She would stop dead in her tracks the moment she heard the words leave his mouth. The girl's eyes fell to a narrow as she bit her bottom lip, getting into the Gentle Fist stance. Mizora would shoot forth, allowing chakra to immerse her palms as she did so! She performed a quick twirl as she made her approach.

"Gentle Fist Art... Eight Trigrams..! Sixty Four Palms!"

At a rapid rate of dexterity she aimed to land a total of two palm strikes on the male's abdomen (16 AS). Presuming that the attacks would land, she threw yet another two strikes, but this time they appeared to be quicker than the previous. (18 AS) Her palms sped up in the rate in which they struck him, each strike she landed obliterating one of his tenketsu.

She rapidly struck him again with a total of four strikes (20 AS), following up with eight even faster ones, prematurely rotating as she followed up. (22 AS) Sixteen consecutive palm strikes followed soon after, targeting the unsealed tenketsu she'd yet to hit. (24 AS). At the peak of her full momentum behind her attacks, she'd assault him with another thirty two strikes, prematurely stepping forth with each segment of the attacks as they gradually knocked them back. Her last attack put enough force to knock him back, had it landed. (25 AS)

Of course, she wouldn't have done the full series of attacks had he avoided the first two, but he'd most likely be locked into taking on the full barrage, considering the constant ascension in the speed that she struck him.* - Sat Dec 12 00:44:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) shrugged, smiling lightly as she got into a rather simple stance, bouncing on her heels with her pearl-like gaze set on Kinami. "You can attack first." She'd remark, simply bracing herself for whatever came at her. The Ryutou didn't even have her Byakugan active, nor was she using any of her stances.* - Sat Dec 12 15:39:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) perceived her movements well, even without her Byakugan! She accessed the sheer momentum behind Kinami's movements, as well as her attacks. The black-haired girl would pay close mind to which foot she was using. Upon identifying that the girl was using her left foot, Mizora would lunge to her own right, otherwise Kinami's left.

With a basic demonstration of her hand dexterity she formed several handsigns, having taken a leap back as she threw her arms out in front of her and released whiteish-blue tendrils of raw chakra kneaded into Raiton-based chakra. Said tendrils were in a swarm / wave, which closed in toward Kinami with impressive movement behind them.* - Sat Dec 12 15:52:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: (18 reflex, moves 11 tiles a round.) - Sat Dec 12 15:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) spectated Kinami as she began to evade the attack that she'd sent at her. With sharp analysis of Kinami's movements, specifically within her feet, Mizora aimed to use intuition to predict where her next position would be in the short future. That would be slightly easier, since she'd already seemed to interpret the movement that Kanri possessed.

The Ryutou pulled out three shurikens, whipping them outward in the area in front of where Kinami was currently at in as much of an expansive range as possible. She whipped a kunai directly in front of where she predicted Kinami would be next once seeing signs that the girl's gaze was captivated by the three shurikens that zipped by at incredible speeds. A tag was attached to the end of the kunai, and despite the fact that everyone in Sunagakure could tank one of those suckers, there was an origin behind it's usage.

Regardless if it hit the person it was targeted for, said tag's explosion would manifest a sufficient cloud of sand. Mizora formed the Ram handsign, and at that point had activated her Byakugan.

---- All of the ninja tools thrown are moving at 12 tiles a turn ----* - Sat Dec 12 16:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: (22 intelligence for predicting shit) - Sat Dec 12 16:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (15.9 speed, 23.4 as) - Sat Dec 12 16:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) would've had to resort to brute strength rather than simple calculation to find out the outcome of this match. The moment Kinami met sufficient range, Mizora would've prematurely formed a single handsign and release numerous whiteish-blue sparks into the air around her, aiming to stun Kinami at this moment.

Directly after having done this her hands parted as she thrusted to Kinami's backside, within the smoke cloud.

She paused momentarily, waiting to see if Kinami showed any signs of being capable of seeing through the smoke. Maybe she'd learned sensory in the past half decade.

Mizora curved her back, mostly her upper torso backward. She puffed her chest out as well as her cheeks, proceeding to inhale largely as she bent her arms at her sides, then threw them back as she leaned forward in one rapid motion, exhaling several spheres of Fuuton-based chakra from her mouth which would consume sufficient distance on this training field, though it was out of range of hitting the spectators.

The sheer speed behind the numerous wind currents, however, would be more than enough to dissipate the cloud of smoke that Mizora had made. Assuming that Kinami was occupied with evading the wide-range Fuuton technique, Mizora formed a simple, single handsign that resembled a 't', beginning to gather chakra as she did so.* - Sat Dec 12 16:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: (I'll be reposting the last two paragraphs since they'll count as my response to ur next rp.) - Sat Dec 12 16:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: This damn smoke is in the way. . .   - Sat Dec 12 16:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) recognized the "Pressure Fist" technqiue, which'd been used by Geo Dude months ago to cause a prison inmate to stagger into Mizora's finisher. Such a burly inmate was -staggered- by the technique, so there was no way the Ryutou wanted to be hit by it, regardless of who was using it. She could've evaded, had she been capable of actually perceiving it's movement as it shot forth.

The blast struck her directly, stinging abit but not causing the damage that she expected. Was it weaker than she expected it to be? Was she burlier than she really thought she was? These questions were casted aside, as they distracted her from being in the moment.

"My turn!"

Mizora curved her back, mostly her upper torso backward. She puffed her chest out as well as her cheeks, proceeding to inhale largely as she bent her arms at her sides, then threw them back as she leaned forward in one rapid motion, exhaling several spheres of Fuuton-based chakra from her mouth which would consume sufficient distance on this training field, though it was out of range of hitting the spectators. The gusts of wind behind the small piercing spheres would easily swoop up sand, casting more detritus in the vicinity upright to conceal some parts of the field.

The sheer speed behind the numerous wind currents, however, would be more than enough to dissipate the cloud of smoke that Mizora had made. Assuming that Kinami was occupied with evading the wide-range Fuuton technique, Mizora formed a simple, single handsign that resembled a 't', beginning to gather chakra as she did so. She leaped back, her eyes failing to a narrow as she kept good watch on Kinami's counter measures.* - Sat Dec 12 16:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) thinks: Will she run to avoid it again? No, it's range is too great...hm.. - Sat Dec 12 16:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) smiled lightly at Kinami's response to the attack. She had gathered the necessary chakra, but none the less she jumped back, surging her chakra.

Suddenly, twenty plumes of smoke circled the vicinity around Kinami, and from those plumes of smoke emerged clones of Mizora.

Ten of the clones engulfed their forearms in chakra, while the other ten were running at her with standard taijutsu intentions.

Mizora herself whipped yet another kunai knife toward Kinami, this time aiming for her lower thigh, with an explosive tag attached to the end. She aimed to produce yet another cloud of smoke, then take the opportunity to escape while her clones attacked her with their impressive numbers. They only held half of Mizora's proficiency.* - Sat Dec 12 16:50:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) immersed one of her hands in chakra, keeping said hand in an open palm, while the other was balled into a tight fist. Mizora leaned forth, suddenly accelerating toward Kinami. The bandages concealing her hands suddenly unraveled, tearing to shreds as Fuuton chakra immersed her red and black elbow gloves. A green gem in each shined brightly as the chakra was funneled into their perimeter.

The clones closest to Mizora removed five explosive tags, one per each. With a single formation of a handsign, they triggered a massive eruption of sand which'd leave a cloud of dirt that Mizora wanted for this situation. She burst from the cloud of smoke and sand, descending high from the air. In one instant she aimed to slam her heel into Kinami's shoulder while she was perhaps distracted by the other fifteen clones remaining.* - Sat Dec 12 17:18:01 2015

Mizora swung her leg downward, regaining her footing. Two shadow clones would fire off blasts of chakra towards her, aiming to knock her back toward Mizora. All of her clones dispersed in plumes of smoke, as Mizora pulled her fist back and smirked.

<Let's see if you can handle this!>

She rocketed her right fist forth, lunging forward as she did so, with intentions of punching Kinami directly in the jaw. She'd dash even further towards her if her clones' usages of Vacuum Palm hit her with enough power.* - Sat Dec 12 17:35:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) scooted into Ai's lap, digging her knees into the sofa pillows as she sat upright and coiled her arms loosely around her. Mizora submerged Ai's head in her bosom, squeezing her tightly.

"I.. I really really -really- missed you! You were gone for so long... I'm so glad you're here!" She'd squeal out frantically as she spoke rapidly, she rested her chin on Ai's head and slammed her eyes shut.

A small smile formed as her eyes narrowed slightly.

"Okaeri."

The woman moved forth a little more, pressing her lips to Ai's intimately. She spared a few moments to maintain the kiss, before ultimately pulling away with a gratified, happy grin.* - Sat Dec 12 20:30:01 2015
