<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) lifted her index and middle fingers up in unison. She pressed the left side of her left middle finger to the left side of her right index finger, forming the Clone handsign. After doing so, she generated an efficient surplus of chakra from her form. The blakc and white-haired Hokuma manifested a half-solidified shadow clone by doing so.

She extended her right arm outward, watching as it phased through the shadow clone's frame. Mizora pulled her right leg back, swinging it forward and nudging the clone in the shin. "Mm.." The hit collided, confirming her wonders.* - Sat Nov 28 19:41:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) gazed blankly at Momura. She could've either taken action.. or let the girl bleed to death. Though it would've been a hassle, the latter wouldn't have been the right choice. She approached Momura, whether conscious or out cold, proceeding to crouch down beside the girl and remove a plethora of gauze from her backpouch. She separated the sufficient amount of gauze from her full roll, coiling it around the areas where the wounds were inflicted.

From that point, the black and white-haired Hokuma would pick up the girl with ease, placing her over her shoulder gently. Mizora formed the Ram handsign, then vanished in high speeds of movement.* - Sat Nov 28 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) eagerly got Momura a hospital room and what not. She presumed that the healing pill the redhead took clotted the blood by now, so now it was a matter of cleansing the wounds.* - Sat Nov 28 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) //

Nurses arrived. The nurses removed the gauze and inspected the wounds that littered her frame. They stripped her down bare-naked, proceeding to redress her in white hospital robes. Said nurses stored her clothing within a box on the stand beside the bed, while doctors gave a rather quick prognosis.

Nurses hastily worked to stabilize her wounds via. basic medical ninjutsu, sanitizing them and halting any still-bleeding wounds, before rewrapping the parts of her body inflicted with gauze. The nurses left and came back once more, giving her a small dose of medicine and hooking her up to machines; it was standard procedure afterall to hook patients up. After seeing that her vitals were stable, they exited.

Soon after, a doctor arrived, checking and approving of the hasty yet efficient work of the nurses, before leaving to update room scheduling and inform hospital staff of when she'll be dismissed.* - Sat Nov 28 22:00:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) pressed herslef closer to Ai's form while she was behind her. Mizora slowly peeled the scroll open, starting to read the contents of it. The basis of the technique was heavily confusing for her. It was expected that a taijutsu specialist such as herself would have a hard time wrapping their head around the usage of such a high-level Ninjutsu.

"I... don't get this."* - Sat Nov 28 23:04:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) bat her eyes briefly before she closed them, leaning upright and pressing her lips to Ai's in response.* - Sun Nov 29 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) accepted the lip lock. Her hands stroked at Ai's back while a small "mmm" resonated from the Hokuma's throat. She leaned against Ai more, her breasts pressing against Ai's chest.* - Sun Nov 29 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) lurched closer to her, her nails digging into it as her breasts continued to press against her. Her back bent forth, her butt sticking out more as Ai grasped it. Mizora's positive response was that of a plethora of moans that spanned out throughout this kissing session. The faintest shade of red cloaked her cheeks. The black and white-haired Hokuma was slowly yearning for more of this pleasure she felt resonating from her body. Her physique was practically glue'd to Ai's.

"Mmmhh... motto.." She attempted to mutter while her lips continued to lock with Ai's. Her head tilted to the opposing direction that Ai tilted her own. Mizora's arms still hung around her shoulders loosely.* - Sun Nov 29 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) nodded with a look of enthusiasm for this activiity. Her hands started sliding along Ai's shoulders, along her neck, and up to her cheeks. She cupped her cheeks and leaned forth. "Mhmmmm..." She stated, giving her positive response to Ai's question before pressing her lips to hers. Her eyes went from half-lidded to agape when she felt Ai's tongue enter her mouth.

Her eyes closed shut as she allowed herself to be immersed in the moment again, her palms still pressed gently to Ai's cheeks, the backs of her forearms smushing her breasts together, which continously prodded more and more at Ai's chest as Mizora's physique began to press to her form again. Her knees dug into the pillow that Ai was sitting on between her legs.* - Sun Nov 29 03:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) noticed that Ai was getting very in the moment. She moaned low in response to her grinding her body against hers. Mizora was caught in the moment too, her breasts continuously pushing up against Ai's form while she was ultimately smothered by the pleasure that came from such lewd acts.

She broke away from Ai briefly, listening to her words. "A-Are you sure...?" She questioned with a small bit of innocence in her tone. Mizora's breasts jiggled slightly with every heavy breath the black and white-haired Hokuma took. She was just moments from falling into Ai's grasp out of pure satisfaction for the gratifying act.

Somewhere in this deeply romantic act her knees ended up pressing to the sides of the pillow and -not- between Ai's legs. Instead, the Hokuma found herself partially sitting on Ai's lap.* - Sun Nov 29 03:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) smiled with glee.

"Well... it wouldn't be comfortable if we went further right here.. and it'd be better not to do everything all at once. I wanna savor the moment."

She leaned forth, kissing Ai on the lips briefly then pulling back. She pushed a bundle of her black hair behind her ear, twisting it around her pointer finger.* - Sun Nov 29 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) had her back pressed against the table. "C-Can't we do this in bed..?" She asked, attempting to ignore the fact that her mid-back was digging into the table. The girl had fallen victim to her own 'techniques' persay when it came to romantic interaction. Her heartbeat had raced as she didn't expect this from Ai.

The black and white-haired Hokuma blushed madly, understanding the sexual pressure that Ai felt when she was on the receiving hand of this affection. Mizora pulled Ai closer, pecking on her lips and luring her in while running her hand through her hair.* - Sun Nov 29 05:14:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) clasped Ai's hand, beginning to walk away slowly so she could follow in ease. Mizora waved back at Chikyu with a smile.* - Tue Dec  1 00:46:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) scooted toward Ai, embracing her.* - Tue Dec  1 01:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) lay ontop of Ai, her head pressed to her chest. The black and white-haired Hokuma was silent, her arms wrapped around Ai's waist.* - Tue Dec  1 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mmmm.... - Tue Dec  1 01:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Hmmm?~ - Tue Dec  1 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Huh? - Tue Dec  1 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) seemed to have gotten caught in the moment. She was in a comfortable daze from the warmth emanating from Ai. Even then, her bare feet were cold, and she still had a mild case of the shivers.

"Let's cuddle in bed."* - Tue Dec  1 01:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) removed her clothing and changed into a set of red pajamas, scooching back into Ai with her back to her and her butt prominently pushed out.* - Tue Dec  1 01:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) tensed up momentarily, though she loosened her muscles shortly after, pressing closer to Ai as much as possible. Mizora's hands inched down to where Ai's were, simply resting them a top Ai's. "Mmmm.." Her shoulders arced back a bit against Ai briefly.* - Tue Dec  1 01:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) pivoted so that she could face Ai. Mizora grasped her hands in her own, guiding them around the Hokuma's waist. The black and white-haired female smooched Ai on the lips, pleased with the warmth of Ai and the blankets shrouding her frame.

"Mmm... I just didn't expect you to nuzzle my shoulder." She remarked, attempting to burrow her own head against Ai's upper chest so that her head would rest on Ai's chin.* - Tue Dec  1 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) // "Oh? Seems interesting."

She pressed closer to Ai, her face suddenly flushing red. A dirty thought.* - Tue Dec  1 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) pressed her palms to the opposing sides of the pillow that Ai had the back of her head on. Mizora's head had sunk down to press against her chest. "Lewd.." She murmured, her libido really affecting her.* - Tue Dec  1 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: I.... um.... - Tue Dec  1 03:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Mm? - Tue Dec  1 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) was at a loss for words. She descended down to Ai, attempting to press her lips to hers. She'd pull away briefly, her face flooded with nervousness and redness. "I...I'm ready.. to do 'it'.." She whispered, attempting to initiate another kiss.* - Tue Dec  1 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) removed her own clothing, remaining bare naked. The black and white-haired female took one of the pills, before scooting across the bed and coiling her arms around Ai, her curve-endowed, milky white physique exposed with nothing to hide. Her breasts pressed against Ai's back.* - Tue Dec  1 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) couldn't help but eye Ai's body. She nodded, retracting from the hug from behind. The girl was extremely anxious, but it was something she felt was obligatory as a part of growing up. The fact that she didn't know what sex felt like was making her curiousity act up, too. The black and white-haired female crawled away slowly, her elbows digging into the bed as she bent over, her plump ass facing Ai's direction.

Her plush, pink folds were perceivable. She was blushing hard, and she was cold. At the same time she was very nervous. <I hope it doesn't hurt too much...> She thought to herself.* - Tue Dec  1 04:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) felt the sensation of something wet touch her crotch. She yelped, an overwhelming sensation debillitating her body. She could barely contain the moans that were involuntarily exiting her partially agape mouth. She buried her head in the blanket, her thigh muscles tensing up. If getting tongue'd in the vagina was so great feeling she couldn't imagine what it'd feel like when it was time for the most important part of this activity.

"Nnnh...y-yeah.." She said in response.* - Tue Dec  1 04:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) clenched the bed sheets below her as she felt Ai ease her way deeper into her already wet, pink walls. She clenched her teeth, slamming her eyes shut. The black and white-haired Hokuma curved the middle of her back inward, sounds that were a mix of whimpers and moans resonating from her throat.

"Mmmmnnn.... hhhnn.." The forceful stretching was painful. Ai's rod was more than enough to thrust on through her hymen and tear it apart, at which point she yelped, her black and white locks concealing her face as she pressed her own head against the mattress. The pain was great, and just when she thought she'd have to beg Ai to stop a wave of pleasure engulfed her.

With measly effort she managed to suck in the saliva running down from the side of her mouth, a drained look on her face, which was still pressed to the mattress sheets. This was the most pleasure she'd ever experienced in her life, and that was a fact.

"O-Oh... m-m-my.... nnnh.... g.... gaaaw.... d.."* - Tue Dec  1 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) lay on the bed on her belly, breathing heavily. She attempted to relocate herself so that she could embrace Ai.* - Tue Dec  1 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Love you too, hun.... - Tue Dec  1 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) was still woozy from the previous night. With a small dizzy spell to remind her, the black and white-haired Hokuma bent and extended her legs out, stretching her right arm out in front of her while leaving it slightly bent, with her palm facing the vicinity in front of her. Her other arm occupied a more bent position at her waist-line, still bent. After getting into the Gentle Fist stance, she fluidly accelerated forward.

With a quick swipe of her left arm from her waistline she drove her left arm out in a speed that she herself could barely perceive. Mizora retracted her arm, and as fast as she retracted it her other was thrown forward in a jabbing motion utilized by the entirety of the chakra-immersed appendage. Having set a basis for her attack fluency she began to rapid thrust forward by alternating between her left and right arms while palm striking the air repeatedly at least several times in just a second.

Despite this type of offensive motive she remained in a rather calm-positioning while she did it, her legs and feet perfectly positioned to avoid the risk of falling. The female concluded the barrage of attacks with 180 degree spin, followed by an expulsion of chakra from one of the tenketsu in her back as she pivoted her left foot and whipped her left forearm back while keeping her upper left arm in place.

The byakugan wielder deactivated her doujutsu, allowing the chakra coursing to her forearms to fade. She headed back home, too dizzy to continue this training regime.* - Tue Dec  1 12:45:00 2015
