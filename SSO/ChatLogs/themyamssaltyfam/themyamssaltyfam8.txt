"I've managed to understand the bare bones of the technique, so I guess I'd say I'm a novice at using it, for now. I haven't practiced it much." She'd state, being completely honest about the matter. When she thought about it, she -barely- trained. Whenever she did perform the task it was brief, or with someone else.

"I'm not sure on how to go about training it." She'd also state, seeking guidance from Mirai.* - Fri Oct 16 03:53:23 2015

Chakra flowed to her ocular nerves as she activated her clan doujutsu, causing her pair of very dark, red contacts to lighten to maroon. Mizora would step back some, proceeding to expel chakra from all of her tenketsu. She'd lift her heels off the ground, extending her arms out from her sides and begin to spin rapidly.

"Eight Trigrams: Revolving Heaven!"

A globe of sky blue chakra rotated rapidly around her figure, driving a crater into the earth beneath her. Normally, a genin of her level would've most likely lost consciousness from utilizing the technique at the level of mastery she had it yet.

However, if Mirai didn't notice already, Mizora's chakra reserves were strangely immense, capable of matching a C rank shinobi's raw chakra reserves without any training of said reserves, while only retaining her D+ rank. She'd stop swiveling rapidly, allowing the chakra expelling from her form to fade from view. 

She breathed mildly, having managed to consume a little less than a third of her monstrous reserves of chakra. Her chakra could perhaps become thee-times greater if she trained it. Unfortunately, it was clear as day to anyone spectating her, especially Mirai, that she lacked control of her chakra, and more or less received little to -no- training of her reserves.

"How was that..?"

Mizora looked to Mirai eagerly for the answer to her question.* - Fri Oct 16 04:20:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) simply glimpsed at Susumu. She'd whisper faintly, before allowing her left arm to emerge from her cloak. Suddenly, a large cloud of smoke would envelop the trio of individuals. The smoke suddenly bursted forth as she emerged, shooting directly toward Susumu. Without a single glance spared for the male her pair of arms would dart forth, the base of her palms aiming to smack against his chest.

Her maroon gaze was focused on the earth, but she could still see very easily.

"Checkmate."

If he hadn't avoided the attack, he'd be overloaded on chakra, most likely incapacitated by the amount.* - Sat Oct 17 02:12:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) ran forward, chakra immersing her hands. She started making an attempt to eagerly hold Hideki back from assaulting the male. Her reaction time was on par with Hideki's attacking speed, so hopefully she could hold him back from beating Susumu up further.

The black haired girl honestly wanted to do the same as him, but it wouldn't sit right with her if she watched a fellow shinobi sit and get mutilated; regardless if she disliked him highly, she wasn't willing enough to abandon him. The chakra focused around her hands would -NOT- be jerked into Hideki's frame unless he showed signs of denying her actions and the words that spouted from her mouth subconsciously, without thought, just instinct.

"That's enough."* - Sat Oct 17 02:40:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) turned to face Hideki, the chakra around her hands fading as she extended her right arm out to him briefly, before receding it and peering at Susumu. Mizora was relying on her natural instincts to protect her comrades up until the point that said comrade she was protecting no longer needed it. She'd peer down at Susumu's unconscious figure, holding no pity for him. She'd slowly follow after Hideki out of curiousity, and hope that he was calm. If he wasn't, she'd try taking matters into her own hands by calming him herself.* - Sat Oct 17 02:49:48 2015
