<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) removed a scroll from the confines of her backpouch. The girl would open up the scroll, starting to read the information that the words written in it held. Mizora would get the basis of the jutsu within her mind. After addressing what the technique did, now was time for her to test out it's efficiency. Mizora would fold the scroll up.

She stood to her feet, moving forth abit. After doing so she clenched her gloved hands into tight fists, slowly allowing chakra to course throughout her form at a quicker rate. As the chakra coursed throughout her, she infused it with Lightning-based properties, efficiently surging her chakra to produce flickering blueish-white sparks composed of Lightning chakra around her form. The technique was still unstable, thus she didn't do it as properly as she wished.

She still was far from knowing how to use the technique the way it was supposed to be used. Essentially her usage of it was more subpar than a newbie's usage. The girl would walk back to her original spot, seating herself on the sand.* - Sun Nov  8 21:38:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) felt the need to take a break from trying to learn a Lightning technique. The girl would remove a different scroll, peering at what it contained. Mizora would read and interpret whatever information the scroll contained. It wasn't until she was halfway done understanding the scroll that she realized it was another lightning based technique. The girl could only squint, when realizing it was the Lightning Ball technique.

With a small sigh, she continued to read regardless. It unsettled her when the writing informed her that the ball of lightning could only be produced between two conductive subjects. The girl would remove two kunai knives from her backpouch, placing the scroll within said back pouch. She'd leave a small space between the two kunai, but otherwise faced one blade to the other.

Mizora ran chakra along the blades of each kunai, emitting the kneaded, lightning based chakra from the tips of each blade. The blueish-white chakra coursed throughout the tips of her weaponry, the continously amplifying chakra coursing into that of a perfect, lightning-composed sphere. She pulled the kunai knives away from one another, pulling her arms to her sides and firing hte lightning orb. It was smaller than average.* - Sun Nov  8 21:56:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) aligned one wrist with the other, intersecting them at the same time. In each hand she held a kunai knife. The female coursed chakra throughout each piece of weaponry, all the way to the tip of the metallic weaponry. Small sparks aligned with one another while the blades were across from eachother. Between the sparks formed their collaborative effort, a sphere of lightning-composed chakra.

Her eyes came to a narrow as she tensed up her body. She distanced one kunai from the other, firing hte sphere of lightning off at the vicinity in front of her. The sphere would shoot forth at a sufficient distance before combusting into sparks. Unforunately, the sphere was incredibly slow because Mizora was inexperienced, her chakra control being as inept as her ability to socially interact with others.

She sighed lightly, her gaze sinking to the ground briefly. It seemed she'd have to try once more. The girl intersected her wrists once more, running kneaded Lightning-based chakra down the blade of each piece of weaponry. She allowed the sparks protruding from the tip of each kunai to form a sphere between the tips of the kunai knives. She released the small blueish-white ball of lightning outward, watching as it soared across the air slowly, before it exploded.* - Sun Nov  8 22:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) placed one of her kunai knives within the backpouch, keeping one out. The female would begin to attempt running Wind-based chakra throughout the kunai knife's form. Unfortunately, she could only flow a little bit. She expected a result like this, though. It was fine to her. Mizora would remove one of the scrolls from her backpouch, opening it up and proofreading the title.

The art of funneling wind-chakra into objects.

She'd start reading whatever the scroll contained. The girl wanted to know just how tough it'd be to learn the technique. In addition, she wanted to know how useful it'd be. Lastly, she wanted to make sure just how efficient it'd be in certain situations. Her learning experience was only boosted by the fact that she was rather attuned to the art of interpreting things on a more advanced level.

The black haired female would pick up the kunai knife, having dropped it previously. She'd clench it by the hilt rather tightly, beginning to process a thin layer of wind-based chakra. She ran the chakra throughout the blade's form, allowing said metallic to be immersed in the specified, kneaded wind. The female slashed at the air rather simply after doing this.* - Sun Nov  8 22:20:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) thrusted forth at incredible speeds, her right arm moving to jab him in the nape of his neck and inject chakra into said vicinity, aiming to target the areas of his body most vulnerable to incapacitation with a volley of palm strikes.

"I don't condone to kidnappers."

(15 Attack Speed)* - Mon Nov  9 01:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) noticed that he had activated a doujutsu by the chakra flowing to the tenketsu close to his eyes. "Why?" She'd ask in reference to Izanami's request.* - Mon Nov  9 01:16:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) thrusted her right arm back with only intentions of coiling her hand around his wrist to stop the action. Her near-three hundred and sixty degree vision aided exponentially in this action.

"This is the second time he's crossed the line. I'd rather put him out of commision then kill him." She murmured off near the end of her statements. 

She'd uncoil her hand from around his wrist, if she managed to grasp it in the first place.* - Mon Nov  9 01:23:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) //
"I can't relax with a guy like this around."

She moved forth toward the male, her right arm jabbing forward as she intended to palm strike him directly in the gut, injecting a rather immense amount of chakra into his frame with intentions of knocking him cold right then and there. In what seemed to be an arm movement that bent vision itself, instead of her right arm hitting him, her left arm did. It wasn't an illusion, it wasn't "mindbending".

It was raw attack fluency.* - Mon Nov  9 01:28:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) was the point to her attacking style. She knew that he would attempt to dodge, at which point she thrusted her right arm, pulling her left back in one instant. As her palm strike made contact and her chakra pulsated throughout Shira's form and incapacitated him, she'd be sent reeling backward by the flames. The attack wasn't as damaging as she assumed it'd be. She'd recover midair, landing in a crouched position.

Her strike only held the perfect measure of power to knock him unconscious, but without hindering any vital areas of her victim's body.* - Mon Nov  9 02:11:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) leaned against the object behind her, her hands shoved into her coat. She inclined her head, simply looking up at the ceiling. Chakra flowed to her eyes once more. She ran her left heel across the back of her right ankle in a weak attempt to solve itchiness.

"My bad. I lost myself momentarily. That fire... it knocked some sense into me. So.. you have my gratitude and my apology."

She demonstrated stubborness, a quick fuse and intolerance just moments ago. But now she was demonstrating an apologetic, relaxed tone to her ways. She definitely had some mental impurities about her.* - Mon Nov  9 02:23:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) ogled Bryson with her hollow, maroon spheres.

Her hands were pressed to the sides of her lengthy black coat. Acrimony submerged her facial features. The subtle compliance in her rejoinder to Bryson's hand pressing to her shoulder was contradictory to her gaze. She responded in a light, subliminally defensive manner.

"Basically, you're shaming me for my actions because they're not beneficial to my family's pride and reputation?"* - Mon Nov  9 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: ...Uhh. - Mon Nov  9 02:51:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) 's vacant look was set on Izanami when the young girl began to speak.

It was apparent that Izanami's error-free statement pertubed Mizora significantly. One sign was how she averted her dark red stare numerous times; her eyes were flickering throughout the vicinity in a seemingly futile evasive manuever.

Mizora's stare focused on Bryson for the time being. A look of guilt swarmed her face as she lowered her gaze to the wooden, dark floorboards below her.

"I -am- mentally unstable.." She'd murmur in response to Izanami. Though she was subtly confident of it before.. now it was hitting her full throttle that she had mental issues.

"I guess I'm afraid I can't resolve my issues, either..." She said, presumably thinking out loud. She was saying things that she usually contemplated to herself, and herself alone.* - Mon Nov  9 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) kept her stare focused on the floor.

"If you insist.." She murmured her number-one, phrase of submission.* - Mon Nov  9 03:24:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) bent her knees slightly. She'd smile lightly, a fierce presence seeming to absorb Mizora. The black haired female shot toward Mitsunara, aiming to jab her right arm forward with intentions of punching Mitsunara firmly in the chest right off the bat. She wanted to test out the swordswoman's durability first hand.* - Mon Nov  9 22:30:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) simply smirked. It meant that she could go all out without harming Mitsunara. Mizora wasn't caught off guard by the left-handed, unexpected slash directed to her side.

She suddenly removed a kunai knife her coat pocket via. her left hand, thrusting her arm upright to press the blade of the kunai against Mitsunara's katana, aiming to collide her kunai against the piece of weaponry. She was holding it backwards, so her hand was behind the tool's blade.

Her maroon stare was set upon Mitsunara.

"I can agree."* - Mon Nov  9 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Jiki.. - Mon Nov  9 22:39:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Less work.. - Mon Nov  9 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) watched as Mitsunara thrusted her katana, perceiving the action with her impressive line of sight. Mizora let go of the kunai with her left hand, attempting to jet her left arm forth to coiil her hand around the katana's blade and yank Mitsunara forth, at which point she'd keep her hold, suddenly springing off of the earth and twisting her body midair.

At this point she twirled a few feet above the ground, intending to slam the back of her leg into the medium-point of Mitsunara's side. She had high hopes for Mitsunara grabbing her leg with her free arm.* - Mon Nov  9 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) continued to grasp up against the blade, blood leaking from her palm. In the meantime, the female would aim to take the strike, minor pain jolting throughout her chin and her head in general as it landed. She bent her leg that just struck, sliding it away from the female's side and aiming to slam her heel into the side of her neck. Even if she was durable, Mizora's main goal was to tip her over with the momentum and strength put behind the attack.

It was only then that she would release the blade of Mitsunara's from her grasp, blood leaking from Mizora's mouth even though she didn't take as much damage as one would think. It did more damage due to the fact that Mitsunara had seemed to take advantage of her direction. She was a smart opponent..

Mizora's body would twist about if the heel strike to the side of her neck landed and if she had successfully stopped holding the blade. Her arms thrusted out to the ground below as she wormed her way away from her foe, gaining some distance and tightly grasping her maroon scarf, wiping the blood from her chin with her free hand and then clenching it tight, bending her knees slightly.

A genuine smile plastered itself to her features. She knew that she couldn't bear to hold back in this fight, it didn't seem right to her opponent. Though.. it also didn't seem right that Mitsunara's lust for fighting trumped her own.

"Should I stop holding back and fight the way I'm best at?"* - Mon Nov  9 23:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) smiled. This would be interesting to watch, since her opponent looked to be into pain. Mizora intersected her wrists out in front of her, crossing one arm over the other as chakra swarmed to each of her hands.

She threw her slightly-bent arms to her sides, allowing auras of flame-like, light blue essence to swarm her hands. The essence known as chakra radiated freely around her hands and lower forearms, emanating them.

"This time I'm coming at you first."

Mizora bent her knees, then suddenly jabbed forth, thrusting across the sand at a slightly quicker momentum than one would expect. She would thrust her right arm forth, but her strike was like an optical illusion, while at the same time it really wasn't one.

The black haired female's left palm would strike Mitsunara's instead of her right palm, injecting a mass of chakra into her form. Mizora's raw speed had taken a slight jump the moment that chakra swarmed to her hands. At the same time, it was as though her right arm never un-arched from her side.

(15 Attack Speed.)* - Mon Nov  9 23:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) was familiar with the chakra that manifested the piece of weaponry. She coudlnt' define it, but however she clenched her teeth slightly upon withstanding the slash to her shoulder.

The chakra flaring around her palms dimmed a little, indicating that she had intentions of attacking with less power than she initially was.

Mizora attempted to withstand the pain, thrusting through it with another three attacks directed to non-lethal areas of Mitsunara's torso, intending to seal the tenketsu within the area and deal impressive damage. The last strike was purely to make Mitsunara stagger back.

If the three attacks landed she'd shoot forth, her feet pivoting rapidly on the ground as chakra expelled from every tenketsu of hers. She stopped moving forth once in close enough contact with Mitsunara, intending to produce a massive sphere around her form that would barrage Mitsunara with the friction of raw, rapid moving chakra. This sphere of hers was smaller than average, specifically because she wasn't trying to injure Mitsunara too much.* - Mon Nov  9 23:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I generally prefer not to use this, too.... Heh. - Mon Nov  9 23:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: (( All her chakra feels off- it's not quite right. The closest you can think of is probably that it seems to all be Yin Chakra- but again, not quite.)) - Mon Nov  9 23:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) narrowed her eyes. Mitsunara seemed to be asking in a manner similar to the way she was when Paine was attacking her.

"Yeah."

Mizora clenched her teeth at the pain resonating throughout her shoulder. The byakugan wielder removed yet another kunai, backing up abit to crouch down and grasp the other one rapidly, holding both as her gaze came to a narrow when she peered at Mitsunara.

<This is getting dangerous...>* - Mon Nov  9 23:31:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) only frowned when Mitsunara began to approach rather rapidly. She -definitely- wasn't taking chances colliding with the female. Two kunai would -not- suffice for dealing with a blade of such immense size. She zipped diagonally to Mitsunara's left, proceeding to attempt shooting past her side.

She whipped the two kunai knives from her hands directly toward Mitsunara's ankles! She wasn't a marksman... but damn she had quite some eyes, even without the Byakugan at her disposal.

"Checkmate!"

She attempted to thrust behind the purple-haired female, intending to jab her right arm forth and smash her palm into the female's back, aiming to run enough chakra throughout her form to incapacitate her and knock her to the ground if it connected.

Mizora was still wary, though. She would run evasive manuevers at the slightest sign of a counter to the attack.* - Mon Nov  9 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) knew that by the manner that Mitsunara intended to evade the attack that it wouldn't incapacitate her.

Mizora thrusted her other arm forth when the previous made contact, intending to strike her again with a similar amount of chakra jolting through her.

At this point the byakugan wielder attempted to distance herself.

"Let's hold this off.." She'd state, partially exhausted.* - Mon Nov  9 23:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) allows the chakra flowing to her hands, and eyes, to come to a stop.* - Mon Nov  9 23:58:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) moved forth, extending her hand out to Mitsunara.

"Come on."

A small smile graced Mizora's features.* - Tue Nov 10 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: . . .Perhaps this guy here beside me. . . - Tue Nov 10 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) slung Mitsunara's arm over her shoulders, her other hand swarming with chakra as she unsealed the tenketsu. The chakra around that singular hand faded away once more.

"Uhuh..."* - Tue Nov 10 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) entered the hospital with intentions of gaining medical treatment for herself and Mitsunara, since there were no medics outside.
