<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) tucked her legs beneath her, pressing her back agianst the wall. She buried her face within her gauntlet-adorned hands, sobbing lightly. "I.. I'm tired.. of this.." She'd murmur between her uncontrollable sobs. She was immersed in pools of angst and jealousy where-ever she went. She was lovesick, and she desired the affection but was too afraid of her own personal weaknesses. Mizora feared that any relationship that she would get in would be ruined by her own odd emotions.

"W.. why... my own emotions... they.. they curse me.. " She said, continuing to sob within her hands. She lurched forth, throwing her torso upon the matress as her muffled sobs continued to resonate lowly.* - Sat Oct 31 20:25:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) was sobbing on the bed. She cold feel some frustration building up inside of her. The black haired female lashed out subconsciously before she could conjure a decent response that didn't come off as rude. Her torso arose from the bed as she addressed the male with sadness, which completely converted to anger. Nothing was going through her mind at the moment, only that she wanted to be alone. She didn't want anyone to see her like this. The tears were still streaming as she shrieked at him with her weak voice.

"No! Leave me alone!" She cried out desperately, her hands clenching at the bed sheets.* - Sat Oct 31 20:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) realized what she had done. Her eyes went agape, her lips pressing toether in discomfort as she bit her lip. Mizora shook her head, averting her gaze and simply drifting it to the bed, wet from tears. She seemed defenseless as well as hopeless. Her hands clenched the bed. Mizora spoke through her debillitated voice, which was slightly more composed, even though she was very emotional at the moment.

"N..Nothing.. just.. go away.." She murmured, the statement coming off more coldhearted than it originally was. She was telling him this for not just her own sake, but his as well. The female was only seconds from snapping like she did before; only this time it wouldn't be as lacking, violence wise.* - Sat Oct 31 20:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: Think I'm about to get knocked out... - Sat Oct 31 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) recognized the tone of sympathy being acknowledged by her. Her gaze wouldn't drift away from her lap. The black-haired female clasped her hands together within her lap as an effort to not do anything she'd regret, especially because she was getting the impulse. This time around she was far too depressed, if not embarassed, about the situation at hand. She was growing more distant to his presence as a small stroke of logic ran through her head. She didn't know how he got in here, nor did she know why he came in.

"N.. nothing..."

Her voice was increasingly weak. She could feel her fingers curling into fists, her initially submissiveness, in addition to her timid-looking exterior building up into what seemed to be a hint to her sadness once more converting into anger. She wanted him to go away before she tried to hurt him or herself. Whimpers resonated from her off and on, and her shoulders were very tense. There was no way she could sustain her frustration for this long.* - Sat Oct 31 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) clenched her teeth. It was at the moment that he put his hand on her shoulder that she got a bad vibe, rooted from paranoia and misunderstood social interaction. The female's fist blindly shot up toward his face at full momentum. Her seemingly weak, inferior look diminished in a matter of seconds as she jetted from the bed, aiming to coil her hand around any part of his upper body that she could get a good grasp on, most likely his neck. It was at this moment that, with her application of strength she'd attempt to drive him into the wall and glare at him with her maroon gaze.

"Go away before I try anything else." She'd state, her other palm pressed to the wall to the male's right. There was malice and intended coldheartedness behind her tone. Her words foreshadowed her next actions, which were unpredictable because of her mood. It was this type of quirk about her that she feared of herself, that the quirk would someday get her on someone's bad side; and here she was, shoving someone against a wall because they wanted to help her. She'd cry about it later on, just like she cried about her regretful choices day by day.

Mizora feared herself, because she was aware that her personality could flick like a switch.* - Sat Oct 31 20:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) retracted her hand from around his neck. Chakra flowed to her ocular nerves as she turned her back to him and moved across the room, a gloomy aura surfacing around her. She seated herself in the chair, looking at him with her maroon stare. "Just go, and don't mention this to anyone..." She murmured, her gaze drifting to the floor. Her right hand glided across her face, her fingers conforming to the shapeliness of it as she attempted to remove any signs of her crying.

Her arms hung off her kneecaps, her palms directed to the ground. A look of guilt plastered itself to her rather serious looking gaze.* - Sat Oct 31 21:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) continued to stare at the floor.

"I need to get this under control.." She'd murmur.* - Sat Oct 31 21:14:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) took a quick, well-assessed scan of the vicinity that she could discern chakra from an extended, "zoomed in" view. With rather quick movements she'd exit the courtyard, intending to prepare herself for the throat that had made itself obvious to a majority of Sunagakure. She had an idea in mind as to whom it was, since she already got a whiff of their chakra 'signal'.* - Sun Nov  1 03:04:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) made her way to the vicinity of where an escaped rpsioner resigned. The female seemed ashamed by how Koji seemingly uncontrollably rushed into the fight with no second thought. Having planned her manner of attack, the female would rush toward the prisoner as well. Lacking in the speed department, Koji would be on his own for a few more moments than she intended. With no mid-range or long-range attacks at her disposal the only thing she could rely on would be close-range combat, something that seemed unwise with an opponent of the prisoner's stature.

The female quickly scanned the area with her doujutsu, only slightly relieved by the fact that some of her fellow shinobi had arrived to the place as well. Koji looked as though he was going for the kill right off the bat, so she was as well. Chakra flared around her palms, auras of the flame-like effervescence immersing her forearms. A lack of emotion played onto her features; only a serious gaze used to address the opponent.* - Sun Nov  1 03:19:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: -omit- - Sun Nov  1 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) kept her focus on the male in front of her, even after Koji was sent flying toward Ai. At this point, she had noticed the chakra beginning to spew from every one of Tribus' tenketsu. Being familiar with this mechanism, she would do her best to -not- allow him to perform what he intended. She'd intend to speed up, her hands continuing to swarm with chakra.

Mizora was more than attuned with the male's momentum, so perhaps she'd do better than Koji. That was if she didn't get hit, though. She attempted to maintain a calm and collected approach, analyzing the male's fighting style and his almost lightning-like reflexes. The female bounded off the earth, aiming to strike his chest and direct chakra to his lungs to knock the air out of his lungs with her left palm, her left arm extended outward; her other arm directed itself to the side of his skull, her other palm aiming to surgically inject his frontal lobe with chakra.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) recovered midair from the palm strike. She'd proceed to descend to the ground, bending her knees and taking a rush forth. Chakra surged around her hands once more. Not under any circumstances was she going to allow him to even -stand- any longer.

"You don't belong in jail.. you belong at death's door. That's where you're going tonight."

The chakra buildup definitely frightened her, but she wasn't one to give up from immensity in chakra, because Koji and Tribus could notice that her chakra also appeared to be intense, much more intense than normal for her level, and level of chakra training.

She manifested several handsigns, a clone of her manifested from water proceeding to appear. She'd grasp hold of the clone, whipping it towards the male. Said clone would corkscrew throughout the air intentionally, both Koji and Tribus being capable of noticing that the clone began emitting chakra from it's form. The water clone released a sphere of blue chakra from it's frame, intending to barrage him. In the meantime Mizora kept rushing at him.* - Sun Nov  1 05:51:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) followed the directive and efficiency of Makoto's attacks very easily. With that being said, she intended to be the followup of the midair chin strike. Mizora was impatient, and slightly fatigue'd from the fight, and while Makoto might've wanted to keep going, or Tribus himself, she wasn't taking chances. In her eyes, Tribus needed to die, now!

She bent her knees, proceeding to align herself with the male with a rapid jump, and attempt to palm strike him at full momentum in the frontal lobe with her left hand. In her right hand was a pair of kunai knives, between her fingers. She'd jab her right arm forth, aiming to thrust each kunai knife through either one of his eyes, attempting to ruin them. To end it all, she'd thrust her knee toward his groin, aiming to retract her left arm from the side of his head and knock him to the ground with the knee blow.* - Sun Nov  1 06:14:11 2015

She'd calculated his top speed long ago, and how fast, and strong his attacks were. She knew how strong he was by how he struck Koji. Knowing that he had sight of her, the female cracked her knuckles, her maroon gaze set upon the male's frame with her doujutsu.

"Looking for someone other than your own fellow clan member to kill you?" She'd state.* - Sun Nov  1 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) slowly removed the gauze from her upper cheeks, exposing the veins beneath her eyes. Speaking of her eyes, she removed her gauntlets, using her bare hands to pluck her maroon contacts from her eyes, exposing her pair of white orbs, making her easily identifiable as a Hokuma clan member.

"Then that means you're entertainment as well."

She slowly placed her gauntlets back on, folding her arms beneath her chest. Her mouth was a flat-line, and her gaze was narrowed, though there was no malice behind the half-lidded gaze.

"You aren't making a prison break to entertain us. If you are, then you've truly lost whatever capacity you mentally possessed."

Her lips pursed and she shifted her weight to her right hip, her stance twisting.

"You're selfish for initiating this situation out of boredom of staying in jail. You must've done something horrible for the sake of 'entertainment'. If that's the case, it's no wonder you were in that place."* - Sun Nov  1 07:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) faced away from the male at this point. She continued speaking, though she was well aware of the condensed "ray" of chakra closing in on her. Knowing it'd prove to be terribly damaging, she'd thrust out of harms way, gliding her way across the earth.

"Do whatever you desire. However, you'll deal with me yourself if you kill a white-haired woman with eyes similar to mine, a white-haired male that fancies being nimble and has purple eyes, or a male with a gourd. Slay me now if it's that important to your "cause" for the sake of entertainment."

"Life's thrown crap at me too, and they weren't as bad as what you've gone through, but for me they were equally traumatizing emotionally. My two cents for you are to simply live life rather than try to relinquish it. Because someday, taking lives will make the removal of your own be ten times as painful."

As she reached her location she'd take advantage of the fluency of her movement to break into rotation, proceeding to emit chakra from her tenketsu and immerse herself in a sphere, using the sphere of defense to discern whatever occured outside of it with her Byakugan.* - Sun Nov  1 07:36:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) rubbed the back of her neck. She allowed the chakra flowing to her eyes to dissipate. The veins beneath her eyes dissipated from view as she deactivated her doujutsu. Her pair of white eyes set themselves upon Ai.* - Sun Nov  1 17:09:32 2015

She seemed to have no response to his question for the time being. She scooted her feet outward abit, crouching down as she did such. She stretched her lower legs out, allowing them to hang off the edge of the branch as she sat down on it. Her gaze shifted amongst the other two within the vicinity, before it was averted to the mansion. She still lacked a response.* - Tue Nov  3 17:00:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) swung her legs back and forth lightly. She seemed to be immersing herself in the delightful "aura" that the environment had about it. Though the people were often undesirable in her opinion, the village itself seemed calm and tranquil. She sniffed at the air, taking in the scent of nature itself. The occasional tweet of birds nearby only intensified her calm and collected senses.

Depsite how relaxed she seemed to be, her doujutsu was active. The girl's gaze was captivated by the actions of the others nearby, as though she was expecting the unexpected.* - Tue Nov  3 17:12:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) slowly scooched forth from off of her position in the tree. She'd descend from the tree, landing standing upright. She pressed her back to the tree trunk, folding her arms. Mizora peered up above her, continuing to scan the area with her doujutsu. She peered at her surroundings, allowing her arms to unfold from beneath her chest when noticing that Yonbu was already peering at Rias'.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: There isn't a single sign of blood.. - Fri Nov  6 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) removed her blindfold briefly, peering at it for any details that were important. She wanted to make sure that touching this corpse wouldn't bring her own demise, so that meant she activated her doujutsu, as well.

"I didn't expect to find this.."* - Fri Nov  6 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Wow.. - Fri Nov  6 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: HEllo!  - Sat Nov  7 08:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) nodded with a light wave. She was kneeling on the ground.* - Sat Nov  7 08:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) was fully aware of her surroundings. She didn't address Yan physically, though.* - Sat Nov  7 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) thinks: I miss Konoha already. - Sat Nov  7 08:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...Didn't anticipate seeing you so soon.. - Sat Nov  7 08:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm sure ya' do. He's a good dude. - Sat Nov  7 08:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Ugly. - Sat Nov  7 08:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Seems Mizora has returned... - Sat Nov  7 08:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...The girl in front of us? - Sat Nov  7 08:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Mhmm.. - Sat Nov  7 08:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) stopped kneeling. She'd stand up, shifting her maroon stare back to them. Her stare was as down-to-earth as ever. Though, she didn't speak at all. She only addressed them with a nod and a small, shy smile.* - Sat Nov  7 08:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) thinks: This is the second time I attempted to get in. - Sat Nov  7 08:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) aimed to break into a spin the moment that she saw the handsigns form, in addition to the chakra surging. By the time the female had expelled the domes of Fuuton-based chakra, Mizora was already twirling rapidly, expelling chakra from all of her tenketsu. A spiralling sphere of sky blue tone would emit itself around her form, most likely deflecting, if not dissipating the Fuuton-based chakra upon contact.

Mizora would scan the outer area outside of the spiralling sphere with her Byakugan, intending to see if there were more attacks to come.

<If I die here oh well. I'll be going to a place better than the one I'm currently located in.>* - Sat Nov  7 08:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) says: Ahh. - Sat Nov  7 08:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) says: What is happening here ? - Sat Nov  7 08:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) was well aware of the gap in power between the massive blast of wind and her own sphere of defensive chakra. The wind would easily break through, but negated most of the damage. Thus, she was only consumed by the remaining power that the wind possessed. The wind tore apart at her cloak, revealing her undergarments, her typical outfit. A dry look was on her facial features.

"I thought you were trying to kill me?"

Cuts were noticeable on certain parts of her body, but it seemed the attack didn't harm her that much. Mizora had found a way to fight this female. Judging by how exponential the doujutsu wielder's chakra reserves were... it was a pretty good method.

"If I lose today, then I'm not afraid. Because times are gonna change." She'd state, chakra beginning to flare around her forearms. She suddenly dashed to the right in a diagonal line, forming handsigns as she did so and producing a clone made by pure water. The female thrusted her hand out, clasping the clone and proceeding to whip it toward Marrisa.

The water-composed clone would aim to produce three handsigns and release a dense, pale blue, syrupy liquid upon the female, aiming to bind her in place. Mizora was the -worst- at Ninjutsu, so naturally she only intended to slow Marrisa down, because she was sure that this formidable opponent could manage her way out of this sticky situation.

In the meantime, Mizora's only intentions were to close the distance between herself and Marrisa.* - Sat Nov  7 08:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) thinks: I guess I get to die to someone who has a level of irrelevance more abundant than the sand storms in this land. - Sat Nov  7 08:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm. . .Whoever is trying to get into the village. - Sat Nov  7 09:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Don't let them get in. - Sat Nov  7 09:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: <*Summons an Earth Wall*> - Sat Nov  7 09:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) immediately halted her own handsigns the very moment she saw Marrisa begin to plume her chakra and form handsigns. Mizora would incline the rate of speed that she was moving. She zig-zagged her way to Marrisa, taking a great leap into the air to evade the bullets and beginning to twirl as quick as possible, chakra thrusting outward from her tenketsu. By the time she was close enough to Marrisa the sphere was at it's full size.

Her spinning slowed down as she intended to align her front with Marrisa's, the chakra beginning to dissipate. She shot her right arm out, aiming to get a strike upon the female, even if it was a tap. The chakra around her hands was still intact. The attack wasn't lethal, and if anything it was aimed to stun.* - Sat Nov  7 09:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) thinks: I never want blood on my hands... or else I'd never be able to differentiate myself from these people.. - Sat Nov  7 09:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) was saved from the full brunt of the attack thanks to her sphere of chakra, which'd deflected, if not debillitated most of the Fuuton-composed bullets. Upon taking the attacks, she was pretty-injured at this point, with various points of her body pierced by the compressed wind. Blood seeped from the pierced wounds. She was pulled underground, but not before she attempted to thrust her arm upward with intentions of stopping herself from completely submerging.

Her next expectation for Yan's course of action was decapitation. It looked as though she had lost. Her breathes were mild and her exuberance was draining as she bled out slowly.* - Sat Nov  7 09:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: 10mins and you are good - Sat Nov  7 09:39:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) attempted to expose the proper kanji meaning "forbidden" and "speak" on her neck to them.* - Sat Nov  7 09:41:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) shifted in unease. The pain resonating throughout her body was a result of the piercing wounds adorned throughout her body. She was still slowly losing blood.* - Sat Nov  7 09:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: this nigga sais desert coons - Sat Nov  7 09:44:57 2015

She cocked her head to the left, exposing the kanji on her neck and shifting her gaze to Sanoke out of her peripheral. She was eager to get this seal removed. It was starting to hurt to keep her eyes open.* - Sat Nov  7 09:59:28 2015
