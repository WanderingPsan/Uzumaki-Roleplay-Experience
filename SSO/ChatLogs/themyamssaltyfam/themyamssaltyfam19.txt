<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) slowly removed her hands from her lap. She raised her arms, beginning to consume her miso soup. It tasted perfect. There were no inefficiencies to the taste of the food. Her paranoia kicked in, making her wonder if what she was consuming may've been poisonous.

But how could poison taste so good?

She ate a little faster, but remained as polite as ever with her eating etiquette. Her appetite seemed to have stopped diminishing. The girl halted her consumption briefly, pressing a napkin to her mouth even though there was nothing on it. If she had to rate the food, she'd rate it...

Perfect.

The black haired girl peered at the tea, slowly placing her npakin down before cupping her hands around the mug that contained the beverage. She brought the tip of the mug to her lips, tilting it back and beginning to slowly consume the drink. Her eyes widened slightly when her mouth was immersed in warmth and exceptionally good flavor. The name for this restaurant was misleading, because clearly there was yet another..
