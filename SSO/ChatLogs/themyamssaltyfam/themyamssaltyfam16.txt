An aura of gloom absorbed her, the grip on Chikyu's hand that she had beginning to slip away. She nodded anxiously, murmuring a demoralized "yeah" in response.* - Tue Nov 10 03:48:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) assumed that it was her time to do what she typically did, and that was stop people from getting majorly harmed, or killed. Chakra flared around her lower forearms and hands in the form of pale, translucent, light blue auras. Chakra coursed to her eyes as she thrusted toward Aza. She didn't expect Sanoke to use the cloth binding technique, but that made her window of opportunity better.

Without hesitation she'd aim to jab the tips of her five digits into his stomach, aiming to send a massive jolt of chakra throughout his body, with capabilities of incapacitating the strongest of people.* - Tue Nov 10 04:17:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) approached the binded individual, chakra swarming to her right hand as she pressed the corresponding palm to the clothing, the bind releasing as it came in contact with the chakra.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) was tracking Kurt's speeds easily. In her eyes he hadn't disappeared one bit.

<Nice....>* - Tue Nov 10 21:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: You have a count of ten, or I will open the door by force! Open under the laws of Suinagakure! - Tue Nov 10 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) was strolling around currently.* - Tue Nov 10 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Eh? - Tue Nov 10 21:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) was simply strolling throughout Sunagakure's prominentlly residential districts with intentions of finding a home to purchase.

She spotted a female being launched out of the door to a house, Mizora's head whipping in the direction that the medical kunoichi ran from, even if the black-haired girl had her Byakugan active.

Unlike Marrisa, she was more worried about the female that was sent flying out of the house. She sprinted to Kiyoko's side, kneeling down beside her. She'd attempt to gain the female's attention.

"W-What happened to you!?"

Mizora was appauled by the chakra emanating from within the home, but it was faintly familiar to the male whom she saw fight Ivel. She 'zoomed in' with her doujutsu, gaining sight of the suspect, whom seemed to  have lost his cool again. The same, odd chakra that was oddly attuned with... the vicinity itself.. was emanating from him again. She couldn't put a finger on it, but it made him look like a mini-personification of mother nature. That worried her.

"Marrisa, wai---.." Marrisa had already entered the home.

She looked down at Kiyoko, her left arm attempting to slide beneath her knees and her right attempting to slide to her medium-back, in an attempt to hold her in close proximity, though not overly close. That'd just be weird.

The maroon-eye'd female scanned Kiyoko's frame for signs of injuries other than ones that were blatantly obvious. Mizora scanned the area with her Byakugan, taking note of the two individuals slowly approaching the district.* - Tue Nov 10 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) 

One of the individuals was approaching, while the other appeared to be "pussying out".* - Tue Nov 10 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) noticed that Yan had arrived upon the scene, and judging by the fact that he came to a halt at Kiyoko's side, as Mizora did, it seemed that the byakugan wielder's position was unnecessary at this point in time. Mizora would lower Kiyoko..

"I understand... I'll try and make sure that doesn't happen.. just try to keep calm." Mizora spoke in a slightly more gentle tone.

Mizora had experience with Marrisa's ninjutsu level, and she knew for a fact that there was the possibility of her killing him, whether intentionally or not.

"Hold off on the wires!"

She attempted to jab her left arm forth, aiming to grasp hold of the extended arm. If she successfully latched on she'd attempt to dash to Marrisa's side, at which point she tried to yank Aza toward her, pulling her right arm back and bending it.

She balled her hand into a tight fist, aiming to thrust her arm out with intentions of punching Aza directly in the jaw. The girl knew for a fact that wires wouldn't be enough to rest his anger unless they remained coiled around him for awhile. Mizora was partially acting out of fear. At this point, he was an embodiment of nature itself, with the chakra emanating from his form.* - Tue Nov 10 22:21:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: Huh? Interesting thing to walk in on... - Tue Nov 10 22:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) immediately noticed the movement of his arm. Luckily, it was something she could withstand. Chakra flared to her palms upon noticing Marrisa's aggressive dash forward.

Mizora let go of the beast's arm, intending to dash to Marrisa's side, pivoting on her feet and attempting to face the Jounin, intending to hit her with a right-handed palm strike that'd jolt chakra throughout her frame, hindering her from attack or stunning her with the amount of chakra put into the attack, but not going any further.

At this point, Mizora's other hand jolted out, intending to strike Aza in the stomach with an amount of chakra that made the one directed to Marrisa seem pallor. Unlike with Marrisa, Mizora was trying to knock Aza unconscious straight-forward.
