<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) reappeared in a distant area. He'd immediately coil his arms around the girl, clenching his teeth and slamming his eyes shut.

"Can I really do this..?" He'd murmur..* - Fri Sep 18 22:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: I... can't do this... - Fri Sep 18 22:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) rested his head on her shoulders, his grip on her faltering slightly.

"Why'd I even consider it..?"* - Fri Sep 18 22:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) let her go, sinking to his knees. He presse dhis hands to the ground, looking down at it with wide eyes.

<Why did I just consider killing my own daughter.. ?> He'd think to himself.* - Fri Sep 18 22:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) whimpered slightly, something uncharacteristic to him. Tears fell from the corners of his eyes down to the ground beneath him. His arms arched slightly as he tensed his muscles, his body shuddering. "I... didn't think.. I..I'd cry... in fr.. front of my own k..kid.. damn..." He'd murmur... his strained sobs resonating.* - Fri Sep 18 22:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) felt his emotions suddenly warp immensely. His helpless sobs would slowly turn into uncontrollable chuckles. The tears still fell, but he was feeling completely different from how he looked. He slowly ascended his head, a sickening grin plastered upon his facial features. He'd suddenly slam his left foot firmly upon the surface of the ground, lunging forth and attempting to thrash his hand against her neck and contract it around said neck.

"Hahaha... ! I'm tired of it... the damn despair... Maybe this is what Kiria's wanted... maybe that's why she's been haunting me for so long! She whores me, then she proceeds to want to whore both of our children with her in the afterlife... is that it, Kiriaaaaaaaaaaaaa!?" Ozui said, his maniacal laughter suddenly progressing into rage. As he exclaimed Kiria's name he roared, attempting to thrash Saseki against the tree and pin her there.

His dagger-like, black, abyss-like gaze was more menacing, fierce and piercing then it was before. It seemed he held no remorse for his harsh actions. He was changing, changing into something, or someone undesirable.

A monster.* - Fri Sep 18 22:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) stared fiercely into her eyes, though even he could recognize her emotions even with the impassive manner that she acted. When he looked directly at her face he saw Kiria, and it simply made it harder to do what he intended. The male's eyes noticeably widened, and the bloodlust seeping throughout his orbs would turn into regret and guilt as he saw the tears drain away from her eyes.

Ozui's grip around her neck faltered, all the strength put behind it weakening. He'd pull his arm away, allowing her to descend from being pinned against the tree. The black haired male would stagger slightly, moving back a single left footed step. He barely knew himself anymore. He desperately wanted to feel what love was like, but the harsh problem was that in order to experience that he'd have to slay his own child.

<What did I just do...?> He'd question himself in his thoughts, in shock as he looked upon his daughter.* - Fri Sep 18 22:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) reacted rather swiftly the moment the smoke bomb was thrown down. He was still at a state of shock, but he couldn't risk having all of Kiri know that he tried to murder his own daughter. With quick thinking the male would increase the malleability of his hair, manipulating it to extend outward and hopefully bind Saseki in place.* - Fri Sep 18 23:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) would wait for the smoke to clear, keeping the hair bind in place while doing such. He was slowly recuperating his mental bearings.

"Renkin... she.. told me she wanted you dead... before her and I could be together.. she said I had to choose between her and you.. so..." He'd look into Saseki's eyes firmly.

"I chose you."* - Fri Sep 18 23:08:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) sustained his hair bind. He'd step forth with gentle steps, crouching down and wrapping his arms around the girl. "I almost lost myself. Lost to my own lack of sanity. I remembered my third rule though.. my third rule for myself. To never forsaken my family." He'd state, before looking down at the girl. "Also.. stop holding in your emotions, it's okay to let them out. If you don't, you'll lose yourself."

"Let it go. You can drown me in your fury or your sadness. Just let it all out." The male said firmly, rocking the girl within his grasp. His chill meter had went from 20/50, to -50/50, to 50/50 within minutes.* - Fri Sep 18 23:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) peered at her.

"I refuse. Come here. I won't harm you. Never again. I promise." He'd state.* - Fri Sep 18 23:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) followed, clasping her hand with his own and pulling her back.

"I don't care if you don't believe me. You don't need to believe me to know that I love you. And I won't leave you be until you let go of your pent-up emotions." He'd slide his arms around the girl, attempting to pull her into his hold.* - Fri Sep 18 23:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: I refuse to let you lose control of your emotions because I set a bad example by doing that. - Fri Sep 18 23:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) godmod doj no jutsu. He'd proceed to pull her close.

"You're not going to walk around with your heart on your cheek, dear." He'd state.* - Fri Sep 18 23:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) released the hair bind at this point, embracing her in his arms.

"Tell me how you feel. About anything and everything. Even people."* - Fri Sep 18 23:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) wasn't gonna let her run off and say he almost killed her. He'd continue to look down at her intensely, attempting to user his fierce-ass gaze to pry her emotions out of her.* - Fri Sep 18 23:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) 
Staring contest.* - Fri Sep 18 23:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) felt like he was trying to fucking talk to a mirror. He swore that her attitude contrasted with his when he was in his shitty moods. That would imply he wasn't in one all the time, though. The male would ascend her position within his lap, keeping his arms securely wrapped around her. He'd kiss his daughter's cheek slightly, pressing his back to the tree. It'd require lots of effort to repair this broken father~daughter relationship of theirs.* - Fri Sep 18 23:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) was understanding this situation very well, he was just too stubborn to give up at it. The male would do the duty of taking her to the hospital and getting her a room, leaving before medical personnel could question why she was there and why her neck was purple. He himself would go somewhere to think things over and contemplate life.* - Fri Sep 18 23:46:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) set her down on a bench, purchasing a can of soda, as well as some coffee, then sitting down beside the girl.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) observed the girl's neck for any marks. If he saw any, he'd brush his fingertip across the area, applying minimal pressure. The male would hoist the girl into his lap, pulling out a small comb and running it through her hair, grooming the girl's flowing strands and bundles.* - Sat Sep 19 21:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) stopped combing her hair, sealing the comb within one of the many tatoos strewn upon his right arm. He'd coil his arms around her, pulling her close and pressing her head to his shoulder with his right palm, pressing the small girl's body against his upper and mid-torso. He'd whisper to her, resting his chin on the top of her cranium.

"I'm sorry."

It seemed that he was saying that more often.* - Sat Sep 19 21:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) lifted her some more, so that her head was alined with his own. He'd lurch forth, pressing his lips to the child's cheek, proceeding to lower her within his grasp. This time his chin wouldn't come in contact with her skull, considering he'd harmed it previously wtih his rash actions. A plume of smoke would cloak himself and the girl as he rose to his feet, black robes draping over his figure and engulfing Saseki in warmth, as she was within the confines of it's perimeter.

"We're headed out of Kirigakure." He'd state, before toward the gates, maintaining his affectionate hold on her. It seemed that he didn't really acknowledge her lack of speech. It made things easier.* - Sat Sep 19 21:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) sent out several shadow clones, a trio in specific, to scout the area.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) had found a sufficient place to avoid others. He'd eagerly push his way into the home, guiding Saseki to what seemed to be the washroom.

"Wash yourself up." He'd state, urging her into the room before heading away, resting atop a bed.* - Sat Sep 19 21:18:56 2015

"Still don't want to talk?"* - Sat Sep 19 21:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) would attempt to rest his hand beneath her chin, lifting it slightly so her face would look toward his own. His gaze would focus on hers, attempting to draw her focal point in on him.

"Saseki."* - Sat Sep 19 21:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) wondered if he strangled her too hard. Then again, she was talking after it occured.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) suddenly increased the speed at which he lurched, headbutting the shit out of her, but attempting to throw his arm behind her and catch her if he had succeeded, attempting to save her from her own decent to the ground.* - Sat Sep 19 21:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) took the entirety of the attack, clenching his teeth. Blood drained from between his teeth, as he breathed heavily at the pain overwhelming him. He'd tear the blade out, gagging slightly and spewing blood off to the side, taking two slow steps toward the unconscious girl. "I blame... this world.... for my insanity.... but I blame myself.... for letting it control me.. I've been a pawn... of my own madness... for too long..!" Ozui said through clenched teeth, his left arm wrapped around the front of his stomach, blood drenching his wrist and forearm.

He'd hold the katana in his hand. "I.... I tried... but... trying isn't enough... for failures in the world...." He'd murmur, chuckling slightly, barely lifting the sword over his head. "We'll... see your mother and brother... together.. soon enough.. I'll save you from the treatment of this world... even if I don't go to the same place you're going..." Hot tears flowed down his cheeks, his right arm shuddering.

"E..Even if you don't forgive me... I'll always love you..... because you're my daughter... Saseki... Okami.. Kimura.." He'd whisper in a strained voice, coughing up more blood. The male would throw his right arm down in front of him, shoving the blade through his daughter's chest, surely inflicting damage that'd be enough to render her dead before she could wake. With the last of his strength he'd tear the katana, drenched with himself and Saseki's blood from the girl's torso, whipping it to the wall nearby and descending, having lost the strength to stand.

He slammed his hands against the floor, stopping himself from falling upon Saseki. The male would sloppily coil his arms around the girl, his tears soaking her face as he embraced her, both of them laying upon the floorboards. "Let me... hug you one more time...... before I don't see you anymore.... I know we're not ending up in the same place... not in the afterlife..." Ozui would murmur. He always had evil in his heart, selfish evil. And now it was the reason why he was dying, and why he was taking his daughter with him.

"Heh... maybe I'll rebirth... into a father... that's better than the one that I've tried to be......" He'd state, his eyes slowly shutting. Flashing memories of his past engulfed his sight. They weren't in order at all. The last image he saw was himself, Kiria, Orihara and Saseki sitting back within their home in Sunagakure, filled with the happiness that'd left his life long ago. He cherished the image until his consciousness was flooded with white as he died.* - Sat Sep 19 22:27:12 2015
