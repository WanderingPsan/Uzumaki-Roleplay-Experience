<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) felt her mouth go agape. She wasn't eager for this at all. The brunette would feel a shudder course throughout her body as she spoke rather timidly. "I...I'm... not sure that... I want to do this.." She'd utter to the male, falling victim to his eager actions. A look of displeasure ran across her facial features, and her mouth was curled into a frown. Her muscles tensed up as well.* - Mon Sep 28 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) whimpered. Her hazelnut gaze filled with fear and neverending displeasure set itself upon the male. "N..No.." She whimpered, attempting to remove herself from her close proximity with the male. The most that the brunette could muster physically was constant disruption to his actions as she squirmed in his grasp. Without her cloak, the only things restricting him from bare access to her frame was a pair of khaki's and a grey hoodie.* - Mon Sep 28 02:12:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) attempted to lurch her head back, trying to pull away as much as possible. Her hands were pressed to his shoulders as she desperately tried to push him away. Her legs pressed together closely. Tears gathered at the corners of her eyes. Only whimpers and unsettled, murmured "No's" resonated from the twenty year old.* - Mon Sep 28 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) sobbed lowly, dragging herself beside her gourd and coiling her arms around it. The item seemed to be her only remedy for most of her emotional problems. Once regaining some of her bearings she'd wrap her figure in her cloak, pressing her body against her gourd once more. It'd take quite awhile before her crying would come to frequent sniffles, before she'd become completely silent.* - Mon Sep 28 02:25:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) shook her head, her right arm submerged between her legs. It probably wouldn't be noticeable since her cloak was draped over her form. The brunette shuddered, her hazelnut gaze drifting to the floor below.* - Mon Sep 28 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) shook her head, whispering.to the male.

"N..No... it's not your fault... it's mine for being too weak... to stop it.." Her shudders had yet to falter.* - Mon Sep 28 02:36:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) lifted her arms slightly over her head, allowing waves of sand to seep from her gourd. The grains of sand would compress themselves into a platform that'd gather beneath Pandora's footing, suspending her in the air.* - Tue Sep 29 21:44:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) nodded, even if such a gesture seemed to be a facade. Her hazelnut gaze set itself upon Rymei's stare. Her responses would surely become more subtle after Rymei poked her.* - Wed Sep 30 02:46:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) lifted her arms from beneath the cloak. Waves of sand grains seeped from the gourd, compressing as a platform beneath Rymei, which elevated her off the ground.

Her face cracked. Quite literally. Some of it chipped away. Her hazelnut stare drifted up to the male blankly.* - Sat Oct  3 04:47:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) leaned forth some, her tongue protruding from her mouth. She'd wrap her tongue around the tip of his member, her saliva lubricating it. Pandora would move forward some, clearly a novice at actions like these. She'd allow a decent portion of his shaft to enter her mouth, soaking it in her saliva as she suckled on his member. A look of discontent consumed her facial features.* - Sat Oct  3 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) gagged upon the length of his erection coursing it's way past her mouth and down her throat. Her lips contracted down upon his shaft, as though she was smothering it in kisses. She had no ill intentions with performing the action. If anything, she wanted to get this over with as quick as possible.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) slammed her eyes shut, her hands clenching tightly at his pants legs. Pandora continued to suckle on his rod, her tongue swirling around it's perimeter as she bobbed her head continously. She was having an immensely hard time dealing with his sexual tolerance. Pandora's hazel gaze was shifted to the floor nearby. The brunette just wanted it over already.* - Sat Oct  3 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) coughed raucously. She'd allow the white liquid to drain from her mouth down from the corners of her lips. Her hazelnut gaze was filled with displeasure.

"Please...not now.." She'd utter.* - Sat Oct  3 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) gazed at him with a wide gaze.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) removed her sand gourd, resting it against the wall to the cavern. The platform of sand she was sitting on parted into waves which flowed into the gourd. She'd approach the shore of the body of water, attempting to focus well-proportioned chakra to the soles of her feet. She'd extend her right leg outward in front of her, allowing it to displace the water and then proceed to dip down beneath it. She'd withdraw her wet foot from the water.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) sighed. It seemed that she would have to put a little more effort into the task at hand. Pandora attempted to refine the manner in which she concentrated the chakra to her feet. For one, the chakra being concentrated to her feet was disproportionate. She wasn't balancing the amount of chakra she had concentrated to her soles.

In addition, it seemed that the girl had also failed to use enough chakra to gain full access to the technique. The brunette female would proceed to concentrate more chakra, attempting to level it evenly throughout the soles of her feet. She would extend her right leg out, slowly un-arching it down toward the surface of the water.

Pandora would press her foot firmly to the surface of the water, surprised when she didn't displace it. Pandora would walk forth, simply stepping across the water several times before standing on the other shore. She'd stare at Edge with her hazel eyes of eager.* - Sun Oct  4 04:50:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: How are you feeling, Kohaku? - Mon Oct  5 23:51:53 2015

"You're such an odd individual... might deprivation of affection be the reasoning?"* - Tue Oct  6 00:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) simply smiled, allowing Kohaku to remove herself from the embrace.

"My actions of affectionate are devoid of ill intention. You'll soon grow accustomed to the negative aspects of this environment." She'd state.* - Tue Oct  6 00:17:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: That's up to Edge. - Tue Oct  6 00:26:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Try. - Tue Oct  6 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Nahhh. - Tue Oct  6 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I'd prefer a real one. - Tue Oct  6 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) allowed sand to seep from her gourd. Said sand would press itself to Kohaku's broken leg, in addition to her broken arm. The sand covered every aspect of her arm and leg, then slowly redefined it's own texture, accentuating that of a normal cast. The sand adopted a cast-like appearance, save for it's tanned hue.

More sand seeped from her gourd, manifesting into the shape of a pair of crutches beside Kohaku.* - Tue Oct  6 00:28:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) thinks: I'm sure I could make dildos out of sand. Or condoms. Condoms would be deadly... - Tue Oct  6 00:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) lifted her arms outward in front of her, directing her chakra to the crutches made of sand. The crutches would thrash together, forming into that of a platform. Said platform would descend toward Kohaku. Pandora herself would guide the girl atop the platform, then proceed to apply more sand, allowing herself and the temporarily crippled individual to sit upon the circular object of highly compressed sand.* - Tue Oct  6 00:34:33 2015
