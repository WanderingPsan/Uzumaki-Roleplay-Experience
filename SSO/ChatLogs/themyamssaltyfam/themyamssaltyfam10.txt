<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) arched her arms, balling her hands into tight fists and extending her arms out from beneath her cloak. She'd menacingly glare at him, her maroon gaze peeking from above her knuckles, her fists in front of her face. "Overconfident... asshole... you're just like Susumu.. you're just like Reguel.. you're just like every damn asshole in this village!" She'd exclaim, suddenly sprinting directly for him with nothing more than emotion fueling her irrational actions.

Her arms slightly parted as she ran at him, her right arm jetting outward as she aimed to straightup punch Sanoke in the jaw with bone-rattering power put behind it. It was clear that this was only happening because she was -very- frusatrated with the whole situation.* - Sat Oct 24 03:58:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) perceived his attack -very- quickly. She'd suddenly attempt to recede her arm, then shoot her other forth, attempting to directly -smash- her fist against his chest. Her intentions were to strike before Sanoke could hit her. She was intending to knock the wind out of him as he intended to do so to her. If this was her success, she'd proceed to flare chakra around her hands.

With extra momentum to her attacks she'd rapidly start to throw palm strikes, aiming to deal heavy damage to him but not lethally impair him. Rather, she'd try to knock the breath out of him -again- just as he was beginning to recuperate it. Her intentions were to palm strike him a total of three times, her last strike coming from her right palm.

If the flurry of attacks was successful she'd bend her left arm back completely and shove it forward, aiming to smash her hand against his chest and blow him back with the force of extra-chakra applied.

"OF ALL THE STUPID! ASININE! SHARK-JUMPING BULLSHIT!" She'd hollar madly, kicking forth at him to bust his shit more.* - Sat Oct 24 04:09:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) took note of the performance of the one handsign, in addition to his quick retreat from close range. With her near three hundred and sixty degree vision she'd perceive his reappearance, and rotate on her heel and begin to shoot off. She'd skid to a quick stop, grinding the soles against the earth to halt herself. She'd breath heavily out of frustration, her fury-filled gaze debillitating when she peered at Mirai.

The chakra flaring around her hands would dissipate, but the chakra flowing to her ocular nerves wouldn't. It became obvious that she'd gotten the time to train her chakra reserves, which were double the average for her proficiency in her reserves, and skill level. Her maroon stare would simply drift to the earth below as she remained silent, refusing to initiate eye contact with anyone, even though she still possessed her impressive vision.

"Impressive.." She'd whisper.* - Sat Oct 24 22:23:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) smiled lightly, Mizora's hand seeking itself from inside the white cloak draped over her. She'd wave in return, watching with her pair of maroon irises as Kurotsuki began to form kanji within the sand. She was slightly intrigued by the manner that the female responded. Mizora would crouch down on her knees, her right arm extending out slightly, as she decided to mimic the way that Kurotsuki responded to her in a friendly manner.

She'd press her finger against the grains of sand, forming necessary kanji for a response to Kurotsuki's greeting. 'I happen to be doing fine, I hope the same goes for you; you communicate pretty uniquely.' She'd refer to Kurotsuki's usage of the sand to interact by writing kanji. A smile overlapped Mizora's initially pursed lips.* - Sat Oct 24 22:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) says: Well, hello there. - Sat Oct 24 22:50:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) thinks: I told them she'd be back in a month.. can't they just leave her be..? - Sat Oct 24 22:56:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) seemed to be at ease, judging by how her shoulders lowered and she pressed her butt to the back of her ankles to sit. She'd smile lightly, allowing a look of relief to immerse her. Mizora would proceed to allow the chakra flooding her ocular nerves to dissipate to no chakra at all being focused to her eyes. She was good at perceiving bad handwriting, but it made it easier with Kurotsuki's legibility.

She would set her pleasant, maroon gaze upon Kurotsuki, watching as she performed the gesture that indicated she was mute. Mizora was filled with what seemed to be remorse, as a look of anxiety took over her facial features. She'd place a cuffed hand over her own mouth, lowering it abit. "You're mute? I'm sorry!" She'd state, still panicking about her imitating the Dokugiri girl's method of communication even though she seemed to show no offense to it. The Hokuma female seemed had no teasing manner behind her actions, but even then that didn't put her qualm to a halt.

Letting all of this go through her mind, her burst of sentiment had settled itself, and she seemed almost as composed as she was before. The female would smile lightly, a hint of shyness to the genuine action as she introduced herself, this time speaking in her voice, ordinary for her age, but slightly more calming and quiet.

"I'm Mizora of the Hokuma, it's nice to be acquianted with you as well." She'd say in response to Kurotsuki's last message within the sand.* - Sat Oct 24 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) was more relieved by the fact that Kurotsuki showed her that she took no offense to Mizora imitating how she 'spoke'. The maroon eye'd female would sigh lightly, feeling as though her friendly interaction with Kurotsuki just so happened to be spontaneous. Mizora would peer down at the female's finger, tempted to wince herself upon seeing them in general.

The female would allow her palm to face upright, so the female could use it as a substitute for the blister-causing sand. The Hokuma would smile lightly, a nod showing that she acknowledged the tracing of the kanji that Kurotsuki formed. Not only did she seem comfortable with Kurotsuki's presence, but also a small part of her allowing the female to use her palm instead was that she didn't want to see her suffer while trying to communicate. Mizora would verbally express her feelings about coming to find out Kurotsuki's opinion on her previous actions.

"You aren't? That's good... uh.. so what've you done most of the time? Seems like no one interacts with you." She'd ask, peering around the courtyard. The focal point of her attention would redirect itself to the Dokugiri girl once more. She honestly hadn't heard about the "Dokigiri". Perhaps it was a nice, special clan?* - Sat Oct 24 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) perceived the kanji that Kurotsuki was writing rather easily. Mizora's hand was a little smaller than average, but it was unharmed and her skin maintained it's milky, soft exterior. The feeling of Kurotsuki's finger running upon her palm tickled Mizora slightly, but she showed no signs of it actually impairing her sense of awareness.

She'd smile back softly each time she saw that Kurotsuki did so. The Hokuma felt as though it was safe to inform her with more information than she told anyone else. Social interaction was comforting, regardless of how bad Mizora was at it. "I'm a shinobi too!~ I've been a shinobi for... two or three months I guess? I've mostly lazed around though... so it seems you're the more productive one here.." She'd whisper in response to Kurotsuki, giggling a little bit.* - Sun Oct 25 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Reguel was your visit okay? - Sun Oct 25 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) seemed to sense the angst and large amount of negative emotions emanating from Kurotsuki. Mizora would attempt to clasp the female's hand and place her other over it, smiling toward her. She'd release the grasp once it seemed the female was less tensed than she initially was, allowing her to trace more kanji along the shape of her palm.

"It's fine. And even if I could best you, you're still more active than I was a few weeks back. I'm a little less prone to laziness now." She'd whisper to her, smiling brighter, but the gentleness was still there. The genuine manner that she showed affection to Kurotsuki was practically immersing her. There was no sense of 'fake' to her gestures when they were directed to the Dokugiri.

"What's your profession? I'm pretty good at hand-to-hand combat, I guess."* - Sun Oct 25 00:38:24 2015
