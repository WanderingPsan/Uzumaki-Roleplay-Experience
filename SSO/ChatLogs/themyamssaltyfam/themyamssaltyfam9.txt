The Hokuma clan member would surge the chakra within her ocular nerves after perfroming the handsigns. After surging the chakra, her rather dark pair of red contacts grew slightly brighter. The red bandages on her upper cheek bones concealed the veins that would've formed beneath her optics.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) would grasp onto Madelyn by her collar. If the female was capable of removing herself from the grasp Mizora would take a leap, chakra surrounding her hands, soaring above them, and beginning to rotate rapidly as she descended toward them. Once calculating the range of her technique, she would become aware that the technique would be more than capable of striking both of them.

In any case, a rotating sphere would surround the female, consistently striking Mirai and Madelyn with the rapidly gyrating force of chakra. It was -way- too little force to kill, and if anything there was only enough force applied to knock some sense into the two siblings, if not knock them unconscious.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) simply approached the two individuals, well aware of Reguel's movements towards her; she had near 360 degree vision regardless. She'd -easily- perceive any re-adjustments to the arc of his attack, and thus the moment he came in close enough contact she'd thrust forward in a rush of movement, attempting to throw her right arm out.

In one -rapid- movement Mizora would thrust her arm forth in a manner that'd allow her to evade the swipes of his chakra-engulfed hands and strike him at the same time. Her strike was directed to his appendix, as she attempted to knock the air out of him with chakra alone.

"You're going down."

Mizora would suddenly allow the chakra around her hands to fade, as she shoved her arms up near her face, her knuckles facing the area in front of her, as she balled her hands into -tight- fists. Her arms were completely arched, and she'd slowly swerve left and right, the momentum between this weaving increasing rather rapidly as she moved toward him.* - Fri Oct 23 23:39:56 2015

With quick movements she'd zig-zag toward the male, with clear intentions of avoiding Reguel's trio of senbons. The female would briskly take a glance at him face-to-face, only inches away from his face. Her face would be the last thing he'd see before four knuckles would hopefully smash into his right cheek, most likely whipping his head to the right.

She wasn't done with just that, though. Mizora would suddenly pull her left arm back, throwing her right arm up and attempting to punch him in his left cheek, knocking his head the other way. Her entire torso would cock to the direction that she punched him from. She'd barrage him with endless punches to the cheek, suddenly weaving to the left as she pulled her right arm back, arching it completely and jetting it forward.

At full power, she'd aim to smash her fist into his jaw one last time, with certainty that he'd be -thrown- into the earth from the pure strength put behind the attack.* - Fri Oct 23 23:53:36 2015
