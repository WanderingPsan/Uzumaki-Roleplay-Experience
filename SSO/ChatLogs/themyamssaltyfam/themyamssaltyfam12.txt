<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) wasn't one to get involved with situations that appeared not to be of her concern, but none the less she had little to no intentions of watching a fight unfold. The female would sprint in front of Kyubishu, proceeding to stand in front of the male, her gaze twisting to address Kana. Even with the blindfold covering her maroon stare, tension rose from her very form.

Her arms slid from her cloak, exposing a part of her outfit; a pair of red and black fingerless gauntlets concealing her forearms. Mizora's right arm thrusted upright as she removed her blindfold, casting it aside and peering at Kana with her piercing stare.

"Stop now."

The statement was simple, but the malice behind it was amplified by her body language. She was tensed and ready to fight if it was necessary.* - Sat Oct 31 02:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: That's it, the fight is over.  - Sat Oct 31 02:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) whispers: I've overrestimated you if you honestly believe that. She's going to attack again at a moment's notice. I'll take whatever's necessary to ensure your protection. - Sat Oct 31 02:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: What do you mean, 'my protection'? What's up with her? I know I'm a blood thirsty demon when I get into it. But, is there a reason why she's like this? - Sat Oct 31 02:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Violet... do you even know where your housei s anymore? - Sat Oct 31 02:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) whispers: Tell me, what is she? - Sat Oct 31 02:49:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) whispers: You're speaking like she's an extremely dangerous foe. - Sat Oct 31 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Oh man.... - Sat Oct 31 02:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: I clearly wanted you to stop complaining over something so feeble. - Sat Oct 31 02:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: People have different personalities and reactions to things. - Sat Oct 31 02:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: What you think is 'feeble' means something to someone else. - Sat Oct 31 02:51:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Fucking asshole. - Sat Oct 31 02:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) removed her cloak, throwing it toward Violet. The throw was perfect for allowing the cloak to conceal the carrot topped girl's frame. While the cloak soared throughout the air, it was the perfect conceal for Mizora's movement. In brisk movement she'd attempt to thrust her right arm forth, aiming to ball her hand into a tight fist and smashed it into Kana's stomach, aiming to hit her with enough strength to make her smash into the wall and ricochet off of it.

"Because I said so."* - Sat Oct 31 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) whispers: ( 3 Guards, Base stats of 9, 10 Attack Speed, 9 Reflexes. - Uptown Realest ) - Sat Oct 31 03:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) whispers: ( Raging Waves, Mud Wall, Earth Flash, Great Breakthough. - Uptown Realest ) - Sat Oct 31 03:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) approached the gates of Kirigakure within a caravan. She'd exit said caravan, moving toward the entrance of the village, a black blindfold concealing her maroon stare. She was aware of the presences of the trio of guards at the gates, but she'd have to maintain her disguise as a blind woman. Her lips were pressed together lightly. Her only intentions were to enter the village, at this point.

<Going back to Sunagakure would be suicidal. I'd be running into death if I went back. Not to mention I'd look pathetic and fake all the while if I did survive.> Mizora thought to herself.* - Sat Oct 31 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: ILOL - Sat Oct 31 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) lifted her right arm to her face, removing her blindfold and allowing it to fall. She turned her back to the village briefly, only to be struck by the attacks. A tingling sensation was left in her body, and not only that but she was partially wet, and her frame was covered in minor cuts. The cloak around her was now torn to shreds and burnt on the ends, falling from her form in pieces.

Without a word or sign of reaction she reapproached the caravan, intending to leave for Sunagakure.* - Sat Oct 31 03:50:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) approached the courtyard, her figure covered in minor cuts. Her cloak was gone without a trace.

"Yeah... hey, Mirai." She'd state. Her voice was a little more composed.* - Sat Oct 31 04:10:01 2015
