<br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) help* - Sun Aug 30 13:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) exhaled under his breath slightly. The male's right arm emerged from within the bflack cloak draped over his form. Ozui produced a thin katana from a large plume of smoke in front of him. He narrowed his eyes, gazing fiercely off in front of him. The male'd proceed to emit a mass of chakra into the katana's blade, producing a thick aura of flames over the blade.

He'd rush forth, thrusting the blade out in front of him. He'd proceed to rapidly slash at the air, moving fluently along with the piece of weaponry.* - Sun Aug 30 15:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) temporarily strapped his katana to his form. He'd then proceed to leap into the air, forming the Clone handseal. From a plume of smoke at his side emerged a shadow clone. His shadow clone flicked it's right leg outward, kicking him away. Both of them removed their katanas from their forms. Ozui swung in a deadly arc aimed to his upper left. The shadow clone slashed forth, parrying Ozui's attack.* - Sun Aug 30 15:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) landed on the ground, across from his shadow clone. Both of them shot forth within an impressive rate of speed. They slashed toward one another rapidly, parrying eachother's attacks and swerving around one another to gain a useful upper hand in the battle. Both Ozui and his shadow clone performed backflips, skidding across the ground. Ozui slid his hand across the dull edge of the blade, erupting the long blade of metallic in flames. He rushed forth, his katana at his side, his hands coiled tightly around the blade's hilt.* - Sun Aug 30 15:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) watched as his clone engulfed it's own katana in an aura of thick flames. They parried eachother even faster than they initially were. Ozui put his senses to the maximum, using his sense of smell, his hearing, his sight, and especially his slight ability to anticipate his clone's attacks and counter them in a corresponding fashion. Ozui swung diagonally to the left to counter his shadow clone's diagonal slash aimed to the right. The strength put behind their swings resulted in both of them being pushed back.* - Sun Aug 30 15:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) crouched down slightly, arching his legs. He then rushed forth as fast as possible, shooting to the right in a straight line when his shadow clone least expected it when it tried to impale his left arm. He dashed to the left in a straight line, directly toward his shadow clone. Before the shadow clone could counter the attack he thrashed the dull end of his blade into it's side, causing blunt damage to it. The shadow clone jumped back, holding it's side. Ozui simply glared.* - Sun Aug 30 15:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) formed a series of handseals then rushed forth, leaping into the air. He performed two quick somersaults, attempting to swing down upon his shadow clone. His shadow clone quickly impaled him, though the sloppy attack was a feint. A log took Ozui's place, as he reappeared behind the shadow clone, dashing toward it rapidly. He extended his right arm out in front of him, a seal on his palm.* - Sun Aug 30 15:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) smashed his palm against the clone's back, watching as the sealing formation spread upon the clone's cloak as he clenched his fingers against the fabric of the black robes. "Bang." He murmured. From his palm, his flaming katana was summoned, jerking through the shadow clone's torso. He pulled his hand away, leaping back as the clone vanished in a plume of smoke. The katana dropped to the ground, the aura of chakra engulfing it's thin blade dissipating from visage.* - Sun Aug 30 15:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) formed the Tiger handsign, producing a massive plume of chakra within his throat. He released a fierce amount of chakra kneaded into flames from his gullet. The flames were formed into that of a giant, dragon-head composed of orange heat. The dragon-head shot forth rapidly, consuming the area in front of him in flames. The male huffed tiresomely, dropping down beside Saseki and slowly beginning to recuperate from the immense exhaustion of his chakra.* - Sun Aug 30 15:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) drifted his gaze from the area in front of him to the white haired girl nearby, then toward the boy he identified as an acquintance of hers. He had no knowledge of them being siblings, even if it wasn't biological. His eyes narrowed slightly, his coal-colored orbs drifting off to the space in front of him once more. The male extended his right arms out in front of him, as he formed the Ram handseal, vanishing in a tempest of grains of sand rotating around his thin, grim-looking figure.* - Mon Aug 31 02:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) was unsure if he was -really- being confronted by a bald, tanned female in her birthday suit. The male blinked, his eyes uncharacteristically widened. The male's right arm extended out from beneath the tattered, black cloak draped over his form. He pointed off to the southwest with his thin, gloved pointer finger, remaining quite puzzled as he did so.* - Mon Aug 31 10:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) threw his right arm forth in her direction, yanking his hand around her wrist, then proceeding to pull her forth. He'd then shoot his left arm outward, balling his hand into a tight fist. From that point he'd aim to press his knuckles into her stomach with intentions of stunning her.* - Mon Aug 31 10:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) blinked with his narrowed, dagger-like gaze. From a gray plume of smoke would emerge his sheath, clenched tightly by his hand. He'd whip his arm outward, attempting to thrash the mostly plastic, yet metal reinforced sheath atop the individual's bald, shiny globe of a head.

"Sit."* - Mon Aug 31 10:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) pressed his gloved palms firmly against one another, building up chakra burrowed within him. From his mouth he spewed the plume of chakra, having kneaded it into orange flames. Said flames shot forth in a continous, ever-expanding stream. His hands parted, his left hand lifting toward his mouth as he coiled his thumb and pointer finger around the most thin part of the stream of flames, concentrating the chakra while doing such.

His right arm concealed itself within his tattered, black clothing. His arm emerged once more, his hand clenching three shurikens, one between each of his pair of digits. He extended his arm out in front of him in a quick, whipping motion, releasing the trio of shuriken from between his gloved digits. The shurikens whipped forth, spinning throughout the air in very close proximity to Ozui's ever-proceeding stream of highly compressed chakra.

Instead of setting the ninja stars ablaze as he intended, the sharp weaponry slowly began to crumble away as it remained in close proximity to his flames, being incinerated.* - Mon Aug 31 11:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) removed a special type of chalk from the confines of his space time ninjutsu. While it happened to be the chalk that easily pissed anyone that used it off, it was useful for writing sealing formations. He wrote small sealing formations on the palm of each of his gloves, then proceeded to write small sealing formations on specified areas of his location. He wrote one as close as possible to the cactus parallel to him, then one next to his current location, then finally one diagonal to his current location. Of course, this was written on the solid ground hidden beneath the sand.

A series of steel wiring and kunai knives were sealed into each of the seals. He proceeded to remove five tags without any writing on them. He casted the white chalk he had aside, then proceeded to write small, corresponding to one another utilizing a black-colored utensil. He proceeded to scale the outer walls of Sunagakure, pressing two of the tags to the outer part of the wall, then proceeding to set the other three in close proximity to the traps he set. He then proceeded to cover said traps with grains of sand.* - Mon Aug 31 11:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) sighed. He removed the tags from their corresponding areas, having taken the precautions to successfully evade specified parts of the environment that'd trigger the three traps he set up. The male hid the five tags within his space-time fuuinjutsu storage. Ozui would proceed to rush off without a second thought, intending to find a better place to test the technique and hopefully get successful results.* - Mon Aug 31 11:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) extended his arm out from beneath the tattered cloak concealing his figure. He proceeded to whip five shurikens from within the grasp of his gloved hands toward the training dummy in front of him. With great accuracy he managed to hit the area intended. The male pressed his palms together and concentrated a massive amount of chakra. As the chakra proceeded to flow through his throat he kneaded the essence into flames, releasing said flames in the form of a highly compressed stream. His pointer finger and thumb were pressed together, forming a small hole for the flames to pass through, and aid him with controlling the chakra. His right hand remained hidden in his cloak.* - Mon Aug 31 12:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) removed his hand from within his cloak, producing a sheathed katana from a plume of gray smoke. The male shot forth, gliding across the ground on the soles of his black, heavy duty tactical combat boots, unsheathing the katana as he moved forth at a decent value of momentum, before sliding his gloved left hand across the blade's dull edge, emitting it in an aura of orange flames while it remained at his side. He swung horizontally from the right to the left, using the deadly arc of his attack to efficiently cut the training dummy's mid-torso and set it ablaze.* - Mon Aug 31 12:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) watched closely, following the metallic blade as it cut deep into the training dummy's mid torso and left small embers in it's cruel trail across the dummy's stomach region. Said embers slowly conflicted with the training dummy's material, resulting in the area that his blade cut to be set ablaze. His keenly calculated movements remained showcasing how gifted he was as a swordsman.* - Mon Aug 31 13:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) followed his blade's movements with his keen line of sight. The very moment it left contact with the training dummy he quickly shifted the arc of his weapon's aim to the upper right, slicing the training dummy's head with relative ease. The cut left embers behind, causing the corresponding part of the dummy to be set on fire.* - Mon Aug 31 13:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) tightened his grasp on his katana, jerking downward diagonally, separating the training dummy's left arm from the rest of it's figure. He rested his katana at his side, sheathing it. The male exhaled nonchalantly, closely identifying the errors of the way he slashed the dummy. Of course, he couldn't analyze the slashes as good as he hoped, considering the fact that the training dummy was burning up.

"Hn.." He murmured, leaning forth and narrowing his dagger-like gaze. His cuts were slightly uneven, and he wasted lots of movements with the delays between his attacks. He exhaled.

"Good enough." He murmured.* - Mon Aug 31 13:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) gazed expressionlessly at the burning training dummy. The male pressed his hands together, concentrating an immense amount of chakra. He released the chakra from his maw in the form of flames, compressing it further than it already was by pressing his pointer finger and thumb together. The stream consumed the training dummy in flames, incinerating it slowly. Clearly that wasn't quick enough for Ozui, because out of eagerness he tossed an exploding note toward the training dummy, forming a single handseal and distancing himself with the Body Flicker technique. From a sufficient distance he watched the training dummy erupt into flames and burning ashes as it was reduced to nothing.amidst the explosion.* - Mon Aug 31 13:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) focused a massive amount of chakra from within himself, pressing his gloved hands together as he formed the Tiger handseal. He kneaded the chakra within him into flames, releasing the flames in the shape of a massive, dragon head-shaped blazing projectile. The massive projectile shot forth, leaving smoldering ashes and ground in it's trail as it thrashed against the wall in front of him, erupting into a series of flames.* - Mon Aug 31 14:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) kept the Tiger handseal formed, looking up into the sky. He opened his maw once more shortly after he focused a massive amount of chakra. As the chakra left his mouth, he kneaded it into flames, shaping them into a dragon-head shaped blast. The enormous, flaming dragon head shot high into the air, incinerating the grains of sand as it soared higher into the air, lighting up the sky as it detonated into endless embers that rained down.* - Mon Aug 31 14:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) kept the Tiger handseal formed. As he gathered up chakra he kneaded it and allowed it to leave his open mouth. He released the flames in the form of a massive, impressive blast of heat. The enormous, expertly shaped flames burned grains of sand as it soared into the air, lighting up the sky as it detonated into endless, raining down embers.* - Mon Aug 31 14:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) moved forth several steps, sliding his arms from within the cloak concealing his thin figure. He built up chakra, pressing his palms together and forming the Tiger handsign as he did so. He kneaded his chakra into flames, releasing said flames from his maw in the shape of a massive, dragon-head shaped projectile. The enormous projectile soared off into the air, incinerating grains of sand in it's path as it ascended into the sky, lighting said sky up as it detonated. An endless rain of scorched grains of gray sand landed within the area.

"Still not good enough." He murmured in a hushed tone.* - Mon Aug 31 23:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) shifted his dagger-like gaze toward Saseki.

"We're going." He remarked in a stoic tone of voice.* - Tue Sep 01 02:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) frowned slightly. The male formed the Ram handseal, concealing himself and the small child in a tempest of grains of sand, which rotated around him, ultimately masking his thin figure as he made his departure from the area.* - Tue Sep 01 02:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) reappeared within another area of Sunagakure. His onyx orbs would set themselves upon Saseki's. He rubbed the back of his head, and in a carefree, generous manner he spoke. "Kronos, a rogue shinobi of Sunagakure. Don't know where he's been all this time, doesn't matter. A gourd is a piece of equipment that stores a large amount of one material. Sand is usually carried inside of a gourd, but water is, as well. By the way, I was actually lying about having something new to teach you. But I do want to get your taijutsu skills up to par."

He didn't know why, but he was picking up some of Kiria's traits, personality-wise. He found himself being more and more casual with each coming day. It was creeping him out.* - Tue Sep 01 02:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) exhaled, returning to a more stoic style of interaction. "I doubt you have the same element as me. It's annoying to train someone within those conditions." He remarked simply. The male distanced himself from the girl, standing upright.

"Come at me."* - Tue Sep 01 02:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) swiftly shifted to the right some, backing up some to narrowly avoid her attack. He swiftly slapped the back of his palm against her wrist, intending to knock her arm away.* - Tue Sep 01 02:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) didn't feel shit. He'd jab her right shoulder with his pointer and middle fingertips, using the small action in an effortless attempt to screw her balance up.

"Keep trying."* - Tue Sep 01 02:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) stepped to the side relatively quickly, extending his left arm outward from his side and attempting to catch Saseki, coiling his one arm around her. "That's enough." He'd murmur.* - Tue Sep 01 03:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) coiled his other arm around her, pulling her close so that her forehead was pressed against his. He looked at her with narrowed, onyx orbs. "Just know that I love you, Saseki." He murmured. Likewise, his cloak was wrapped around her with his arms.* - Tue Sep 01 03:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) moved forth some, seating himself on the ground and leaning against the wall. He kissed her forehead, then tightened his grasp around her, drifting off into slumber.* - Tue Sep 01 03:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) remained leaning against the wall in a casual manner. He looked up at the sky, watching grains of sand flow in massive quantities throughout the air. His cloak concealed a majority of his figure, save for his head and his lower legs, as well as feet.* - Tue Sep 01 15:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) lifted brow, his attention drifting to her. "We do. We simply train outside." He remarked, removing a small red scroll from within his cloak. The male opened the scroll, beginning to read what the inside had to offer to him, knowledge-wise. He began to absorb the information, but he wasn't pleased with just doing that. Once understanding the knowledge he would then interpret it from every angle possible, intending to receive maximum finesse from studying the technique he was trying to master, the Great Dragon Flame technique.* - Tue Sep 01 15:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) sunk his head. He gazed at the ground in front of him, thinking intensely. His grip on the red scroll he was reading had faltered. Something had actually prohibited him from learning, and that was surprising. After all of this time he was still mourning. He found himself pathetic for doing such, but none the less he couldn't resist his own feelings, even if they were the worst feelings ever conjured.* - Tue Sep 01 16:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) exhaled heavily, evading any eye contact she could've locked with him.

"A...better place.." He murmured.* - Tue Sep 01 18:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) would link his fingers between hers after she pushed him, his hands drifting up her arms, as he coiled his own arms around her and pulled her into his grasp, pressing her head against his chest with his hand. He looked down at her with narrowed eyes. He tried to mask his sadness with his normally emotionless, stoic stare.

He whispered to her, his voice slowly beginning to abandon him. "S..he's gone... dead.. she commit suicide.."* - Tue Sep 01 18:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) tightened his grasp around her, holding her closer than he ever had before. The male remained silent, allowing the girl to press her head against his chest. He'd already cried too many times to do it again, it just wasn't in him. The least he could do was offer her security within his cloak, and he was doing that now. He clenched his teeth, an unmistakably terrible feeling conjuring itself deep within him again. It was unbearable.* - Tue Sep 01 18:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) pat her back in silence, unsure of what else he could do.

"I'm sorry.." He murmured, holding her close.* - Tue Sep 01 19:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) lifted her up some, holding her affectionately. He'd press his forehead against hers.

"It's fine."He murmured, keeping her in close proximity.* - Tue Sep 01 19:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) slowly let go.

"Do what you want."* - Tue Sep 01 19:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) moved forth some. From a plume of smoke emerged Kiria's katana, which he held by the handle in one, gloved hand.

"Here."* - Tue Sep 01 19:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) lifted his head, staring into the air and proceeding to gather chakra within him. He formed the Tiger handseal, then released the chakra in the form of flames. Said flames were shaped into that of a giant dragon-head, which shot up into the air, smoldering any grains of sand that were in it's way. As it soared high off into the air it detonated into massive embers, causing a massive light to shine in the sky. By the time the embers landed on the ground they were already out, thus bringing no harm.* - Tue Sep 01 20:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) sighed, standing to his feet once more after he finally recuperated from the great deal of chakra that he used on performing the technique before. The male formed the Tiger handseal once more, and gathered a massive amount of chakra within his body. After doing such a thing, he proceeded to fire the dragon-head once more. The enormous flaming projectile soared into the air, detonating into a massive amount of flames once more.

"Not good enough.."* - Tue Sep 01 20:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) metagames his appearance with prodigy, tier two studious and stratagem of wind. doj with shunshin.* - Tue Sep 01 20:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) formed the Tiger handseal once more. He emit a massive dragon head from his maw, which shot forth at an intense speed. He manipulated the enormous flaming projectile with relative ease, watching as it shot high into the air and erupted into a mass of flames capable of eviscerating someone upon contact. He was getitng relatively better at Fire Release techniques each time he utilized one.* - Tue Sep 01 20:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) removed a red scroll from the confines of his cloak, beginning to study the text within the scroll. He took whatever information the scroll could provide and used it to his advantage. He imagined just how deadly the technique could be if he used it as a -way- more experienced Katon specialist. Such a thing would be overkill for most people. Ozui had many things on his agenda, but for now they would have to wait until he had managed to master this technique. The male produced the TIger handseal once more.

He realized that now, with his chakra reserves, he had the capability of using the technique at least twice before exhausting his untrained chakra reserves. It was extremely astonishing that he was able to use it at all, but none the less he still downed himself for his lack of experience in Katon, as well as the technique in general. The male murmured something to himself faintly, "This is so repetitive... and annoying." He remarked, before proceeding to read the scroll, interpreting the information, as well as each sentence, from every angle that it had to offer.

As a scholar, he couldn't let -any- information slip by him unseen, so naturally he was giving it his all to master the technique. With his current chakra reserves he could incapacitate himself, specifically because he had used the technique twice back to back. He was on one third of his chakra, so naturally he had to be easy on himself. He kept the Tiger handseal formed, the emo-looking, tall individual proceeding to gather an immense level of chakra, gambling on his reserves.

Suddenly, he felt the necessary amount of chakra that he needed come to him. After this he wouldn't be able to use any techniques at all without incapacitating himself, and therefore he -had- to master the technique -now-. The chances of him mastering the technique at this very moment were inconceivable, though there wasn't a point in not trying it. He released the chakra from his throat, kneading it into flames as he did so. The orange flames that exited his maw shot from his mouth, forming into an enormous dragon-head shaped blazing blast.

"Katon: Goryuuka no Jutsu!" He exclaimed, firing the massive blast of incinerating heat off into the air, watching the smoldering projectile burn anything in it's way to ashes, ascending higher into the sky at an unbelievable rate of speed. The dragon slowly expanded, until it burst into a massive explosion of powerful, orange flames.

He breathed heavily, slamming down onto his butt and leaning against the wall of the outside of his home, his gloved palms pressed to the floor below.* - Tue Sep 01 21:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) sighed nonchalantly. It seemed that he'd recovered enough chakra to proceed with the rigorous training that he was undergoing. He pressed his hand firmly against the wall at his side. Shortly after doing so a sealing formation akin to that of a lotus formed beneath his palm. From a plume of smoke emerged a kunai, which was grasped firmly by his left hand. He tossed the kunai over his head, catching it with his right hand. In one brisk movement he slashed across the air in front of him.

The male kept his hand pressed firmly to the sealing formation. From a plume of smoke emerged a jug of water. Shortly after, an empty plastic bottle was conjured from high-speed space-time storage movement. He proceeded to fill the bottle with water from the jug. After doing so, he pressed his hand against the jug, watching as a lotus sealing formation appeared beneath his palm, tendrils extending out and coiling themselves diagonally throughout the jug and sealing it.

He placed his hand on the bottle of water, forming a lotus seal on the transparent plastic as well. Tendrils spread across the bottle's perimeter, making it vanish within a plume of smoke. Both the jug and bottle were returned to a space-time storage far off. He dispersed the lotus seal on the wall with little effort necessary.* - Tue Sep 01 21:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) approached the female, revealing a black scroll. He leaned against the wall of the home, peeling the scroll open. The male revealed a small ink writing utensil, writing one large kanji that'd correlate to the cleaning supplies she'd gathered. Ozui proceeded to place his palm on each of the cleaning supplies, placing a lotus-sealing formula on each and every last supply. After doing so, he pressed his hand against the kanji written in the scroll, watching as it shined brightly. Tendrils extended out from the sealing formulas, wrapping themselves around the perimeter of each tool. In a large plume of gray smoke the cleaning tools were gone, sealed in the scroll. He rolled the scroll back up, handing it to the maid.

"Hold onto it, when we get to where we're going I'll unseal them."* - Tue Sep 01 22:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) shifted his line of sight to Naoko. His eyes were narrowed.

"Naoko. Expose your back to me momentarily. I need to try something." He remarked.* - Tue Sep 01 23:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) lifted a single digit of his, emitting it in chakra. The male proceeded to extend his right arm forth. "This'll hurt a bit." He remarked, pressing his chakra immersed fingertip against her skin, melding his initials into the skin on her back, like a tramp stamp.

O D K - was a permanent scar on her back.

"Hm.. It works."* - Tue Sep 01 23:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) stroked his chin with the hand not occupied by a chakra-covered fingertip. He shook his head even though she couldn't see the gesture, proceeding to speak. "Actually.... from now on, show your reaction to pain to me. That counts emotional pain, in addition." He remarked, proceeding to lean against the wall and look forward once more.* - Tue Sep 01 23:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) turned away from the female, removing his cloak. He looked at her over his shoulder with narrowed eyes. "Give me a back rub." The male would utter, removing the fishnet short sleeve shirt he had on.* - Wed Sep 02 00:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) would appear very tensed to the touch, even for those unexperienced in the field of massages. Her fingers were like magic to him as they removed practically all of the tension in his back. He grunted slightly, otherwise remaining impassive and soundless as she provided him with the gesture.* - Wed Sep 02 00:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) was shirtless receiving a back rub. He looked at the female with his narrowed, dagger-like, onyx gaze.

"Who're you?"* - Wed Sep 02 00:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) lifted a brow. "Medical kit? No. The economy's shit. I'm unsure where I'd get one, regardless." He spoke in a nonchalant tone.* - Wed Sep 02 00:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) exhaled slightly, pressing his back firmly against the wall. He looked down at the grains of highly compacted sand at his feet, beginning to reminisce about the death of his lover. He pressed his hand against his forehead as his head began to pound, clenching his teeth. Ozui slammed his eyes shut, shuddering slightly. He slowly began to recollect his physical stability, evading any type of acknowledgement of Renkin.

He slowly lifted his eyes open, staring with a narrowed gaze at the sand. <I'm tired of this.> Ozui thought to himself. * - Wed Sep 02 02:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) pressed his hand firmly against the wall of his home. From a plume of smoke emerged a black blanket. He shrouded his form in the blanket, proceeding to seat himself on the ground and look up at the sky with somber, narrowed, onyx eyes. The male felt a little more at ease with the blanket around him, as it had Kiria's scent on it. Though, he couldn't help but shed a tear or two, or completely start bawling. The sobbing happened often, and it was more of a burden than an ease of tension. He'd probably have to ask Naoko for another massage.

Being alone was more painful than he thought it was.* - Wed Sep 02 07:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) felt an incredible feeling of unease and guilt travel throughout his figure. He knew that the guilt rooted from the fact that he still thought Kiria's suicide was because of him. The male drifted his onyx-colored, dagger-like glare to the ground below, his face covered in dry tears and his schlera still red. He shuddered uncontrollably even with his cloak and the blanket wrapped around him. He didn't know why or how he was cold. The male pressed his hand against the blanket, forming a lotus sealing formula on it. Tendrils spilled out from beneath his palm, wrapping themselves around the perimeter of the blanket and sealing it in a space-time storage dimension far off.

* - Wed Sep 02 07:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) noticed that his pigment was slightly paler than usual. None the less, he seemed to feel fine, other than being extremely cold under the warmth of the black cloak concealing his figure. He pressed his hand to the ground, forming a lotus sealing formula once more. Tendrils spilled out, then came to a standstill. From a plume of smoke emerged a water bottle, which he picked up and proceeded to guzzle down.* - Wed Sep 02 07:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) sighed in relief after fixing his case of a dry throat. He pressed his hand to the center of the lotus seal, watching as the tendrils retracted from across the ground and then proceeded to curl around the perimeter of the water bottle, sealing it in his space-time storage dimension in a plume of gray smoke. The male removed five small tags, placing them in the relative area in obvious places.

The male would proceed to erect a barrier around his home, throwing a kunai at it just to test. It worked.* - Wed Sep 02 07:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) sighed nonchalantly. He passed in and out of the barrier in surprise that he had successfully performed the technique. The male gathered five civilians, making them take off the notes simultaneously. After doing such, the civilians returned the small tags with the kanji "forbidden" written in ink on each. He kept the civilians there, instructing them to do such as he placed the tags, throwing a kunai at the house once more. The barrier had proved sufficient, and thus the kunai did no harm to his home. The technique was absolutely great.* - Wed Sep 02 07:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) slowly watched as the civilians removed all five of the tags and gave them to him. He sighed nonchalantly, waving them away as he leaped into the air, scaling his home all the way to the roof and proceeding to sit on it casually, looking around. The male sat on his butt, removing a scroll from within his cloak, opening it up and beginning to inspect the details closely.* - Wed Sep 02 08:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) peeled his eyes open, staring up into the sky. He slowly looked down at the five tags located within one of the many pockets in his black, tattered cloak. He removed the tags from the pocket, looking at the kanji written on each of the tags. The kanji stood for 'forbidden'. He studied more closely. Forbidden as in forbidden access to the corresponding location. Forbidden access to the corresponding location as in a barrier. The technique was -very- interesting to him.

"Hn.."* - Wed Sep 02 18:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) proceeded to palce each of the forbidden tags in various places in the area, then activate the technique. After erecting the barrier, he used the sealing formula he made to pass through, testing it's efficiency before deactivating the technique and removing each of the forbidden tags. The male sighed in high amounts of boredom, though he kept at practicing.* - Wed Sep 02 18:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) had realized he was yet to check something about the barrier that'd be rather important. Ozui proceeded to place the five forbidden tags within various areas. After distancing himself from his home, which was the area he erected the barrier around, he proceeded to spill an ever-expanding stream of flames from his maw, finding that it had no effect on the barrier. "Hn..."* - Wed Sep 02 18:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) slowly deactivated the barrier. Shortly after doing such he collected each of the forbidden tags once more, placing them within his cloak. He rested in front of his home, removing a scroll from within his cloak. He opened the scroll, beginning to read the contents of the scroll and study what technique it had to offer information on. In this case, that technique would be the Five Seal Barrier.* - Wed Sep 02 19:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) sighed, continuing to read over the sentences. He murmured the sentences. "The Five Seal Barrier forms a barrier around the intended location, after placing four tags with the kanji 'forbidden' written on them. The last tag was placed on the location with the barrier intended to be erected around." He nodded, approving of the information.* - Wed Sep 02 19:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) closed the scroll. He knew for a fact that he wouldn't be able to put maximum use to the technique unless he mastered it. Mastering techniques was easy, but trying to master sealing ninjutsu when he had no one to use it on or no one to aid him in using it was plain boring. The male exhaled nonchalantly, removing the five forbidden tags from the confines of his cloak. He pressed four of the tags to various areas in the residential district, then pressed the last one to the door. He entered his home, activating the barrier.

"Hm... the upkeep of the technique would be too lethal for me to deal with. I'd be left with barely above half of my chakra."* - Wed Sep 02 19:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) found that the change in setting was wonderful. He was delighted by the appearance of Genjigakure no Sato. The male sighed nonchalantly, leaning against a tree. He embued his finger in an aura of smoldering chakra, pressing said finger firmly against the wood in front of him. He carved a simple slash into it.* - Wed Sep 02 21:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) sat outside what seemed to be a mansion. The male looked at the massive building, clearly unphased. He proceeded to remove five tags from one of the pockets to his cloak. "We'll probably stay here. The weather's better, and people aren't hassles." He remarked. From a plume of smoke emerged a shadow clone shortly after he formed the Clone handseal. He handed the shadow clone four tags with the kanji for 'forbidden' written on it.

The shadow clone traversed throughout the area, placing four tags within various parts of the district. The shadow clone then dispersed, allowing Ozui to receive the information. The black haired male then proceeded to place the last tag on the center door. He approached Saseki, picking the young girl up and carrying her within the mansion with his cloak covering himself and her. He rested her on one of the pillows in the lobby, then proceeded to erect the barrier around the mansion.

With more experience as a shinobi, naturally his chakra reserves had increased, even though he still had never trained them as intensely as he should have. Ozui sighed nonchalantly, being well aware that a third of his chakra reserves would be depleted every day he held the barrier. It'd help him attune his chakra reserves.* - Thu Sep 03 00:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) extended his right arm out in front of him. He focused an immense amount of chakra into the tip of his pointer finger. The male studied the delicately applied chakra. He stopped concentrating the chakra shortly after, sitting down beside Saseki.* - Thu Sep 03 01:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) sighed nonchalantly. He began to focus chakra, engulfing the tip of his pointer finger in the effervescence. Shortly after doing such, he showed it to her. "This is the basis of the technique. You can practically write by using your chakra, but it requires extremely precise control." He explained, pressing his fingertip to the wall. The intense heat, produced by his chakra, ultimately caved the wall in, easily melting the surface. The damage'd be a pain, but it was worth explaining the technique visually.* - Thu Sep 03 01:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) frowned slightly. Saseki learning the Finger Carving Seal and him practicing it had -definitely- left their marks on the wall, none the less such damage only barely ruined the greatness of the mansion. He sat down firmly on the pillow, a black blanket coiled around his figure. Kiria's distinct scent was on it. Even though he was still managing to take care of Saseki and all the fact that he was mourning was clear. Bags were under his eyes, and his pigment seemed to be paler than usual. He was very good at hiding his suffering emotionally, but physically? It was -all- there.* - Thu Sep 03 02:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) slowly opened the black blanket, wrapping his blanket covered arms around the girl and pulling her close. He rested his chin on the top of her head, his onyx orbs never drifting down to look at her. Instead, his eyes remained looking forth into nothing. A bitter feeling grew within his chest as he reminisce about life back when it was more preferrable, in his eyes. He sunk his eyes down to the girl, burying his head into her shoulder and folding his arms around her once she was asleep, holding the girl tightly.

"I won't leave you. I promise." He whispered, kissing his daughter's cheek before burying his head into her shoulder once more. Regardless of his daughter being right there, and the blanket being wrapped around them, he was still cold, even to the touch.* - Thu Sep 03 02:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) coiled the blanket around Saseki's sleeping figure, resting her across two of the indigo pilows. He proceeded to kiss her forehead, giving her a quick hug before moving forth slowly. The male pressed his hand against one of the wave-like tatoos strewn across his right arm, summoning a katana from a plume of smoke. The male rushed forth in eager movement, attempting to slash horizontally from left to right, then follow up with a diagonal attack aimed toward his upper left. When his attacks seemed to be done he slashed in a downward arc directly in front of him, slightly impressed by his speed.* - Thu Sep 03 05:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) leaned backward, holding his katana at his side while it was sheathed. Both of his hands rested on the hilt of the weapon, clenching the handle intensely. The black haired male rushed forth, unsheathing his blade and unleashing a quick slash to the left. In one jagged movement he cut diagonally to the right, but stopped mid-slash, driving the katana downward in front of him, then proceeding to release a barrage of horizontal attacks.* - Thu Sep 03 05:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) continue'd to slash at the air in front of him with relatively impressive rates of momentum and speed put behind each slash. He ran forth at least four feet, before spinning around and ducking, slashing at the air in front of him horizontally to the right, then proceeding to jab at the air with the end of the handle to his blade. He jumped back, coiling his hands tightly around his weaponry.* - Thu Sep 03 05:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) sheathed his katana suddenly. He proceeded to form the Cloen handseal, and a gray plume of smoke poofed into sight at his side. The smoke conjured a perfect replica of the male, which ran forth and distanced himself, standing across the male. Their onyx orbs met eachother and so did their dagger-like glares, as they dashed toward one another eagerly, holding the handle to their blades tightly with both hands. They unsheathed their blades at nearly the same speed, then proceeded to parry one another. Ozui slashed to the upper left, while his shadow clone slashed to the upper right, resulting in a quick collision.* - Thu Sep 03 05:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) clenched his teeth, staring at his Shadow Clone with a look of determination glinting in his dark orbs, both of which seemed to be endless abysses of despair, compiled over large amounts of mourning and dissapointment. "Groahhhhhh!" Ozui shouted, putting more strength behind his katana as he attempted to break the collision and also knock his shadow clone off balance. Both of them flowed chakra through their swords. A wave of heat practically smacked both of them in the face, but that only furthered their determination to see who could break the other in a showdown using pure strength between flame-engulfed weaponry.* - Thu Sep 03 05:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) pulled back, performing a quick backflip then quickly ducking as his shadow clone rushed forth and attempted to slash horizontally at his chest. The male quickly pounced to the right, sliding across the floor then rolling out of harms way as his shadow clone came stomping towards him with it's hands held over it's head. He leaped to his feet, shooting toward his shadow clone. The male thrashed the flaming blade of his katana against his shadow clone's, using the gap between their weaponry to headbutt his shadow clone and distance it from him.* - Thu Sep 03 05:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) clenched his teeth, feeling one corner of his mouth curl into a smile. His glare became more sinister as he clenched the hilt of his blade even tigher, staring firmly at his shadow clone as it mimicked his actions. Both of them dashed forward, smashing their blades into one another with so much momentum and strength that each collision knocked one another off balance, forcing them to step back. They continued parrying one another's blows easily, though.* - Thu Sep 03 05:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) 
"Groaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"

Ozui shouted, rushing toward his shadow clone eagerly. He somehow managed to avoid the direct headshot that his shadow clone performed, watching as the sheathed katana shoot past the side of his head as he redirected his body some. In a quick zig-zag like manner he avoided the shadow clone's attack and closed in from a blindside, thrusting the blade of his katana through the clone. In a plume of smoke the shadow clone dispersed.* - Thu Sep 03 05:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) sighed briefly. He retired to one of the pillows, removing a scroll fromone of the pockets within his cloak and proceeding to read the information that the scroll had to offer. He read up on various aspects of kenjutsu that, by now, he'd be capable of putting to use in the middle of combat. He was becoming very accustomed to the style, and it'd only be a matter of time before he was efficient at it.* - Thu Sep 03 05:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) removed a medium-sized scroll from within his cloak. He pressed the scroll to the floor, crouching down and proceeding to open said scroll. Shortly after doing such he pressed his hand firmly against the kanji meaning 'train' written in ink. From a plume of gray smoke emerged a sturdy training dummy that would be sufficient for his kenjutsu training procedure.* - Thu Sep 03 05:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) proceeded to unsheathe his katana, glancing at the training dummy and identifying it's weaknesses and strong suits. He rushed forth rather eagerly, quickly slashing to the upper left and lacerating it's torso diagonally in the process, then proceeding to interrupt the direction in which the katana was heading, changing the slash from diagonal to horizontal and cutting the training dummy's head clean off with little difficulty. But he wasn't done yet. As the training dummy's head flew into the air he thrusted forth, thrusting through the center as though it was butter then casting it aside with a quick whip of his blade to the right.* - Thu Sep 03 05:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) resealed his katana, then spawned forth a bokken from a plume of smoke. The male swung at the air in front of him with the bokken with little difficulty, easily stringing together his anonymous, test-slashes into a combo that'd prove proficient when it came time to use it in combat, with a katana. He rushed forth, jabbing at the air several times like a fencer before proceeding to do a quick spin, slashing horizontally. Before he could completely slash horizontally he shifted the direction of the cut to the upper left, slashing diagonally.* - Thu Sep 03 05:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) huffed heavily, holding the bokken at his side. He suddenly thrusted forth, slashing the air in front of him diagonally, horizontally and even vertically in a flurrying barrage of attacks. He ended the combo in a thrust at the air in front of him, finding that the attack was quite intriguing, and even beyond the limits he found himself having to set a majority of the time. The black haired male sighed nonchalantly, growing tired. He proceeded to seal the bokken, then reseat himself on one of the pillows.* - Thu Sep 03 05:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) moved toward Saseki's sleeping figure. He coiled his arms around her, burying his head into her shoulder while laying atop the right side of her body. He slowly drifted off, feeling the warmth of his sleeping daughter and the blanket cured around himself and her for once.* - Thu Sep 03 06:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) seemed to be still asleep. His head was buried into Saseki's shoulder, and his arms were coiled around her, holding her close. He was laying on his stomach, strewn across the pillows within the lobby of the mansion.* - Fri Sep 04 00:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) slowly came to. He ran his hand through his head of hair, which was a little past shoulder-length. He stood to his feet, walking across the floor wearing only a fishnet short sleeve shirt, and a pair of black, baggy pants. He walked across the cold floor with his bare soles, shifting his onyx-orbed gaze to Saseki.

"Hungry?" Ozui questioned, his hands sliding into the pockets of his pants. The bags under his eyes were still pretty clear, even if he had finally gotten a decent amount of sleep, after he exhausted the shit out of himself, of course.* - Fri Sep 04 00:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) folded his arms, pressing his back against the wall. He folded one leg over the other, proceeding to slam his eyes shut. The male slowly began to drift off into slumber, but his sight was unexpectedly haunted by a flashback to the first time he saw his lover's corpse. He oepned his eyes rapidly, looking around eagerly to find that he wasn't back within 'that' situation. He slid his hands into his pockets, shifting his onyx-orbed, dagger-like glare over at the wall to his left.

<Damn..> He glanced toward the pinkette at her desk, working away. "What type of disorder causes flashbacks, nightmares and random anxiousness rooted from traumatic experiences in the past?" He questioned her, his voice remaining as impassive and low as ever, though he was quite freaked out by the sight he had just seen. It was extremely clear, too clear for just any old memory.* - Fri Sep 04 00:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) looked away from her, a scowl forming upon his lips. "Yes. From my former fianc's death, Kiria." He was definitely not pleased with bringing it up, and the fact that his physical condition was subpar, it was clear that he'd been mourning, even if his calm and collected, as well as impassive personality, didn't seem to take a hit from it.* - Fri Sep 04 01:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) gazed at her with his narrowed eyes. The male moved forth slightly, settling down beside her within the second chair. His onyx orbs peered over the text she was writing, though they quickly drifted to her, then her bodily features, as he seemed to have no interest in task of note taking.

"The meaning behind my words is up to you."* - Fri Sep 04 03:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) folded one leg over the other, resting at ease within the chair. His dagger-like gaze drifted up to Renkin's face once more. His impassive, rather emotionless persona seemed to match hsi gloomy appearance perfectly. His arms hung from the sides of the chair, swaying back and forth slightly as he lifted his gaze from her up to the wall. The male had no desire to answer the question, but being what he considered generous -was- a desire, at least from time to time.

"Hn..?"* - Fri Sep 04 03:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) slowly arose frmo the chair. He headed off toward one of the bedrooms, intending to sleep there.* - Fri Sep 04 04:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) wasn't -that- eager to bed yet. The male proceeded to walk down the staircase into the lobby, unstrapping his bokken from his hip and proceeding to thrust at the area in front of him. He cut at the air horizontally utilizing the bokken, seeming quite immersed within the training. The only problem was that he couldn't infuse the wood with fire chakra, because that would kind of risk burning down the entire mansion. He rushed forth, slashing at the air diagonally.* - Fri Sep 04 04:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) leaped into the air, slashing downward then proceeding to thrash into the ground with his bare soles. He zipped forth, cutting at the air in front of him in what seemed to be an endless barrage. He wasn't on par with his actual maximum combat efficiency, considering he was suffering from sleep deprivation. He proceeded to start off with basic slashes, then those basic slashes evolved into more advanced ones as he proceeded.* - Fri Sep 04 05:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) produced the Clone ahndseal in one brief moment and shortly after such he allowed the shadow clone to traverse away from him and stand in front of him. The shadow clone proceeded to stare at him keenly, waiting for the right moment before rushing forth at the same time as he did. They collided with their bokkens, then proceeded to distance htemselves from one another. Ozui and his shadow clone slashed at one another, forcing one another to be pushed back with each collision/parry that they initiated.* - Fri Sep 04 05:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) ran forward, suddenly becoming more calm in the midst of battle. As the shadow clone attempted to strike his left shoulder blade he shuffled to the right, jabbing the hard point of his bokken into it's gut. The shadow clone didn't quite disperse yet, and thus it immediately attempted to smack the side of his neck with the even duller end of it's bokken. Of course, Ozui ducked downward, pulling his bokken from at the clone's gut and proceeding to thrash it into the clone's thigh.* - Fri Sep 04 05:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) // At this point, the shadow clone had dispersed from taking too much damage. He supposed that he could use just a little more chakra to produce another shadow clone, but this time he'd have to become more attuned to fighting with a katana for sure. Symptoms that came from mourning, as well as the quarter of chakra drained from him hindered his combat capabilkties. He formed the Clone handseal, producing a shadow clone in front of him from a plume of smoke. The shadow clone distanced itself, and they both stood in tense waiting.* - Fri Sep 04 05:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) ran forth steadily, attempting to slash horizontally, his clone completely trumped his attack by slamming down upon his bokken with a vertical attack. But the clone wasn't done, because he headbutted Ozui right after, knocking him off course. He stumbled back, then rushed forth again, attempting to slam his bokken down upon the clone's shoulderblade, though it responded with a quick block, attempting to push him back.  He manged to break through it's defenses, causing it to stumble back.* - Fri Sep 04 11:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) rushed forth after he broke through the defenses of his shadow clone, remaining calm and collected as he did such. He evaded the jab that his shadow clone performed with it's bokken, driving his own weaponry into it's side and knocking it to the side. The black haired male quickly threw his bokken out in front of him, blocking the vertical attack that followed with a horizontal one. He knocked his shadow clone off balance with a quick application of strength to help his end of their collision.
* - Fri Sep 04 11:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) braced himself, holding his arms out in front of him, his hands wrapped tightly around the hilt to his bokken. His shadow clone rushed forth, attempting to strike his right shoulder, causing him to block horizontally. He quickly shot to the left, attempting to swipe his shadow clone with his bokken. The shadow clone quickly blocked the attack, and returned it with a quick attack directed to Ozui's upper left arm. The attack quickly pushed him off balance, giving his shadow clone an opening, or so it thought. The moment his clone attempted to jab his chest with it's bokken he blocked the attack and knocked it off balance.* - Fri Sep 04 11:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) breathed heavily, showing obvious signs of exhaustion from chakra deprivation. He barely blocked his shadow clone's enslaught of attacks. The shadow clone thrusted toward his chest and he barely blocked with a quick, thoughtless parry. The clone then proceeded to attempt to diagonally thrash upon his right shoulder, causing him to race to the side, successfully avoiding the attack in one quick, anxious motion. He slowly began to regain his breath, and his levelheadedness during battle. The male braced himself, extending his bokken out in front of him once more.
* - Fri Sep 04 11:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) // Both rushed forth, beginning to initiate a high-speed battle. They attacked eachother in endless enslaughts of attacks, all of which one another managed to parry. Ozui was the one blocking most of the attacks and parrying them, or dodging him if he really needed to. He rushed to the right in a straight line, then proceeded to thrust toward his shadow clone in a straight line to the left, attempting to jab the shadow clone in it's side. The clone had learned from it's original mistakes, naturally avoiding the attack, only to feel his bokken jab into it's back, making it disperse. He'd went with a customary action, and that was switch up which hand was holding the weapon, to expand his range of attack.* - Fri Sep 04 11:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) was clearly exhausted by now, judging by the fact that sweat was pouring off of his body. He stripped down, proceeding to take a short bath, then head off to bed. He submerged himself beneath the blanket cloaked in KIria's scent, prepared to suffer another night deprived of sleep due to his fear of the nightmares that'd come.* - Fri Sep 04 11:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) slowly climbed out of bed, soaked in his own sweat. He'd had at least four nightmares about Kiria's suicide, but there were another nine that he hadn't recalled upon awakening. He stepped across the floor with his bare soles, his half-lidded eyes drifting throughout his setting as he stepped outside of his room and arrived at the lobby.* - Fri Sep 04 13:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) scolwed slightly, setting his narrowed, onyx orbs upon the female. "I'm bored. Don't know what to do. Why not sitting in a claustrophobic place and contemplate the turn that my life has taken?." He questioned, crossing his arms and folding one leg over the other. He inadvertently focused his line of sight on her chest, as opposed to her face. Ozui's eyes seemed to lower, as he attempted to discern any curves visible. He'd quickly urge his black irises to focus on her face after recognizing that he was doing this.* - Fri Sep 04 17:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) lifted a brow when she smiled. He didn't know how to respond, so he simply looked at her with his rather gloomy gaze. The male hesitated momentarily after she extended her hand out to him. He impassively looked from at her emerald irises, then down at her hand. Doing anything productive would be difficult for him, considering the fact that a third of his chakra was always gone from his reserves, and he was rather sleep deprived. None the less, he would extend his own hand out, clasping hers.

The male frowned slightly as she guided him down the stairs. Normally, one hundred pushups would be easy for him, but in the condition he was in such a thing would probably tire him out rather quickly. None the less, he trusted her word, considering she was practically a nurse to him. The male got on all fours, stretching his legs out under him and proceeding to bear the entirety of his body's weight, which wasn't much at all, on his arms. He arched his arms, proceeding to descend downward as much as possible, his body not even an inch from touching the floor.

The black haired male poceeded to ascend and descend, counting within his head as he performed the pushups with proficient succession in the task. His dagger-like glare was focused upon the floorboards below. By the time he was at eighty he was slightly fatigue'd, but otherwise he managed to complete the task with moderate fatigue, breathing lightly.* - Fri Sep 04 18:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) grunted in a rather impatient matter. He did as she told him to, proceeding to stretch. After doing some basic stretches the male focused on performing situps. Naturally, situps were easier for him than pushups, thus he set his personal limit to one hundred and fifty. The male barely acknowledged Renkin as she mentioned acquiring some pills, proceeding to do his situps. The male's mind was preoccupied with the physical exertion at hand, managing his way throughout the exercise with mild difficulty.* - Fri Sep 04 19:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) was halfway completely with perfroming sit-ups, drenched in sweat but not as fatigued as he looked. He approached the female, taqking the herb from her grasp gently. The male proceeded to turn away from her, chomping down on the most edible looking aspect of the herb, chewing what he bit off. He squinted slightly when ntoicing it had a bitter taste, but couldn't help but noticed that it was rather refreshing as well. As he ate the herb he recovered from his physical ordeals at a slightly faster rate than he normally would.

The male would begin performing sit-ups once more.* - Fri Sep 04 19:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) frowned at her while retaining his silent composure. He finished up the sit-ups with relative ease, before pressing his figure against the wall with a dull look on his face. The exercise had alleviated his mild boredom, as well as sadness, but he was still as gloomy looknig as ever, even if he wasn't feeling the way he appeared. His hands rested at ease at his sides.* - Fri Sep 04 19:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) rolled his eyes simply. "I can easily improve my appearance. I simply don't care to." He remarked. Malnourishment played an immense part in his lack of proper body composition. Lack of training that associated with boosting his physical strength and what not also affected this. His stomach groaned lowly, giving an obvious hint to how many days he'd went without eating, or refusing to make himself do so.* - Fri Sep 04 19:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) grunted toward Renkin. The male stormed off, heading to his bedroom.* - Fri Sep 04 20:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) seated himself beside Saseki. The male extended his arms out to her, pulling her into his grasp. He'd look down at her with a light smile printed upon his noticeably handsome facial features. "You know.. I think I can move on from your mother's death. And if I do, I promise I'll be a better parent." Ozui murmured, resting his chin upon the top of her head, running his hand through her hair in a gentle manner* - Fri Sep 04 22:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) pressed his pointer finger against her chest, as well as his own.

"In our hearts."* - Fri Sep 04 22:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) exhaled nonchalantly.

"No one'll replace your mother. She holds a special place in my heart. I may find someone else to love again, but.. even then I'll still care about her.." Ozui elaborated.* - Fri Sep 04 22:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) looked up at the ceiling high above, lifting his right arm up above his head, clenching his hand open and then closing it. "I don't forget the people I love. That just isn't part of me."* - Fri Sep 04 23:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) stood up, walking forth slowly then turning to face the girl. He stood there simply, his hands within his pockets. He seemed pretty nonchalant about the entire thing.* - Fri Sep 04 23:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) sighed. He glid his hand across his bicep, which was covered in tatoos. From a plume of gray smoke emerged hair gel within his grasp. He dipped his index finger into the hair gel, spreading the gel across his hair, running his hand through his hair, from front to back, slicking it back. The male watched as Saseki moved toward him.* - Fri Sep 04 23:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) awaited for the shadow clone to attack. He braced for an attack, but made sure it wasn't exactly clear that he was ready. His onyx-orbs retained the dagger-like fierciness in them, but a glint of confidence was slightly identifiable.* - Fri Sep 04 23:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) did what was natural to the situation. And that was dodge. Completely. He shot to the side, keeping his hands within his pockets. "If you want to land a hit you should take the initiative and attack me along with your shadow clone, while you have the advantage in numbers." Ozui said, standing off on the side.* - Fri Sep 04 23:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) sighed. The male looked up at the balcony, finding that Renkin was there. His hair retained it's gelled back composure. A single strand of hair remained hanging, untouched by the gel.* - Fri Sep 04 23:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) thought she was still upset at him. Rather, she was announcing relatively good news. He nodded slightly, producing the Clone handseal and watching as it head off to get the necessary supplies for successfully catching fish. In the meantime, Ozui would stand within the corner, his arms crossed and one leg folded over the other, a half-lidded expression on his face.

"The clone'll have no problem getting the fish. If it does, I'll always know why. I receive whatever information or knowledge my clone receives when it disperses." He informed her a little bit on the technique.* - Sat Sep 05 00:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) nodded silently. He formed the Clone handseal, producing another shadow clone from a plume of smoke.* - Sat Sep 05 01:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) 

Clone: The shadow clone traveled throughout the terrain. The shadow clone removed a kunai from the cloak it was wearing, proceeding to leap down from one of the trees. With direct aim, the shadow clone emitted the kunai in it's grasp in an aura of massive flames, before throwing the kunai knife, purposely missing the shot on the rabbit that it was intended to hit. The flames'd erupt the grass in flames as they combusted when the kunai hit the ground, setting the rabbit ablaze. Eventually, the rabbit was burned to death, one way or another.

The shadow clone shoved the burnt up, dead rabbit into a sack, then proceeded to travel deeper into the forest. With markmanship that came natural with a shinobi of his level he directly struck another rabbit luring within an empty meadow in the back of it's neck, practically ruining it's jubular vein. The sight was harsh, but it got the job done. The shadow clone proceeded to collect the rabbit's corpse, shoving it in the same sack as the other and heading off to return to the manner.* - Sat Sep 05 01:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) (Bunshin) walked up nonchalantly, holding a fish net with five, large fish residing within it. The second shadow clone arrived holding a sack containing a rabbit with a punctured jugular vein, and another that had it's fur seared off. Both were dead, of course. The two shadow clones placed their 'delivery' on any free space for Renkin's desk, before both dispersed in a plume of smoke upon conjuring the necessary seal. * - Sat Sep 05 01:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) remained seated on the indigo pillow in a casual fashion. One leg was folded over the other, and his arms rested at their sides, his fingers tapping unevenly at the floor tiles below. His dagger-like, onyx-colored gaze was focused on Renkin. The male discerned her process of creating the pills that would aid him within his training. He wasn't exactly eager about training, but none the less when the time came he'd have something else to utilize to aid him in his generic training regime. The male suddenly exited the room, but unlike before he made her aware.

"I'll be back momentarily."

With that being said, he kept his word, sliding the traditional japanese door open and closing it behind him, a white bowl with red-patterned design. Within the bowl was steaming miso ramen broth, along with several flat links of sauced pork, and other various ingredients that would ultimately increase the quality of the dish. Ozui ate the food eagerly, though his eagerness was concealed by his impressive table manners. He ate at a genuine pace, savoring the food while allowing it to refill his empty stomach.

The male grumbled some, exiting the room with the empty bowl in hand. He'd re-enter the room after some time. He'd quenched his thirst and managed to get out of the habit of not eating, though it seemed that, as always, he was malnourishing himself, while being completely oblivious to it. The black haired male would sit back down on the pillows, exhaling lowly and looking up at the ceiling, folding his arms behind his head.* - Sat Sep 05 02:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) had easily identified that the pinkette had fallen asleep at her desk. His eyes narrowed as he focused on her chest, or to be more specific, her breasts. The male slowly lured forth, getting a tight squeeze before retreating the room, looking at his hand and sniffing it in a perverted manner.* - Sat Sep 05 02:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) entered the room, one hand tucked into his pockets, while the other clasped what seemed to be the product that Renkin wanted for quite some time. The male placed the medipot on the table, without regard for the papers located on it, before tucking the hand that no longer occupied the object into it's corresponding pocket.

"There you go." He spoke in a casual, calm manner. An aura of relaxation carried itself upon his presence.* - Sat Sep 05 21:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) lifted a brow. His right arm slowly moved forth, his hand simply resting upon her hip as he allowed her to hug him. "That was an excuse for me to surprise you." Ozui murmured. The manner in which he was standing indicated he was slightly surprised by the unexpected embrace.* - Sat Sep 05 21:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) slid his hand off of her hip, tucking it away within one of his pockets. He looked at her with his dark eyes. "I'm not sure how to use it myself. There wasn't a manual either. I don't think..." He drifted off into deep thought, drifting his eyes to the right in a manner which indicated he was reminiscing about something. He couldn't recall what there was in the box that came with it, other than the object itself. And he threw out the box directly after.. a shame.

Ozui exhaled slightly, resting down on one of the pillows, folding one leg over the other. He rested his arms behind his head, sitting there in a very laidback manner. He'd most likely observe as she learned how to utilize the piece of equipment added to her arsenal.* - Sat Sep 05 21:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) produced a pair of dice from a plume of smoke. "Why?' He questioned, noticing that she'd placed her sword on Renkin's books, and all of the other wonderful things she used to aid herself in medical research.

"It's unwise to place that there." He remarked.* - Sat Sep 05 21:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) nodded slightly. He slid the die from his palm, allowing them to roll across the floorboards.* - Sat Sep 05 21:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) handed her the two die.

"I guarentee you'll win if we trade."* - Sat Sep 05 21:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) frowned. He crossed his arms.

"Someone who's lucky isn't a cheater."* - Sat Sep 05 21:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) frowned slightly.* - Mon Sep 07 14:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) exposed a thin novel from a plume of smoke, opening it. He read what it contained, blinking slightly. <This.. isn't a book on taijutsu, is it?> The male read the title.

Tai the Booty up; Jutsu.* - Mon Sep 07 14:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) slowly turned a few pages, nodding in confirmation of his assumption.

<Yep. Bondage sex everywhere."* - Mon Sep 07 14:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) continues reading.

"This book.." He murmured.

<The author is a genius. How do you manage to make such a title that isn't even a pun? Sex during taijutsu workouts. Doing jumping jacks on someone's penis. Japanese culture is quite the wonder.>* - Mon Sep 07 14:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) closed the book he was reading about bondage in, standing up. "'Come on, we're training. Go ahead and use shadow clones, and your mother's sword. Anything." Ozui said, sighing nonchalantly as he tucked his hands within the pockets to his black pants, distancing himself and looking back at her over his shoulder.* - Mon Sep 07 16:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) had braced himself. He folded his right arm behind his back, holding his bokken with his firm, left-handed grasp. He looked toward her fiercely, awaiting for her to approach. Though, she'd suddenly questioned what seemed to be something that had not been on his mind for awhile. Renkin seemed to be busy with her work these days. The male lifted a brow, his fierce gaze faltering and his bokken-wielding arm descending to his side. His right arm did as well.

"Because the outside world's a rough one. I hate to admit it but I'm not strong enough to protect you from the nightmareish things you may go through if you aren't strong enough to defend yourself." He remarked, drifting his narrowed gaze to the right. He desired power, but he didn't possess it. Living in such a manner was painful.

<I understand now. Even if I must take the devil's fruit, I must gain power.> He thought to himself.* - Mon Sep 07 17:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) stanced himself once more. He threw his bokken out in front of him, blocking the punch.

"Try to take advantage of the fact that there's one of me and two of you."* - Mon Sep 07 17:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) watched as Saseki's shadow clone threw it's leg out, he leaped up, quickly shoving his bokken into it's sheathe and forming the Ram handsign, a tempest of sand cloaking his figure as he traveled from in front of the shadow clone to in front of it's owner. From a plume of sand he'd emerge, swinging downward at her with his bokken.* - Mon Sep 07 17:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) slipped his hands from around the handle of his bokken, glancing down at Saseki with a light smirk plastered to his features. He'd anticipate the shadow clone, putting his sense of hearing into it's maximum, though at the most it was average compared to others.* - Mon Sep 07 18:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) shoved his arms up in front of him, blocking the thrown bokken with said arms, then proceeding to bound into the air to evade the shadow clone. He'd attempt to perform a quick backflip and land behind her clone.* - Mon Sep 07 18:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) stood there, tucking his hands in his pockets.

"Hm... you'd be stronger if you spent as much time training as you do complaining." He said in a mocking tone.* - Mon Sep 07 18:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) stepped forth some, picking her up and resting her within his lap.* - Mon Sep 07 18:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Huhn... - Fri Sep 11 21:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Ah? That's good. - Fri Sep 11 21:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) says: Yeah. - Fri Sep 11 21:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Hm... - Fri Sep 11 21:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) sighed nonchalantly, leaning against the wall. He looked up at the ceiling, folding his legs in a lazy manner.* - Fri Sep 11 21:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Not that I know of.. - Fri Sep 11 21:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) says: I see. - Fri Sep 11 21:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Hnn.. - Fri Sep 11 22:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Saseki. How would you feel about me attempting to find someone to love? Or getting a girlfriend? - Fri Sep 11 22:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) produced a shadow clone from a plume of smoke shortly after forming the Clone handsign. The shadow clone would proceed to transform into a female version of him, with long pigtails and a white pair of pajamas. It would've been pathetic for someone to see him like this, but in all honesty he was lonely. He curled up against his shadow clone beneath a blanket, pondering what he was going to do in life.* - Sat Sep 12 13:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) thinks: I miss being in love. And the feeling of knowing that you're loved by someone. - Sat Sep 12 13:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) slowly drifted off into slumber.* - Sat Sep 12 13:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) says: That wierd lady was looking for you. - Sat Sep 12 20:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Renkin? - Sat Sep 12 20:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) says: Yeah. - Sat Sep 12 20:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Is she still in her room? - Sat Sep 12 20:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) says: No idea. - Sat Sep 12 20:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) says: She was here. - Sat Sep 12 20:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) says: Then she was gone. - Sat Sep 12 20:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Right... - Sat Sep 12 20:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: So. Are you hungry? - Sat Sep 12 20:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) says: No, I'm fine thanks. - Sat Sep 12 20:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Hn.. - Sat Sep 12 20:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: I'll be right back. - Sat Sep 12 21:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) cloaked himself in a veil of sand grains, concealing his movement. The spinning aura of sand would vanish, his presence gone.* - Sat Sep 12 21:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Hnnn... - Sat Sep 12 21:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) says: Hmm - Sat Sep 12 21:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: So... what was your life back in Suna like before you met me? - Sat Sep 12 22:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) says: Wasn't that lucrative. - Sat Sep 12 22:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) says: It was...average.. - Sat Sep 12 22:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Huh. I lived the life of a rich person. Graduated when I was thirteen. Still lazed off for another five years or so, then I started to become more interested. I only became a shinobi because my parents wanted me to. - Sat Sep 12 22:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Guess you could say my life was and has been boring. - Sat Sep 12 22:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) says: Well...If you became a shinobi because of what your parents wanted...it reveals something about you.. - Sat Sep 12 22:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) stroked his chin, looking up at the ceiling.

"What did it reveal?"* - Sat Sep 12 22:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) says: You don't really have a goal...a purpose.. - Sat Sep 12 22:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: I've noticed that a long time ago. I'm just going with the flow. - Sat Sep 12 22:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: I don't have a motive for anything. I don't exactly see who I need or want to protect. Other than my daughter. Eitherways, didn't ask for her either. - Sat Sep 12 22:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Why's not having a goal make me sad? - Sat Sep 12 22:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) says: Because then you're just there....you have no purpose on this Earth. You are needed less than the ants outside. - Sat Sep 12 22:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Hn.. I wouldn't consider the two things I think about 'goals'. But... someday I want to be the God of Shinobi. Not just one of the greats. -The- great. I want to gain power. Regardless of the cost. - Sat Sep 12 22:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) says: Then that just makes you a sad fool. - Sat Sep 12 22:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: A sad fool is someone who doesn't have the instinct needed to achieve goals like that. I do. - Sat Sep 12 22:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Call me what you want. None the less, if I am wrong about what I am. If I'm too much of a fool to not notice it, then I thank you for being here to guide me from my foolishness. - Sat Sep 12 22:42:08 2015
