<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) was still contemporary to the arts of dissipating genjutsu, in addition to using Water Elemental Ninjutsu; therefore she was determined to train her ability in both. First off, the female reviewed what she knew about the techniques. Forming the one necessary seal, the girl began to halt her chakra flow. After her reserves came to a complete standstill, she suddenly surged them. Doing this would prove to be efficient in dispelling genjutsu.

After receiving more basic knowledge on the technique that she just demonstrated, the girl felt as though she was more knowledgeable on how to use the Genjutsu: Kai technique in general. None the less, a second try at attempting to advance her experience with the technique wouldn't hurt, would it? The byakugan wielder exhaled, parting her hands.

"Alright.."

She pepped herself up to continue doing this, proceeding to clasp her hands together in a loud clapping sound. She halted the flow of her chakra. Once the flow of chakra completely halted, the female would apply a rapid, large surge of chakra to her reserves. Having effectively performed this method, she better-improved her experience with the technique again.* - Sat Nov  7 11:43:34 2015

She'd distance herself from the others, coming to a standstill once she was at a sufficient distance. Mizora would've clasped her hands togetehr. She allowed her chakra to come to an absolute standstill. Upon completely halting her chakra flow she would slowly begin to focus.

With the necessary focus the black-haired female would surge her chakra. This was to ward off any genjutsu that'd been placed upon her; regardless of the fact that there was clearly nothing that had afflicted her. She drifted her gaze to Yan briefly upon finding that he was practicing one of the affinities that she possessed. Not wanting to intrude, she didn't exactly bother to ask for aid.

The doujutsu wielder allowed chakra to flow to her eyes as she analyzed the jutsu. It was similar to the Syrup Trap technique, though it was much more concentrated, rather than a technique that had a specified area of attack. As much as she wanted to learn binds that targeted only one person, she needed to better herself in Water Ninjutsu in general.

Mizora would form a trio of handsigns, her maroon gaze coming to a narrow. Mizora would clasp her hands together, processing a substantial portion of chakra within her gullet, kneading it into water as it exited her maw in the form of a translucent, blue, partially thick, glue-like liquid. The wave of syrupy liquid would descend upon the ground, in a wide-spread vicinity.

She smiled lightly at what little progress she made. However, the technique was still draining on her. She wanted to better it for that very reason. Mizora would form more handsigns. The doujutsu wielder spewed water from her mouth, said water manipulating itself in front of her into the form of a perfect replica of her frame. It soon-after applied her physical appearance to itself, making itself a perfect replica.

The female would extend her right arm out, intending to grasp the clone's hand and whip it forth with a great application of strength. The water clone somersaulted rapidly while high into the air. The clone came to a standstill with it's knees tucked to it's lower torso, forming handsigns with it's maroon gaze focused upon the lower-area of the training field several feet below it.

The water clone would produce a trio of handsigns, though seemingly slower at doing so than Mizora. With a plume of chakra, followed by said plume being kneaded, a wide-spanning wave of sticky, barely malleable liquid gushed from the clone's mouth, spreading across the earth below. The clone would descend to the earth shortly after.* - Sat Nov  7 20:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) gazed over at Yan for at least a second, before averting her gaze bashfully. She felt as though not only him, but some others would be wary of her presence.* - Sat Nov  7 20:36:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) turned to face Fujitora the moment he made his approach, attempting to leap back and explain why she was here. The doujutsu wielder had no intentions to fight, but rather resolve the conflict without being harmed. She was still sore from yesterday's experience.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) followed behind Mirai. Mizora's unsettled, almost anxious exterior still remained while she did so.* - Sun Nov  8 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) folded her hands in her lap, her gaze focused on said lap. She muttered a response to the waiter, lifting her head as she did so. "Just water.. please." She'd state. Her gaze roamed to Mirai, being maroon only because of her contacts. She slowly thought of how she'd respond to whatever questions were asked.

Not only was she thinking of responses, but she was also thinking about other things that were the reason for which she was typically unsettled. Discontent and displeasure always consumed her.

"I..  well.."

Her gaze fell to her lap once more. The un-sociable girl was having a hard time with just normal speech. It was so embarassing to her! She slowly lifted her gaze back to Mirai.

"Mostly training.. and just lots of thinking. I realized that some things factor into my rash decisions.."* - Sun Nov  8 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) frowned and averted her gaze to the right when Mirai chose her order for her. 
She would probably make herself feel obligated to eat the food now, since otherwise she would've been wasting yen.

Mizora's upper body was tensed, and she had an aura of gloom, in addition to exhaustion, about her form. Her hair looked like she'd simply ran a hand or two through it. Her clothing concealed most of her body.

"I've mostly... been going through emotional problems.. my emotions are the reason why I come off as paranoid.. and why my sense of judgement isn't as good as it should be.."

Her gaze didn't align with Mirai's once. She was obviously embarassed about spilling the beans on her mental issues.* - Sun Nov  8 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) sunk her head abit. Her hands remained folded none the less. She couldn't help but appreciate the fact that Mirai hadn't seemed to change her opinion of her when the bashful girl finally spoke up.

The smell was alluring to Mizora's senses, and she couldn't help but sniff as well. She was more of a fan of sweet foods, but one way or another it managed to pique what little of an apetite she had.

She guiltily nodded in response to Mirai's next question.

"My paranoia and bad case of envy are the reason why I had to fight for my life; for being considered a rogue of this village after I left for awhile..."* - Sun Nov  8 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) leaned back a litlte bit as Mirai leaned forward.

Mizora's right arm lifted from her lap, her fingers curling around the chopsticks. She leisurely swirled the chopsticks around within the bowl of ramen.

"What do you mean by that..?"* - Sun Nov  8 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: I stayed in Konoha.. the village I was born in. - Sun Nov  8 05:43:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) ate some of the ramen, before beginning to swirl the chopsticks around within the bowl.

"Um.."

Her finger pressed to her lip.

"I like sweet foods... I practically live in an inn room even though I have enough yen to buy my own house.. " She said with a shy chuckle.

"I like festivals... and peaceful environments. I honestly had retired from being a kunoichi in Konoha..."

"I dislike...lots of stuff.." She said, averting her gaze. It was as though she was trying to crawl back into her anti-social shell.* - Sun Nov  8 06:00:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) left a sufficient amount of yen on the table, before getting up and beginning to leave the diner.* - Sun Nov  8 07:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) stood at a decent distance from Mirai. The female would adjust her stancing, proceeding to expel chakra and allow it to flow to her eyes. She activated her doujutsu, then allowed chakra to course through her lower forearms and hands, immersing them in flaring, pale blue auras. She'd bend her knees, then dash toward Mirai with intent of initiating close combat.* - Sun Nov  8 07:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) bent her arm, extending it out in front of her. She jerked her other arm upright, intending to coil her hand around Mirai's arm, aiming to grasp it before the hit landed. Unfortunately, even with the hindering grasp if it landed, a tap was enough, and the impactful chakra burst throughout her shoulder, dealing internal damage that wasn't too major. She flinched slightly upon taking the hit.

If her grasping of her cousin's arm originally worked, Mizora would let go and place her hand on her own shoulder, undoing the effects of the attack with an equal pulsation of chakra running across her shoulder upon hand-contact. She'd nod lightly.

"I'm still tired from my run-in with Marrisa at the gates... I'm not sure if I'll feel better later in. But if I do, we'll definitely do this later. I won't be using Gentle Fist when we go head to head again... "* - Sun Nov  8 07:44:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) simply watched as Shira either got merked or narrowly evaded. She was simply a spectator, with little to no intentions of getting involved unless it broke out into an actual confrontation between the two involved.

She was slightly intimidated by the look that Chikyu gave her. Maybe it was because Mizora was bowing? The scarf-wearing girl somehow found it necessary.

"My apology..." She'd say with a stroke of shyness in her voice.

The black-haired female's maroon eyes dashed upon Ryutaro, inspecting his figure briefly before she nodded and responded. "Mizora.." She'd state her name with a small, bashful smile.* - Sun Nov  8 19:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) bent her knees, proceeding to thrust forth at a rather decent speed. At this point, her gaze flickered between Chikyu and Shira.

She aimed to thrust her right arm outward with pure intentions of punching the sword at full power, possibly knocking it out of Chikyu's grasp and cracking it if the hit connected.

At the same time, she threw her left leg up, bending it and propelling it toward the side of Shira's head, intending to knock him out with a direct hit to the temple.

As much as the albino wasn't her type, it wasn't in her to watch blood be shed without reason.

(13 Attack Speed, 11 Reflexes, 29 total damage to your sword.)* - Sun Nov  8 19:36:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Koji. I need to speak to you, if you would? - Sun Nov  8 19:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: No problem. In private? - Sun Nov  8 19:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm. - Sun Nov  8 19:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) blinked, wide-eye'd and confused about Chikyu's response. She expected the same malice that the female displayed in her actions against Shira, but none the less... she was appauled by Mizora's strength?

Her paranoia kicked in, as she slowly started to suspect that Chikyu was going to try attacking her next. She hid that feeling from physical sight, though.

She sheepishly smiled in response. She extended her right arm out to shake Chikyu's hand. Her smile grew wider, and brighter.

Her leg lowered, revealing that she wasn't at all harmed by her knee's collision with the shuriken, which wasn't harmed either.

"You think I'm strong..?" She questioned. There was -no- malice in Mizora's tone. If anything, she sounded surprised.* - Sun Nov  8 19:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) whispers: (imma recruit you into the hokuma clan okok) - Sun Nov  8 19:52:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) yanked the fuuma shuriken out of his grasp, at which point chakra flared to her left hand. She'd jab him in the gut with her open-hand, incapacitating him then continuing her interaction with Chikyu.* - Sun Nov  8 19:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) note that he's out.* - Sun Nov  8 19:59:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: But you shouldn't have used force aganst that man. I'm sure the situation could of been avoided through words. - Sun Nov  8 20:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Well he had grabbed me, if I don't react I'll surelly be killed with knowing it. Just like my dad said. - Sun Nov  8 20:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So your response to people grabbing you is to attack them? - Sun Nov  8 20:10:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) peered at the unconscious boy, chakra flowing to her eyes. She recognized chakra faintly similar to herself, Mirai, Madelyn, and Koji. She deactivated her doujutsu directly after.

<Hm...> She thought to herself.

"I'm Mizora... and no force was intended... but she was about to kill him. Even if I'm the one who doesn't deal the killing blow... I'll have blood on my hands for being there but not doing anything to prevent it.." She'd state, looking down at her now balled up fist.

"I knocked him unconscious and stopped the attacker from killing him. A fight broke out. I simply resolved it.."* - Sun Nov  8 20:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You'd have to ask one of these two females. - Sun Nov  8 20:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: I didn't put enough strength behind the attack. It was only strong enough to knock him out. - Sun Nov  8 20:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Do you both hate him? - Sun Nov  8 20:11:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If anyone puts their hands on you, and you don't know them, you have plenty of reason to use  reasonable force. - Sun Nov  8 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Kuro, you aren't a ranked ninja here. I appreciate your desire to do things peacefully, but this is a militaristic ninja village. - Sun Nov  8 20:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) thinks: Why are all of these shinobi so offensive? - Sun Nov  8 20:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Actions have consequences. - Sun Nov  8 20:13:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If you have a complaint about the guy, file that complaint with Koji and he'll handle it appropriately. - Sun Nov  8 20:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: All actions have consequences, it's the rule of the world.  If I take a step, the ground beneath me will get an imprint of my foot. - Sun Nov  8 20:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: However, to use force on an unsuspecting male when the situation could have been solved peacefully, is rather saddening. - Sun Nov  8 20:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I suggest everyone keeps their hands to themselves unless everyone involved is on the same page. - Sun Nov  8 20:15:08 2015
