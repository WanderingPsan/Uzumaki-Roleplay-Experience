<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) intended to march over to Rias', intending to yank her by the hand with her own. Mizora intended to hide her own face from visage, because her look seemed to be that of pent-up irritation. She attempted to drag the redhead away.

"We're going.." The black-haired Hokuma would state.* - Sun Nov 15 23:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) suddenly bursted with slight frustration.

"See that's the problem... you -don't-!" Mizora shouted to Rias, having snapped briefly. She clenched Rias' hand tighter, though it wasn't intentional.* - Sun Nov 15 23:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) let go of Rias' hand, breathing slightly heavier than she should be.

"Okay.. try not to make a mess. I'll be out here."* - Sun Nov 15 23:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: No.. it's nothing. - Sun Nov 15 23:10:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) moved forth, sighing lightly.

"Come on."

She'd guide Rias back into the room, leading her over to the towel rack, pointing to the pink towel.* - Sun Nov 15 23:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Um.. - Sun Nov 15 23:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) called out to her.

"On the bar beneath the shower head!"* - Sun Nov 15 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Chikyu.. you might get brain damage if you keep doing that.. - Sun Nov 15 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) moved forth, pressing her hand to Chikyu's shoulder.* - Sun Nov 15 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Just relax - Sun Nov 15 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Are you hungry? - Sun Nov 15 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Yeah...sort of. - Sun Nov 15 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: What's your favorite food? - Sun Nov 15 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: So.. stew then? - Sun Nov 15 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Yeah that be good. - Sun Nov 15 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Alright... - Sun Nov 15 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) tied a white apron on, proceeding to open the fridge. She leaned down, peering throughout the shelves of the fridge and removing several items. Mizora began to boil the liquid in the pot, applying seasoning and several sauces to the pot. 
The black-haired girl worked efficiently within the kitchen, using the nearby resources to efficiently speed up the process of cooking stew. Soon, the aroma of the rather pleasant scent immersed the home.

The Hokuma girl began to remove the skin from potatoes, while cutting the potatoes in small bits at the same time, allowing the small tidbits of potatoes to drop into a bowl. After skinning all of the potatoes she poured them into the pot, placing the bowl down on the counter and stirring the pot briefly with a large spoon.

She lifted the spoon, taking a sip.

<It needs a little more salt..>

She applied a tad bit more salt, then tasted it again, confirming that it had the necessary taste. Afterward, the female proceeded to place small slabs of what appeared to be marinated pork within the pot, placing the lid over the pot.

She washed the bowl in the sink, then beginning to cut carrots into small pieces, allowing them to drop into the bowl. Mizora lifted the bowl, allowing the carrots to fall within the pot.

This was too easy for her, if anything.

She continued to stir the pot, waiting a sufficient amount of time before finally removing the lid for the last time, fetching a duo of bowls, one for Chikyu and another for Rias. By this point, Rias had came out of the shower.

"Are you hungry, Rias?" Mizora questioned, still pouring the stew into the bowl for Rias regardless of her answer.

She approached the dining room table, placing the two bowls on the table.

"Enjoy."

Mizora went back toward the kitchen, cleaning it up and then hooking her apron up.* - Mon Nov 16 00:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: I -do- cook for him.. - Mon Nov 16 00:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Oh! He gets this... Mhmm! Can I have another bowl? - Mon Nov 16 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Of course. - Mon Nov 16 00:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) approached Chikyu, attempting to take her bowl. If the female allowed her to, Mizora would re-enter the kitchen, refilling it with some more of the stew and then exiting the kitchen. She placed the bowl in front of Chikyu again, backing up to her original position. Mizora smiled lightly, pleased that Chikyu enjoyed what she made.* - Mon Nov 16 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Would you like anymore? - Mon Nov 16 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: I think if I eat another I would explode. - Mon Nov 16 00:21:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Alright.. - Mon Nov 16 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) proceeded to go into the kitchen. She came out with a large bowl, covfered in silverware. She placed the bowl down in front of Chikyu. The same scent throughout the house, prominent in the kitchen, was emanating from the bowl. It was warm too.* - Mon Nov 16 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) sat down beside Chikyu as well.

"Want to spend the night here?"* - Mon Nov 16 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: It's fine.. - Mon Nov 16 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: I'll have to ask Ai, though. - Mon Nov 16 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Well if its okay, then I wouldn't mind spending a night with my best friend. - Mon Nov 16 00:36:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: I'm lucky to have you, Ai and Mirai as companions.. you guys really have managed to bring me out of my sadness. - Mon Nov 16 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) attempted to lean forth and embrace Chikyu. She couldn't express her true gratitude verbally.

"Really, thank you." She'd state, hugging her tightly. Her eyes closed as she smiled, her chin resting upon the back of Chikyu's shoulder.* - Mon Nov 16 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) broke away from the hug, smiling brightly for the first time in what seemed to be forever.

"That's the only way I can express my gratitude. I can barely explain it in words, hehe." She chuckled, waving to Ai when she entered the home.* - Mon Nov 16 00:48:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Can't say..~ - Mon Nov 16 01:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) pursed her lips as well as bit her lower one, her gaze drifting to her lower right and narrowing. She stammered out words that she really didn't want to say so soon, again.

"Oh... well... be safe."* - Mon Nov 16 01:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) thinks: Don't die either... - Mon Nov 16 01:04:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) attempted to stand up, clutching her hands together.

"W-Wait.. just for a few seconds, please?"* - Mon Nov 16 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) moved forth, standing in front of Ai. She murmured something, her face reddening as she did so. Her hands remained clutched together.* - Mon Nov 16 01:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) whispers: C-Could I kiss you..? For good luck..? - Mon Nov 16 01:15:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) leaned forth, her hands remaining clutched together. She stood on her tippy toes, attempting to press her lips to Ai's while murmuring "Good luck" beforehand. All the while, her face was still slightly red.* - Mon Nov 16 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) stopped clutching her hands, eagerly coiling her arms around Ai shortly after she did the same. She couldn't help but smile about the turn of events, in addition to what Ai whispered to her. A feeling of warmth immersed Mizora's entire being. She wouldn't pull away until Ai did, her hands clutched together again.

"O-Okay.." She said, a small smile on her face. A faint tinge of red was on her cheeks. She noticed the rose, her smile growing bigger as she did so. She stood there momentarily, thinking.

She settled down beside Chikyu once more, in what seemed to be a very light daze. She was very happy, but she also felt something that she never experienced. It was the adamant feeling of:

Love.* - Mon Nov 16 01:38:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Of course you do it soon! Don't wait, if things don't work out then you just go back to being friends. But, if things go great. You'll have a partner for the rest of your life. - Mon Nov 16 01:45:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) rose to her feet beginning to walk away.

"I'm going to go take a bath.."* - Mon Nov 16 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: ... - Mon Nov 16 02:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: ... - Mon Nov 16 02:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Huh? Okay... - Mon Nov 16 02:34:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) thinks: Don't think about it...Don't think about it. - Mon Nov 16 02:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) removed her robes, proceeding to make her approach to the bath. She immersed herself in the water draining from the shower head, her hands running down from her neck to her chest, feeling her own soft, pale skin. The black-haired girl felt her optimistic views rising, especially since she kissed Ai. That was her first kiss... too. Things were finally going in the right direction.

Her hands trailed up to her chest. Mizora clutched her breasts lightly, sizing them up. She then trailed her hands down the sides of her well-shaped torso, her hands clutching at her butt, sizing her ass up as well. She removed her hands from her body, picking up the bar of soap then beginning to scrub herself down.

After scrubbing her body from head to toe for about three times, she allowed the soap to drain from her frame, before she stopped the showerhead from running and exited the small 'booth'. The black-haired female put on her new change of clothes, exiting the bathroom. She twirled in the mirror briefly, smiling and nodding at her choice of new clothing.* - Mon Nov 16 03:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) arrived from the bathroom wearing a new kimono, with black, naturalistic design such as thin bamboo trees and leaf art plastered to it's thin, silky, sky blue appearance. It brought out some more of her prominent features, showing off a small bit of her curves and even a small bit of her cleavage. The kimono fit her perfectly. A small smile was on her face as she sat down, smelling fresh of mint leaves.* - Mon Nov 16 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) raised a brow, before smiling and nodding. She stood up, stepping over the pillow to her right as she motioned over toward Ai, settling down beside her. She couldn't help but wonder why she was told to sit next to Ai. If Ai acknowledged her change in seating she'd simply smile at her.* - Mon Nov 16 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) widened her eyes, then smiled lightly. "It does? Thank you, Chikyu, Ai." Her subliminal intentions were to show off a bit more of her body. She noticed that Ai was still ogling her frame. Her gaze drifted to her left as she blushed nervously.* - Mon Nov 16 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) whispers: (fuckin pissin'me off with a passion..) - Mon Nov 16 03:54:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) looked at Ai out of her peripheral, shifting her head completely to peer at her.

"Well... s-sorry." She'd state, not really knowing what she was sorry for.* - Mon Nov 16 03:57:13 2015

"I love you.. Ai.. I.. really do.." She whispered, her head pressing to Ai's chest.* - Mon Nov 16 04:21:58 2015
