<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Let's go. - Tue Oct 27 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) proceeded to move along. Mizora would rush along eagerly, proceeding to approach the two dozen tigers, lions and other felines attuned to the wild. She'd initiate close-combat with them, proceeding to shoot throughout the crowd of wildcats and strike them down with her impressive levels of strength. With her reaction time, coupled with her fine vision and near-perfect three hundred and sixty degree vision, ntohing could get past her.

Mizora would shove her right arm out, etending it completely and balling her hand into a tight fist as she did such. Her fist smashed into the neck of one of the lions, sending it reeling onto it's side, dead for sure. She'd spin around, thrashing the back of her ankle into a tiger's side. She'd drive her foot into the ground, finding that she was suddenly confronted by several pouncing felines.

The female would simply sigh under her breath, allowing chakra to expel from every one of her tenketsu. Suddenly, she spun around rapidly, sending a series of the mammal foes flying. She'd halt spinning only after finding that the cats were a sufficient distance away from her. Of course, she was capable of doing this with her doujutsu.

She'd rush forth, sprinting at a decent rate of speed. Mizora would quite literally karate chop one of the other lions on the head, while cracking another's skull as her left fist directed itself into the temple of another one of the seemingly wild animals. All the while, the alert female would watch her two teammates on the mission.* - Wed Oct 28 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) noticed that Trilliam and Reguel could easily take care of this section of the series of animals that they had to exterminate. Mizora would move along at a rapid pace, distancing herself from her teammates and confronting the several hundred animals roaming the desert in one, highly-concentrated pack. The female opened her hands, allowing chakra to flare to her palms. The female took a -great- leap into the air above, diving downward while somersaulting forth. She'd extend her body out completely, proceeding to spin around rapidly, at which point her cloak flew off.

The black-haired girl released chakra from all three hundred and sixty one tenketsu of hers. She'd spin throughout the air like a ballerina, a spinning dome of sky blue chakra erecting itself around her as it rotated rapidly. She struck down multiple animals at once, and after seeing that it was safe to stop spinning she'd halt and sprint toward the gathering of animals. With her boosted visionary skills, in addition to her doujutsu, she struck down any animal that came her way.

She palm struck a scorpion square in it's head, immediately killing it. From that point, she'd spin around, thrashing her palm into a rabid squirrel's stomach and knocking it unconscious immediately. She'd strike down any animal that came her way, by using the Gentle Fist. Of course, she was only using it because Trilliam and Reguel weren't there to see her -true- proficiency in fighting. She was strong physically, but her Gentle Fist took it to a further extent.

She'd continue to strike down the "legion" of animals, causing great harm with simple taps. Even the barely landed attacks would incapacitate the animals. All the while she was keeping a good watch on her teammates, considering that was possible with her doujutsu. "This is the power of my clan, no, -my- power, don't take me for granted! Haaaaah!" She'd suddenly exclaim, suddenly piledriving through several animals and sending them flying into more with the force of her strength.* - Wed Oct 28 02:20:22 2015
