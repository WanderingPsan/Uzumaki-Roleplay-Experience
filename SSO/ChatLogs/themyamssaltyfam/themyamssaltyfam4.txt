She'd try to utilize the sand withdrawn to add to the perimeter of the sand she was standing on.

Her arms were folded beneath her pair of rather-large breasts, but that was besides the point. As usual, the cloaked brunette appeared to be suspended in the air by a highly compressed, circular platform composed of many sand grains.

"Hm..?" She'd ask, her voice appearing as soft as ever. Pandora couldn't help but recognize the change in Erebus' tone as he approached.* - Thu Sep 24 20:47:08 2015

'Why me of all people' was a verbal expression of the one she was making. She couldn't see how efficient her sand would be, especially in the aspect of others. Flying wasn't a big deal to her, nor was manipulating sand. Though, when she thought of it from his point of view, it was quite a feat.

"Business affairs..? I.. might be able to do that.." She'd state.* - Thu Sep 24 21:08:28 2015

"As you wish.."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) remained levitating with the aid of her sand platform in front of the male. The brunette kept her left arm tucked beneath her chest, her right hand running through her hair briefly, her fingers coursing between her dark locks. She was rather tall, and well-built for someone of her age ans stature, though a majority of her weight came to her rather immense endowments.

"Beliefs.. religiously.. ? If you mean by that... I'm not really sure about religion... it's not a subject I've been educated on.. " She'd remark. "Otherwise... I believe the world requires more tranquility than it's current amount.." She'd elaborate upon her honest opinions of the conflict that consistently rifted from settlements, villages, and even nations.* - Thu Sep 24 21:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) nodded silently, tucking her right arm beneath her left once she stopped fumbling with her hair. She'd nod slightly. "If there's a method of peace without bloodshed, I'd happily oblige to it." She seemed rather pacifistic, to a generic degree.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Do you agree with that? - Sun Sep 27 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Or do you still stick to the theory that you can have peace without anyone dying at all? - Sun Sep 27 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: If there's no way to reason with said person... if there're someone like Zetsumo was... I.. would have to agree... - Sun Sep 27 05:10:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: The seal is to make sure you don't expose any plans here to anyone. Or perhaps betray me in any way. - Sun Sep 27 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I don't think you will. - Sun Sep 27 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: But it's for precaution. - Sun Sep 27 05:15:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: You said you needed to place a seal... - Sun Sep 27 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: That a seal needs to be place on the part of the body that it affects. - Sun Sep 27 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I do. - Sun Sep 27 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: It won't require your shoulder though. - Sun Sep 27 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) blinked, putting two and two together. She'd retract her arm, readjusting her clothing. The brunette would stick her tongue out, opening her mouth slightly, naturally assuming that it'd be necessary to place a seal that stopped her from talking about him within the area that allowed her to talk in general.* - Sun Sep 27 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(X_Jake From State Farm_X) thinks: What if Edge just stuck his penis in there...I would laugh.. - Sun Sep 27 05:19:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) was caught completely off guard by the male's action, a whimper escaping her throat. Her body tensed up, her hazelnut gaze anywhere other than at Edge. The brunette would stop tensing her muscles whenever he'd pull away, though she showed mild signs of bemusement. <Why did he...?> She'd think to herself. Pandora was slightly familiar with kisses, but not ones from practical strangers. She still refused to make eye contact with the male.* - Sun Sep 27 05:24:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Except kill or maim her. - Sun Sep 27 05:25:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(X_Jake From State Farm_X) says: Could I at least play with her breasts when I'm bored? - Sun Sep 27 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) scoots toward the wall, rather disturbed by the female's question. It'd take awhile to adjust to her new residence, and new roomates, so to speak.* - Sun Sep 27 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: You could I suppose. - Sun Sep 27 05:27:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) scooted back a little more, pressing her back against the wall. The female would simply stare at her gourd, until she shut her eyes, attempting to fall into deep slumber.* - Sun Sep 27 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Hippie dippy shop? - Sun Sep 27 05:31:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) strapped her gourd to her back once more. She'd stand to her feet, lifting her arms frmo their sides. Slowly, waves of sand grains would push the lid to the gourd open, compressing themselves beneath her and suspending her in the air upon a circular platform. The brunette girl would simply gaze at the fluorescent haired individual with her pair of hazel orbs.* - Sun Sep 27 19:46:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) lifted her arms from her sides. She'd attempt to manifest waves of sand from her gourd, using said waves to produce a platform of compressed grains of sand beneath the female. Without the necessary mastery of the technique, she was unable to perform the technique to Rymei's benefit, that being displayed when her sand went motionless, as though it was refusing to suspend the female in the air.

Pandora herself was standing on a platform of sand, floating there.* - Mon Sep 28 01:06:59 2015
