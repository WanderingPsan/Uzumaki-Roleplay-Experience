<br><br><font color=teal>*Ai(Sennalove) says: Mizora, why don't ya spar her? - Thu Oct  8 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Hmmmmm. - Thu Oct  8 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: whos sparing? - Thu Oct  8 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) felt as though she was subliminally being thrown into guilt.

She'd purse her lips and bat her eyes, shifting her maroon gaze back toward Mirai. Her arms were folded beneath her chest beneath the black cloak draped over her form.

"You didn't need to say 'please'..." Mizora frowned. She was honestly caught off guard by the honorific. "In any case... let's spar then. You lead me to the location." She'd state. Vivacity coursed through her veins, as she seemed to be awakening from her 'daze', inflicted by her lazing off.

Chakra would course throughout her ocular nerves as she peered at the scene to her left, curious as to what, if anything, was going on.* - Thu Oct  8 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) nodded. She'd follow along behind Mirai.* - Thu Oct  8 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) nodded lightly. Chakra would immerse her hands, though it wouldn't be visible to the naked eye. Naturally, Mizora could see the chakra around Mirai's hands, and Mirai could see the chakra around hers. "Try not to seal any tenketsu or hit me fatally." The black haired female would state, before rushing forward. It was a given that she would keep up to the proposal she just made. Her maroon contacts concealed her pair of white eyes beneath them.* - Thu Oct  8 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) keenly gazed at Mirai. The black haired individual would be unable to evade the hit, and thus she was inflicted with the blow. Eagerly, the byakugan wielder would extend her left arm out toward Mirai, aiming to palm strike the back of her wrist, located on the hand that she used to strike her in the shoulder. A small surge of chakra would follow the palm strike, inflicting minimal damage and inflicting little to no disruption to the chakra flow within her palm.

Mizora's attacking speed seemed to be on par with Mirai's, a slight delay on it, however.

"Is there any restriction against using attacking methods other than palm strikes?" She'd ask, but only if she had the time to do so while they were immersed in sparring.* - Thu Oct  8 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) followed Mirai's palm strikes very easily with her keen vision. Though, dodging them with her reaction time was another thing. Mizora would be struck in the waist twice, and struck in the hip. The surgical application of chakra would've immersed her figure in pain rather easily. "Gah..!" She'd yelp, attempting to distance herself. If she was given the opportunity she'd attempt to speak.

"Would it be unfair to use punches with our clan fighting style?" Mizora would state. Her legs would extend out, the soles of her boot-covered feet gliding upon the grains of sand as she gazed keenly at Mirai with her pair of maroon irises. Her arms would remain extended out from her draping, black cloak, her palms remaining open.

Upon recovering the willigness, the black haired female would rush towards Mirai, attempting to strike her with a string of palm strikes. Said string would consist of a left, right, left right pattern, each palm strike aiming to temporarily detour chakra flow in her shoulders with minimal chakra.* - Thu Oct  8 03:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Seems they're still at it. - Thu Oct  8 03:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) gasped loudly upon being struck in the stomach. She'd instantly attempt tod istance herslef from Mirai. She'd quickly try to remove her black cloak, her hands balling into tight fists. "Alright then..." Mizora would state, bending her arms and placing her fists close to her lower face. The sides of her wrists would face Mirai. She'd run forth eagerly, despite having had a majority of her chakra draiend by Mirai's strikes.

She'd throw a right jab toward the female, obviously being very experienced when it came to punching. Her right jab would direct itself toward Mirai's left cheek, and her other fist gestured to strike the female in her stomach region. Chakra still plumed through her fists, meaning that she was stacking her physical strength with her Gentle Fist's main purpose, dealing internal damage and halting the flow of chakra with your own.

Red and black gloves were strewn over the female's fists, as well.

"This is something I've been trying out for awhile!" She'd state to Mirai exuberantly.* - Thu Oct  8 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) had managed to land at least a third blow on Mirai throughout the entirety of the spar. The now cloakless individual would take the double palm strike immediately, her eager rush making her be unablet o evade. Mizora would feel the pain of the chakra-injecting strikes resonate throughout her frame. Her figure would go limp as she was knocked unconscious by the overload on chakra, most likely falling into Mirai's grasp, or on the ground if the female didn't assist her unconscious self with retaining her footing.

The chakra within her ocular nerves dissipated, in addition to the chakra coursing through her hands. It seemed she needed to improve her idea for involving her physical strength with Gentle Fist, or completely revise the idea.* - Thu Oct  8 04:12:09 2015
