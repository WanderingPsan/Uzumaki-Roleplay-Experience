<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: Finally. - Sat Nov 14 06:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) blinked, her gaze agape. It was at that point that this spar had gotten too serious.

"Mirai... take care of Mitsunara if she breaks out of that genjutsu and tries to attack, please." She'd murmur. Her voice was slightly rigid, but she seemed to be doing herself to keep calm.

It was a shame that right after she vowed to not do shinobi work, here she was, attempting to save a shinobi.

Mizora recognized the fact that Mitsunara's screams were over the fact that she was within a genjutsu. The black-haired female moved rather quickly, intending to close the distance between herself and the injured preteenager. She'd attempt to come to a stop when close enough to Nina, crouching down beside her.

Mizora exposed a maroon scarf from who knew where, attempting to coil the entirety of Nina's arm in it to halt blood loss as much as possible. She spoke no words to ease the girl's anxiety, only her actions rather than her words being involved in this situation.

Now, she only intended to pick up Nina, and lead her to Kiyoko.* - Sat Nov 14 07:16:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) proceeded to roam throughout Kiyoko's backpouch, removing the tourniquet that she informed her of, as well as a sufficient amount of gauze. After doing so, she'd give the gauze to Kiyoko, biting her lip in pity of the pain that Nina was going through upon the gauze being shoved into her wound in such a manner. Mizora would proceed to hand over the tourniquet.

The female focused chakra to her eyes, in addition to her hands. Focusing on the shoulder joint, she'd press her hands to the vicinity, immersing the area in a sufficiently measured level of chakra. She adjusted the little girl's shoulder joint utilizing the chakra, relocating the shoulder successfully. She ignored everyone other than Nina and Kiyoko, being focused on her position in the situation at hand.

Once said situation was complete, she'd pick up Nina, showing off her rather impressive level of physical strength. With that being said, Mizora would carry Nina off to the hospital, ensuring that Kiyoko had done the blood test already and was following.* - Sat Nov 14 07:39:56 2015
