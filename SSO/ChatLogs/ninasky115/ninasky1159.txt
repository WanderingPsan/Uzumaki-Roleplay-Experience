<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) clapped her hands as she noticed the lightning ball coming towards her. She had plenty of time to do the handseals, even though they were fairly new to her, and she was a prodigy of course. From there, she'd send her chakra into the earth underneath her, the earth noticibly cracking and such to show that her chakra was in fact getting into it, but it wasn't any use. It wouldn't budge quick enough, and so she had to leap to the side to dodge the lightning ball that was coming towards her.

Flicking hair out of her face, her eyes would set on Kilm and blink, then twist into that of a serious demeanor to show that she was ready for business. "Again!" She was sure about it this time, she had to get it done, and she would if it was the last thing she did. For Ortho and for the others in her life.* - Fri Oct 30 16:36:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked at the fireball and nodded, this one gave him plenty of time to react to the giant flaming ball of fire. That's right, it was a flaming fireball, it made all of the sense in the world. Regardless, clapping her hands together quickly, she'd begin sending her chakra down into the ground in front of her, the earth once again sectioning off in front of her as it did before. Only this time she had way more time to actually let the wall swing up with her chakra, if she'd even be able to swing it up at all, but she felt pretty confident in her abilities.

The large wall would quickly begin to move upwards as the fireball came towards her, she could feel the heat even from this far away. The wall would finally come up and come to a stop at a perfect 90 degree angle with the ground underneath it, and as the fireball came towards it, it'd seem to explode against the wall but the wall would keep its strength throughout the entire attack. It seemed extremely durable, which was a wonderful thing and an awesome jutsu to have for frontal attacks.* - Fri Oct 30 16:46:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked out towards the water and quickly clapped her hands together once again, before she jumped back a bit. Deciding to take this a different way this time, she'd nod and slowly move her hands together into the handseals. As it came towards her, Nina would smile slightly as chakra began to form inside of her body this time. Instead of going into the ground underneath her, she'd form the chakra neccesary in her stomach this time, wondering if it would be quicker or any stronger or anything like that, but there wasn't anything really big to change anyhow.

With a sudden burst of chakra, she'd begin spitting out earth out of her mouth quickly, forming a wall made out of durable mud just infront of her before the water would be able to connect against her. The earth element seemed very useful, and with her jutsu that she had learned from Kilm already, they would be pretty good all together. She just had to find a way to combo some jutsu together to use them all to their highest potential.* - Fri Oct 30 16:57:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) studied the handseals that were being performed by Kilm, for a technique called Earthern Corridor. It woulded pretty weird for a name, but then again what jutsu didn't? Looking at his hands intently, she seemed to be memorizing every handseal that he threw out for the technique, and then finally came the technique in question. As the walls suddenly came up out of nowhere, she'd blink a little. It didn't seem like anything too special, but it was a pretty good jutsu if someone were trying to run or had to be enclosed into something.

With a smile, she'd take the compliment from Kilm and nod, turning her head over just a bit. "I understand." And with that, it was time to get training already. Clapping her hands together to make an audible clapping noise, she'd begin flowing through the handseals quickly as she usually did, allowing all of the chakra needed for the technique to begin channeling through her hands and then into the ground underneath her. And it seemed to work for a while.

Allowing the chakra to effect the earth around her, it'd slowly begin to wiggle upwards, struggling pretty hard to shoot up from the ground in that corridor-shape around Nina.  It seemed pretty impossible, but of course that wasn't true at all, especially considering the amount of jutsu that she had been learning from her teachers. Maybe she had a thing for elements, or something. But alas, even though she wanted the jutsu to land first try, the earth walls crumbled down into the ground, showing that she was indeed a failure for that try.* - Fri Oct 30 17:16:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) brought up her hands once again to clap her hands together. With that, she'd flow through the handseals once again as she usually does, and of course all she does is use handseals pretty much. Almost every day is what she has to do. But she still was doing it, indeed. And from there, her chakra would begin to channel into the ground and into her hands as well, the handseals activating the chakra indeed. Now was the time that she was going to master this technique, there wasn't any doubt.

The chakra was quickly tunneled into the ground around her and the earth was quickly converted into that of hard rocks. And after that, they'd begin to move up around her, attempting to reach the top and block off any exit that she had. It hadn't been moving quickly at all, it was moving extremely slow in fact. But that wasn't anything new at all. The goal was to complete the jutsu, not to finish it instantly. The rock walls slowly moved upwards though, and it seemed that she was mastering the jutsu quite well.

Finally, she got the chakra and earth wall to shoot up quickly, and on top of that allowed it to trap her in it, and at the same time trap anyone outside of it, well, out. With a smile, she'd allow her chakra to fall and allowed the walls to fall as well. Turning her head to Kilm with a smile, she'd throw the girl a thumbs up and chuckle. "I got it, finally." That jutsu was a bit harder without any help or anything, but she still got it down finally.* - Fri Oct 30 17:26:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked at Kilm and his handseals for a bit of time, wondering what exactly he was doing. After a while, she'd look over at Zolo as the spikes seemed to stop right before hitting him. That had to be it, it just had to be. Nothing but chakra control in creating these piercing sticks. She thought she understood the jutsu, but just like most jutsu she had to do she was sure she could get it down pretty well. And after she did get it, it would be a pretty useful technique to use.

Clapping her hands together, she'd attempt to move through the handseals as quickly as she possibly could, before sending her chakra underneath her once again. Sending them into the ground, she'd attempt to manipulate certain bits of earth and morph them into thin yet sturdy spikes of death, however she wasn't as lucky this time. When she tried to make the four spikes come up around her, it seemed that only one would come out, showing tht she understood the concept, but needed a bit more practice.* - Fri Oct 30 17:40:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) clapping her hands together once more, she'd attempt to flow through the handseals quickly enough to finish the jutsu in just a second, and then she'd close her eyes and allow her chakra to be shifted into the ground once more. Allowing her chakra to take shape in the earth, she'd form small spikes of death from the earth to manipulate and move around, hopefully this would work well without her having to worry about anything going wrong. And so, she'd begin trying to manipulate and move the sticks.

After moving them around for a bit and getting the hang of it, she'd turn towards Kilm and have a sly grin on her face. Without any hesitation, she'd shoot the "bamboo" up just in front of Kilm, hoping to scare him back just a bit. But if he just ignored it and continued talking, she'd frown and call him a "party pooper." It was so unfair if he didn't get scared, she had put so much work into this plan that took literally three seconds to come up with and execute!* - Fri Oct 30 17:46:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) says: I Won't get knocked out that easily ! - Fri Oct 30 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked up at Zole as he ran forward. He was pretty slow, but she was only barely faster than him anyway. However, her eyes focused on him intently, awaiting to see what kind of attack he would have to attack with first. As the punch came directly towards her, she'd smirk slightly. "Taijutsu, my first focus in the academy." Raising her hand up to block the attack outside of her comfort zone and before it could connect with anything, Nina would quickly raise her fist up.

Throwing it forward with what would be unbelievable speed to Zole, but would be a snails pace to Kilm. The punch was quick and was meant to rattle his brain from the first attack. If that worked, and he was stunned like she thought he would be, she would quickly follow up with another straight punch directly to his nose. Not strong enough to punch him, but strong enough to knock him back on his ass.* - Fri Oct 30 19:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: How about both of you against me? - Fri Oct 30 20:11:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Sorry. - Fri Oct 30 20:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So you both up for it or? - Fri Oct 30 20:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I suppose so. - Fri Oct 30 20:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) turned her head and quickly shot forward towards Kilm. "We can't give him time to prepare, we're already disadvantaged." As she said that, she'd allow a single handseal, the clone seal, to appear through her hands and allowed her earth chakra to flow through her hands. From the ground, two clones would appear on either side of her, though they would remain stationary while Nina continued to push forward. She wouldn't attack at all, just close a bit of distance.* - Fri Oct 30 20:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) felt the sudden bamboo rock things appearing around her, trapping her quickly. With that, she'd chuckle before pushing chakra into her feet before jumping up into the sky, rising up high. From there, she'd clap her hands together hard, preparing a jutsu all for herself. She didn't know if she had to fight to kill just to stay on par with her or not, but she knew what she had to do to at least get a hit in.

Clone 1 would quickly take off to the side, making just a bit of distance from the other. This way, they couldn't simply get wiped out in one clean sweep. After she got a bit out of range, she'd do a quick set of handseals before dropping to the ground, placing both hands just below her before it shot forward underground. As it shot up, Nina would grin in the air as it turned out to be the jutsu that he had taught her himself, the Earth Stone and Bamboo Shoot.

Clone 2 would clap her hands together as well, the combo flowing as if it were simply being made up as they went along. The Earthen Corridor would suddenly appear in a wider arc around Kilm as well. That way, he had to get through the Bamboo Shoot that was directly around him to trap him, as well as the broader and more defensive Earthen Corridor to get through. The only opening was just above him.* - Fri Oct 30 20:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) watched as Kilm had finally floated up through the one hole, the only way that he would get out that she perfectly calculated. Sometimes it felt good to be a prodigy, hehe. But anyway, back to the task at hand. Pulling her hand up to her mouth after completing the handseals, she'd push her head forward and release a sudden burst of wind, two, to be precise. As she released these two, they would quickly shoot towards Kilm, aiming to slash him up quite a good bit. This was the only way she could really do any damage to Kilm.* - Fri Oct 30 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Hey Yab - Fri Oct 30 20:58:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: hi Nina - Fri Oct 30 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) pulled her hands together and clapped them, allowing her chakra to surge quickly. This allowed a tornado to quickly overtake her, making the lightning move directly towards the tornado and, since wind usually overpowers lightning, causes it to completely disperse all together. This was to protect her from the lightning technique all together, and she would be backing away from Kilm.

As for clone one, she would do another set of handseals before slapping the ground again. This time, she would utilize the jutsu in an offensive matter instead of just trying to trap him. The sharp rocky sticks would shoot up out of the ground and make their way towards Kilm, aiming to penetrate him in both of his shoulders, his lower right knee, and the left side of his stomach. If that hit just like that, he'd most likely also me trapped. But she didn't have the ninjutsu power for that anyway.* - Fri Oct 30 21:05:55 2015
