She'd quickly sip down the drink, three gulps in and her cheeks were already a bright blushing red from the drink.

When the roundhouse kick came, Kinami's legs would suddenly tuck in out of nowhere. The kick would fly right over her and out into nothingness. She'd chuckle a little before literally flinging her body forward at Hiroshi, aiming to clash them together and deal an amount of damage to Hiroshi just from that.

With a giggle and a hiccup, Kinami would begin to do push ups, her head smashing into Hiro's stomach to inflict damage.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) chuckled as she slid on her shell. "Do what you'd like, honestly. I can adjust, mhm." As she said this, she'd smile and look at her.* - Fri Dec  4 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) brought her hands up quickly and smiled. As she moved forward, she noticed the sword coming towards her chest. Kinami's body leaned back quickly to allow the blade to miss its mark, only barely missing at that but still missing enough for her to not take any damage. From there, her leg would slowly come up and aim to kick the girls wrists, hopefully knocking the blade out of her hand.* - Fri Dec  4 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) quickly kicked backwards, backpeddling as her opponent intended her to. She grinned as the girl had tanked the attack, meaning Kinami would raise up the head a little bit. Next would be a full power hit, lets see how she liked the likes of an attack like that, hehehe. Kinami would continue to backpeddle, keeping away from the katana.

From there, Kinami would quickly shift her body before running forward. With the running and the attack speed of the woman, it was slightly more difficult to dodge. Kinami's body quickly turned to the side, the katana cutting her lightly against the arm as she moved. Kinami bit her bottom lip lightly to keep the pain inside. It hurt, but it wasn't anything to make her burst into tears.

As she turned her body, Kinami's arms would lift up. A powerful elbow was thrown towards the chest of Mitsunara. She moved slowly, but attacked quick. With the elbow, she aimed to suddenly stun Mitsunara slightly, and if she did Kinami would send another attack. She'd lift her leg up swiftly in the attempt to knee the girl in the wrist with the same amount of power, to disarm her as she attempted to earlier.* - Fri Dec  4 22:14:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) blinked as she stepped back slightly, the suddenly large sword appeared out of nowhere. It was like she could summon these things. "W-What....." Kinami didn't know how to react. When it finally popped into her mind to run away, she was already being attacked by the weapon. She was suddenly smacked down in the shoulder, the ground beneath her slightly giving way.

However, Kinami didn't seem to take any damage. All worry that she had from before was gone. If she wasn't really tanky, that attack would've torn her arm off. But luckily she was safe when the attack landed on her shoulder. "Oh man, this thing seems awesome. You should've joined the chuunin exams with this!" However, after saying this, she'd begin lifting the blade up.

After lifting it up slightly, she'd look at Mitsunara with a grin. Out of nowhere, she attempted to sling the blade up before shooting forward with her foot outstretched. The kick was aimed directly at the girls chest, meaning to send her flying back and possibly into the rocky wall behind her.* - Fri Dec  4 22:29:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Could I use your sword? I'm kind of new at kenjutsu, but I'd like to get some practice here. - Fri Dec  4 22:39:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) nodded, and slid her shell off. "Thank you. But I'll make sure to give you something much harder to hit." As she smiled and said this, the shell would land in the sand with a huge thud. Some of the sand would even cave in from the weight of it. And from there, Kinami's body began to move around quickly, first moving to grab the blade from the ground.

And from there, she'd move forward towards Mitsunara, a frontal attack being quite obvious. The goal was to get the girl to clash with her regular katana, wanting to see if she could move that quickly with such a giant sword in her hand compared to this little katana that Kinami had. If she could, it'd be a wonderful thing to use.* - Fri Dec  4 22:43:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt the hand pressing down on her body, which wasn't much but it'd still help. With her body moving quickly, her arms would begin to bend down to a 90 degree angle, before Kinami pressed her body back up. The resistance against her was only familiar weight added on to her back as she usually had the turtle shell on.* - Fri Dec  4 23:13:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) was suddenly smacked into, her body being positioned where Chikyu's head landed right into her breasts. She barely noticed it since that wasn't her main concern, and turned her head over towards Momura. "Dang it Momura, why not hit her somewhere else?"* - Fri Dec  4 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: B-Because.. - Fri Dec  4 23:40:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) looked down at Chikyu as she was basically gropping Kinami's chest. Throwing her hands up, she'd push the girl off and over towards Momura. "Damnit Chikyu, stop it! That's it, we're going to spar! All of us!" If they even tried to deny, it'd be too late as Kinami's arms went out to grab them both by the wrist and drag them outside.* - Fri Dec  4 23:45:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) moved forward in response to Momura, her weights slowing her down greatly. Without any hesitation, Kinami would spin her body quickly, suddenly throwing a sudden elbow towards Momura's head as she slithered through that spin quickly. If that landed, Kinami would smile and bring her hands up to her chest, her legs spreading a bit.* - Fri Dec  4 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's body continued to spin as the strikes started to come towards her face. Moving backwards, Kinami would backpeddle as she blocked the strikes with her arms. Some of the strikes being misdirected and pushed to the side, while others were simply dodged completely. Her eyes moved around to look at Momura's body for any additional strikes or openings.

Throwing her body back slightly, she'd twist her body for sure. Since Momura was moving forward with the assault, this would most likely land. Kinami's body turned sideways and leaned to the side, allowing a straight side kick towards the girls stomach, aiming to kick her, stun her, and launch her back after the kick had landed.* - Sat Dec  5 00:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) threw her attack forward quickly as her strike was suddenly dodged out of nowhere. Knowing that Momura usually couldn't dodge her full-speed strikes at all. It was something she hadn't expected at all, but when she had her foot grabbed, she'd chuckle. Her body quickly started to rotate around as she was spun out of nowhere.

With her body being released, Kinami would chuckle and look off at the crowd that she was gathering once again. "Hiroshi, jump in this!" As she said this, Kinami would throw her hands above her, gripping on to the rocks that she was about to clash against. Throwing her body upwards, she'd do a simple flip and skid against the wall, before dropping back down.* - Sat Dec  5 00:12:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Fine, at least I can fight you seriously. Seems Momura is too afraid anyway. - Sat Dec  5 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Sure. - Sat Dec  5 00:21:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) nodded and slid off her weighted turtle shell. With a slight smile, she'd suddenly burst off towards Hiroshi, ignoring the announcement of the exams. She'd been keeping track of the days that passed and knew that it was just around the corner.

Moving towards Hiroshi quickly, she'd smile a little bit and decide to strike him hard enough that it'd hurt him, making sure that he'd get out of the way of the attacks from then on. Her body moved quickly when she suddenly jumped up and began spinning, throwing a powerful kick towards the side of his head.* - Sat Dec  5 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: You... - Sat Dec  5 00:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Scuse' me. - Sat Dec  5 00:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) wouldn't stop to say a single word, her body still moving forward. After Kinami had dropped from the ground, her body would still be spinning, beginning to kick Hiroshi in the ankles and knock him off of his feet. However, he didn't even have the time to turn his body and fall to the ground. Kinami's body continued to spin and spin.

This gave her incredible speed and damage with the attacks, her body slowly beginning to lift up from the ground, and so did Hiroshi's body as well. He knew this technique, but there was no way he could avoid its devastating damage that she knew it would do to him. She grinned slightly as she did this technique, before finally coming to an end.

Out of nowhere, her body lifted up Hiroshi's body with each kick until she suddenly paused and threw an extremely powerful kick towards his shoulder once again. This would would make Hiroshi spin a few times in the air himself, showing the power of this attack. It was pretty powerful, of course. After it landed, it if did, Kinami would kick herself down towards the ground.* - Sat Dec  5 00:34:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) thinks: Oh that guy talks!? - Sat Dec  5 00:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) did a few backflips from the sky as she suddenly inhaled deeply, her body skidding against the sand underneath her as she looked up with a grin. Her jutsu was a success once again. Out of nowhere, Kinami would put all of her power into her feet, shooting up into the air swiftly. Her body matched Hiroshi's body perfectly in his shadow, even if he was spinning.

She'd smile at Hiroshi from underneath and behind him. Out of nowhere, Kinami would throw a sudden kick towards Hiroshi's body, hitting him square in the left side. Spinning once again, she'd send a kick towards his opposite, his right rib. With those two kicks, Kinami had enough momentum to move herself around Hiroshi's body and on top of him.

From there, she'd suddenly spin and aim to plant her heel firmly into Hiroshi's stomach, giving him some pain in the stomach for sure. "Nami's Barrage!" Kinami chuckled a bit as she suddenly kicked off of Hiroshi's body, doing her flips once again before skidding back against the ground once again. "Success, hehe."* - Sat Dec  5 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) chuckled as she heard Hiroshi's comment, giving him a thumbs up. She moved forward towards him at full speed, holding back nothing at all. This might have scared him a little bit, but she wouldn't attack him at all as she slid beside him. "I'm sure you'll do well too. Unless you're matched up against me.~" She'd chuckle a little bit before throwing her arm around his neck. "Joking anyway."* - Sat Dec  5 00:55:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's eyes focused on the body of the girl as she suddenly went into her flying paper god whatever the hell she was doing. This made it to where Kinami was fighting a losing battle already. And even worse, she could fire projectiles while in this form, so Kinami had to sit around and dodge for a few hours of the battle. Good luck audience.

As the attacks came towards her, Kinami would begin to dodge. Her arms were thrown behind her as she ran forward, moving left and right do dodge each of the shuriken that was thrown her way. In return, Kinami would shoot her hand back into her holster and unleash five sudden shuriken towards Ai's overall area, just to see if her attacks would fly through the girl or if she'd dodge.* - Sat Dec  5 02:32:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) suddenly turned her head when she heard Ai speaking. Had it not been for her warning, they would've probably hit her without a problem. Kinami's fighting stance and first gate would suddenly flare up as Kinami quickly shot forward out of nowhere, using her intense speed to her advantage. But knowing how people were in these exams, Ai probably had eight times her speed and could dodge everything.

But still, they wanted her to try, so she'd try. Shooting forward behind the shuriken that were caught by the two sheets, Kinami would ball her fists up powerfully before launching her attack forward into the shield in front of her. She'd completely shatter the shield with her one simple attack, her strength being great enough to break through it.

After breaking through it, Kinami would bring up her left hand and send a very powerful punch towards the center of her chest, testing the waters and wondering if she would simply fly through Ai or connect a solid punch. This was all based on speculation that she could manipulate paper and turn her body into it, but since the shield was punchable, maybe she would be.* - Sat Dec  5 02:53:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) noticed that the wall was much sturdier than she had expected before she had actually hit it, which made this fight even harder. The girl had long range, couldn't be hit by physical objects, and had a shield that Kinami couldn't even break. What the hell was this, favoratism central? Of course she would have to fight someone like Ai.<6>

Doing a frontflip quickly before her feet connected with the shield, she would quickly kick off of this 'wall'. The explosion only assisting in blasting her backwards, luckily she was able to kick herself backwards before they had exploded while she was in such a close range. Kinami was shaking in anger, something Trilliam would remember quite well. This entire match was quite frankly pissing her the hell off.<7>* - Sat Dec  5 03:15:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) continued moving forward as she noticed the handseals, being a dead givaway of a jutsu that was taking place. With her blood bubbling and her anger beginning to tick her off, she'd suddenly move to the side, allowing the fireball to completely miss her while she still moved. It was close still, and she felt the heat, but luckily it wasn't enough to actually burn her.

She now moved forward, attempting to blur out of sight from most of the people. As she moved, she'd place a single explosive tag directly underneath Ai, continuing underneath her at full speed. She did this in secret, letting the explosive tag move directly underneath her as Kinami blurred behind her. With a grin, Kinami would spin around. "Take this!" As she said this, she'd shoot forward.

but none of that mattered because of meteors. Kinami just moved the hell away from it.* - Sat Dec  5 03:32:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) just simply walks forward a little bit since Momura had gotten into place. She giggled at Hiroshi as she turned back at him. "Thanks hun.~" As she said that, she'd turn back around at Momura and bring up her hands, which were now covered up to her elbows. Something might've even happened to her. Spreading her legs slightly, she'd chuckle before her body expanded into power.<8>* - Sun Dec  6 03:30:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's eyes followed the girls movements, Kinami's body already being used to such high speeds. Raising up both of her arms into an X to take the attack, her body would fly back a bit from the strength of the attack, causing Kinami to grimice a bit. Her body wasn't as tough as it usually was for some reason, it was strange to say the very least.<7>

However, this wouldn't take Kinami out at all. "Hehe, my turn." As she said this, she'd shake the attack off a bit before taking a step forward. With this step, she'd begin to zoom past, remembering back to a time where Momura was much faster. But now, the tables were turned. Kinami moved at 154 miles per hour, her blur being much greater than Momura's. Since she was trying to nullify the chuunin exams already, so would she.<8>

With her speed, she'd quickly spin her body down to hit the girl in the legs, however, this didn't seem to be the only attack. Kinami's body would continue to spin more and more. With this spinning, Kinami's strength would begin to raise higher and higher. Their bodies moving up through the air without any worry. Their boyancy seemed to increase a lot.<9>

After she had gotten high enough into the sky, she'd grin and nod slightly, these kicks stunning her most likely. Out of nowhere, Kinami would put all of the force into a single kick, kicking the girl in the chest hard. This was meant to leave Momura's body to fly backwards with her back facing towards the ground while Kinami's body floated to the ground much quicker, reaching the ground way swifter than Momura would.* - Sun Dec  6 03:45:16 2015
