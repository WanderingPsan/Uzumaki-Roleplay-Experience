<br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) kept her grip strong on Hanai, but it wasn't as strong as his at all. The grip actually started to hurt just a bit. However, she wasn't any quitter, she really did want that ice cream. Standing up quickly, she'd spread her legs slightly more and allow her Kung Fu grip to take effect, adding everything that she had into the 'attack' that was this arm wrestle.

Standing up and leaning forward, she'd slam her left palm into the ground, yet her right elbow never left the ground. She'd simply continue to push against Hanai, trying to finally gain the lead against the strong individual that was named Hanai.* - Sun Nov 22 02:54:04 2015

At this rate, if he didn't lose stamina or focus first, she would be on the losing end. Poking her butt to the side, she'd shake it lightly while trying to overpower the man, or maybe even lose his focus. But if he did that, she'd surely have to take advantage quickly to keep her ice cream.* - Sun Nov 22 03:00:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) blinked a little as she looked at it. She wanted one, it seemed like an amazing weight to help her training. But aside from that, Kinami would spread her legs to shoulder width, and chuckle a bit. However, she'd shake her head slightly at the offer of creating the first move. "No, you may do it if you'd like.~" And as she said that, she got a little more serious, bringing both of her hands up to her chest. "Hehe."* - Mon Nov 23 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) kept her eyes on Sanoke the entire time, noting that he was indeed still fast with the shell on, even faster than her. He must've been holding back way more than he let on earlier in life when they sparred, because now he's increased more than she ever could have in a few years. However, she wasn't planning on giving up that easily at all.

Without a bit of hesitation, she'd take the damage from the attacks since she was unable to dodge it at all. However, this wouldn't keep her down one bit. Pulling her fists up, she knew that she couldn't hold back against Sanoke, and so she went forward. Throwing a punch towards Sanoke's face quickly, she threw it directly at his nose.

If that had worked, Kinami would quickly follow up with yet another attack, holding back the damage that she had taken from the bokken. She had a strong body, but he was pretty strong after all. There wasn't much that she could do against that. But still, she was pretty strong and wondered if he could take the damage as well.* - Mon Nov 23 01:09:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt the kick suddenly hitting her ankles after he had ducked underneath her attacks, the second person to ever dodge her attacks at full speed. Biting her tongue lightly, she'd growl in anger as she was falling to the ground. However, she had enough reflexes to not fall face first, and so she reacted quickly. Throwing her hands down, she'd catch herself in the plank position.

From there, Kinami would throw herself up with a fling of her arms, throwing her over the wave of mud just barely as she moved towards Sanoke, her body still spinning in the air. As she approached him, she aimed to throw her leg out, with all of the momentum adding to the attack. From there, she aimed to land a powerful heel kick directly on his nose, hopefully knocking him out before he could do much else.* - Mon Nov 23 01:29:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) noticed that the attacks were coming at her still. She had been dodged once again, easily. It was quite frustrating, she knew he was good however. A nice training partner. Without hesitation, she would move side to side as the attacks came towards her, her body moving on its own to dodge the attacks to the best of her abilities.

Her body kept moving, and before she knew it, she'd be closer to Sanoke. Much closer, even. Once she was in range to attack him, she'd take it happily, and crouch down slightly. She thought he would be ready to fire another bullet at her, so her hands attempted to blur with speed. They were going in a hook towards Sanoke's right side, the attack being simple and to the point. Or, that was the idea, heh.* - Mon Nov 23 01:47:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) would quickly move to the left side of him. The plan was to get him to jump to the left to dodge the quick attack as he had been doing the entire time, and that should've pushed him right into the attack that she was sending towards him. With a smile, she'd bring up her knee quickly, aiming to smack it against Sanoke's head to rattle his brain.

If that worked, she'd continue the attack, pushing her right hand forward to smash against his cheek and push him back as well. Her plan seemed easily flawwed in her book, but it was something that she had never considered, and given his dodging patterns it seemed like a good enough plan to do right now.* - Mon Nov 23 01:53:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Go for it. - Thu Nov 26 18:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's eyes focused on the girl as she moved forward, causing Kinami to quickly spread her legs to be shoulders width apart. Her Kung Fu stance was great, but she had to upgrade sooner or later. However, now wasn't the time for that, she had training to do if she was ever going to keep up her grandfather's legacy. And so, Kinami began to act quickly.

Lifting her arm up, she'd push it forward to grip the elbow tightly, canceling out the force of it as it came into the station. Kinami moved her arm back a bit with its force to ensure that she didn't crack or break a bone. After she did that, she'd lift the girls elbow up lightly and send a powerful kick towards her ribs, aiming to send her flying backwards a bit. She had the speed to recover back anyhow.* - Thu Nov 26 18:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) looked onward at Momura after she was kicked backwards. However, the moment that she saw something being thrown, Kinami began backing up, not knowing what exactly the object was. She continued back-peddling to gain as much distance from whatever it was, however when the smoke suddenly appeared, Kinami went to work. 

She clapped her hands together and did a quick flash of handseals, using the smoke as cover since Momura would've had no way to see them or reach her before there handseals were done. From there, Kinami would hop back and throw her feet backwards, touching the wall behind her before kicking off of it and flying upwards in the air. If someone could sense chakra, they could tell that some jutsu was about to take effect. However, she was left stranded in the air to get away from the attack.* - Thu Nov 26 18:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) looked down as she saw Momura suddenly poof into a simple burst of speed. And in no time, she was suddenly in front of Kinami, throwing a knee out towards her. She was indeed stuck in the attack, and the knee was swift and sudden to her stomach. She opened her mouth to gasp in air, her stomach pounding. However, this was only for a few seconds, before she suddenly poofed away, leaving nothing but a large rock in her wake.

Kinami would appear up where she was at first, smiling slightly. She utilized the Kawarimi technique the moment she hit the wall with her feet. And her plan to get Momura up into the air had worked perfectly. And now, Kinami could do as she wanted with the girl that was stranded in the air. It was simple, easy. But, would Momura know how to react to it, was the problem.* - Thu Nov 26 18:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Fine. As long as we get suffecient training. - Thu Nov 26 18:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) looked at her pocket as she pulled out yet another smoke bomb. "I guess I should get me some super pocket bombs too. Hehe." As she said this, she'd lean back a bit and try to feel around her what was going to happen, hoping that her kung fu reflexes would kick in fast enough for her to react to the attack. Since her attacks were slow after all, but who knew what to look for in this new form?* - Thu Nov 26 18:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Ah. I guess that makes sense. I was going to ask for his help. - Thu Nov 26 18:45:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) thinks: She moves quick but attacks so.. slow. - Thu Nov 26 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt the sudden attack hitting her back, sending her flying forward a bit. This one really hurt her back, more than what it usually did. She could tell that the girl was hitting much harder. And so, Kinami would do the same thing, and begin hitting much harder as well. She smiled, standing up and looking onward at her, feeling this pain in her back that she could ignore.* - Thu Nov 26 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Tch, you get a hit in and quit? You're pathetic for that. - Thu Nov 26 18:54:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mm...hm.. - Thu Nov 26 18:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: You may start us off. - Thu Nov 26 18:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Hm..? Okay. - Thu Nov 26 18:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Should I hit at full strength or..? - Thu Nov 26 19:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Nevermind, I'll ask you that later on. - Thu Nov 26 19:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: (17 AS.) - Thu Nov 26 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: (aiming for your left arm. it'll do 10 internal damage, nothing more.) - Thu Nov 26 19:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) was suddenly struck in the arm by the girls left hand, causing her to take a step back and hold said arm that was hit. Her arm was nearly useless already, and that was with just one strike. Her strong body was completely useless against this fighting style, and she was no doubt fast enough to dodge everything that came her way.

Still, Kinami was going to try. Grandpa wouldn't give up that easily, so neither would she. Taking a step forward, she'd quickly lift up her right leg and send a powerful kick towards the girls chin, aiming to do a nice amount of damage to her. However if she was able to dodge it, then that was the entire spar already.* - Thu Nov 26 19:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (17 as also) - Thu Nov 26 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: (damage?) - Thu Nov 26 19:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (25 holding back) - Thu Nov 26 19:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: (27.6 / 28 durability over here after being doubled from 13.8, btw.) - Thu Nov 26 19:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) grimiced from the three attacks hitting against her body, causing her to grit her teeth and close her eyes tightly. They hurt, they hurt like hell. And to think that Mizora didn't even take any damage from her kicks, it was something different for sure. However, Kinami was determined to get some good training in and Mizora was a great sparring partner.

Getting a hold of herself after a while, she shook her left arm, and smiled a little. Then, she ran off towards Mizora quickly. As she approached, she had average speed, but she thought of herself as quite slow since she was a taijutsu specialist, and she had to improve that as well. Her grandpa would be proud of her until she had died.

When she finally got close to Mizora, she'd lift both arms up before throwing a quick punch towards Mizora's nose, aiming to push her back with a bit more damage since she wasn't hurting from the other one. After that attack, Kinami would throw another straight jab with the other arm towards the girls stomach, and finally she'd jump up to kick the girl in the chest and send her flying back into the wall. All of this was only if she had allowed it.* - Thu Nov 26 19:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (30 damage this time) - Thu Nov 26 19:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: (30 damage for punching ya'fist, 35 for grabbing both of them.) - Thu Nov 26 19:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: (39 for the knee) - Thu Nov 26 19:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: (15 AS in general) - Thu Nov 26 19:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt both of her hands being grabbed. The woman was truly amazing, much more amazing than Kinami. It made her blood dance around inside of her with excitement. With both of her fists grabbed, she wouldn't be able to attack with her hands again, and she sat there waiting for what would happen. When she felt the knee smacking against her stomach, she groaned loudly.

However, in half of a second it all quickly turned around. She went from groaning to being slightly in the air, using Mizora's arms to hold her up and to hold the female in place. Stretching out both of her legs, she aimed to thrust both feet squarely into her chest, drop kicking her hard and landing a direct square hit on her.* - Thu Nov 26 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (52 dura total, 39 damage holding back) - Thu Nov 26 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) gasped slightly as she looked onwards at Mizora, she had seemed to have pulled out an entire transformation. She was now like a boss fight or something of that matter. It was something that she couldn't handle, since she couldn't even handle the girls regular fighting style that she used everyday. And now, she seemed to be able to mix strong fist and her regular fighting style.

Kinami grit her teeth lightly, but continued to look on at her. Then, Kinami threw her hands up with power, and yanked them back down in front of her chest to show that she was ready. "Let's! No more holding back for me!" As she said this, she'd smile and begin running forward, her eyes locking on to Mizora.* - Thu Nov 26 19:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: (19.4 AS, 50 damage per physical hit, ofc 10 static damage per gentle fist strike. not aiming at any vital areas.) - Thu Nov 26 19:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) would continue to run forward as she was barraged by the large amount of attacks that was coming her way. This wasn't something that was an easy task, she was sure, but for some reason it didn't hurt all that much. She felt it of course, and it stung slightly every time she was hit, but it wasn't anything to make her wince or anything.

However, when she was jabbed in the side, Kinami suddenly flew back far, rolling against the ground. Skidding slowly, Kinami would pop herself back up and place a hand on the ground, both feet behind her as she came to a skidding stop on the ground. From there, she'd stand up and rub her body in multiple places.

"Jesus, that last hit hurt like hell. Your fighting style is amazing, Mizora. I can see why you're held to such a high class." Kinami felt a sudden ping of injury inside of her side, but tried to shake it off as if it weren't that bad. "Next time, I'll have my own trump card, so I hope you'll accept a spar from me again one day."* - Thu Nov 26 19:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Hehe, I'll have to learn and master that one day. To my own extent, at least. - Thu Nov 26 19:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: I plan to master every single fighting style there is. - Thu Nov 26 19:58:56 2015
