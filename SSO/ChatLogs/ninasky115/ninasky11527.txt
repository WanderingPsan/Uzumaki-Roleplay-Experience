<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: She's a physical specimen unlike any i've ever seen. - Sun Dec  6 03:55:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) decided to just end this right then and there. When she hit the ground, Kinami would put all of her power into her legs so that she could jump into the air with great speed. Kinami would most likely go invisible to most in the area as she appeared behind Momura in the air. With a smile, her arms would quickly shoot up towards Momura, but it wasn't her that was attacking?<11>

Kinami moved her arms quickly, allowing the bandages to shoot outwards and begin to wrap around Momura's body, starting around her arms and hands to cancel any handseals that she might've done. This was all moving so quickly that it seemed that the bandages had a mind of their own. Kinami would pull back her arms as the bandages tightened.<12>

From there, Kinami would pull her hands up and grab the bandages tightly, her body quickly pulling back so that their heads were pointed directly towards the ground. With a grunt, Kinami would begin spinning their bodies as they hurdled towrds the ground. It was obvious that this jutsu was new to her, and was quite taxing of her stamina.<13>

As she hurdled towards the ground, she'd explode into a load of dirt, smoke, and sand. The impact was quite powerful, as was the degree of the jutsu. Kinami would be seen flipping out of the smoke, backflipping as her bandages were still unwrapped. She seemed to be panting from the amount of physical energy she had to put into the technique.<14>* - Sun Dec  6 04:03:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Wait so it is over Sanoke? - Sun Dec  6 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt the girl slip out of her clutches somehow, which she thought wasn't possible because it really wasn't, but whatever. She would stop the technique just before hitting the ground so that she safely rolled away instead. Looking over towards Momura, Kinami would cross her arms. "If you don't want to fight me, then just give up. No need to waste our time."<15>* - Sun Dec  6 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Unsure. THe participants will decide this. - Sun Dec  6 04:16:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Guess he really didn't like my answer. - Sun Dec  6 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) gripped her fights tightly as Momura landed. When she began talking, Kinami would kick off of the ground, taking no hesitation at all. The fact that she had gotten out of her front lotus had pissed her off majorly. Without any hesitation at all, Kinami would aim to appear beside Momura once again, her leg being thrown forward to kick the girl directly in the head.<15>

This all, of course, was aimed to be finished before she even got the idea to rush forward, and while she was still speaking. If this worked, Momura would most likely be sent flying to the side, but Kinami wasn't done at all with her attault. Kinami would grin and begin running beside the girl who would be flying through the air, making sure to add to the assault.<16>

As she moved beside the girl, Kinami would begin beating her down similar to how Android 13 did in dragon ball z. Her body moved at a blur and her attacks were even quicker, the attacks kneeing Momura in the back to keep her in the air, while being punched all over her body without Kinami holding back. She was hoping to end it with this assault clearly.<17>

At the end of the road, Kinami would move in front of Momura suddenly, lifting her leg up quickly as she flew towards the girl. When Momura finally got close enough, Kinami would throw her foot down quickly on top of the girls face, aiming to smash her head into the ground with explosive strength, morphing the ground beneath her from the attack. But this was all non-lethal, of course.<18>* - Sun Dec  6 04:28:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's assault had connected against Momura. Kinami allowed her body to rest and let the gate as well as her fighting style drop. Picking Momura up with one hand by her shirt, she'd walk the girl to Sanoke. "We might need a medic for her, I don't know."* - Sun Dec  6 04:33:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) nodded and followed Mitsunara. She didn't understand the fun in drunken fighting.* - Mon Dec  7 05:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) smiled and pulled out her own personal Sake that she kept on her. "You'll see. It'll be interesting." After saying that, she'd bring the bottle up to her lips, her face slowly turning red and hiccuping after only three sips.* - Mon Dec  7 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) suddenly "passed out" on the table, her body all sprawled over the top with the Sake bottle tightly gripped in her hand.* - Mon Dec  7 06:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) had the bottle nudging her off of the table, her body hitting the ground hard. Kinami would blink a little as she pushed herself forward using her fingers, her head basically headbutting the girls shins.* - Mon Dec  7 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) giggled as she hiccuped, and then started scrunching her body up like a worm while crawling towards the door.* - Mon Dec  7 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) continued scrunching around before turning around to look at Mitsunara. She'd stick her tongue out at the girl before standing up without the use of her arms, which might've even been creepy. "W-We're going to spar, wight here! *hiccup*"* - Mon Dec  7 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) blinked a little as she started to lose her balance. Kinami would throw her arm back out of nowhere as far as she could, as she took a few steps back to dodge the attack. Kinami's left hand wrapped around her right shoulder, before she coughed. "Gomu Gomu No....*hiccup*" After saying this, Kinami's body would shoot forward with a sudden burst of speed and power.<20>* - Mon Dec  7 06:19:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's arm suddenly jerked back out of nowhere, her back bending out of nowhere. Kinami's body went back quickly and suddenly with dodging intent, almost impossibly if she hadn't been drunk like she had been. And before Mitsunara could even throw another attack, Kinami's head would be thrown forward, her body twirling through the air lightly before aiming to headbutt the girl in the center of her chest.<21>* - Mon Dec  7 06:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt the attacks crashing into her body, which made Kinami fall to the ground. It didn't seem that her body was all that hurt, because it honestly wasn't. However, Kinami was a crazy fighter when she was drunk so there she slept.* - Mon Dec  7 06:48:19 2015
