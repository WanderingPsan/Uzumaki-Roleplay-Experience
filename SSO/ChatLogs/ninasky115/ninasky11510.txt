<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) turned her head towards the her right quickly as she heard something about him doing his favorite combo, so she knew that he would be one of the ones attacking. Clapping her hands together, she'd flow through a series of handseals before forcing her hands against the ground, even though it wasn't needed. Allowing a large wall to come up infront of her to defend against Trilliam.* - Sun Nov  1 00:52:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) clapped her hands together and began to flow through handseals. Rising up quickly, she'd turn towards the wall and would prepare to fire something when she was suddenly hit in the shoulder by an unknown object, ripping through the wall as it connected. Her muscles quickly began contracting as she fell back on to the ground. Her teeth gritted in pain, she'd never really saw anyone use lightning in battle, this was definitely new to her. She fell to the ground and continued convulsing for a few seconds while the electricity began to wear off, leaving her body on the ground for a few more seconds.* - Sun Nov  1 01:34:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) was a bit shaken up indeed, but she knew she had to get back up. It was something quite hard for her to do, and she seemed to be struggling as she did so, but she finally got up after all. As she clone was moving towards her, she'd stagger up and take a step forward, before rushing forward without any hesitation. It seemed that she were ready for a fight now, and was sick of playing ninjutsu and range. She was much better at taijutsu now, and she was going to show it, to at least put up a good fight.

As she got much closer to the clone, she'd clap her hands together and, focusing her chakra around the clone, she'd create a tornado big enough for the two of them. This was so that the clone couldn't escape as easily, and she could move in on it. When she got close enough, she'd quickly pull up her hands in the form of closed fists, her arms up to her face to protect her while she was still able to see through. And then, moving forward extremely quickly in her own eyes, she'd throw a fist forward directly into the clones nose, hoping to disperse it.* - Sun Nov  1 02:07:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Right. - Sun Nov  1 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) crawled out of the ground and looked over at Trilliam. "Next time, I want to see what you can do with a sword, hmph." Turning her head, she'd begin walking into the village and look for Ortho.* - Sun Nov  1 03:18:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) sighed and forced chakra into her feet, before quickly crouching down and jumping back through high into the sky. To land beside Ortho, she'd groan and crouch down slightly. Looking up at him, she'd begin whispering lightly to him, perhaps making a plan or something.* - Sun Nov  1 03:50:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yeah, Kinda. - Sun Nov  1 09:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: They were about to. - Sun Nov  1 09:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I just didn't want it to go too far. - Sun Nov  1 09:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Oh. - Sun Nov  1 09:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So I gave them antidotes. - Sun Nov  1 09:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I see. - Sun Nov  1 09:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You up to do something? - Sun Nov  1 09:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Like what? - Sun Nov  1 09:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Eat perhaps or just talk. - Sun Nov  1 09:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Either is fine. - Sun Nov  1 09:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . Talk while eating? - Sun Nov  1 09:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: That's okay too. - Sun Nov  1 09:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Okay, Follow me then. - Sun Nov  1 09:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) hopped on his back.* - Sun Nov  1 09:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked up at Kilm and shrugged after heearing him talk, as well as taking her chair push in. Looking down at the menu, she'd smile and point to a picture of food that looked pretty good, but she didn't feel like pronouncing the name of it, it seemed pretty long and expensive anyway. She'd smile and look up at Kilm, looking for if she was able to get it. Also, she'd wve at the raccoon with a big smile on her face.* - Sun Nov  1 09:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked down at the tea that was poured into a little tea cup. Looking up at the Raccoon, she'd smile and giggle at it, picking up the cup with both hands and taking a sip of it. It was pretty good, too. Even though she hadn't really drank a lot of tea anyway. Reaching forward with an open hand, she'd try to lightly pet the raccoon, rubbing her hand lightly over his fur.* - Sun Nov  1 09:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) giggled as she kept petting the racoon, feeling the warmth around her neck like a fluffy little scarf. As the food came, she'd smile and move forward, picking up her chopsticks with one hand and diving into the food platter in front of her. She'd eat the single riceball that she had, a small dipping sauce accompanying it. With a smile, she'd much into it, never taking her hand from the fluffly beast known as Chopper as she just rubbed it more and more.* - Sun Nov  1 09:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) nodded and looked over at Chopper, laying her head on it softly while she ate. She moved over to take a dumpling, eating one of them slowly. After that, she'd reach forward with chopsticks and grab another one, lifting it up to Chopper. "Try one." She'd smile as she said this, and if he tried to refuse, he'd have to deal with the saddest face put of all time from the girl that had been petting him for the longest of times now. And then! After he ate it, she'd turn to Kilm and nod. "He's fluffy."* - Sun Nov  1 09:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: So Kilm, what do you want to talk about then?~ - Sun Nov  1 10:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Eh, What do -you- want to talk about? I'd rather talk about that. - Sun Nov  1 10:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Umm, I don't know. - Sun Nov  1 10:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You planning to get a fluffy summon like him? - Sun Nov  1 10:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Do they have fluffy gorrilas? - Sun Nov  1 10:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: gorillas* - Sun Nov  1 10:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: They might have some. - Sun Nov  1 10:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Maybe fluffier than Chopper there. - Sun Nov  1 10:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Maybe.~ - Sun Nov  1 10:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm, Have you tried mastering your techniques? - Sun Nov  1 10:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Mhm. - Sun Nov  1 10:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm not sure why I feel like being lazy right now. - Sun Nov  1 10:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Like . . . I want to lie around. - Sun Nov  1 10:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: You're a lazy person. - Sun Nov  1 10:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I picked up my habits from other friends. - Sun Nov  1 10:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hah. - Sun Nov  1 10:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I had so far two lazy best friends. - Sun Nov  1 10:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Must be nice to have friends huh. - Sun Nov  1 10:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I have two. You and Index. - Sun Nov  1 10:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Which one do you like more? - Sun Nov  1 10:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I don't know. - Sun Nov  1 10:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well I guess it's hard to choose which friend is better than the other. - Sun Nov  1 10:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Most of the time it's best not to compare - Sun Nov  1 10:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Yeah. - Sun Nov  1 10:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I hope you don't use chopper as a teddy bear. - Sun Nov  1 10:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) nodded, getting ready to climb up on his back.* - Sun Nov  1 10:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: No one is around in the square . . . Might as well hang out here. - Sun Nov  1 10:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Okay. - Sun Nov  1 10:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So erm, Have you ever tried pranking someone? - Sun Nov  1 10:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Nuh uh, never. - Sun Nov  1 10:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: But you do like to joke around, Right? - Sun Nov  1 10:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Sure. - Sun Nov  1 10:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I mean, You did scare me that one time. - Sun Nov  1 10:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hehe.~ It was fun. - Sun Nov  1 10:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Why are you so lazy? Lame-o. - Sun Nov  1 11:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Because my other friends are lazy too. - Sun Nov  1 11:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: What about you? - Sun Nov  1 11:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hmm? - Sun Nov  1 11:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Are you lazy? - Sun Nov  1 11:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I'm lazy sometimes, when there's nothing to do. - Sun Nov  1 11:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well that's the case for me right now. - Sun Nov  1 11:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Mhm, right now. More like always. - Sun Nov  1 11:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You have not seen my best friend. - Sun Nov  1 11:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: She is more lazy than me. - Sun Nov  1 11:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Who? - Sun Nov  1 11:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Katsune. - Sun Nov  1 11:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Ahh. - Sun Nov  1 11:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Wanna go and visit mom? - Sun Nov  1 11:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: She's back? - Sun Nov  1 11:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We can if you want. - Sun Nov  1 11:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I don't know. She might be. - Sun Nov  1 11:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Let's find her then? - Sun Nov  1 11:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I wish more people were awake. - Sun Nov  1 11:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Same. - Sun Nov  1 11:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Maybe they're just busy. - Sun Nov  1 11:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Maybe. - Sun Nov  1 11:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I dunno what there is to do for fun at the moment. - Sun Nov  1 11:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I don't know either. I need more kids around my age. - Sun Nov  1 11:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yeah, They would suit you better. - Sun Nov  1 11:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) kidnaps Kilm and runs outside to find something to do. Off guard attack!* - Sun Nov  1 11:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) thinks: How does he know everyone's name? I've been around longer than him! - Sun Nov  1 12:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) moved inbetween them with her arms up. "Calm down! Jeez, we're only here to hang out. You know, chill!"* - Sun Nov  1 12:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: See? Isn't that all better? - Sun Nov  1 12:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) crossed her arms and snarled. She'd raise her hand up and start scratching his head, showing that mister raccoon there was her pet. That's right, the mighty raccoon sage was reduced to a little pet for a twelve year old girl. She's stick her tongue out at Chikyu, but then she'd shrug it off out of boredom. She'd continue to look at the big sword that the girl had. "Aww, that seems like fun." After she said that, she'd whip out her blade and inspect it, looking at the craftsmenship. The craftsmenship!!!* - Sun Nov  1 12:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hehe...I'm sure I'll learn a lot if you are as great of a teacher as you say you are. Whether it be through you, or maybe one of your students. - Sun Nov  1 12:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Training is always more then just physically building up strength, it includes character as well. - Sun Nov  1 12:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) stuck her tongue back out at Chikyu, and waved her sword around as well. "I'm still better!~" She'd run back around waving her katana around as if she weren't used to holding a sword at all. Though she'd stop every time to scratch his head lightly, before running back around waving her sword. It seemed that she was doing nothing but having fun at this moment.* - Sun Nov  1 12:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) spun around, her swordsmanship being challanged. "Oh yeah!? Kilm, tell her!" She'd cross her arms and await her praise.* - Sun Nov  1 12:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Of course, earth is a great teacher. Though, it takes some truly special to get lessons out of it. My father told me about many fighting styles based off animals, but watching snakes and lizards fight didn't teach me much. Though, I've never been that good of a learner! - Sun Nov  1 12:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) thinks: Hm, I guess I've been replaced already. Gosh. - Sun Nov  1 12:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hehe, thats getting way above my head. Though, I believe you two must be very strong. My hand still stings from your handshake. I'm already glad, you are my friend and not my enemy. - Sun Nov  1 12:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) sighed and plopped down on the ground. Everyone was talking about learning stuff now, but when she was in the mood for training and sparring everyone was trying to hae fun. She hated being a kid so, so much.* - Sun Nov  1 13:00:22 2015
