<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's eyes just watched him as he moved forward, shaking her head. He was quite slow, and obviously new to taijutsu. However, she wanted to see how he went about attacking first.* - Sun Dec 13 00:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's eyes continued to look at Ibbaki as he ran forward, sighing slightly as she raised her hands up to combat the shuriken. She simply swiped her hand back and forth, taking each shuriken in her hand easily. They would be gripped in her hand as she noticed that Ibbaki was in front of her now. With a slight grin, she felt the kick to her chin.<150>

As she was suddenly kicked, she would take no damage at all, however she didn't want to ruin a kiddo's future yet, so she let her body fly up as she jumped off of her legs, most likely unseen by the kid. Now was the time to see, did he create a jutsu similar to her own, or did he have something else up his sleeve?<151>* - Sun Dec 13 00:40:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) sighed as she flew through the air, the kunai that was thrown at her would do nothing but bounce off of her body. And now, she was falling towards the ground. If he was going to attack, this would be the time to do so.* - Sun Dec 13 00:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) sighed as she had expected a bit ore from the boy that was in front of her. However, the time for playing around was over. As she landed on the ground, she would notice the boy had appeared in front of her once again, spinning around and throwing a kick outwards. Kinami nodded slightly as she recognized the jutsu.<153>

However, instead of a low kick afterwards, the boy went back up into a higher kick. As the kick came towards her face, Kinami's hand would raise out of what seemed like nowhere to grab the boys ankles. "Hm, you'd be a nice little student, perfect for my academy that is coming up." As she said that, she'd grip the ankle lightly.<154>

This was meant to do a bit of damage to him, make him feel the pain of her grip slightly before spinning around. She'd throw the boy away from her position, leaving him skidding against the sand beneath him for quite a while. She crossed her arms to see how he would take the attack, since she really didn't punch the boy at all, just threw him away.<155>* - Sun Dec 13 00:59:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) chuckled as she took a step back. She'd then move forward, everyone realizing what she was doing if they were high enough level. Kinami's body would've disappeared from his view unless he was used to seeing such a high level of speed. Appearing directly in front of him, probably without him seeing where she went, she'd chuckle.<155>

"You're too slow, but you're good. About as good as me when I was at your level." As she said that, she'd raise her leg up and kick the boy in the chest, sending him flying back a bit. However, before he could hit the ground, Kinami would run around him in yet another blur of speed and punch him back towards the ground where he had come from, both of these increasing a bit in power.<156>* - Sun Dec 13 01:09:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) looked over at him as he just shot forward with the shuriken coming towards her. She grinned as she reached up to grab her tanto, deciding to show off her use of a blade once again. She quickly unsheathed the tanto and moved it in a quick blur of speed, the blade quickly knocking away all of the shuriken that were in front of her.<157>

From there, Kinami would move forward with her tanto, allowing the strikes to hit her for no damage. Kinami literally just sat there as the knee hit her stomach and the elbow hit her hard in the nose, something that she could easily ignore. Placing the tanto against his shoulders, she'd chuckle and wind at him. "You lose.<158>* - Sun Dec 13 01:26:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) suddenly saw as Geo had come forward, Kinami's body ready to react quickly. As the first attack came towards her, Kinami's eyes strained to follow them, but she followed them somehow, probably because she was used to moving at such speeds herself. Kinami's arm quickly shot that way, pushing away the punch.<159>

The other knee that was smacked into her stomach sent her flying back a bit, skidding against the ground, however Kinami did hold her ground. Rushing forward, Kinami's body aimed to lower down and take off with speed, her fists gripped powerfully into an attack that she was going to give Geo, or was she? That was the true question.<160>

Lifting the punch upwards quickly into an uppercut aimed directly at his chin, she aimed to draw his attention towards said uppercut, leaving him to dodge or block, or even take the hit. However, the true addition was in her spinning. As she spun, Kinami would quickly throw out her right leg in a powerful side kick where she made a perfect T with her body, aiming to send Geo back.<161>* - Sun Dec 13 01:49:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) says: Alright. - Sun Dec 13 12:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Chikyu. - Sun Dec 13 12:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: ...Kinami. - Sun Dec 13 12:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Wanted to say sorry for a year ago, since I can see you're still upset about that. - Sun Dec 13 12:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Well.. yeah, you knew I liked Mitsunara... then against my will... It hurt. I trusted you to help me, not to make fun of me. - Sun Dec 13 12:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) says: Hassan, I've decided. - Sun Dec 13 12:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) says: I'd like to take on your offer and become your student. - Sun Dec 13 12:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) raised her hand to pat the girl on the head, if she was allowed to. "It was all a joke hun. I'll get you two together." As she said this, she'd turn to Kaiser. "Awesome."* - Sun Dec 13 12:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Oh my. - Sun Dec 13 12:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) says: Good. When you're finished let's begin. - Sun Dec 13 12:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Eh? - Sun Dec 13 12:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: I get it, no more jokes. - Sun Dec 13 12:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: A handshake doesn't seem like forgiveness from a best friend. - Sun Dec 13 12:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) says: Hm? - Sun Dec 13 12:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Its a seal to start. Because, I may give my trust openly and frriendship. But, I'm not a fool willing to be played twice. You'll just have to regain my trust. - Sun Dec 13 12:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) thinks: She's really overreacting over a joke. - Sun Dec 13 12:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) shrugged and shook her hand. "Come on, I'm going to go and train Kaiser, I want you to come with."* - Sun Dec 13 12:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Makeinu(Sensena) says: Mommy? - Sun Dec 13 12:29:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hey there little one~ - Sun Dec 13 12:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) says: A-Rank? Really?! - Sun Dec 13 12:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Hopefully. B-ranks are really simple. - Sun Dec 13 12:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: A ranks are not as simple as you think. - Sun Dec 13 12:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Not everyone has your strength Nami. - Sun Dec 13 12:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: I understand that, but. - Sun Dec 13 12:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Anyone can give a private lesson, that's a B-rank mission. - Sun Dec 13 12:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: And you're not quite ready to handle an A rank. - Sun Dec 13 12:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: One silly up, you fail the misison and kill off your comrades. - Sun Dec 13 12:31:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: If I'm able to hit someone, though! It's game over! Hehe. - Sun Dec 13 12:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) says: Really? Not even Senpai-Kinami is ready for an A-Rank? - Sun Dec 13 12:32:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) says: Awaaaaay, swooosh! - Sun Dec 13 12:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) says: Alright. What're we doing for today? - Sun Dec 13 12:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Working on your reflexes. - Sun Dec 13 12:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) says: M'kay, easy enough. - Sun Dec 13 12:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: I'm not pulling my punches, they'll be coming at full speed. - Sun Dec 13 12:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) says: No problem. - Sun Dec 13 12:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: .... - Sun Dec 13 12:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) thinks: He really doesn't know what that means, alright then. - Sun Dec 13 12:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Come at me. - Sun Dec 13 12:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) thinks: She's durable, I should be able to inflict an attack. - Sun Dec 13 12:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's eyes continued to follow the boy, her eyes not even straining. "Hm, I got used to it...." As she thought about this, her eyes continued to focus on him, making sure not to let him leave her vision. She even heard where he was going, which was quite amazing to her. However, she had to keep her focus, and quickly she began to counterattack.<162>

Bringing her hand up to her stomach, she aimed to catch the attack and swing her legs without any emotion towards his lower legs, knocking him off balance. The attacks came swiftly, he most likely didn't even see them. "I told you to focus on your reflexes. You won't improve anything for a while, but over time it will come to you." It was clear that she wasn't going to get him accustomed to anything in seconds, everything would take time.<163>* - Sun Dec 13 12:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's reflexes were quite quick now, and her hand quickly shot upwards to grip his ankle once more. She really was something unseen by Taijutsu, as the Kazekage had once said. Her hand wrapped around his ankle once again and threw him up into the air. From there, Kinami's body seemed to move on its own, knowing exactly what it was doing.<164>

Kinami's body suddenly disappeared from the ground out of nowhere, blurring out of Kaiser's vision entirely. She would've appeared behind Kaiser quickly, and while he was stranded in the air he had no choice but to let what would happen to him happen. He had no way to defend against it, all he could do was sit there and take the attacks.<165>

From behind him up in the air, Kinami would sigh. "You're too slow, offense isn't always the best. Sometimes you should learn how to play defense and counter" As she said this, she threw a kick towards his left side, then sent yet another to his right one. She wasn't the one to always sit back and play defensive, but he was going against someone way above his level.<166>

Kinami wouldn't finish the technique, she'd just allow their bodies to fall to the ground, neither of them taking real damage since she held back majorly against Kaiser.* - Sun Dec 13 12:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's eyes continued to look at Kaiser as he grabbed his weapons. Out of nowhere, Kinami would disappear from view, her speed being that high. As he was in the middle of throwing them, Kinami would be behind Kaiser without any time. "You're still too slow, focus on watching the speed of the enemy."* - Sun Dec 13 13:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) saw him whip around with yet another kick, the kick connecting with her chest. She began to skid back slightly, but it showed that it didn't hurt her at all. "You won't beat me if you can't even land a hit. We will focus on your strength later."* - Sun Dec 13 13:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Mhm, that is all for now. Later you'll have self workout. - Sun Dec 13 13:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Be sure you drink a lot of water, there's a lot of improvement you need to work on. All will come together in time. - Sun Dec 13 13:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Hey, Auntie Lera. - Sun Dec 13 13:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hrm? - Sun Dec 13 13:26:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Uh huh...? - Sun Dec 13 13:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Could I borrow some yen from ya? About a million or so? - Sun Dec 13 13:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: A million? Eh. Why not. - Sun Dec 13 13:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) caught the bag of money and smiled. "Thanks auntie Lera."* - Sun Dec 13 13:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: You're welcome. - Sun Dec 13 13:30:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Well, I'm opening a dojo for people to train their taijutsu in. - Sun Dec 13 13:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: And hopefully I'll expand further into different weaponry. - Sun Dec 13 13:34:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Or get another teacher in there with me to teach some more. - Sun Dec 13 13:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hm. You could always ask iza. - Sun Dec 13 13:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: I could, mhm. - Sun Dec 13 13:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: I might think about opening a ninjutsu branch of the dojo, so that you could teach there too.~ - Sun Dec 13 13:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Heh, maybe. We'll see~ - Sun Dec 13 13:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Momura, why so quiet? - Sun Dec 13 13:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Hmmm...I could do with a spar... - Sun Dec 13 13:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Tell her about your accomplishments, miss rival of mine. - Sun Dec 13 13:39:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: I will then, since no one else wants to. - Sun Dec 13 13:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Why not both of you at the same time~ - Sun Dec 13 13:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: That seems a bit unfair. - Sun Dec 13 13:44:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: Right. - Sun Dec 13 13:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright you two...lets see what you can do. - Sun Dec 13 13:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: Uh-huh. - Sun Dec 13 13:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: Shall I begin? - Sun Dec 13 13:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Go ahead. - Sun Dec 13 13:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Still alive uh? - Sun Dec 13 13:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: H-Huh.. Yea..  - Sun Dec 13 13:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: How is Konoha? - Sun Dec 13 13:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt the sudden burst of chakra that surrounded the area, stunning her slightly. Kinami couldn't even move, it was so sudden, the girl's chakra was just that high. Her eyes looked over towards Lera, wondering how one could have such powerful chakra as to put it out in an area and stun the people around. However, Kinami wasn't one to give up that easily.<167>

"H-Ha! You think.......it'd be that easy!?" Kinami began to take a step, and then another, this could simply show how powerful her body and taijutsu was, or maybe it was more will, how would the public take something like that? Never the less, after a while, Kinami was bursting forward at full speed towards Lera, as if nothing was even around her anymore.<168>

As she ran, Kinami's arm would quickly come up and throw a swift punch towards the side of Lera's face, trying to send her flying slightly whether she took the pain or not. If she wasn't able to attack, she wanted to see just how Lera would react to such a thing.<169>* - Sun Dec 13 13:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Destroyed. Mmm..  - Sun Dec 13 13:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Yeah.. - Sun Dec 13 14:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: But hey, your kage is still alive. - Sun Dec 13 14:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: My kage?  - Sun Dec 13 14:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: I am from around here.  - Sun Dec 13 14:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: I live here. - Sun Dec 13 14:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Oh? I see. - Sun Dec 13 14:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Not inKonoha. I was there to visit Rias.  - Sun Dec 13 14:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Well, she's safe. - Sun Dec 13 14:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Good..  - Sun Dec 13 14:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) says: Go, Senpai! - Sun Dec 13 14:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) thinks: Her skin got darker..Interesting. - Sun Dec 13 14:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Fighting her would actually be a headache.. - Sun Dec 13 14:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt her punch connecting, her eyes just barely noticing the sudden brown skin that appeared where her fist had connected. It seemed Lera could make her skin tougher with the use of a jutsu without any handseals, which made things a bit more interesting indeed. "Hey, I guess that means I can go full power, right?" As she said this, she grinned.<170>

Kinami's leg suddenly shot to the side with a certain power that only trained taijutsu users could use, showing that her real fighting style was activating now. Even without her first gate, this could be seen as something that'd boost a few things much better. Her eyes focused on her auntie, with a large smile. It's not often that someone could take her full punches and go on.<171>

Bursting forward once again, she aimed to appear in front of Lera, drawing her attention to the front. She feigned a punch forward, and then disappeared once more, her body now suddenly on the side of Lera. A powerful roundhouse swung outwards towards her jaw once again, aiming to send Lera flying once again. She wouldn't barage the woman until she was sure how much the girl could take.<172>* - Sun Dec 13 14:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: --Is she trying to kill her? - Sun Dec 13 14:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) thinks: ...C'mon, Senpai. - Sun Dec 13 14:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) would've continued to move forward as she noticed the girl's hands clapping together. Out of nowhere, Kinami's body jumped forward out of nowhere, high above Lera's body, causing the water shoot forward for no reason. Hopefully she was high enough for the jutsu to miss her all together.<173>

Kinami's body seemed to have changed in the air, changing from the toned and tough, calculated fighter to one that had never fought in their life when they were concious. Her body was limp and loose, as if it had been broken apart with no bones in her body. She looked up at Lera with another smile. "Ha!"<174>* - Sun Dec 13 14:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Hm.. - Sun Dec 13 14:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's body was suddenly thrown forward by the powerful gust of wind, Kinami already knew this was a losing battle but it was all training in her eyes. It seemed that even drunken fist couldn't save her from taking some damage, which meant that she had to take it even further a step, see how she would deal with something like that.<175>

Kinami hit the ground and quickly bounced back up, her body being tough enough to handle the attack that hit her, only because her aunt decided to hold back so much. This made Kinami grin a little bit, knowing exactly what she had to get better with to fight such a proficient ninjutsu user, knowing that it was already her weakness.<176>

Spreading her legs slightly to her Kung Fu stance once more, she allowed something in her head to pop open, her body being flooded by a nonexistant chakra. Her muscles tensed up slightly as they began to use one hundred percent of their capacity instead of just the twenty percent that everyone else used on a daily basis.<177>

From there, Kinami began to shoot forward once again, trying to blur from speed so that even Lera couldn't realize what she was doing. She had to get close enough to the girl to hit her without being blasted down by ninjutsu. She went directly for a frontal attack, crouching down and kicking up into Lera's chin. She was holding back as to not blow her body apart, but it still held considerable damage.<178>* - Sun Dec 13 14:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) continued to run forward, wondering how the wall would deal. She was sure that it wouldn't simply be that easy to break through it, so she would try to use her best jutsu to break through said wall. This would only prove how powerful that she was getting, knowing that Lera's wall would have the toughest strength in the world.<175>

Pulling her hand back, she'd thrust her fist forward with all of her strength, making sure to use the technique that Geo had taught her. As she punched it, multiple cracks and such might've appeared on the wall, but then there was the second punch. A burst of sheer air pressure that broke through the wall, unseen to the naked eye unless they had trained to see it. Possibly even hearing it if they were able to.<176>* - Sun Dec 13 14:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) sighed slightly as she jumped away from the technique, panting lightly even though she wasn't all that tired. "I give."* - Sun Dec 13 15:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright. Keep training, I'll see you later Kinami. - Sun Dec 13 15:07:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: Good. - Sun Dec 13 17:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: You're very generous. - Sun Dec 13 17:33:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: I think I've got my stance. - Sun Dec 13 17:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) spread her legs slightly to be shoulders' width apart, her eyes focusing on Hanai and analyzing his body. "No need to play dumb with me. Stop playing around."* - Sun Dec 13 17:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: ...... - Sun Dec 13 17:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: I'm not playing around, Kinami-san! - Sun Dec 13 17:36:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: Alrighty then. - Sun Dec 13 17:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) hobbles back a few inches.* - Sun Dec 13 17:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) quickly stepped back as well, gaining a little more distance.* - Sun Dec 13 17:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: Here. - Sun Dec 13 17:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: I don't think thats appropriate for her. - Sun Dec 13 17:40:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: I'm not holding back. - Sun Dec 13 17:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) sighed as she was slightly upset, she was tired of being played as if she had never used taijutsu in her life. Moving forward at full speed, she aimed to throw a punch directly at Hanai's nose to get a reaction out of him. If he wanted to take these little baby steps, then he could take some baby steps after getting punched back a few feet. <177>* - Sun Dec 13 17:42:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: You got anything to teach me? I've gotten a bit stronger since before. - Sun Dec 13 17:48:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Nice, I can't wait to have some of my own one day. - Sun Dec 13 17:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: Attacks are fast and she moves fairly fast. - Sun Dec 13 17:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt her attack suddenly being misdirected, however Kinami wasn't one to simply allow her opponent to get a wide open attack. Kinami's leg shot forward quickly to sturdy her body, and her upper body quickly shot back to avoid the attack that was coming her way. As she moved back, she threw a kick towards Hanai's head, the two seeming to go back and forth.<177>* - Sun Dec 13 17:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (reflex 15.32, so just barely registering and dodging if that's ok with you.) - Sun Dec 13 17:50:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Yes. - Sun Dec 13 17:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: What are you two waiting on? - Sun Dec 13 17:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: Kung Fu?  - Sun Dec 13 17:51:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Uhh. . I'm not 100 percent sure Mirai. - Sun Dec 13 17:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: I almost mistook it for Taekwondo. - Sun Dec 13 17:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: I don't know if there's any avoiding it. - Sun Dec 13 17:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: I'll probably have to use a technique. - Sun Dec 13 17:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: I can't just beat her by toying with her as I'd do normally. - Sun Dec 13 17:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) smirked a little bit as she looked at Hanai. "I see, you've recognized my fighting style eh?"  Kinami chuckled as she ducked down once again, shooting forward with all of her speed, her eyes looking directly at Hanai's body in case he tried to move outwards. Kinami's body would appear in front of Hanai once again, her arm pulled back preparing for a punch. <178>

However, Kinami wouldn't be done with just this, Kinami's body pulled back over to the side in another quick step of movement, her punch being thrown from the side. She wanted to test exactly how well he could react to something that wasn't directly in front of him, but she was sure he had the skills to track her movement anyway.<179>* - Sun Dec 13 17:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (speed?) - Sun Dec 13 17:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) whispers: (14.2) - Sun Dec 13 18:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Chikyu's nice.. - Sun Dec 13 18:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's eyes traced over as Hanai moved as well, her eyes focused intently on his movements. She was capable of reading them perfectly, however she wasn't so sure about his attack speed. Instead of her Kung Fu stance, she'd allow her tight and secured stance to become much looser and more carefree, her eyes looking directly into Hanai's eyes.<180>

With this, Kinami would move forward once again, her right hand suddenly being thrown forward. However, this attack was already missing, and the real attack was coming towards the bottom, aiming to hit him hard in the stomach. These attacks together proved to be quite difficult to dodge, simply because no one would really do this in a real battle due to being left completely open.<181>* - Sun Dec 13 18:02:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (no damage? qq) - Sun Dec 13 18:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) whispers: (you hurt me.) - Sun Dec 13 18:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) whispers: (just at least.) - Sun Dec 13 18:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) whispers: (i didn't get demolished) - Sun Dec 13 18:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (ahh, minor/medium?) - Sun Dec 13 18:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) whispers: (Med.) - Sun Dec 13 18:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (i see) - Sun Dec 13 18:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) leaned back a little bit, before shooting forward once again. Kinami's body moved so unorthadoxed that even the most trained of taijutsu users wouldn't be able to read it, thus was the perk of being a drunken fist user. No one could decifer her movements or predict what she would do, and that would be the best advantage that she had against anyone.<182>

When she got close, Kinami's body would suddenly jump forward in a blur, her arms tucking into her sides as her head aimed to burrow itself into Hanai. Seriously, who uses these kind of attacks in a spar, or in any fight at all? However, she couldn't shake the feeling that Hanai was simply holding back as much as he could, meaning that she was trying her hardest for nothing.<183>* - Sun Dec 13 18:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Oh. . It's still going?  Nice, I might learn something from this. . . - Sun Dec 13 18:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (as?) - Sun Dec 13 18:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) whispers: (19.4.) - Sun Dec 13 18:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) whispers: (Attacking a second time after the first time.) - Sun Dec 13 18:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's body seemed to act on its own, Kinami's arms shooting up to grab his arm quickly. She wrapped her hands around his arm and pulled herself closer to him, making the attack just narrowly miss. She could just barely see the attack without it blurring on her, and just barely pull herself enough to dodge the attack, but she was able to.<184>

This, of course, caused her attack to be off centered as she tried to dodge, her attack now heading directly towards his shoulder instead of directly into his chest. This caused the damage to be much less to him overall, and his shoulder would probably easily survive. As Kinami flew past him, she'd roll a little bit on the ground and then pop back up.<185>

"Hmm, that technique seemed nice. I guess we're getting a bit more serious now, huh?" As she said this, she spread her legs into her Kung Fu stance once more, allowing something in her head to click. It seemed that her muscles would tighten up majorly and were no longer restrained to the twenty percent that Hanai was.<186>* - Sun Dec 13 18:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (18 reflex for the dodge) - Sun Dec 13 18:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (18.32) - Sun Dec 13 18:22:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) whispers: (it's fine.) - Sun Dec 13 18:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) whispers: (not a serious fight) - Sun Dec 13 18:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Haha, I see. How many can you open? - Sun Dec 13 18:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: Uhm.... - Sun Dec 13 18:25:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) inhaled and exhaled lightly, allowing her gates and her kung fu stance to fall. She had gotten a thorough work-out, so she was satisfied. "I guess we're a little back and forth from being evenly matched."* - Sun Dec 13 18:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: A good match. - Sun Dec 13 18:28:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's eyes looked over at Hiro as he did his new little dance style. It was surely something interesting that he was doing, she had never really seen what this fighting style entitled, or what it was even mainly for, but she was kind excited about it anyway. Her eyes focused directly on Hiroshi as he continued to run forward, her eyes tracking his every movement.<187>

The sudden movement was something that she could easily track, and with that Kinami would smile lightly. She'd begin running towards Hiroshi quickly as well, aiming to meet him half-way. As she did, she aimed to duck underneath his kick and send a flying sweep directly at his other foot, knocking him off balance easily.<188>* - Sun Dec 13 20:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's eyes quickly looked at how he had recovered, that was quite nice of a fighting style if he could do such a thing without any hesitation, it was exactly what she was looking for. However, Kinami didn't have time to worry about any of that. The moment he threw his hands down on the ground, she knew that she was in trouble and had to dodge quickly.<189>

Quickly pushing her feet down to the ground, she'd kick off with all of her strength, propelling her body from underneath his and making him kick nothing but air. Kinami then did a small backroll as she got herself to her feet, spreading said feet until they were in the same space apart as her shoulders. Her eyes then looked onward at Hiroshi once again.<190>

"Nice, time to get a bit more serious." Kinami's body flew forward with great speed, focusing only upon him and nothing more. Every appendage that he had to attack with was focused upon, and she would not get ganked out of nowhere. Her fist was thrown forward quickly in an attempt to attack the boy, but her eyes were looking for a counter attack as well.<191>* - Sun Dec 13 20:18:30 2015
