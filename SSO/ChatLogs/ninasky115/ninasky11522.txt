<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) noticed the giant hammer of fire that appeared right in front of her. Kinami quickly moved to flip her body over, her feet connecting with the hammer to kick off of. With another burst of speed, Kinami aimed to suddenly disappear and reappear in front of Izanami, her body moving quickly and her attacks moving just as quickly.

With her quick speed, she aimed to send a quick spinning kick towards the side of Izanami's head to knock her out as well. Hopefully she moved quick enough to knock the female out without taking major fire damage. If she was even able to bypass the fire defense. However, if she did bypass it, she'd kick Izanami quickly and get her leg out of the fire so that she wasn't burned to death.* - Mon Nov 30 03:13:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) sighed as she stood up. Once again, she'd take her Kung Fu stance and then open her first game, her eyes looking over at the two who were charging forward. This was a useless fight since Izanami could just dodge her -and- use her fire shroud, but she was still going to put up a nice fight.* - Mon Nov 30 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) bent down slightly before quickly jumping towards the two. While moving through the air at her extreme speed, she aimed to go for not Izanami, but after Hiroshi. Her intent was to grab his leg and hold on, weighing them down. Her arm quickly reached up and grabbed his left arm, her eyes burning into Izanami's. "Go down and allow yourself to be captured, or his arms are being shattered." Her legs wrapped around Hiroshi's legs so that he couldn't use them to kick her, and her grip on his arms showed that she was extremely serious. It was clear that from the kick when she sprained his arms, this was completely believable.* - Mon Nov 30 03:56:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt her body beginning to fall towards the ground as Izanami released Hiroshi. Kinami wasn't stupid, and she knew that Izanami wouldn't just let go of a teammate that easily, especially if the consequence was nothing but a broken arm. Using her strength to guide Hiroshi, Kinami would mimic Hiroshi's movement and sit directly behind him, making it impossible for her to be struck by the lightning and thus making Hiroshi take the hit.

Afterwards, she'd land on the ground holding Hiroshi in her arms. Yet again she had her hostage. What would Izanami do now? Give herself up, or risk her teammate's wellbeing? She was curious to see what kind of kunoichi were on her side in this village.* - Mon Nov 30 04:06:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt her body being picked up from the ground by Izanami. Her eyes focusing on the giant worm that suddenly jumped up out of nowhere. Using her remaining strength to fight off the beasts, Kinami would suddenly burst into strength once again, throwing her fighting style out of the window since she wasn't focused on it. Using one leg, she'd kick off of Izanami and look at the wor as it attempted to smack into them.

Raising both of her arms up, she'd aim to grab the sandworm's enormous body simply around its skin. She couldn't wrap around its entire body, so she at least would attempt to grab onto something. From that, she aimed to literally swing the sandworm away from Izanami and onto the ground, allowing her two comrades to escape. Of course, there was a -high- probability that this wouldn't work and that she'd be the only one to get smacked down to the ground. And if that was the case, she'd easily accept that instead.* - Mon Nov 30 04:35:37 2015

However, she planned on kicking the worm with full strength directly in the side, kicking off of it as well as sending it flying back down to the ground. Of course it was 52 damage, so Kinami would assume that it'd die. Kinami would also be on the ground, suffering from the medium damage inflicted on her.* - Mon Nov 30 05:01:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) took a few steps back, and then looked up at Hiroshi. It was nothing but a simple kick it seemed, so it must not be that strong of a jutsu or anything. But still, it was something that was quite useful in one way or another. So, she smiled and decided that she'd learn this jutsu in the first try, hopefully. Crouching a slight bit to stretch her legs, she'd stand up and lean all of the way down to stretch her hamstrings.

"Alright, lets see what I can do." Taking another step back, Kinami would begin running forward at full speed, her body quickly jumping upwards and her leg being thrown out. The foot would aim to connect directly into Hiro's chest, the damage being highly constricted so that she wouldn't do anything but land on her and kick off of him.

Doing a backflip, she'd chuckle and land on the ground, taking a few staps after she had landed. It was pretty fun to learn this, since it was a pretty basic jutsu that had almost nothing more to it than running and kicking, with the basic balance and everything that all jutsu had. "Hah, I did it. See, you see!?"* - Tue Dec  1 02:16:06 2015
