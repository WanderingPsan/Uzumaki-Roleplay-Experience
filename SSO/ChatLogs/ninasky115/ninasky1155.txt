<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) wondered why Marrisa was starting off so strong when she should've known Nina wasn't ready for anything like that. As the kick came to her, she'd have no other choice but to take the barrage of kicks, using her arms to absorb most of the shock and the pain that was put into the kicks. As she was kicked horribly, Nina would just fall to the ground, her body in pain from the strength of said kicks.* - Sat Oct 17 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) placed both hands onto the ground below her, raising up her legs and kicking her up to her feet. Without hesitation, she'd lean forward a bit as if she were going to fall, which Marrisa was going to pick up on. But instead, she began running head first towards said girl, her arms thrown behind her as she ran. Focusing on Marrisa now, she'd grin a little bit, bringing her hands up to her chest.

Sliding to a small stop, she'd bring up her arms quickly before throwing two quick punches towards the girl, one towards her chest and the next towards her face. These punches would be placed well enough to rattle the girls movement for a small bit of time, and felt just a tad bit harder from where they hit, Nina picking her spots carefully with her punches and her boxing knowledge.* - Sat Oct 17 02:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) jumped back a bit. "Never mind. I don't want to spar anymore."* - Sat Oct 17 02:28:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Mizukage-sama, I have a favor to ask. - Sun Oct 18 00:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: There's one thing I need to advance my training, and sadly to ask. I need to learn as much about the Water and Fire Elements as possible, I'm willing to Donate nearly Two million to the village. - Sun Oct 18 00:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: If you're willing to help. - Sun Oct 18 00:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: . . . Hrm. . . - Sun Oct 18 00:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Well, I'm going to train this jutsu.~ - Sun Oct 18 00:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked down at the scroll, wondering what was up with it. Upon studying the scroll in question, she'd notice that it was a fire jutsu after all, one that seemed quite powerful even. Without any hesitation, she'd stand up after looking down at the jutsu, trying to see just how quickly she could master it. It seemed pretty difficult, but at the same time very helpful.

Without any remorse, she'd stand up to her feet, the scroll just underneath her as she looked onward, out into the water that was in the area. Bringing her hands together confidently, she'd perform the single seal, the Tiger seal, which would enable her to use the jutsu. Though, as she pursed her lips to try to blast out the fire, it blew up in her face, literally.* - Sun Oct 18 00:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) slowly began standing up from the explosion, her face aching just a tad bit as she rubbed it, some black soot coming off of her face as she did so. She'd groan before looking out into the water, her face focusing on one point in said water that seemed to be like a good hotspot, even though it was completely random in choosing.

With that, she'd bring her head back once again, her hands clapping together solidly to form the tiger seal. Moving her head now with pursed lips, she'd attempt to shoot forward a bit of fire, which actually worked, but it wasn't anything powerful yet. And it was mostly just soot and smoke, but she could tell she was getting the hang of it.* - Sun Oct 18 00:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) sighed once more as she stood up from her butt, her hands gripping one another as she clapped her hands together strongly. Her hands would quickly morph into that of the tiger seal, which would cause her chakra to begin churning and morphing into that of the fire element, which she apparently had an affinity to.

Without any hesitation, she'd push her head forward and allow her chakra to begin flowing from her lungs up into her mouth. From there, she'd simply have to keep her concentration so that she could keep the flow of chakra going and the fire to reach out into the distance. Though, she'd have to get the fire out of her mouth first.

As she exhaled, she pushed the fire chakra out of her lips, allowing them to quickly zoom out in the form of a powerful fire stream, shooting into the water and allowing some of the water to evaporate into steam and letting it rise up into the air. After that, she'd smile at her success, but feel the massive drain that she had felt.* - Sun Oct 18 01:18:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: That was one of those "I won't teach you for a while" talks. - Sun Oct 18 02:02:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Actually... do you want to test your jutsu? - Sun Oct 18 02:28:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Heya.~ - Sun Oct 18 16:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hello - Sun Oct 18 16:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: How are you? - Sun Oct 18 16:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm well thank you. Yourself? - Sun Oct 18 16:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I'm good.~ - Sun Oct 18 16:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Good. - Sun Oct 18 16:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: What're you doing? - Sun Oct 18 16:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nothing it seems. - Sun Oct 18 16:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Aww, that's no fun. - Sun Oct 18 16:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm a little bored in all honestly. - Sun Oct 18 16:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Well, lets do something!~ - Sun Oct 18 16:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Like? - Sun Oct 18 16:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Umm, I don't know... - Sun Oct 18 16:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, you're a shinobi are you not? - Sun Oct 18 16:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Mhm!~ - Sun Oct 18 16:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: How is your training going? - Sun Oct 18 16:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: It's going okay. I'm learning a lot of jutsu. - Sun Oct 18 16:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: A lot of jutsu hm. What do you specialise in? - Sun Oct 18 16:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I am a generalist.~ - Sun Oct 18 16:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see. - Sun Oct 18 16:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I am still lacking on fire jutsu and genjutsu, though. - Sun Oct 18 16:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Katon and genjutsu... - Sun Oct 18 16:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can help with those two if you wish. - Sun Oct 18 16:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Sure thing!~ - Sun Oct 18 16:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Follow me then. - Sun Oct 18 16:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Okay! - Sun Oct 18 16:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. Which first? Genjutsu or Katon. - Sun Oct 18 16:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Ummm, I'll take katon. - Sun Oct 18 16:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And if you have any other elements, I can probably help with those as well. - Sun Oct 18 16:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I know wind, but I'm pretty good at that so far. - Sun Oct 18 16:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Which katon jutsu do you know right now? - Sun Oct 18 16:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Fire Dragon Bullet. - Sun Oct 18 16:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And Wind is another of my specialties. - Sun Oct 18 16:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Just that? - Sun Oct 18 16:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Haha. I know some good ones, but nothing over C-rank. - Sun Oct 18 16:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: And mhm, just hat. - Sun Oct 18 16:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see. - Sun Oct 18 16:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'll teach you a few then - Sun Oct 18 16:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) nodded, and looked out into the waves. Pulling her hands up, she'd slowly form the one handseal that Lera had done, and focused her elemental chakra up through her lungs. As it exited her esophogus, she'd lean forward and try to release it, similar to Dragon Bullet, but much weaker. After moving back, she'd turn to Lera. "Like that?"* - Sun Oct 18 16:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yes, like that. Thats one down. - Sun Oct 18 16:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) nodded as she looked down at the flames. Turning her body around a bit, she'd perform the three handseals, her eyes focusing on said ground. Without any hesitation, her chakra would spike, allowing the fire to begin forming and circling around in one spot, her ears opening as she heard Lera. And then, she had gotten the idea.

Pulling her hands up, she'd clap them together solidly, a tornado quickly forming on top of the flames, causing them to shoot up rapidly, the small flames quickly turning into a tornado of fire and destruction. "Awesome!"* - Sun Oct 18 16:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Okay next. Tell me if you're getting tired. - Sun Oct 18 16:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked at all of the handseals as she blinked a bit. That was quite a bit of handseals, but she wasn't worried, not even a little bit. She was a prodigy in jutsu, after all, so why would she be worried? Clapping her hands together confidently, she'd begin flowing her hands through the five handseals without any hesitation.

Pulling her head back once again, she'd lean forward and allow the fire to begin shooting out into the area, the fireball quite large and extremely slow. It seemed like another jutsu that she could've used a wind jutsu to boost, perhaps like Great Breakthrough. That'd be wonderful.* - Sun Oct 18 17:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Okay. Theres three more I can teach you. - Sun Oct 18 17:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: They'll be harder to learn however as they're nothing like the other jutsu you've learned so far. - Sun Oct 18 17:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: How much stronger? - Sun Oct 18 17:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its not so much that they're stronger. Its simply that they work differently to the ones you've learned so far. - Sun Oct 18 17:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Ahh, I see. - Sun Oct 18 17:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We'll start with the most useful. - Sun Oct 18 17:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) studied the girl in her movements. It seemed that there weren't any handseals needed, it seemed like it was nothing but chakra control. It would make it a bit harder to learn, but she was confident in herself. Pulling her hand up, she'd allow her left palm to wrap around her right wrist, her chakra pulsing in her arm it seemed, and her face twisted in that of concentration.

Without even the slightest bit of hesitation, she'd let out a small yelp, sparks appearing around her arm as the fireball, the singular fireball, would've shot forward into the water before sizzling into the water, letting up just a bit of steam and shooting water up into the air. She panted a bit, nodded at how useful it was, then turned to Lera. "That's cool.~"* - Sun Oct 18 17:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right. - Sun Oct 18 17:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The next two work pretty well together, so I'll show you both. - Sun Oct 18 17:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) nodded as she looked at the woman once again. Bringing her hands up, she'd do a simple few handseals before jumping up into the air. After wards, she'd pull out a shuriken quickly. While falling down towards the ground, she'd reach behind her and quickly grab a single kunai. This next part was much easier, since she already had the wind flow technique.

The kunai would quickly shoot up into flames, throwing it forward without hesitation. The entire area would quickly light up into flames, spreading everywhere with the same amount of power.* - Sun Oct 18 17:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right, now just the Misty flames dance. - Sun Oct 18 17:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And you have every Katon jutsu I can teach. - Sun Oct 18 17:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: So you know Wind and Fire, no other elements? - Sun Oct 18 17:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Not even a little bit. - Sun Oct 18 17:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see. - Sun Oct 18 17:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Shame. - Sun Oct 18 17:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: It really is... - Sun Oct 18 17:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I'm going to try and get into the higher ranks soon though. - Sun Oct 18 17:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Heh...good luck... - Sun Oct 18 17:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I've been a genin for...hm...seven years now? - Sun Oct 18 17:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: What, B rank jutsu won't be that hard. - Sun Oct 18 17:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ah, you mean jutsu - Sun Oct 18 17:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Mhm.~ - Sun Oct 18 17:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well...I know a few B rank jutsu. - Sun Oct 18 17:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Hassan told me never to teach those to anyone.. - Sun Oct 18 17:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Well...one couldn't hurt surely. - Sun Oct 18 17:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Really? Are they any good? - Sun Oct 18 17:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'll let you be the judge. - Sun Oct 18 17:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) thinks: I hope it's a wind one! That's awesome!~ - Sun Oct 18 17:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) blinked as she saw the wind smash into the tree, completely ripping it to shreds. Smiling at how Lera had decided to go against permission and teach her anyway just showed that they were becoming pretty close, or the fact that she was just a good student who showed potential. Who could know, really.

Staring back at her hands, she'd notice that they were only three handseals. How could that be possible. She knew that it didn't matter on the type of jutsu that was used for the amount of handseals, but she just assumed that the higher the rank, the more handseals it'd be and the more powerful it would be as well.

Without hesitating and going straight into the jutsu, she'd sigh and attempt to perform this jutsu, it seemed to be an extremely difficult one. She'd sigh and do the three little handseals needed for said technique, her eyes focusing on the tree beside her. Pulling her head back now, she'd begin focusing and transforming her chakra into that of the wind element.

From the look of it, it seemed to be a great burst of wind, as well as sharp objects inside of it. With that, the only thought that she could have on how to perform this jutsu was a combination of the wind jutsu that she has. And so, she'd put this to the test now, and wonder how it would go.

Moving her head forward now, she'd shoot the focused stream of wind out in a ball, similar to how she had done the fireball jutsu, only it was with the wind element. As well as that, she'd have it shooting out with great speed, similar to Great Breakthrough. And yet another jutsu had to do with this, her wind bullets technique taking part as the sharp cutting objects.

As it shot forward, she'd look into the sphere, realizing that it looked exactly as Leras did. Though, it was so much weaker, it even -looked- much weaker. Though it was strong enough to the point where when it connected the tree, it'd have various little cuts around on its trunk, but not utterly destroying it.* - Sun Oct 18 17:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Huh, Seems you figured it out. Oh well. - Sun Oct 18 17:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Haha, thank you Lera. - Sun Oct 18 17:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You're welcome - Sun Oct 18 17:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: What do you want to do now? - Sun Oct 18 17:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I don't mind at all. - Sun Oct 18 17:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Piggy back ride!~ - Sun Oct 18 17:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ...Hm...I can do one better than that. - Sun Oct 18 17:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) blinked as she felt her body becoming light, her body raising into the air now. She'd giggle a little as she felt Lera's hands around her, keeping her from falling to the ground maybe. She'd spread her arms out, smiling as she were flying around.* - Sun Oct 18 17:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: What do you think? - Sun Oct 18 17:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: It's fun! - Sun Oct 18 17:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Good, I'm glad you like it - Sun Oct 18 17:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hey Lera. - Sun Oct 18 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: sYes? - Sun Oct 18 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Do you want to spar before we go over the genjutsu? - Sun Oct 18 18:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure I suppose. - Sun Oct 18 18:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) landed on the ground, looking over at Lera. "I don't usually start, but do you want me to?"* - Sun Oct 18 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Go ahead. - Sun Oct 18 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Umm, what are we focusing on? - Sun Oct 18 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Or is it just like, a fight like I would fight for my life? - Sun Oct 18 18:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Throw everything you have at me. - Sun Oct 18 18:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) nodded, and slowly walked forward for now. After a while, she'd suddenly run forward, her arms being thrown behind her as many of the shinobi ran. With that, she'd focus on Lera, her arms slowly being brought up to her chest. It seemed that she was a boxer in fighting style, and would fight Lera like that for a bit of time.

As she got close, if Lera hadn't suddenly moved like the others who moved at four hundred miles per hour, she would notice that Nina were throwing a simple punch, towards the side of her jaw. It seemed simple, but there was a lot of power packed behind it, enough to rattle the girls brain and jaw a bit.* - Sun Oct 18 18:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) was still running when she realized the mud was shooting towards her. Luckily it wasn't all that fast, but who knows what was coming from that. Quickly, Nina would do a small hop, pulling up her feet quickly before allowing chakra to flow into her feet, activating the suimen technique. She wasn't sure if she'd be able to run on top of the mud or not, but it was worth a try.

Knowing how well trained Lera was in ninjutsu, and realizing the use of said ninjutsu right off the bat, Nina knew that she'd have to get close to even attempt to land a hit. And so, her plan was to trap the girl, or at least halt her movements a bit. Clapping her hands together while running, a sudden tornado would flare up around Lera. It was weak, but enough to keep someone from easily running through it.* - Sun Oct 18 18:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) groaned a bit as she noticed the girl doing a bit of handseals and slamming it into the ground. It was true, Nina was quite skilled in the art of Fuuton techniques, even as a young girl. This was also due to the amount of teachers that she had as well. Though, she didn't have time to sit around thinking about this, she had to continue pushing Lera, keeping her on the defensive.

Nina never stopped running, however, as she reached back behind her and grabbed two kunai. It seemed that she didn't even need a second before throwing the kunai, which seemed a bit sharper on the edges than normal. It had wind chakra flown over them in just that one second that Nina had them in her hands.

As they zoomed towards Lera, it seemed that they were aiming to smack right into the center of her torso, which wasn't true, that was simply the largest place to aim at. They were also spread out enough so that if Lera moved one way or the other, she'd still hopefully get knicked in the shoulder, and rendered immobile. "Lets see you dodge that one!~"* - Sun Oct 18 18:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) slowly skid to a stop as she was approaching Lera, noticing that the girl had transformed her body into that of earth. It seemed quite durable, and the shuriken would've simply bounced off, if that hadn't been her plan in the first place. A dodge would've been better for the unexpectantness of the jutsu, but this would also do quite fine.

Without any hesitation at all, Nina would clap her hands together before the shuriken could connect with Lera's skin. The kunai would quickly begin running around in a circle around Lera, picking up massive speed behind it and allowing it to catch a bit more power, in addition to the wind chakra in front of it to hopefully pierce through the earth. Was this really her plan? She'd never seen the jutsu before, so it had to work, right?* - Sun Oct 18 18:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) watched as the wind enhanced kunai would shoot towards Lera, smacking into the new earth corridor that she had suddenly created. However, she already knew that she wouldn't be able to defeat the earth with her wind jutsu, she was planning this from the start as well. Nina was simply mixing jutsu together as if they were legos.

Smiling at herself, she'd pull her hands together, the Divine Wind still in effect since Lera hadn't disabled it this time. She didn't want to hurt Lera, but she wanted to show Lera exactly what she could do. Moving forward quickly, chakra would begin to morph inside of her lungs, and it seemed that it was quite powerful.

Moving her head forward without any hesitation, she'd purse her lips and allow the stream of fire to begin shooting out, the stream quickly enveloping and being boosted by the divine wind. The large tornado of fire would begin to pick up in heat, hopefully making it extremely hot in the dome and possibly even scorching the rock. In any case, Lera would probably feel like Aang when Ozai was shooting fire at his eath dome of protection.* - Sun Oct 18 18:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) frowned a little as she looked at Lera. "That's so unfair."* - Sun Oct 18 18:54:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) blinked at the giant thing, and looked back at her little weapon on her back. Pulling it out, she'd chuckle at the little wooden bokken. "Well, I have this thingy..."* - Sun Oct 18 19:04:44 2015
