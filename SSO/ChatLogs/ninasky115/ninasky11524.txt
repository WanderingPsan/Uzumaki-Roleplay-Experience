<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) kept her eyes trained on Geo Dude as he jumped over. His eyes studied over his fighting style, noticing that he was a boxer as well, just like most of the taijutsu users around the area. This would be a fun little match, she believed. She usually had fun sparring against Hiroshi, so if it was someone that beat Hiroshi? Someone that was on her level without downright demolishing her, this was something.

"Come at me whenever." She'd grin and get into her fighting style as well, her legs slightly spreading as she brought up her hands similar to that, or exactly like that of a boxer.* - Thu Dec  3 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) took a step forward when Geo Dude got closer. She was moving slowly as well, just to see if he would get slightly scared from her moving forward towards him. If he did do something, this would be an excellent way to see how his reflexes were. She was also ready to block or dodge an attack at any moment when she jumped forward, so she expected to see an attack out of him as well.* - Thu Dec  3 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: What the hell is this? - Thu Dec  3 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) blinked a little as she saw him jump to the side and stumble over. Looking over at Hiroshi, she'd give him the death stare of Thanatos, the god of death himself. "How did you lose to him? Tell me how much he's holding back right now." As she said this, she crossed her arms, her eyes burning into Hiroshi's soul as she stared at him with that look of anger and disappointment.* - Thu Dec  3 05:28:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) blinked at Geo as she saw the slow punch coming her way. Lifting her hand up swiftly, she'd grab Geo, or attempt to grab Geo's fist by wrapping his hand over his and stopping the power utterly. Looking down at him, she'd blink. "I don't like people to make fun of my power by holding back this much. Now get serious please." As she said this, she'd turn her body to the slide slightly and kick off towards Geo's stomach, more worried about pushing him back rather than inflicting damage.* - Thu Dec  3 05:33:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) thinks: A lot of people use taijutsu around here. - Thu Dec  3 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) smiled as she noticed him going much faster. "That's the spirit!" As she said this, she'd hop backwards lightly, her hand coming up quickly to protect herself. As the punch was thrown, Kinami would pull up her hand and attempt to redirect his attack, pushing it sideways and off to the side of Kinami. Hopefully this attack would land and move off his attack.

If this had worked, Kinami would quickly spin around and attempt to send another side kick towards Geo's stomach. During this spin, she'd continue to keep her eyes on Geo. He was striking quite fast, but Kinami was faster. The leg went directly towards the center of his belly and added force to kick off of him, pushing him back against the ground once again. "I love your weights. I need limb weights like that, much better idea."* - Thu Dec  3 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Count! - Thu Dec  3 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Everytime I go down count. - Thu Dec  3 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Uh o-okay? - Thu Dec  3 05:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) smiled as she saw him running forward at full speed, similar to how Kinami did to Paine. Those were quite good times. However, with this, Kinami would try something a little different, and wonder if it'd work. Lifting her leg up, she'd use the first half of the Leaf Whirlwind technique, throwing her leg up quickly to rival against Geo's dynamic entry, which she knew quite well.

With this, she planned to swing her leg up in a half-roadhouse kick, forcing Geo's body to spin instead of flying directly into her body. With that spin, Kinami would quickly throw her arm forward, attempting to hit Geo directily in the middle of his back and push him forward. If that didn't work, however, Kinami might find herself in a situation of being attacked by the young man, not knowing his full strength yet.* - Thu Dec  3 05:51:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) chuckled as she looked at Geo as well. He wasn't that stupid guy that she thought he was. Big brute who went taijutsu but couldn't even hold back in secret. That wasn't the case at all, Geo was actually somewhat skilled in taijutsu, and he still seemed to be holding back. He could take some damage as well, that was even better.

"Haha, I guess you've caught on huh?" As she said that, she'd look at Geo with a grin. It didn't seem like an actual fight anymore, more like a spar between rivals, or soon to be rivals even. Turning her body quickly towards Geo, Kinami would move quickly, possibly disappearing to some. She kicked off of the sand with a big puff of it popping up into the ground.

Aiming to move quickly, she'd spin through the air swiftly, her leg stretched out to kick Geo directly in the side of his head, possibly even sending him flying from the force this time. She was still holding back, but there was notibly more power in the attack this time. Kinami would then land and look at Geo, it was his turn to react and play on the defensive.* - Thu Dec  3 06:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Three? You know bro? - Thu Dec  3 06:08:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt her leg getting grabbed, and her body beginning to spin around in the air. Kinami would quickly bring her leg up to kick the boy again, her leg just barely missing him as she released her leg to throw her. Her body was estatic and filled with energy, her arms quickly bring thrown up as she arched her back, connecting them with the ground.

As they touched the ground, they would grip it lightly and Kinami would begin doing a bit of backflips to slow down her momentum from the throw, finally ending with three backflips in the air. After she landed those backflips, with a perfect dismount might she add, she'd kick forward once again. This time, she went for a different tactic.

Kinami was still spinning just the same, however this time, she went low with the attack. Her legs would begin to attack at Geo's lower ankle region. It was a sweep kick, but it wasn't designed to knock him off of his feet at all. Kinami was just spinning and spinning at insane speeds, her attacks becoming more and more powerful and even going higher. What was she doing?

As the attacks went higher and the spinning got quicker, Geo would notice that his body was beginning to lift off of the ground, the force of the attack finally adding up. Kinami and Geo would get lighter, or so it'd feel, as she continued to kick the boy upwards into the sky with more and more speed. Kinami was quite skilled in kicks as she was with punches.

After she had kicked him and they were high enough in the air, Kinami would smile, before quickly switching it up. Instead of ending the technique like she had with Hiroshi, Kinami would quickly rotate her body. Using the momentum that she already had as well as her strength, Kinami would push forward quickly towards his chin, aiming to push him up even more while throwing her body towards the ground. 

If they were watching, they could tell that Kinami wasn't even panting or sweating. She seemed like she was literally strolling in the park, however Geo could say the exact same thing.* - Thu Dec  3 06:14:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) watched as Geo had fallen to the ground. She wouldn't give him the satisfaction of defeating her. She kicked off the ground towards Geo once again, her body focusing on no one but Geo. This was quite the fun spar indeed. Pulling her arms up as well, her eyes noticed the attack that was coming towards her face.

She was moving at full speed, so it was too late to react, and she didn't know how hard it'd hit her. But she was a reckless fighter when it came to taijutsu, and she slipped into her fun sparring instead of her actual fighting mode. As the punch connected to her face, Kinami's hands would come up and attempt to hit Geo with the same amount of damage.

However, she wasn't done there. If that had worked, Kinami would do a slight hop and aim to kick Geo directly in the head once more, sending him flying towards the side of the mountain with the same amount of force as the punch beforehand. It seemed that she was getting a bit more serious with this spar. After all was done, Kinami would blink a little and smile. "Nope, your full damage isn't that painful.~"* - Thu Dec  3 06:38:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) blinked a little as she saw him opening up the first gate. It was quite wonderful to see that someone else had unlocked them. As he burst forward, her eyes would track him, deciding to see what he could do. From there, the punch would connect directly in the center of her chest, sending her back. Kinami would bounce on the ground a few times before popping up and coming to a skidding stop.

However, it seemed that she took no damage. "That one actually hurted, nice!" However, spreading her legs slightly as she stretched out her arms and allowed her fists to grip tightly. No rocks rose at all, however, as she wasn't into all of that flashiness when she was opening the gate. Her body seemed to explode into massive power, but it was completely invisible to anyone but herself. Or maybe someone with Byakugan, maybe.

With a smile, Kinami would burst forward even quicker, her face appearing in front of Geo. She aimed to return the punch to him, a straight jab going directly into his chest. However, she wasn't done there. Running after him with greater speed, she aimed to look at him as he flew from the force of it, her body seeming the same but her power being increased as well.

As he flew, Kinami would continue to dish out attacks, various elbows and knees in the stomach and back while she ran beside him. These attacks would continue to add up to take a toll on his body, before Kinami finally jumped up and roundhouse kicked him in the chin to add even more power to him flying away, possibly even hitting the wall if he couldn't stop himself.* - Thu Dec  3 06:57:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) chuckled a bit as she was praised by Geo. She allowed her gate to fall and threw a thumbs up at Geo. "If you want to be my rival, then I'll tell you now. I wasn't even hitting you as hard as I could!" She'd giggle to herself and grip her fists a bit. It was fun to spar him, next time he'd be even better. A worthy teammate and rival indeed.* - Thu Dec  3 07:15:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) dropped to the ground and looked at the ground, her arms pushed straight up and her body in a plank. "Begin!" As she yelled this, her body began to pump up and down as Kinami pulled her arms up and stretched them out, bending them into a perfect 90 degree angle before pushing them up to straighten her arms out, giving her one single perfect push up.

She'd continue to pump her arms quickly, looking up at the two to see what they would be doing. It wouldn't be a challange if they simply did the bare minimum. With a grin, Kinami would easilty finish five push ups before she took it a step forward. Pushing up hard, Kinami would pop off of the ground a few inches, before falling back down into the 90 degree bent arm.

After popping up, Kinami would drop back down every time, until she got to around ten push ups. After that ten, she would take it yet another step further, making sure that she exercised her arms thoroughly just incase something had come up that she wasn't going to expect. Her arms would have quite a nice bit of blood pumping through them when she did this.

She went down once again, this time with only one singular arm. One arm was behind her back and the other was pressing against the ground, her one arm pumping up and down with only her three fingers pressing against the ground. Kinami's arms were perfectly fine as she did this, her body was toned and used to this exercise.

Kinami switched arms like a pro in the middle of her pop up, as if she was used to it because she really was. She did this usually for quite a bit at a time. After she finally got her twenty push ups out of the way, Kinami would pop up all the way to her feet, and dust off her hands a little bit before looking at the two and how they were going.* - Thu Dec  3 08:14:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: What is this jumpsuit man talking about? - Thu Dec  3 09:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) spread her legs out a bit and pushed her arms out, her face showing stone-faced determination as she thought back to when she was sparring against Paine. Paine was a great target of strength to get to. It was a part of her determination, and so she didn't hold back at all. Bending her legs quickly, Kinami would go down until her legs did a 90 degree angle.

And then she popped back up. "One." As she said that, she'd begin to bend her legs once again, her body slowly going down into the perfect 90 degree angle once again in the back of her legs, almost as if she were literally sitting in a chair, and then she'd push herself back up from the squat. "Two." They were pretty easy at the moment.

Her weights on her back made this a bit more difficult, but she was used to the weights by now, so it wasn't all that bad. With a small chuckle, Kinami would bend her legs once again and reach lower towards the ground, seeing just how low she could get before standing up again. "Three." It was pretty fun to do this for training, and it helped her kickboxer all the more.

After a while she didn't really focus on doing the squats or the pain that was in her legs, she just went through the motion of the squat, her eyes burning a hole into the two who were silently moving through the squats as well. Kinami chuckled a little and looked down at her legs. "Four!" This was becoming pretty boring, and she'd rather have a bit of fun via a spar.

However, Kinami would continue to look up at Paine-Sensei. The way she was able to simply block and dodge all of her attacks no matter how fast she threw them. "Five!" It made her all the more determined to train. There was no wonder that she was so powerful, she must've been used to doing this sort of training as well.

And then there was also Grandpa. When he walked off into that dust tornado and spoke to her and Trilliam, she felt so much anger and regret for not being what he had expected. She was good, sure, but she could've been a hell of a lot better. That was another reason she wanted to get so strong, why she trained almost all day, why she sparred so much.

"Six!" She yelled this loudly and with determination, imagining that Grandpa was watching over her while she did her squats infront of her boyfriend and rival. It was a great feeling that even Kinami couldn't turn down, she'd take this over training anyday. It only made it better that she -was- training with these people, the only way that could get better is if her best friend Chikyu was there.

"Seven!" Her legs slowly began to crank through the motions through simple muscle memory. She had toned her legs and arms all throughout her life, she knew that she wanted to use taijutsu since the academy. And so, she would continue to progress through taijutsu and anything that has to do with hand to hand, she was amazing at it.

"Eight! Nine! Ten!" She got three of them out of the way quickly, her legs quickly pushing through the squats as her body adjusted to how her body was positioned. Her entire lower body was beginning to bulge out from the pressure that was being put on it. However, it wasn't a bad thing, it was completely used to this pressure.

Kinami would force her body harder and harder through these squats, wondering how she could make this any harder on herself while still being beneficial. Then, she thought of something. It was a wonderful idea that she could alternate through, but the bad part was she wouldn't be able to balance well and could very well hurt herself easily.

Moving her body still, her arms straight out before she swung them down, she'd chuckle and look at Hiroshi and Geo. She wondered if they had felt the pain in their legs and ws simply ignoring it, or if they were just not feeling anything at all. She knew she felt her muscles clenching everytime she did this to herself. It was very helpful though.

"Eleven!" Kinami groaned as her body dropped to the ground once again before being pulled up. The turtle shell on her back was beginning to take effect on her body and it wasn't anything easy. That meant it was even better for her training. Besides, no pain, no gain. And she needed to gain as much as she could before the chuunin exams.

Her body moved through the movements on their own still, giving Kinami time to think. "Twelve!" She wondered about Grandpa, was he really just retiring? Was he watching over them all as they moved through their work? What if he was just in the village in disguise, helping everyone do what they had to do to be a great ninja? He could do it...

That was rediculous, Grandpa wouldn't waste his time doing that. He said that he wasn't being a shinobi anymore and retired. Why would he lie about such a thing? No, he really did retire. There was no doubt about it. "Thirteen!" Kinami chuckled as she shook her head. He had faith in her still, even before she did this well.

This made her insides tickle a little, knowing that her grandpa had this much faith in her before she even did anything. Back when she only had one or two jutsu, he was the one that knew what Kinami would be capable of. So why not, right? Kinami's body pace began to raise once again, moving quicker and quicker through the squats. "Fourteen!"

Kinami's legs would begin to bulge even more as she moved through the movements, her legs pumping quickly and more powerfully than before. It seemed she really was determined to move right now. She smiled as she looked at Hiro and the work that he was putting into his movements. If he was putting that much movement in them anyway.

And then there was Geo, who was he? Was there really only one taijutsu profession in Kirigakure that had this much skill? And she had beaten him? She found it hard to swallow, she had faith in her but she couldn't have been that good to have beaten the only taijutsu profession in Kirigakure. Maybe he was just lying about what he said.

"Fifteen!" Kinami was overthinking things as she usually did. She had to stop doing this, especially while she was training. It wasn't a good habit of hers at all. As she went through the pumping, she'd feel the shell on her back seemingly shoot to the ground, her legs tensing up to keep her from falling. She bit her lip and chuckled, pushing her body back up.

"Sixteen." She said this one with less enthusiasm, because there wasn't much to be enthusiastic about. She did this often so why would she get excited and sound off every time that she did this? There was really no point in it other than keeping track of her number that she was on. However, she would still enforce the sounding off.

Her legs would bend perfectly once more into that 90 degree angle, leaving Kinami in a chair-sitting position. It was funny to watch others do this when they were in these later off numbers. Especially when their face started to twist and turn into that of pain, it was kind of funny to look at, but you could tell they were putting work into their legs to make them even stronger.

"Seventeen." Kinami chuckled once again as she looked at Hiroshi. She stared at him a little bit to see how well he was doing, and how fast he was going. If he slowed down even a little bit, he was getting a kick to the knee, for sure. Kinami only did this to him because he wanted more training to get stronger and protect her, which she found kind of cute.

She'd give him something to train if that was what he wanted, she would be sure to give him a lot to work on so that he would surpass them all. Kinami smiled widely as she looked down at the ground, blushing a little bit as she thought about him and how he talked to her. It made her all tingly sometimes, even when they were in public.

"Eighteen!" And then there was Geo here who was suddenly in the mix. He gave another flavor to the mix. He could be used to whip Hiroshi into shape as well, taunting him with Geo and how well Geo is doing. She smiled again as she thought about the rivalry, she could perfectly see it happening. It would be wonderful for the both of them to stay motivated.

However, when she thought about how far they might go to win her over, she thought it was a bad idea and getting worse by the minute. What if they broke their bodies or killed someone? It was really bad then, like -really- bad. That wouldn't be nice for anything at all. Hopefully Kinami would be there to keep them from destroying each other.

"Nineteen!" Kinami was extremely toned now, her muscles seemed like they would literally explode into chunks of meat if she had kept going. It seemed like a lot was going on through this small amount of squats, which showed how much she had to talk about. But they were getting done, perfectly even. It was wonderful.

Adrenaline had been pumping through her body and Kinami was playing no games at all. Her legs would drop down and her body weight would suddenly stop at a certain point using nothing but her leg strength, before she stretched it out to stand back up. "Twenty!" She only had ten more pumps left, and these were going to be done quickly and completely.

Her body shot down once more, the weights on her back making her body go down even further than it usually did when she did her squats. Kinami didn't mind though, it made it harder to do but they were still getting done. Her body was slowly starting to ache with the familiar pain of exercise. "Twenty-one!" She could keep this up for a while.

Kinami was used to this pain either way. Her legs were quite toned and her body was pumping hard when she went down and drew her body back up. Her stomach was tightly tucked in every time she went down and came back up. It didn't matter which number it was, Kinami was going to get a perfect squat each time. "Twenty-Two!"

Looking at Hiro once again, she'd throw a quick wink at him that he wouldn't have even caught unless he was paying attention. Her legs looked like something that would be found in a believe it or not magazine, it looked quite nasty with all of her muscles toned and buffed out. But compared to some other legs, they still seemed pretty beautiful. 

"Twenty-Three!" Her body seemed to slow down as she came to a stopping point in a while. It was clear that she wasn't going to give up at all in these RPs, but she was starting to slow down. "Twenty-Four!" Her body was starting to hurt more and more, this shell was really getting to her and it was starting to really suck. But she'd finish them.

"Twenty-Five!" This was all for Grandpa, all of this training was based on him. This was originally for him, and then other people were added in. He was the main starter of Kinami's wonderful work, and she would remember to pay great homage to her wonderful and amazing grandpa. It wasn't enough that he was just the Kazekage. 

"Twenty-Six!" He was also her grandfather, and one of the people who believed in her the most. Slowly but surely, Sanoke was integrated in that group of people. He helped her out plenty as well, It pained her to not be able to hit him yet, since his ninjutsu was just amazing. But he really did help her mould into what she is now.

"Twenty-Seven!" Sanoke and Grandpa was the one who moulded her the most. But there was also others as well. There was now Paine, she helped Kinami train and show what real Taijutsu could do, even without doing much. Paine was one of the best taijutsu users in the world, no doubt, and Kinami was lucky enough to be one of her students.

"Twenty-Eight!" On top of that, she now had Geo and Hiroshi to help her. Boyfriend and Rival, both of them helping her squat right here and right now. Her body aching because of them helping her stay motivated. Even though she was technically the master right now, she didn't think of it that way, because that wasn't the case.

"Twenty-Nine!" Her body dropped down once again as she thought about these people. They were the reason that she was strong, and they all showed a certain type of respect. Without respect, no one would be anybody to Kinami, no matter what they did or looked like. Her standing was set in stone the moment she was born into the Hassan family.

"Thirty!" As her body went down, Kinami would chuckle as her body shot up once again, her legs feeling broken because of the giant turtle shell on her back. That thing weighed a ton. She smiled and ran forward towards Hiro, not sweaty or anything like that. She'd wrap her arms around the boy and squeeze him. "You both move too fast when you're working out, making me feel slow and stuff."* - Thu Dec  3 09:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) spread her legs out a bit and pushed her arms out, her face showing stone-faced determination as she thought back to when she was sparring against Paine. Paine was a great target of strength to get to. It was a part of her determination, and so she didn't hold back at all. Bending her legs quickly, Kinami would go down until her legs did a 90 degree angle.

And then she popped back up. "One." As she said that, she'd begin to bend her legs once again, her body slowly going down into the perfect 90 degree angle once again in the back of her legs, almost as if she were literally sitting in a chair, and then she'd push herself back up from the squat. "Two." They were pretty easy at the moment.

Her weights on her back made this a bit more difficult, but she was used to the weights by now, so it wasn't all that bad. With a small chuckle, Kinami would bend her legs once again and reach lower towards the ground, seeing just how low she could get before standing up again. "Three." It was pretty fun to do this for training, and it helped her kickboxer all the more.

After a while she didn't really focus on doing the squats or the pain that was in her legs, she just went through the motion of the squat, her eyes burning a hole into the two who were silently moving through the squats as well. Kinami chuckled a little and looked down at her legs. "Four!" This was becoming pretty boring, and she'd rather have a bit of fun via a spar.

However, Kinami would continue to look up at Paine-Sensei. The way she was able to simply block and dodge all of her attacks no matter how fast she threw them. "Five!" It made her all the more determined to train. There was no wonder that she was so powerful, she must've been used to doing this sort of training as well.

And then there was also Grandpa. When he walked off into that dust tornado and spoke to her and Trilliam, she felt so much anger and regret for not being what he had expected. She was good, sure, but she could've been a hell of a lot better. That was another reason she wanted to get so strong, why she trained almost all day, why she sparred so much.

"Six!" She yelled this loudly and with determination, imagining that Grandpa was watching over her while she did her squats infront of her boyfriend and rival. It was a great feeling that even Kinami couldn't turn down, she'd take this over training anyday. It only made it better that she -was- training with these people, the only way that could get better is if her best friend Chikyu was there.

"Seven!" Her legs slowly began to crank through the motions through simple muscle memory. She had toned her legs and arms all throughout her life, she knew that she wanted to use taijutsu since the academy. And so, she would continue to progress through taijutsu and anything that has to do with hand to hand, she was amazing at it.

"Eight! Nine! Ten!" She got three of them out of the way quickly, her legs quickly pushing through the squats as her body adjusted to how her body was positioned. Her entire lower body was beginning to bulge out from the pressure that was being put on it. However, it wasn't a bad thing, it was completely used to this pressure.

Kinami would force her body harder and harder through these squats, wondering how she could make this any harder on herself while still being beneficial. Then, she thought of something. It was a wonderful idea that she could alternate through, but the bad part was she wouldn't be able to balance well and could very well hurt herself easily.

Moving her body still, her arms straight out before she swung them down, she'd chuckle and look at Hiroshi and Geo. She wondered if they had felt the pain in their legs and ws simply ignoring it, or if they were just not feeling anything at all. She knew she felt her muscles clenching everytime she did this to herself. It was very helpful though.

"Eleven!" Kinami groaned as her body dropped to the ground once again before being pulled up. The turtle shell on her back was beginning to take effect on her body and it wasn't anything easy. That meant it was even better for her training. Besides, no pain, no gain. And she needed to gain as much as she could before the chuunin exams.

Her body moved through the movements on their own still, giving Kinami time to think. "Twelve!" She wondered about Grandpa, was he really just retiring? Was he watching over them all as they moved through their work? What if he was just in the village in disguise, helping everyone do what they had to do to be a great ninja? He could do it...

That was rediculous, Grandpa wouldn't waste his time doing that. He said that he wasn't being a shinobi anymore and retired. Why would he lie about such a thing? No, he really did retire. There was no doubt about it. "Thirteen!" Kinami chuckled as she shook her head. He had faith in her still, even before she did this well.

This made her insides tickle a little, knowing that her grandpa had this much faith in her before she even did anything. Back when she only had one or two jutsu, he was the one that knew what Kinami would be capable of. So why not, right? Kinami's body pace began to raise once again, moving quicker and quicker through the squats. "Fourteen!"

Kinami's legs would begin to bulge even more as she moved through the movements, her legs pumping quickly and more powerfully than before. It seemed she really was determined to move right now. She smiled as she looked at Hiro and the work that he was putting into his movements. If he was putting that much movement in them anyway.

And then there was Geo, who was he? Was there really only one taijutsu profession in Kirigakure that had this much skill? And she had beaten him? She found it hard to swallow, she had faith in her but she couldn't have been that good to have beaten the only taijutsu profession in Kirigakure. Maybe he was just lying about what he said.

"Fifteen!" Kinami was overthinking things as she usually did. She had to stop doing this, especially while she was training. It wasn't a good habit of hers at all. As she went through the pumping, she'd feel the shell on her back seemingly shoot to the ground, her legs tensing up to keep her from falling. She bit her lip and chuckled, pushing her body back up.

"Sixteen." She said this one with less enthusiasm, because there wasn't much to be enthusiastic about. She did this often so why would she get excited and sound off every time that she did this? There was really no point in it other than keeping track of her number that she was on. However, she would still enforce the sounding off.

Her legs would bend perfectly once more into that 90 degree angle, leaving Kinami in a chair-sitting position. It was funny to watch others do this when they were in these later off numbers. Especially when their face started to twist and turn into that of pain, it was kind of funny to look at, but you could tell they were putting work into their legs to make them even stronger.

"Seventeen." Kinami chuckled once again as she looked at Hiroshi. She stared at him a little bit to see how well he was doing, and how fast he was going. If he slowed down even a little bit, he was getting a kick to the knee, for sure. Kinami only did this to him because he wanted more training to get stronger and protect her, which she found kind of cute.

She'd give him something to train if that was what he wanted, she would be sure to give him a lot to work on so that he would surpass them all. Kinami smiled widely as she looked down at the ground, blushing a little bit as she thought about him and how he talked to her. It made her all tingly sometimes, even when they were in public.

"Eighteen!" And then there was Geo here who was suddenly in the mix. He gave another flavor to the mix. He could be used to whip Hiroshi into shape as well, taunting him with Geo and how well Geo is doing. She smiled again as she thought about the rivalry, she could perfectly see it happening. It would be wonderful for the both of them to stay motivated.

However, when she thought about how far they might go to win her over, she thought it was a bad idea and getting worse by the minute. What if they broke their bodies or killed someone? It was really bad then, like -really- bad. That wouldn't be nice for anything at all. Hopefully Kinami would be there to keep them from destroying each other.

"Nineteen!" Kinami was extremely toned now, her muscles seemed like they would literally explode into chunks of meat if she had kept going. It seemed like a lot was going on through this small amount of squats, which showed how much she had to talk about. But they were getting done, perfectly even. It was wonderful.

Adrenaline had been pumping through her body and Kinami was playing no games at all. Her legs would drop down and her body weight would suddenly stop at a certain point using nothing but her leg strength, before she stretched it out to stand back up. "Twenty!" She only had ten more pumps left, and these were going to be done quickly and completely.

Her body shot down once more, the weights on her back making her body go down even further than it usually did when she did her squats. Kinami didn't mind though, it made it harder to do but they were still getting done. Her body was slowly starting to ache with the familiar pain of exercise. "Twenty-one!" She could keep this up for a while.

Kinami was used to this pain either way. Her legs were quite toned and her body was pumping hard when she went down and drew her body back up. Her stomach was tightly tucked in every time she went down and came back up. It didn't matter which number it was, Kinami was going to get a perfect squat each time. "Twenty-Two!"

Looking at Hiro once again, she'd throw a quick wink at him that he wouldn't have even caught unless he was paying attention. Her legs looked like something that would be found in a believe it or not magazine, it looked quite nasty with all of her muscles toned and buffed out. But compared to some other legs, they still seemed pretty beautiful. 

"Twenty-Three!" Her body seemed to slow down as she came to a stopping point in a while. It was clear that she wasn't going to give up at all in these RPs, but she was starting to slow down. "Twenty-Four!" Her body was starting to hurt more and more, this shell was really getting to her and it was starting to really suck. But she'd finish them.

"Twenty-Five!" This was all for Grandpa, all of this training was based on him. This was originally for him, and then other people were added in. He was the main starter of Kinami's wonderful work, and she would remember to pay great homage to her wonderful and amazing grandpa. It wasn't enough that he was just the Kazekage. 

"Twenty-Six!" He was also her grandfather, and one of the people who believed in her the most. Slowly but surely, Sanoke was integrated in that group of people. He helped her out plenty as well, It pained her to not be able to hit him yet, since his ninjutsu was just amazing. But he really did help her mould into what she is now.

"Twenty-Seven!" Sanoke and Grandpa was the one who moulded her the most. But there was also others as well. There was now Paine, she helped Kinami train and show what real Taijutsu could do, even without doing much. Paine was one of the best taijutsu users in the world, no doubt, and Kinami was lucky enough to be one of her students.
