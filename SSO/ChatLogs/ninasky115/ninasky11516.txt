<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami(Ninasky115) 's eyes couldn't even react fast enough to him moving, causing her to simply go off of instinct now. Raising her arm up quickly, she'd take the punch to the arm, before reacting quickly and turning her body, sending a quick punch with her other arm towards his nose quickly in an attempt to smack against it and push him back a bit.* - Wed Nov 18 04:21:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami(Ninasky115) noticed her attack missing its mark. In return, she saw a palm coming towards her just as quickly, causing her to move to the side as quickly as she possibly could. Though, she didn't only move to the side, she quickly dropped down and placed both of her hands on the ground, her leg kicking up into Sanoke's chin hard. Each kick would send the man lifing into the air more and more, the kicks holding a certain power to them that would rattle someone's brain if they would go on for much longer. After they were in the sky high enough, Nina would kick him hard in the chest with both feet, pushing herself to the ground and elevating him even more.

[insert strategem of wind here]

After hitting the ground, she'd look up at him and jump up, disappearing at almost impossible speeds. Nina would grin as she appeared behind Sanoke in the air, her body mirroring his exactly, and some would notice this technique if they ever used it or had it used against them. The signature Shadow of the Dancing Leaf! It was her playground now, she could do whatever she wanted to from there, and she intended to do just that, beginning to start her signature attack from then on. Without any hesitation, Kinami aimed to kick him hard in the side, expecting him to block it. If he had, she'd quickly go off, spinning to the other side of his body with her other leg.

When this second kick connected to the mans side, she'd use the kick to give herself a small boost, while also adding to their downward force to the ground. Kinami would rotate and send yet another kick to his body, aiming to kick him in the center of his chest, and yet another to the side of his arm. Finally, with all of the downward force coming from the kicking and the gravity all together, she would aim herself perfectly above Sanoke and thrust her foot down, her heel aiming to connect hard to his stomach the moment he hit the ground, adding a burst of damage from both his front and back while leaving a small crator in the ground where his back would've landed.* - Wed Nov 18 04:41:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) spread her legs apart slightly, letting her feet become shoulders length as she raised her arms.* - Fri Nov 20 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) looked over at the woman as she came quickly, aiming to punch her in the chest. Kinami would move quickly to swipe the fist away, using her arm to redirect the attack off and away from her. As she did this, Kinami would use her opposite free hand to thrust forward quickly, aiming to punch her directly in the nose. She'd keep it simple for now.* - Fri Nov 20 05:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) noticed the attack being blocked and pushed away from her nose, similar to how Kinami had just did. Without any hesitation, her eyes would quickly look down on the fist coming towards her and, moving as quickly as she could to step to the side and avoid the attack entirely. From there, she aimed to show Paine exactly what she could do in taijutsu, her body quickly moving to attack the girl after she had dodged the attack. Perhaps this would work, but perhaps it'd simply fail completely once again.

Moving forward quickly, Kinami would move forward and do a small handstand just in front of Paine. She'd bend her arms lightly before pushing up with full force, aiming to kick Paine hard in the chin as hard as she possibly could. If the first kick connected, Kinami would continue to kick upwards, aiming to lift her more and more into the air with each individual kick, this simply being a way to lift her up into the air more and more. After a few kicks, she'd give one more powerful kick to the girl, sending Kinami down towards the ground and leaving Paine suspended in the air momentarily.* - Fri Nov 20 06:14:36 2015
