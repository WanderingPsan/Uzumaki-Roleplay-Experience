<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Just put up a Tiger! seal and just control your chakra. - Wed Dec  2 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) nodded at Hiroshi's explination of the technique. It seemed pretty basic and pretty useful in an overall standpoint. And so, Kinami would bring her hands up and place them together slowly in the tiger handseal. It was so long since she actually had to remember a handseal without it being etched into her brain like Bunshin or Kawarimi. She hadn't really thought about the tiger seal in a minute.

She was able to remember the handseal however, and now came the chakra part, the part that she didn't really care for. She had basic genin chakra control, but she usually wasn't really planning on using it for anything at all. Closing her eyes to focus her chakra into the tiger handseal, she'd wait for something to happen. When she felt the chakra beginning to take effect, Kinami would shoot forward.

Kinami burst out of nowhere a bit of ways away from Hiroshi, her eyes taking a while to adjust to her new surroundings. Her brain wasn't really used to the sudden burst of movement, so the change in the environment kind of took her back a bit. "Oh man..." Kinami chuckled a little and took a seat in the sand below her, looking up at Hiroshi. "That's a nice jutsu there."* - Wed Dec  2 06:17:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: 16.4_ - Wed Dec  2 08:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) quickly took off as well, meeting Hiroshi half way instead of giving him the pleasure of making it all of the way to her quickly. With a smile, Kinami would bring her leg up quickly, aiming to kick towards Hiroshi's head as well. She wouldn't back down, quickly spinning with the attack and sending a quick kick towards his head. The speed was only slightly backed down so that he could focus on and dodge the attack. This was, however, if he was able to pull back from his own kick to complete the attack.

Whether he had pulled back or not, Kinami would continue on with her attack. He was only slightly faster than her, but she had enough time to get her leg up after all. Considering her defense and power, she assumed that she would push Hiroshi's leg back either way without taking any damage. This attack wouldn't really hurt Hiroshi either, simply press his legs back. And then, Kinami would drop down and aim to sweep Hiroshi's leg as well. They'd probably clash once again, but the only difference was that Kinami would continue spinning afterwards.* - Wed Dec  2 08:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Great fighters. - Wed Dec  2 08:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Woot! Kick her butt Blue! - Wed Dec  2 08:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt her kick connect, a smirk forming on her face quickly. Kinami would continue to push on with the spin, pushing her body slightly as she escalated the D-rank jutsu to that of a C-rank jutsu. Her body continued to spin, and it seemed to even get more and more speed with said spin. Kinami's foot would slowly begin to lift Hiro up from the ground, doing more and more damage to him as well. As Hiro went up, she followed after him, still spinning.

Hiro would find that kicks were going higher on his body as well, hitting him quickly in the stomach a few times and even in the chest a few times as they raised into the air. Her body seemed to move effortlessly and flowed perfectly. It was amazing how much of a taijutsu fighter that she was, she focused on nothing but taijutsu everyday, and that's where she had the advantage.

When she was as high in the air as she ever aimed to be, she'd rotate powerfully and kick him in the shoulder, pushing off of his body and moving towards the ground to look up at his suspended body. Kinami could only piece together moves and combos so quick, but she was piecing this one together quickly for her first time doing it. Hiro was at her mercy in the air, and she would take full advantage of it. She was on the ground for now, but next turn she would be moving.* - Wed Dec  2 08:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) sighed slightly as she bent her knees slightly and leaned forward. Jumping with full power, she'd shoot up into the air, disappearing suddenly. If they looked around for her, they'd notice that she was behind Hiroshi, perfectly in his shadow. He'd know the jutsu well, in fact. Or maybe Momura would know this jutsu well. One of them knew this jutsu and tried to use it on her, that's all that she knew. And she wasn't going for it, not one bit!

"Hey Hiro, time for my secret technique.~" As she said this, she'd throw the kick to Hiroshi's left side, aiming to get him to turn that way. And from there, she'd kick off of his body and rotate her own body, her leg leading the way to hit him hard in the right side as well. With this, Kinami would use her strength to pull her body up lightly, using another foot to kick him in the right side once again. The people around would also notice that they were falling to the ground pretty quickly now.

With this, Kinami was well above Hiroshi's body, her body still spinning quickly. As they neared the ground, Kinami would stretch out her foot once more, her heel dropping right on top of Hiroshi's stomach. Luckily he had the shell on his back so he didn't feel the kick connecting with the ground, he was spared of a bit of damage. But he finally felt the move that she yelled out the moment she landed the kick in his stomach. "Nami Barrage!" After landing this, she'd kick her body backwards, doing a small backflip to land a bit of ways away from him.* - Wed Dec  2 09:08:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) hit the backflip most likely, skidding against the ground until she came to a stop. Nodding lightly, she'd look over towards Trill and Sanoke. "Hey guys, could we get some ninjutsu or something to dodge while we spar?"* - Wed Dec  2 09:18:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) heard the name of the technique, which caused Kinami's eyes to burst open. A ninjutsu hitting her from Sanoke would probably break her in half. And so, she moved quickly, shedding her shell quickly. And then, she'd break forward quickly, her eyes splitting focus between both Hiroshi and the bullets that were firing towards her. When she arrived at Hiroshi, Kinami would leap forward slightly, closing the smaller gap even quicker. "Dynamic Entry!" Her foot aimed to plant itself into his chest, her body twisting and contorting to dodge the bullets whenever she had to.* - Wed Dec  2 09:23:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's foot quickly clashed with Hiroshi's. They were closely matched, but Hiroshi was only slightly stronger, much so that you probably couldn't tell just from their clash itself. Kicking her body off of his foot, Kinami would do another simple flip in the air, her body landing just in front of the shell that was behind her. From there, Kinami would smirk slightly, before shooting forward once again, her body low and poised to dodge at any moment. 

Once she got close to Hiroshi, Kinami would pull a fist up to throw it forward towards his nose. She expected him to dodge this, of course, but it still was going towards his nose. Another attack would come towards his lower body, going directly forward towards his left ribcage. This strong hook followed some power behind it as well. By now, Kinami's body was still for long enough, and she was sure that something was coming her way.

Whether Hiro had dodged the attacks or not, Kinami would jump backwards, her body spinning as she dodged some of the attacks. Her back arched hard as she saw a bullet flying over her chest, her leg lifting up to allow a bullet to fly past her as well. Her eyes once again cut over to Sanoke, deciding to tease him just a bit. "You'll have to do a bit more than that. We're used to dodging ninjutsu while pushing on with the taijutsu fight!"

At that moment, it seemed that three more clones were suddenly put into the mix. Kinami grinned slightly, and turned back towards Hiroshi. "Welp, I guess he stepped up to the plate, huh?" After saying that, Kinami would quickly take up her Kung Fu stance, her body never staying still now as she dodged all of the bullets that were coming her way. Her body turned and twisted, spinning and ducking down. It was like she was being tazed or something, only instead of her muscles locking up it made her limbs go crazy.* - Wed Dec  2 09:36:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (you also don't -have- to take hits, just to let you know) - Wed Dec  2 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (if you feel like blocking them or redirecting them, its fine too) - Wed Dec  2 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) whispers: Yea its cool Hiro needs to toughen up XD) - Wed Dec  2 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (oh, alright xD) - Wed Dec  2 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) quickly moved back, her body still moving to dodge these attacks from the bullets. It was pretty fun, she had to admit. And she was still getting some work and training done. As Hiroshi came forward and the bullets roared past them both, she grinned. The training was getting quite serious, so Kinami would follow suit. Her face quickly stoned up as she began focusing extremely hard, nothing was said by her, her face would just show that Hassan determination, mhm.

Her body seemed to move by itself, her arms being thrown in front of her as she took a step forward. Her eyes watched over Hiroshi's movements intently, making sure to keep what he did close to her memory and knowing how to react to it. As he charged and threw a left hook towards Kinami, she would quickly jump back, her eyes still studying his movements. She noticed the attack coming towards her stomach now.

Moving her hand down, she aimed on grabbing the knee to stop its momentum quickly. After stopping it, Kinami would look up at his eyes before pushing him back, her feet pushing her back as well as a large baseball sized bullet flew between the two. After Kinami had dodged it, she would move forward once again, her eyes still zooming everywhere at once. Leaping up slightly to let a ball fly under her feet, she'd look Hiroshi right in his eyes.

She knew that he would have to stand up from the ground to fight back. And knowing him, he wouldn't want to seem weaker than his girlfriend in front of Hiroshi and Sanoke. So, she quickly threw a kick towards where his head would be going. However, Kinami didn't expect it to be that easily. As the clones moved quickly, she had to quickly react once again, canceling her attack completely to avoid getting obliterated.

Placing her foot on Hiroshi's shoulder, assuming he had gotten up even slightly, Kinami would throw her body off of his by kicking off with all of her strength. He would most likely go back down into the sand, giving hi more time to react overall to the bullets. Kinami was in the air, her body twisting and turning as she dodged the bullets, her feet landing onto the ground. There was no skid or anything this time, her feet was continuously moving. Luckily she had a lot of stamina to do all of this moving.* - Wed Dec  2 09:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hey Sanoke, Akira told me he gave the key to his house to you. Is that correct? - Wed Dec  2 10:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Mhm. - Wed Dec  2 10:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Akira told me, he gave it to you to give it to me. I really like to have it. - Wed Dec  2 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . Hrm. .  - Wed Dec  2 10:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) kept her body moving as she spun and rotated around. Looking over at Hiroshi as he spoke, she began to talk. "I got the idea from Sensei, only this time it's way more dangerous and I have an even sparring partner." Cutting her sentence, she'd quickly move over towards him as her arms were pulled up. "Besides, it means you'll have to think less and react more. Less time wasted on overthinking things!"

Right then, the attacks started. Kinami jumped up slightly to send a quick spinning kick towards Hiroshi. She watched as he lowered his arms to block the attack, but instead of just letting it stop, he used the momentum to spin his body quickly and lift up one of his legs. With said leg and the spin, Hiroshi would throw a powerful kick, which Kinami would lift her arm up to block. At that moment, they'd seperate only about a foot, before jumping back into the attack.

Kinami quickly brought up an attack, another kick towards his head. He lifted his arm to block it, and instead send a quick swipe at Kinami's leg that was on the ground. This caught her off guard and made her lose her footing, however she quickly caught herself and put both hands on the ground, using her strength to push herself up and keep her up. Her body quickly began spinning on her hands, similar to a spinning top.

Hiroshi wouldn't have noticed this one for sure, and took a quick yet harmless kick towards his shoulder. He grinned as she did, and she quickly jumped up to send a kick towards his head. At that same moment, Hiroshi seemed to slide down to kick the girl in her head, since she was upside down it'd make sense that he went with the slide. They missed each other just barely, it seems.

After realizing what happened, they quickly turned around and ran towards each other once again, their body rotating and moving unorthadoxed as they just reacted to their surroundings. Their attacks were becoming more and more in sync, punches and kicks clashing, ducking under attacks and jumping over leg sweeps. They were perfectly trained with each other at this moment, and there was suddenly a pause of what seemed like time as both of their fists connected with each other. Kinami giggled as she jumped back powerfully, her body seeming to rest a bit. But, she wasn't even breathing hard.* - Wed Dec  2 10:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) whispers: I'll let u decide how to end it, my eyes is gettin heavy lol) - Wed Dec  2 10:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) thinks: Holly crap. How long can one guy use this jutsu?! - Wed Dec  2 10:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Shit. . This is bad. . .  - Wed Dec  2 10:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) slid back after the encounter, chuckling as she heard Sanoke speaking. Moving quickly, she'd grip Hiroshi's shirt tightly before jumping straight up into the air. She was high enough to get out of the way of the bullets, and quickly threw Hiroshi towards the softer part of the sand lightly. It wouldn't hurt him at all, it was simply to get him out of the firing range called the battlefield. Kinami wasn't tired at all, however, so she would stay in and see how well she fared against someone of Sanoke's calibre.

Moving forward towards one of the clones, she'd grin lightly. Now they could simply focus fire on her instead of shooting it in a wide arc, which made it even harder for her to react to all of it. As she moved towards the clone, Kinami would continue to move around, the bullets simply flying past her, a few of them coming close to scraping her and leaving her with a nasty bruise. If she were able to get close to the clone, she'd tilt her body to the side of the clone instead of directly in front of it, throwing a quick kick towards the side of its head.* - Wed Dec  2 10:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt the clone disperse at her feet, chuckling as she looked back at Sanoke. "Oh please, I'm still holding back. I'll show you what the absolute -minimum- that you can expect at the exams is!" And with that, she'd suddenly burst into a powerful stance, her gate quickly opening out of nowhere. It was forbidden to use such a technique, but of course the first gate wasa harmless, and almost anyone could open that.

Turning her head over towards the other two clones, she'd suddenly move at breakneck speed, disappearing completely as she moved. Of course, most of the people at the arena could probably track her pretty easily, she had no idea what they could do in all honesty. But Kinami was sure of herself, and wasn't holding back even a little bit. As she neared another clone, Kinami would attempt to send a powerful kick at the clone's neck.

If it had dispersed, which she was almost positive that it would, her eyes would lock on to the next clone as she zoomed around the arena. She assumed that the clone would be smart enough to stop firing the bullets and get into a taijutsu stance, but maybe not. Perhaps it would simply say forget it and continue to rain down bullets on Kinami. Right now she was perfectly fine with dodging, but who knows what would happen with only one clone on the field?* - Wed Dec  2 10:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt the sudden gust of wind that appeared out of nowhere. Kinami was almost resistant enough to push past it. But alas, she was blown back against the ground, quickly recovering as she skid back on her feet. The girl would allow her stance and gate to fall into nothingness, her arms crossed as she looked over at Sanoke with a grin. "Don't worry, there's much more to see. -Much- more. Maybe you'll even see a forbidden jutsu thrown out there.~"* - Wed Dec  2 11:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Haha. Trust me, if I am lucky enough to unlock my next gate by the time the exams are here. - Wed Dec  2 11:08:09 2015
