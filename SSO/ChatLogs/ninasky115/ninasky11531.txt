<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's eyes followed after Chikyu, the girls attack speed being somewhat quick, but Kinami was much faster. As the blade came swiping across to her, Kinami would raise her arm quickly. Pressing out her hand, she'd wrap her hands around the edges of the blade tightly, causing it to stop in place. There was a large amount of wind that followed the sudden stop.<119>

With a smile, Kinami would yank the blade back, aiming to pull it away from Chikyu. If Chikyu continued to hold on, Kinami would just pull the girl towards her, chuckling as she kissed the girl right on the lips to fluster her even more.<120>* - Sat Dec 12 07:47:08 2015

Her arms shot out towards Chikyu's wrists quickly with both hands, making sure to immobilize each arm. "Hey, best friend, are you upset?"* - Sat Dec 12 08:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) looked at Chikyu as she jumped up, shooting both of her legs forward to connect against her chest. She sighed as the kick connected and all momentum suddenly stopped. "This is payback for you not letting me in any sleepovers over the past five years." She'd wink at her best friend and chuckle again, clearly not taking any of this seriously.<121>* - Sat Dec 12 08:14:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's eyes continued to focus on Hiroshi, but she was actually splitting her attention between the two of them. Moving forward quickly towards Hiroshi, she'd get much closer to his body, making the kick pretty much null and void since she'd most likely get hit by his thigh or so, while all of the power would've been mostly at his foot that he threw out.<123>

After doing that, Kinami would bring her hands up and push it forward, a foot behind Hiroshi's foot to push him down on his back. As she did that, she'd spin around to see Otorius throwing an attack forward as well. Moving quickly, she'd drop down to one knee and bring her arms up once again, aiming to swing the girls arm once again to redirect Oto's attack. <124>

"You have to attack quicker." As she said that, she'd notice that he were still moving with the attack, his body pivoting with the attack even though it was redirected. This made her smile a little bit, her body quickly turning to follow him. Her reflexes were top notch compared to his attack speed, and so Kinami quickly threw a soft punch towards his stomach.<125>* - Sat Dec 12 14:48:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's body was suddenly kicked as she felt her hand connect with Otorius. Luckily he had staggered a bit from the attack, otherwise she'd be a sitting duck. She had already dropped to one knee to get more personal with Otorius on a fighting level, and so when the kick came she wouldn't exactly fall on her butt, she'd just be kicked in the back of her leg.<126>

Turning her eyes towards Hiroshi, Kinami would quickly jump up and pull her arm back, thrusting it forward quickly towards Hiroshi's chest with her powerful strength. She held back slightly as to not completely destroy his body, but it was still quite powerful, and aimed to throw him back several feet just from the impact of the techniue.<127>

Whether this worked or not, Kinami would quickly jump back to gain a bit of distance from the two, her eyes looking at both Otorius and Hiroshi, whether he was thrown back or not. This made it possible to see their attack coming much better, and this also let her react much more compared to their attacks.<128>* - Sat Dec 12 15:15:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) nodded at Mizora, and decided to stick to her own Kung Fu stance for now. Dashing forward quickly, she'd eye Mizora with a smile, wondering if she had gotten any better in fighting as well. Kinami closed the distance quickly, making sure to get as close as she could to Mizora since they both were taijutsu users.<129>

"Ha!" As she said this, she'd throw a quick attack directly towards Mizora's chin, aiming to kick her hard and send her bobbing to the right a little bit, just to give the girl a taste of her own strength. She wondered how the girl would react to such a thing.<140>* - Sat Dec 12 15:45:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) watched as Mizora had completely dodged her attack, which was expected from such an amazing and highly ranked ninja. However, Kinami wasn't a push-over at all. As she noticed the handseals, her eyes widdened slightly as she knew what meant, ninjutsu, her only weakness! The moment Mizora jumped back, Kinami would as well.<131>

As she saw the lightning beginning to shoot outwards, Kinami would quickly begin to move outwards. Kinami was fast, but the tendrils were even faster, causing her to be at a major disadvantage. She cursed under her breath, but continued to run in a large circle. It seemed that she would have to bust out the 1st gate after all. However, for now she had the gap of space between the lightning so she had a second or so to think about it.<132>* - Sat Dec 12 15:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: (22 intelligence for predicting shit) - Sat Dec 12 16:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's eyes had looked over at the shuriken drawn, the lightning most likely no longer following her. However, she wasn't really worried about the shuriken that were thrown since they really didn't do that much damage, as proven with Geo as he completely tanked them. Kinami did make up her mind at this point though, it was time to take it up a notch.<133>

Out of nowhere, it would seem that one of the gates opened within her, the first one in fact, as she seemed to 'buff' up slightly. It wasn't really visible since she wasn't really buffing up, she was only using one hundred percent of her muscles instead of the normal twenty percent that everyone else had used. And from there, she'd quickly divert herself towards Mizora instead of that big circle.<134>

Regardless of the explosion that had happened, Kinami would run towards Mizora in a straight bee line, her eyes focused on nothing but the woman in case she moved. She was moving at full speed towards the woman, and it seemed that nothing could slow her down except an attack or two, and this is what she had hoped they would think.<135>

As she got close, Kinami would pull her arm up quickly, looking as though she was going to attack. However this wasn't the case, and she threw the punch much further back than it needed to be to attack the girl. This was simply to draw her attention and get her to flinch. The real attack came afterwards, which was a straight upper kick to the bottom of her chin, used to kick her upwards into the air.<136>* - Sat Dec 12 16:13:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) couldn't really see anything in the large smoke cloud at all, however, this didn't really bother her much. This fight was exciting all on its own, and showed her that she still had to improve. It was something extremely fun to her. The moment she felt something touch her back, Kinami's eyes would shift to the side, she knew that the girl had moved.<137>

Pulling her hands up quickly, she'd close them into fists, her eyes locking on to be straight in front of her where the girl previously touched her. She didn't know how far away the girl was, but this aimed to smack into her no matter the distance that they were, and this would most likely be a shock to Mizora since this was the first time it'd ever been used against her.<138>

Without a word, the girl threw one of her fists forward, the quick attack pressing through the air as the pressurized air shot forward. This aimed to both clear some of the dust in the air as well as smack into Mizora without any hesitation at all, aiming to push her back on her ass. She didn't know how tough the girl was, so she pulled the attack back a bit.<139>* - Sat Dec 12 16:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) thinks: Will she run to avoid it again? No, it's range is too great...hm.. - Sat Dec 12 16:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) heard the woman say that it was her turn, meaning.....she didn't get hit by it? It seemed that she had clearly gotten hit by it, but of course she didn't have the punch to add on to the damage, that had to be it. She hadn't met anyone who could take her attacks so easily, and she had only gotten stronger in her life. Without any hesitation, she would look onward with a grin.<141>

With her other fist that she had prepared, she would quickly shoot it forward. This, of course, had more power than the wind spheres in front of her, at least one of them, so she was able to completely take out one from her pressurized punch, and the one closest to it or behind it would take a bit of a beating as well, lowering the damage.<142>

After that, Kinami would rush forward, aiming to run where the punch had gone. It would've been nullified by the second sphere that it hit, but hopefully it was enough to leave her a bit of an opening. If not, she'd be hit by a sphere or two, causing her to pull her arms up to take the attack. As they connected with her, however, she'd feel no real damage from it.<143>

Kinami grinned lightly, and began to run forward once more, aiming to keep Mizora on her toes and stop her from getting anymore chakra for the duration of the spar. She had used the chakra that she had needed, so there was hopefully no more of that. When she got forward, she'd leap off of the ground with her foot forward, ready to quickly spin around and shoot in another direction assuming Mizora had dodged.<144>* - Sat Dec 12 16:41:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's eyes looked around as she saw all of the sudden Mizora's in her area. "Hmm...." As she thought of this, she'd move back a bit, her eyes looking over at the kunai that was moving her way. Kinami wasn't in the mood for another explosive tag, so Kinami threw a shuriken of her own, the shuriken ad its own explosive tag so, even if the shuriken missed, Kinami would detonate the tag to send the shuriken flying off elsewhere.<145>

After causing the shuriken to fly away, Kinami would shoot forward towards the others, her arms blurring with speed as she aimed to quickly dispatch them. They were striking just as fast as she could see them, but Kinami had major speed with her attacks and speed to dodge the attacks as well. Her eyes continued looking around to see more and ore clones.<!46>

Without that, her eyes would move around anyway to make sure that she wasn't quick attacked. Kinami's body moved in blurs as she wiped out the clones one by one, unless they could dodge her attack speed of 23.4, which she hopefully assumed they couldn't. If they could, however, she'd be here for a while fighting these clones. <147>* - Sat Dec 12 17:03:31 2015

However, Kinami wasn't a grudge holder against this fact, her eyes simply focusing on the clones.<148>

Out of nowhere, she saw Mizora coming down out of nowhere, the foot quickly landing against her shoulder. Kinami's body went down very slightly, but she barely felt anything. And from there, Kinami decided to move quickly before she or her clones could really capitalize on her. Raising her fist up, she aimed to uppercut the girls leg with the same amount of strength the girl had kicked with.<149>* - Sat Dec 12 17:30:49 2015
