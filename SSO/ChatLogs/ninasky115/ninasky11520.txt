<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) was suddenly kicked into the air, her body being suspended in the air. Her eyes snapped open quickly as she knew what was coming next. Spinning her body by throwing her arm towards the right, she'd quickly turn her body around. She was quite familiar with Shadow of the Dancing Leaf, even since the academy times.

After spinning around, Kinami aimed to send a kick directly towards Momura's stomach with quite a bit of power. She didn't know what move was coming, so she took the stabby-poke to the center of her chest. If the kick did land on the girl, it was meant to send her speeding towards the ground to hit it hard, as well as leave her in a crator.* - Sat Nov 28 04:16:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) suddenly lurched up as if she were possessed, her back arching as she shot upwards quickly. Her face was red as if she were blushing. "You hit too hard, that's mean." She'd hiccup and turn her head towards Chikyu.* - Sat Nov 28 04:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) suddenly lurched back into a backbend as the nudge was about to hit her. "Hm?"  From there, Kinami would begin backflipping towards the bigger group of people, her body suddenly colliding out of nowhere with Chikyu.* - Sat Nov 28 05:05:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Your choice. - Sat Nov 28 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) nodded, and slid her turtle-style weight off of her back. Rolling her shoulders a bit, she'd take up her fighting stance before quickly moving forward towards Hiroshi. She had never really sparred him, so this was going to be something fun and interesting. Without any hesitation, Kinami would move on sheer instinct.

When she was near Hiroshi, Kinami would pull her fist back, before throwing it forward with such sped. The damage was held back because she didn't know what he could take just yet, so this attack would be like a tickle in a sense unless he had a baby body. In which case, he would be kind of an easy target.* - Sat Nov 28 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hes not looking, Punch him while he isn't looking Kinami!  - Sat Nov 28 05:34:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: ... - Sat Nov 28 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) saw the kick coming towards her as well, noticing that her attack didn't do any damage at all. With a grin, she'd go to attack again, before the kick suddenly hit her square in the chest. Kinami paused a bit, as if her heart had stopped. She'd look down at the foot that was planted on her chest, before gasping loudly. But then, she'd grin.

"My turn again.~" 

Kinami suddenly threw a powerful punch towards the center of his chest, the strike coming out quickly once more, however this time it held a bit more damage to it. From there, before Hiroshi even had the chance to react, Kinami would throw another attack, lifting up her leg and planting it directly into the center of his chest.

If both of those landed, Kinami would use the foot that was planted squarely on his chest to kick herself off of his body, doing a quick flip backwards off of his body and landing just infront of her turtle shell. She'd smile at him and chuckle, squating a bit. "You'll have to do a bit better than that, my good friend."* - Sat Nov 28 05:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (same AS. first punch did 20, kick did 30) - Sat Nov 28 05:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Paine - Sat Nov 28 05:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's eyes focused on Hiroshi, her eyes were able to see exactly what he was doing with his movements. Before he got completely close, however, Kinami would move to the side quickly. Probably without Hiroshi even being able to keep up with her and moving in a complete blur. Her body would be sure to be out of the way by the time the kick would've went out.

If this had worked, which she expected it would, Kinami would stand behind Hiroshi with a chuckle. She'd whisper in his ear, "You have to be faster as well." And from there, she'd move yet again, moving in another circle around Hiroshi and appearing in front of him. Now, this was under the assumption that he would turn around after hearing the whisper.

Now if that had worked out like she wanted it to, Kinami would send a quick kick to the back of Hiroshi's knees, aiming to make him fall to one of his knees. And from there, Kinami would pull her power back to kick him in the head and knock him on his side, giving him a bit more pain in his head after the kick.* - Sat Nov 28 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) assumed that her attacks would land, but alas, it didn't. Her kick would quickly get kicked away, startling her just a bit as she felt the foot land on her chest. Her hands quickly raised up to grip his ankle, a grin coming over her face as she leaned back a bit and began spinning. "Come on Hiroshi, start hitting harder!"

Her body began spinning extremely quicker, before she suddenly let it go, allowing Hiroshi to fly back towards the wall. Kinami would follow after him however, not giving him a chance to breath until he was able to do damage to her at least. As she got closer to him, Kinami would begin to attack again, giving no hesitation as she appeared.

Kinami would pull her arm back before twisting her hand powerfully. Her arm was horizontal to her chest, and her hand closed into a fist. Her other hand quickly came up to back-up the fist that was in front of her. Throwing it towards the center of Hiroshi's chest, she aimed to land the attack square into his chest, pushing him back into the wall behind him.* - Sat Nov 28 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (30 damage again) - Sat Nov 28 06:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) whispers: 25 damage) - Sat Nov 28 06:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's eyes widened slightly, and a grin showed on her face. He was finally hitting a bit harder now, so this was surely going to get interesting. As she had her wrist held, she would look at him with the same grin on her face. And the spinning only made her even ore curious. The roundhouse kick to her shoulder caused her to lean the opposite direction a bit.

Then another kick would come towards her, sweeping her off on her ass, and then for the final attack she'd be kicked in the rib cage to send her sliding against the ground. Her body showed that of pain and injury, but in reality it didn't hurt at all. And she meant to show him that. Placing both of her hands on the ground by her head, she'd chuckle lowly.

Throwing her feet upwards, she'd allow her body to follow the momentum of the leg kick, her body landing upright quickly. "Come on Hiroshi, you're hitting too soft. I'll show you how to really hit.~" This was said as a joke, but she meant everything that she had meant when she said that. Stretching her legs lightly, she'd stare him down.

From that stare, she'd take a simple step and then shoot off towards him, her speed maxed out completely. Jumping lightly and with major speed, she'd do a small twist in the air before throwing a quick kick towards the side of his head. This was meant to push him off to the side and send him flying to the side towards the wall once again, and since this was anime it was easily believable.* - Sat Nov 28 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (35 damage this time) - Sat Nov 28 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) whispers: 35 damage) - Sat Nov 28 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) saw the bit of blood that came out of Hiroshi's face from the kick. This made her feel a bit bad,  but it was all for the better of both of them. Then, suddenly, she would feel a sudden kick coming towards her face. It hit her, tilting her head just slightly. -Very- slightly. Other than that, it seemed to have no effect. "Come on Hiroshi, I thought you said you'd actually hit harder!"* - Sat Nov 28 06:29:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) nodded and lifted up her leg. Without any hesitation, Kimani would throw her foot forward at the center of his chest at full strength and speed. Most likely throwing him back and -into- the wall similar to dragon ball z style.* - Sat Nov 28 06:35:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) saw all of the blood that came out of his mouth, causing her to wince a little bit. "I'm sorry." As she said this, she'd look at the roundhouse kick that was coming towards her face. It was coming so fast that she couldn't even react, but when it actually connected, it didn't do anything. Kinami's head moved over to the side from the momentum, but other than that it did no damage.

"Hehe, nice try.~ You really do hit hard though."* - Sat Nov 28 06:41:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) took a sip of her Sake, and then that escalated to three sips. And then, there was hell that was breaking loose in her mind. *hiccup** - Sat Nov 28 09:12:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) threw her arms up high, clipping Hiroshi and Chikyu in the chin. "Shhhhh! Yhu gais don't even know! *hiccup*"* - Sat Nov 28 09:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: H-Hanai. - Sat Nov 28 09:18:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) was suddenly about to be picked up, but her body quickly condensed and curled in on herself, slipping through his hands just like water. She'd slide over between Momura and Hanai, her hands wrapping around both of their necks tightly. "Yhu guys shure you don't *hiccup* want any saaaaaake?~"* - Sat Nov 28 09:18:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: ..I have one question. .  - Sat Nov 28 09:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) heard her name being heard talking about her shell. She didn't want to take it off at all, so she decided not to. "I don't wanna!" Jumping forward hard, she'd spin in the air as her head went directly into the girls forehead. Kinami didn't feel this at all, but this would probably injure Momura for quite a while.* - Sat Nov 28 09:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: O lawed. . . .  - Sat Nov 28 09:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*itachi(Itachi4x4) says: damn. you got knock tha fuck out. - Sat Nov 28 09:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) would continue to fly forward, her leg flying out towards the two as they embraced. One of them was getting kicked in the head by the spinning legs as she propelled forward like a missile. "Weeee!"* - Sat Nov 28 09:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) hit the ground chest first as she felt the shell getting kicked off of her. However, Hiroshi would learn that the weights were only slowing her down. When the shell came off, Kinami would quickly lift up and send a soft slap towards her boyfriends face, her body thrusting over at full speed towards Hanai and Momura before she stopped impossibly close to them. "You gais are soooooo chute!"* - Sat Nov 28 09:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: At least that shell is off. . .  - Sat Nov 28 09:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: But how do I fix this? - Sat Nov 28 09:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: U-Uh-huh..M-Me and hanai have to go. - Sat Nov 28 09:30:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Chiky for the save. . . . Thanks. - Sat Nov 28 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: HELP HIDEO! - Sat Nov 28 09:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt the locking in of the hold that was on her body. Turning her head and leaning back against Chikyu's body, Kinami would begin to slither downwards, letting her head exit the girls arms. The moment of comedic relief would be there if Chikyu didn't move at all while she slithered out, leaving her sitting up all weird and probably lost as to how she was out.

Kinami, however, would be sleeping on Hiroshi's back after she had time to get behind him and sleep.* - Sat Nov 28 09:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: This isn't enough! - Sat Nov 28 09:36:51 2015
