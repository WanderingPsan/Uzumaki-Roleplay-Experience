<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You use your chakra and change the state of that chakra to being solid . . . Or you use your chakra to manipulate the surrounding earth. - Sun Oct 25 18:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You can use it to change the density of the ground from high to low . . . Change the state of it as well. - Sun Oct 25 18:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Some techniques allow you to manipulate the weight of something as well. - Sun Oct 25 18:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So . . . We'll begin by . . . learning Mud silhouette. - Sun Oct 25 18:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) watched the man as he worked the jutsu quickly. She had seen the jutsu a few times before, so she was used to how it worked. But still, she would watch him work as he demonstrated the jutsu. She listened to his words and watched the earth beneath him as it slowly started to morph. It wasn't much that she was doing at the moment, but she would watch him intently to learn, and maybe later she could learn how to fly like her mom took her to do before. Her mind focused back onto the jutsu and the handseals needed for them. She focused hard on them, just to make sure that she could do it, and looked down at the earth once again as she noticed what it could do. With a smile, she'd nod.

Looking down at her own hands, she'd slowly clap them together and see what she could do, she had never worked with the earth element, nor has she ever tried to shift her chakra into anything of that nature. It was usually grinding chakra together or heating up her own or something like that. However, she'd have to focus really hard just to learn the jutsu at hand. Clapping them together, she'd begin to flow her chakra down into the ground, trying to turn the ground into soft mud, of course it didn't really work that way at all. The ground below her would barely even shake a little bit, let alone turn into mud. She had failed. "Dang it, this is....different."* - Sun Oct 25 18:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) sighed as she looked down at the ground, and how it didn't do anything, or even move in the slightest. She groaned to herself, knowing that she just had to get this jutsu down and win over her family, protect them even. But without going into detail in her mind, she'd look down at the ground once more, this was the time that she had to get the jutsu down. And as she thought that, it seemed that the wind would begin to pick up, as if destiny and fate itself were permitting her to learn this jutsu right now, her hair blowing behind her as she looked up with a grin. This was her time, to show that she actually was a prodigy, and for a good reason at that.

Without any hesitation, she'd pull her hands together and begin to flow through the handseals needed to complete this jutsu, the mud river seeming to be very helpful if she could hit someone with it. Looking over at Kilm with a smile, she'd give him a solid nod before turning back over towards the wall, her eyes focusing hard on just one spot of the wall. As she held the final handseal, she'd look down at the earth beneath her, it seemed to waver between if it wanted to comply or not. Her eyes strained a bit and her chakra was focused hard in the earth beneath her. It was going to get done, even if it was the death of her.

Her hands seemed to tighten up in the last handseal, and she was straining herself to turn the earth beneath her into mud. It seemed to slowly work, as the muddy ground beneath her began to expand and move forward slowly. It wasn't anything special, it was worse than if she had the jutsu at new, but now she new that she could do it. With a sudden burst of what seemed to be willpower and chakra, the mud river would shoot up and forward, flowing towards the wall solidly and powerfully. After it had shot forward, Nina would sigh and stagger just slightly, turning her head towards Kilm once again. "I did it, you see?" It seemed that she was slightly stronger every day, and it was all due to her teachers.* - Sun Oct 25 18:52:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hello Saez. - Sun Oct 25 19:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) sighed as she began walking through the forest all of the way from Sunagakure. She wondered what kind of animal she would find, looking for a contract wouldn't be all that difficult right? As she walked, she'd look to and fro, wondering what kind of animals she would even encounter in such a setting. It was so beautiful with the different colors of trees. She'd never really been in a forest setting before, but it was pretty to say the least.

Moving around, she'd notice a baby gorilla who seemed to be stranded, not moving and only staying underneath one tree. "Aww, that's cute." Moving forward, she'd smile and put out a single hand towards it, wondering if it would take it. It seemed to look at Nina for a while, lifting up a single arm to her before yelping lightly and pushing its arm back down. Moving forward slowly, she'd inspect the Gorillas arm, and it seemed that there was some sort of leech on it, apparently a painful one.

Pulling out a kunai quickly, she'd grab the gorillas arm and, using the utmost respect and the least amount of pressure, she'd stab into said leech, causing fluids to begin coming out of the large kunai hole. The leech fell to the ground quickly, not breathing or eating or anything that would signify that it was still alive. Nina then grabbed on to the gorilla, straining to pick it up, and placed it around her neck. It seemed comfortable there for whatever reason.

With the baby on her back, Nina would push chakra into her feet and begin jumping forward, following after the noise and commotion that she had heard. The baby on her back seemed to make noise back towards it, seeming to communicate with whatever the noise was coming from, this is why Nina decided to follow after it. And it seemed that it would pay off, as she finally approached the large group of gorillas and return their baby.

"You, what is your name?" The deep voice surprised her, and she looked up at the older gorilla, who seemed to be some type of leader. "N-Nina, I'm a kunoichi..." After she said that, the gorilla looked down at her, his eyes seeming to pierce through her completely. "You are not selfish, and you helped a young animal get back to its family without asking for anything in return, why is this?" Nina blinked a little, as if that was a stupid question.

"Well, I'd want someone to do it for me, so I did it for them." Nina got a bit excited, wondering what would come out of this, and the gorilla seemed to nod. "Good, those are the shinobi that we would allow our power." Pulling out a large scroll, she'd throw it at Nina, a bit too forcefully and causing her to fall backwards. Looking at the scroll, she'd grin and open it. "Thanks a lot, man!" She'd bite into her thumb hard, wincing as she drew blood, before putting her name into the scroll.* - Sun Oct 25 19:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Did you master the jutsu? - Sun Oct 25 21:38:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) blinked a little, then turned back to Sanoke. "Come on, we need to work already!" Moving forward, she'd bring her hands together quickly. Everyone else was working hard to protect things, and she knew that she had to as well, so she ran forward, eager to help out and protect the village. She didn't run forward much, however, and made sure not to step on any webs just in case.

Without any hesitation, she didn't know which one to go for, but decided to just go for it. Moving her hands quickly through a series of handseals, she'd jump up slightly and aim her face towards the spider. Her chakra shot out quickly towards the giant spider, the chakra aiming to cut deep into it and perhaps even bring off a leg. If that didn't work, however, this wouldn't discourage her from trying at all.* - Sun Oct 25 22:21:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) was tired of traveling by the time that she had gotten there, and when she stepped foot on the island, everything felt......wrong. The sky was different, her directions didn't even seem like they belonged to her. This would definitely be different than anything she'd ever done. Looking towards Fuji, she'd look at him, determined, and not backing down in the slightest.* - Sun Oct 25 23:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) nodded to Izanami, and then to Marrisa. Taking a step forward to be beside Izanami, she'd turn her head and smile. "I don't know your name or who you are, but we'll make it just fine, as a team." This, of course, was to help her cope with whatever it was that they were walking into.

"This'll be a piece of cake with all three of us, no doubt!"* - Sun Oct 25 23:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) nodded. And instead of following behind, she was walking right beside her confidently. "This will be good."* - Sun Oct 25 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked up at the forest as she approached it, her body already feeling that of depression and sadness. "Jeez..." It felt like there was definitely something up with this forest, and it wasn't anything normal at all. Nina instinctively pushed her hand back on her katana hilt, as if preparing for whatever might've jumped out.

Looking at the others, she'd hear what seemed like voices in the wind as they shot past her, this causing her to be even more on edge. It seemed that her confidence was wavering now, but looking at her friends did nothing but reassure her. They all would make it out alive, there was no doubt about it.* - Mon Oct 26 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked over and looked at Marrisa as she started trying to veer off from the team. Crossing her arms and then looking over to Izanami, she'd stare at her. "Are you going to leave as well?" Her hand was still on her katana when she was suddenly bumped into by Marrisa, who was just walking in another direction. "What the heck?"* - Mon Oct 26 00:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) continued walking forward, her eyes looking at the light in front of her. "Maybe it's the way out, maybe we're safe." She wondered why she hadn't seen it before, and looked down at the water that seemed that it was freezing into ice and becoming colder. Focusing chakra into her feet, she'd slowly begin to walk on top of the water, her face turning over to Izu. "Use suimen to walk on top of the water. If your feet get wet in this cold, it might get very uncomfortable."* - Mon Oct 26 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: When did my shroud become a childs play thing? - Mon Oct 26 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: -omit- - Mon Oct 26 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) grunted and quickly unsheathed her katana, her hands moving quickly. She wasn't about to simply torch the place entirely, though. As she held the katana, it'd suddenly shoot up with flames as she looked down. "Get off of me!" Her hands would quickly begin slicing around her, making sure to get the biggest vines and branches and such that was pulling her away.

Looking up at the girl, she seemed to be safe with the fire shroud around her. "Get out, if you can, get away so that you don't get caught!" If she had gotten away from the branches, she would try to run towards Izanami, but if not she'd continue to get pulled and continue cutting away from the branches.* - Mon Oct 26 01:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) felt the heat of the flames hitting the branches, destroying a majority of them. For the ones that didn't get destroyed, she'd spin around and quickly slash through the remaining branches. After she had gotten free, she'd turn her head to the nearest light source, the tablet that was sitting, just chilling on the (ground, pedastal?)

Nina would quickly run forward and, looking back at Izanami, would nod her head. Leaping forward with her suimen just incase something tried to grab her, she'd leap forward with extra strength, her hands quickly reaching out to grab the tablet. She didn't know what it was for, or even if it would stop the branches from grabbing at her. But she only hoped that something would change after she grabbed it.

After she did grab it however, she'd turn her head towards Izanami and smile. "I got it! They'll stop now!" She grinned and ran back to Iza, reaching out to hug her just incase something had changed for the better. And then she saw the fire and changed her mind against it.* - Mon Oct 26 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked around as the roots grabbed her once again as she was grabbed at. She felt much more tired, assuming that this was based completely on the amount of fighting that she had done, as well as touching the tablet. Pulling her hands up quickly, she'd allow her chakra to begin surging as sparks shot out a bit more. And this was maybe an indicator to Iza.

Still kicking and screaming, fearing for her life even, she'd allow the fireballs to shoot from her hand, aiming to completely burn the vines that grabbed her away. Hopefully this was successful and had freed her. If it wasn't the case, then she'd just be in even more of a worse spot. However she was panicking, fearing for her life, and so the fireballs quickly shot outwards towards the branches grabbing her.* - Mon Oct 26 01:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: I remember when I first came here...It's how I discovered me fire shroud..Seven Days and Seven nights..A heart of flame with the courage to fight.. But only those born with this ember will glow just as bright.. - Mon Oct 26 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) 's eyes quickly turned to look at Izanami, her eyes also shooting towards the tablet that seemed to be Iza's focus as well. "Go, you can do this!" Fighting against her hands more so then being pulled, she'd clap her hands together and allow herself to do a series of handseals. Tears streamed down her eyes as she continued getting pulled, and at this point she wasn't fighting back, she was simply making sure that Iza had survived.

"I'm sorry, Ortho. It's the right thing...." As her foot felt the human-like insides of the tree, her eyes snapped back to the tablet that was infront of her, and she knew that she had to get it done already. Without a sound, she'd poke her lips forward and allow a wispy, barely visible gas to shoot out towards the entire pillar. When the fireball and the air on top of that collided with it, well, that'll be something interesting indeed.* - Mon Oct 26 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) felt the sudden explosion through the area, Nina's eyes still watering from her being on the ground and being devoured. She was indeed crying, but now her eyesight was simply hazy and she couldn't see straight, couldn't even hear straight. "A-Am I....dead....?" She just looked up from the swamp, her eyes searching for something to indicate that she had died or survived. Her eyes burned now and her brain hurt from the thought of leaving Ortho behind.

As she felt her hair being picked at by a monkey, she'd slowly groan and roll over, her eyes looking directly at it. Reaching out slowly, she'd try to grab the tablet from the monkey, her eyes closing once again and her body dropping back down to the ground. Her eyes continued to tear up and the tears continued to fall to the ground, leaving streaks on her face.* - Mon Oct 26 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: *faceplants* - Mon Oct 26 02:34:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) was knocked out anyway.* - Mon Oct 26 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Eh.. - Mon Oct 26 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) 's eyes suddenly popped open, her body aching. "Mom, Ortho!" Her eyes looked around for a bit, and them remembered that she was in the labyrinth test. Looking over at Izanami, she sighed and stood slowly. "We should go...." She was only the slightest bit of rested really. But turning her head, she knew that she had to go somewhere.* - Mon Oct 26 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I'm sure..... - Mon Oct 26 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) walked over to Izanami and hugged her, hard. "Thanks for saving me." After that, she'd look down at the tablet in Izanami's hands, before turning about and beginning to walk. Wherever it seemed the tablet would show them to go, anyway. "Do you want me to hold it, or would you like to keep it?* - Mon Oct 26 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) continued walking forward, getting a bad feeling from the tablet and the entire forest once again. Pushing her hands together, she'd allow her hands to flow through handseals quickly before she threw her hand to the side, allowing a puff of smoke to suddenly appear underneath it. From the smoke, a small baby gorilla would be seen, which would quickly crawl up Nina's back.

Turning towards Izanami, she'd smile. "For extra....senses."* - Mon Oct 26 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) also bit her thumb because she forgot.* - Mon Oct 26 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) sighed as she turned back to Iza. "Lets follow the river on foot. If something happens, we'll have more places to go." She didn't trust going on the water itself, since Fuji had shown that not everything in this village was what it seemed. For all they knew, that water could've been.....hell, anything in the world.

Turning back towards Iza, she'd nod, before looking forward. The gorilla that was on her back quickly shot up into the tree, moving through the treetops and being prepared to give her any warning. "Go.~" With that, the gorilla would quickly shoot off and away from the two, as if it were looking for the right way to go.* - Mon Oct 26 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked over at the gorilla as it went into the razor leaves, dispersing the moment it took damage enough to make it bleed. Grabbing Iza's hand, she'd pull the girl over and walk with her hand the entire way. "No running into the forest, we should stay here between the trees and the river." Hopefully this would pay off and something would go right for a change.* - Mon Oct 26 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) just kept strolling on down the river now.* - Mon Oct 26 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) just kept on strolling down the river, waiting for someting to happen and hoping that it was good.* - Mon Oct 26 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: It seems we are doing good now. - Mon Oct 26 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) sighed as she turned around at Iza. "Alright, enough resting. We should start trying to get out of here again." After saying that, her grip would tighten just a bit before starting to jog forward.* - Mon Oct 26 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) started feeling something itchy in her skin, causing her to look around her body. There was no way that anything could've gotten into her, right? There was no period in time where they could've done it, it must have been another trick of the island. Even still, the pain wasn't something that she could ignore. Letting go of Iza, she'd go to scratching her arms and legs lightly, her eyes turning to Iza, who didn't seem to be itching much at all. Pushing her hand forward, she'd grab onto the slab, considering that was the only difference between the two that could've really made a significant difference in the labyrinth.* - Mon Oct 26 04:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) clapped her hands together without any hesitation. At the moment that she saw the bugs, she'd flow through handseals. There was no way that she was dealing with this, nor was she allowing Iza to get injured. Stepping in front of her, she'd let loose a torrent of fire that shot out in a flamethrower at the bugs, making sure to roast them alive.* - Mon Oct 26 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) //after a full day of resting in the rough and taking turns on watch, the two had started to head out once more. There wasn't any time to rest any longer than they had to. Their time was winding down, so they really did have to just go for it now. Using the tablet in front of her to guide the way, Nina and Iza would be running through the forest at a great speed, yet not great enough to make them exert -all- of their energy at all. It was more of a very fast jog.* - Mon Oct 26 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Dark Souls... - Mon Oct 26 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: -omit- - Mon Oct 26 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) just continued to run wherever the tablet carried her, dragging Iza along as well.* - Mon Oct 26 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) turned her head towards the random falcon that was flying towards them. "Jesus." Without a single word, she'd throw a single kunai towards the falcon to divert it away from them both, at least for just a moment. After that had happened, she'd turn her body towards the way the tablet was showing her to go.

Forcing her chakra out into a dome, she'd begin doing a series of handseals, the genjutsu taking effect in an area instead of just to one being, Multiple black clones would begin shooting out from her, all of them walking in different directions while Nina and Iza continued running through them and towards the same direction. They were determined to get to the base, ignoring everything around the island while somehow keeping her eyes open.* - Mon Oct 26 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) continued running as the falcon tried to grab many of clones and went right through them. This was perfect, allowing her to continue to run away. She had to be somewhere very close to the base now, since she was just near it not too long ago. And now she had been running wherever the tablet allowed them to go, wherever the correct direction was.

Aiming to finally reach the damn base, she'd go into a full sprint, dragging Iza along the way.* - Mon Oct 26 05:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) 's eyes shot over to Marrisa as she arrived. "Marrisa!" They had finally reunited, and the base was so clear. But she knew there was one more thing to do. "Get ready, I know that this is some type of trick."* - Mon Oct 26 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) was healed up and rested for the night. In the morning as they woke up, she'd look towards the base. This was the last night that they could last in her own opinion. She had no food or water for the past few days, and had lost a considerable amount of weight from her time on the island. This would probably be her last, and hardest fight, but she would fight nonetheless.* - Mon Oct 26 05:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) stared off at the beast that was in front of her. Luckily, Nina was trained in the art of wind ninjutsu pretty heavy, but other than that she knew that she was screwed. Noticing the beast move quickly, Nina would pull her hands up, doing a quick flash of handseals as fast as she possibly could. The tail whip would be coming around this time, and you know she had to make it look cool.

Leaning back while her chakra was being converted, she'd dip down deep enough so that the tail just barely missed her body, much like the matrix. It was as if she had moved in slow motion during all of this. As she started coming upwards, her eyes looked up at the wolf once more, her lips pursed tightly as she released two blasts of chakra.

This chakra was big, fast, and full of small blades that was used to rip through the wolf and cut it to shreads. This was of course her strongest jutsu, so if it didn't do a significant amount of damage, this wouldn't be a good fight for her at all.* - Mon Oct 26 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) heard the sudden smash behind her, turning around quickly. Clapping her hands together, she'd flow through handseals once again. Holding her breath in, she waited for the creature to move again. She knew that she wouldn't be able to see the creature at all when it did move, so when it attacked again she'd simply hope she was quick enough. Her cheeks remained pufffed up with a massive amount of chakra.* - Mon Oct 26 06:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) 's stomach was suddenly kneed in, her eyes focusing on the beast quickly. She quickly began rapid firing all of the chakra she had built up, estimated to about twelve bullets being shot in total like a machine gun, all aiming to smack deep into and drill through the beast suddenly. As she flew back, she felt the pain even harder in her stomach as she hit the ground near Iza. 

Without hesitation, she'd suddenly clap her hands together, allowing the tornado to suddenly surround those two. Turning her head to Iza, she'd begin whispering lightly. "Okay, here's the plan. We both look for the beast, and when we both get a clear shot, we both use our most ranged and wide spread wind jutsu, which is probably great breakthrough. Lets do this!~"* - Mon Oct 26 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: It should have trouble reaching top speed now... - Mon Oct 26 07:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) decided to make a hasty move. Unsheathing her katana, she'd allow her wind chakra to shift into the blade, allowing a long tip of wind to suddenly materialize on the blade. Looking at the beast, she'd nod. Looking back at Iza, she'd smile. "This is going to be risky, but trust me. Use Divine wind to stop it from running anywhere, just trust me."

After saying that, she'd begin running outside of her own tornado and allowed it to disperse. She'd clap her hands together into a single handseal before both of her hands went back to the bottom of her hilt and gripped it tightly. Hopefully this plan would work if the lightning beast had its movement stopped or it stayed still for whatever reason.

Moving quickly, she'd suddenly disappear in a puff of smoke, her movement extremely quick. She'd suddenly appear in front of the beast, hoping that the divine wind of Iza had halted its movement. And if not, then hopefully she'd get lucky. But anyway, she utilized the shunshins' sudden burst of speed, her mind woozy and dizzy all of the same, that's why it was such a risk.

If it did work, however, her blade would be impaling the beast right through the center of the chest, similar to how Sasuke was stabbing Danzo. This was her exact vision, and hopefully the exact same way that she had stabbed him. Whether this had worked or not, Nina would release the blade and stumble back a bit, her mind still dizzy and trying hard to reassess its area.* - Mon Oct 26 07:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) almost fell back from her frontal attack, noticing that it had worked. She'd groan as she began falling back, not even noticing that she had been grabbed by the beast until it was too late. As it began to squeeze her, she'd force her head up and begin yelling loudly, her body feeling as if it were getting crushed. Tears began streaming down her face, not from the pain, but from the emotional pain and distress that she was suddenly dealing with. It had all hit her out of nowhere.

Throughout the screaming, she'd feel that her body and spirit was being crushed. It seemed that she would have failed as she fell into the clutches of the beast. There was nothing she could do. Her body was weak and dizzy, she could barely even move on her own. She had failed Ortho, Lera and Violet, her only family members would lose her without her even being able to say goodbye. She had taken this lightly and it was getting the better of her.

If she got out of this, she would be changed for the rest of her life, this was positive. Her throat became scratchy as she yelled louder and louder, her memory still flashing hazily through the happy moments of her life, the moments that she had growing up with Ortho, meeting Lera and Violet, her times making friends with everyone that she could find. It was extremely nice, but remembering all of this only made her situation worse, she couldn't lose here. There was no way.

Trying to gather all of the power that she had, she'd reach up and grab her sword, using all of the chakra and power in her reach. Channeling much of her chakra into the blade and into her amulet that she had found, she'd force the chakra of her sword to not only rev up like a chainsaw instead of just a point, but the chakra would also become a blue color. Her eyes burned intensely as her eyes locked onto the beast, her strength being forced into the blade in an upward ripping motion, attempting to cut it completely in half.

After doing this, whether it had worked or not, Nina would pass out, her last memory being her, Ortho, Lera, and Violet all together on the training field one day. Love was the only thing on her mind as she fell back down to the ground, or as she was crushed to death.* - Mon Oct 26 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) brought up the sword as quickly as she possibly could. She was still fading from everything that happened to her in the past few days, all of it hitting her hard now. Both psychologically and physically. She'd slam the wind blade down upon the beings neck, making sure it was dead with her hazy vision.* - Mon Oct 26 21:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) was dragged into the base because Iza was trustworthy.* - Mon Oct 26 21:20:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) slowly began to come to, her eyes focusing on the dead beast that lay in front of her, hopefully it wouldn't come back or anything. Staggering up to her feet, she'd walk up towards the castle, hopefully not finding anymore obstacles in her way. And of course she grabbed her blade.* - Tue Oct 27 08:54:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Mhm.~ - Tue Oct 27 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Follow me. - Tue Oct 27 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Right then. - Tue Oct 27 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll teach you the jutsu of the day now. - Tue Oct 27 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) nodded as she looked at Kilm and the one handseal that he had done. After everything she had been through, it seemed that this wasn't even a little hard. Se had just come back from the Labyrinth, her brain still reeling slightly from the stress of the forest that she had to deel with. Pulling her hands together, she'd press them into the single handseal with a chuckle and turn her eyes to the earth beside her, and beginning to send her chakra into said earth that was beside her. With a slight groan, she'd nod and begin getting to work.

Forcing her chakra into the ground beside her, she'd attempt to mold it up the way that she wanted to. Allowing it to turn down into mud, she'd use her chakra to attempt to mold it upwards and, after a while she'd attempt to turn it into a clone of herself. But she had to get the earth to the right texture before she could do anything with it. And so, she sat there, letting the earth turn into mud slowly but surely, much like she had to do with the mud silhouette.

With that being the plan, she'd begin morphing the mud that she had created underneath her, slowly but surely, into a clone of herself that would be able to walk and talk, and of course have her color and skill. Moving forward just a bit, she'd continue to allow her chakra to shift into the mud and try to convert it up into something solid. It'd slowly begin to bubble upwards and shift around, trying to shoot up into the air to be the height of Nina, but it would just wiggle there in the air for the longest of whiles.

After a while it seems, she'd suddenly get lost in her memories. Her focus went back to the labyrinth and what she went through, showing in her eyes that something traumatic had happened on that island. Of course, a lot of things happened on that island anyway, especially a lot of things that had almost killed her. The vines, for example, stuck to her mind. Her body being wrapped around by hundreds of vines and slowly being pulled back into something that wasn't a tree, but more like an organism or alien or something.

Nina suddenly fell back, screaming extremely loudly and swatting at her arms and legs. Then she looked around and noticed that she was back in Sunagakure, learning a jutsu from her teacher. Shaking her head a little bit, she'd slowly raise back up to her feet, her eyes looking back down at the puddle of mud that she made, and then down at her feet. Her head was hurting just a bit from the memory of it. It was truely horrid, but it had indeed helped her become a better shinobi, and now she had Fuji to count on for things.

Her eyes went back to the mud that she had created from her chakra and the earth that was beside her. She was almost there, she could feel it. For this to be her first try, it was extremely hard, but she had to focus and show that she was a worthy student, and would continue to be one. That's the only thing that mattered, she had to continue and get trained until she could train herself and become strong enough to protect anyone that she needed too. So with that, she'd clap her hands together powerfully and confidently, allowing it to slowly take form.

The mud would slowly begin wiggling up from the ground of mud that she had created, it was like a gelatinous form that was slowly rising up into the sky, but not very high just as high as Nina was. It would start to build mass and weight to it, the mud being such a high amount that it would begin looking like an actual human without anything to signify that it was an actual human. It was slowly forming, and it seemed that it would be perfect height, but it was much heavier than she were due to being nothing but earth and mud.

It would slowly take even more form, the body, arms, and legs would begin forming near perfectly to Nina's posture. Without any hesitation, it seemed to pull arms and legs away from the other to make two of each limb, making it correct instead of just having one clump of a leg and one clump of an arm. Its head would also begin forming on top of the mud figure, and with that, any excess mud would simply break apart and fall to the ground, allowing it to become a part of the ground again.

After that, the color would become to form in, especially around the clothes and hair that she wore. It seemed like a perfect clone of her, because it really was. Without any hesitation, the clone would take a step to the side, and then another. Lots of mud and such would fall off to the ground and form back into the ground that it was a part of. She'd nod at the clone as it seemed to be correcting itself, and she'd have to remember this each time she created the clone.

Smiling, she'd turn to Kilm and put a thumbs up, the clone beginning to run around quickly, almost as fast as the original Nina had. It was throwing punches and kicks, even the sword would seem to be perfect. "I got this one down too!" Nina giggled as the clone jogged around Kilm, almost as if it were to annoy him.* - Tue Oct 27 10:45:58 2015

Raising her arms up to her chest, she'd take the attack head on, as if she had a choice in the matter. Her body was suddenly thrown to the side like a little insect, her teeth gritting as she hit the ground and quickly popped back up, her eyes darting towards Jiki. "Fine, if that's the way it's going to be...."

Standing up, she'd clap her hands together softly, before moving them through a sudden amount of handseals. They were thrown together quickly before Nina shot forward, her chakra moving through her body quickly. With her eyes remaining on Jiki just incase he decided to move, she'd slide to a stop before pulling her hands up to her mouth. Releasing a large yet slow fireball from her mouth, it would slowly float through the air, probably not reaching Jiki anytime soon.* - Thu Oct 29 01:45:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) clapped her hands together once again, flowing through them quickly. There was a reason the fireballs were moving so slowly, and the shuriken would make it even more damaging for him. Since she was already stopped, it'd make it much easier for her. With a grin, she'd focus directly on the large fireball that was moving slowly towards them. "Lets get serious then!" And with that being said, the jutsu was already set in motion.

Pushing both hands forward, she'd allow her wind release to suddenly burst forward powerfully, most likely the spectators would feel the large amount of chakra that was hurtling forward. This aimed to make the fireball as well as the shuriken boost forward and add increased damage towards him, this was aiming to completely wreck him and his shield, but who knows what'll happen.* - Thu Oct 29 02:02:52 2015
