<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Nina(Ninasky115) spun around, and began walking away.* - Mon Nov  9 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm... - Mon Nov  9 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Nina-kun...you're sending mixed messages.. - Mon Nov  9 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You said you'd kill me.. - Mon Nov  9 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Why aren't you trying to kill me? - Mon Nov  9 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Don't make me happy, and then take that away.. - Mon Nov  9 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: ... - Mon Nov  9 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Nina-kun..I suggest you come back. - Mon Nov  9 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Nina(Ninasky115) says: I don't really care what you suggest. You're not really serious about this at all. - Mon Nov  9 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Nina(Ninasky115) says: So if you won't start, I'm leaving. - Mon Nov  9 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Nina(Ninasky115) turned her head over at him as he had suddenly appeared, having made no sound at all before he had suddenly appeared near her. Her guard was up now, but she wasn't really bothered by Nigen simply because he decided not to attack her or anything yet. However, she cut her eyes at him and reached back, a single hand on her katana's hilt. She'd begin backing away from him, her eyes still focused on him in case he actually did try to attack this time.* - Mon Nov  9 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Nina(Ninasky115) sighed boredly as she looked over at him. This was really getting tiresome, so she would dash forward and begin this spar after all. Without any hesitation, she would unsheath her blade and begin running forward, making sure to keep it pointed out and not towards her. Of course when she got closer, she'd take the smallest of a baby hops forward before swinging her blade towards his left arm.* - Mon Nov  9 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Nina(Ninasky115) noticed him as he had pulled back, and she also noticed the finger being pointed at her as well. Who would just sit there when being pointed at in the middle of a spar? No way, she wasn't that stupid. Quickly jumping to the side and stabbing her sword straight up in the ground, she'd notice the black ball that seemingly flew past her, her hands quickly clapping at her chest without hesitation. She'd wonder about the black ball, but that was something to deal with later.

From there, she'd flow through handseals quickly, her head being cocked back before taking a single step forward and lurching her head and her upper body forward, She'd shoot invisible bullets of wind towards Nigen, these bullets being blunt to show that she wasn't really using killing intent. From there, the bullets aimed to smack her in both shoulders, both knees, and the center of his chest.* - Mon Nov  9 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Nina(Ninasky115) watched her attack simply get absorbed by his body, this was another time that her ninjutsu had been proven completely useless. It annoyed her to say the least, and so she decided to take it a bit more seriously. Rushing forward, she'd quickly slide to the side to dodge the ball once again, her speed being used to close the distance much easier. Once she got close, she'd raise her hands up quickly.

And from there, it'd begin. She'd throw a quick punch out towards his nose, her eyes staying busy and quickly shooting between all of what was happening. It most definitely stated with his hands in case he had tried that little dark thing again, since that seemed to be his main means of attack.* - Mon Nov  9 04:20:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Nina(Ninasky115) felt her punch simply get swatted to the side, as if she were just simply slow. Moving forward once again to follow up with her attack, she'd pull yet another attack that she'd throw forward, yet there was no point. He would simply dodge all of them, so why would she waste the energy on trying to hit him with anything? After throwing that second punch, she'd lower her arms, but remain on guard. "I'm done, no point in trying when you're just going to dodge them all." With that being said, knowing that she couldn't hit him at all, she'd turn around.* - Mon Nov  9 04:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Nina(Ninasky115) looked back at him yet she continued walking. Moving her hand to the side, she'd snatch up her katana by its hilt and twirl it to the side, pushing it into her sheath.* - Mon Nov  9 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Mon Nov  9 04:43:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Honestly, if I didn't promise not to hurt you.. - Mon Nov  9 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Nina(Ninasky115) says: You think that you're going to call me a guy and make people laugh at me. - Mon Nov  9 04:47:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Nina(Ninasky115) panted as she moved through the area, deciding to take a break in one of the trees. She'd rest her body in one of the trees to rest, making sure that she wasn't trying to move while all dizzy and exhausted to death.* - Mon Nov  9 04:59:05 2015

She was able to grab his pinky with her hand, her own pinky up on the hand that she had grabbed him with.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) spun around and looked at Owari, blinking. "Sorry, we kind of got into it." From there, she'd walk forward, pointing at Owari once again. "But you're getting a noogie too!!"* - Tue Nov 10 19:56:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) smiled and ran forward as quickly as she possibly could, aiming to reach Owari before she could break away. Once she got close, she'd jump forward with both of her arms swung out, hopefully tackling her to the ground so that she couldn't get back up. And from there, the noogie of super greatness would begin!* - Tue Nov 10 20:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) continued to noogie Owari until she was assaulted by her brother again, the trust completely fading into sibling rivalry. Turning around quickly and holding in her laughter, she'd jump forward with all of her power to tackle Ortho, or so it seems. When she jumped, she'd reach out and grab the blunt out of his mouth, assuming he wasn't having an iron grip on it. If she'd been able to grab it, she'd smile and land on the fence, pretending to take a smoke of it.* - Tue Nov 10 20:14:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) giggled as she looked at him, and then her face turned from happy to a bit of sadness. "Fine, I won't smoke it." After saying that, however, she'd chuckle and allow her chakra to flow through it, igniting it and burning it to ashes. She'd then smile and poke her tongue out at him.* - Tue Nov 10 20:22:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) listened to what Ortho had to say to her, and she was indeed very happy about this. She was just about to speak before she cut her eyes to Ryutaro, her eyes studying over him. "You have a guest..." After she said that, she'd spin off and look out into the distance, smirking a little bit. Muttering a bit so that only Ortho could hear, she'd say, "I'm going to Kirigakure. Make sure I get myself a special item.~"* - Wed Nov 11 20:54:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) nodded at Paine, and started taking a few steps back after a while. She'd keep her eyes trained on the hand that was up in the air, knowing exactly what she had to do from the technique that she was taught before at her house. It wasn't all that hard to do from the looks of it, but looks could always be decieving, even with something like a simple taijutsu. From tere, she'd sigh, looking over at Ortho and all of the people that he had brought in out of nowhere.

From there, she'd take off quickly now, moving towards Paine as quickly as she could without any hesitation. From there, she'd take a powerful step before launching herself forward in the air, lifting one of her legs up high into the air and it was aimed right at the hand itself. Nina grinned slightly as she flew through the air, before connecting with the hand after a period of time. If she didn't move the hand back, Nina would kick off of it and do a backflip in the air, before landing back down on her feet.* - Thu Nov 12 00:11:05 2015

Find someone else to be close to you, I'm sick of fighting with you, especially over fucking jokes. Go make up with Index." After saying that, she'd turn around and leave.* - Thu Nov 12 01:08:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) looked over at Momura, before slowly beginning to walk over towards her. Looking down at her with an emotionless face, she'd push out a hand and wait for the girl to grab it, aiming to help her up. "At least you continued trying to fight as long as you could."* - Sat Nov 14 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I s'pose that's fine... - Sat Nov 14 05:13:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: Huh, a rival. That idea seems positive. - Sat Nov 14 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Then do your best, eh? Heh. - Sat Nov 14 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: Y-Yea..! - Sat Nov 14 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm... - Sat Nov 14 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Anyway, what's your name, Lady? - Sat Nov 14 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) turned her eyes over to the hand, and moved her hand to shake it. "My name is Nina. Good luck."* - Sat Nov 14 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: A'right then... Heh. Let's space out n' get ready. Momura, mind gettin to the sides, just in ca- Atta girl. - Sat Nov 14 05:17:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Or shall I? - Sat Nov 14 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: You can have it. - Sat Nov 14 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I'll be right back - Sat Nov 14 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: Y-Yea.. - Sat Nov 14 05:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) 's eyes kept on her, making sure not to take her eyes off of the girl. As she ran up to Nina, she'd grin a little bit. It'd been a while since she had fought someone that was closer to her skill rank, or at least she thought Mitsunara was. She really hoped she was, possibly. But that didn't matter, as she had to focus on the attack.

As the left arm came over towards her chin, Nina would quickly lean her upper body backwards to dodge the attack, before raising up her right elbow and aiming to connect it into Mitsunara's chest, hoping to push her back a bit, doing damage and gaining space at the same time. After that, Nina would step back as well, flashing her a chuckle and then a grin.* - Sat Nov 14 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) felt the blow landing solidly against her chest, as well as her not reacting to the attack at all. Nina's eyes widened a bit, but then she blinked and went back to showing no emotion at all, it seemed that unless she stopped focusing, this spar might go on for a bit. Regardless, Nina quickly focused on the attack that came towards her waist, causing Nina to take yet another step back. However, when the knee comes up to her, she knows that she had to react differently.

Turning to the side as the knee came, Nina would aim to quickly drop down to the ground and sweep the girl off of her one solid foot that was on the ground. She couldn't really do damage to the girl, but at the same time this would give Nina enough time to get a few steps back from the girl as she stood up. This was, of course, if the girl even fell from the attack.* - Sat Nov 14 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: S-So the girl is s-stronger then me.. - Sat Nov 14 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: D-Darn.. - Sat Nov 14 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) had indeed created a bit of distance, her eyes staring at Mitsunara for some type of weakness that she could exploit. Nina wasn't a powerhouse at all, she had never seen anyone with such a durable body. And from there, her eyes focused completely on the stance that the girl held. It seemed to be one of a swordsman user.

Nina grinned a little bit and reached back to grab her blade by the hilt, unsheathing it and pointing it forward. "I like that stance that you're holding, lets see how well you are with it." Nina wasn't trained in a fighting style for her sword at all, it was more of a freeform, but she knew how to handle her blade well, and she would show it off.

Crouching down slightly, she'd begin running forward in a burst of speed, her body dashing forward quicker and quicker, nearing Mitsunara quickly. Holding the blade up high, Nina would do a small hop through the air towards the girl, one that Nina could easily recover from, and swing the blade. It seemed to go high but somewhere in the arch, it would curve downward and seem to go towards the girls shoulder. This, of course, wasn't meant to cut anything off, but simply to create some damage on the girl.* - Sat Nov 14 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) continued to charge in as her eyes focused on the Nodachi that seemed to form out of nowhere, the purplish dark energy being clearly visible. This definitely took her off guard, which threw off her entire attack. As she focused on the girl once again, she noticed that the girl was swinging the blade. Since she was able to pull this chakra sword out of nowhere, who knew what else she could do with just a swing? And so, Nina was quickly on the defensive.

Without a moment of hesitation, moving purely off of reflex, Nina would push chakra into her feet. She couldn't stop herself, so she would go with the push to dodget he attack. With the flow of chakra to her feet, the girl would quickly jump into the air, shooting up high while using Suimen to boost her jump and get her over the attack, which she just barely got out of the way from.

From the air, she'd look down at the girl, Nina coming down not too far away from the woman, but hopefully not in attacking distance of her. "Interesting..." This was all Nina had said, completely holding in her surprise. This really would've done her in if this were a serious life or death battle, she was suddenly too careless in the battle. Why would she charge in recklessly like that, she got a grip back over herself.* - Sat Nov 14 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) would continue to move backwards as she focused on the woman basically chasing her down with the blade. Bringing her hands together, Nina would flow through a series of handseals quickly, trying to gain distance once again. She couldn't do anything to her opponent with this amount of defensive body, so there was no chance for her to fo anything physically.

After finishing the handseals needed, she'd throw them both forward with a grunt, her wind chakra bursting forward with the intent of forcing her backwards against her will, regardless of the body that she had on her. After doing this, Nina would sigh slightly, before looking back up at the woman.* - Sat Nov 14 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Hm.. - Sat Nov 14 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) blinked a little as she noticed that the wind would kick up tons of sand and things of that element, making it near impossible to see through for the regular person. However, Nina had a trick up her sleeve. Closing her eyes slightly, she'd allow chakra to flow into it intensely, almost focusing on it for a second, before exhaling slightly.

Opening them once again, if they were able to see her, they would realize that it was slightly different. Her eyes were red, and easily able to see the girls chakra through the sand. Bringing her hands together once again, she'd flow through handseals quietly but quickly, aiming to take specific shots on the girl. Moving her head back lightly, Nina would begin releasing multiple bullets of chakra towards the girl, these bullets being blunt just incase she was able to do some type of damage, she didn't want to kill the girl.

These bullets were going directly for her neck, two of them in particular going towards the center. One was going for either shoulder, and then one was moving towards the center of her stomach. She'd probably walk through all of these, but Nina would practice as if she could damage this woman either way.* - Sat Nov 14 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) 's eyes focused on the chakra of Mitsunara, as well as the waves of chakra that came her way in large arches which originated from the blade. As they came quickly, they cut through the sand cloud as well, making it much easier to see through the sand and through the area overall. However, Nina was capable of dodging it already due to seeing it coming from so far away.

As it came towards her, Nina would tuck her legs in by bending her knees forward and leaning her body back, folding her body up to the ground as it simply flew over her. Nina watched it as it flew as well, smiling as it flew straight past her body. From there, the woman quickly laughed her body back up from the ground.

Smiling, she'd look over at Mitsunara as she clapped her hands together. "Hey, this is my ultimate attack right here, so pay attention!" As she said this, her hands would quickly begin to flow through a flash of handseals, as well as chakra building up through her. It wasn't obvious what she was doing, but something was going down. It all depended on where she looked. But maybe, just maybe, she was able to identify genjutsu with her sensing techniques.* - Sat Nov 14 06:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) thinks: ...Weird.. - Sat Nov 14 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: Hey, he's finally awake. - Sat Nov 14 06:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: Finally. - Sat Nov 14 06:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) looked at the giant sword that was being formed out of nowhere, her chakra already effecting the woman named Mitsunara. The genjutsu was already taking over, but now Nina had to dodge this huge sword that was being swung around all willy nilly. Noticing that it was coming down quickly, and the utter size of it, Nina had absolutely no time to react at all.

Moving to the side as quickly as she possibly could, she attempted to turn her body before it could land, but it was too late. Nina had a huge gash going down her entire arm, leaving blood leaking from it. The blood was shooting out quickly, and this wasn't something that she could just ignore, her arm would be out of commission for the rest of the battle, and that was more than just an understatement.

While she was there dealing with blood loss and the almost losing an arm, laying on the ground holding in all of her yelling and screaming while trying to rip her cloak and wrap her arms in multiple different locations, Mitsunara would be dealing with a different type of attack, a more psychological one. Nina would fiddle with the genjutsu a bit so that, instead of seeing leaves, Mitsunara would see a gust of sand flying around her like a small tornado surrounded her. And from there, she would be there to live out her worst nightmare. If it was something obvious, it'd be much easier to break out. But her hope was that she couldn't break out before the temporary psychological damage took the girl down.* - Sat Nov 14 06:58:59 2015
