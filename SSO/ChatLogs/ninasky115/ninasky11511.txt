<br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) grabbed the raccoon and lightly placed him on the ground, pushing him a bit towards Kilm. "Go and ask him."* - Sun Nov  1 13:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) sighed as she reached up and put him in the ground again, she was in the eternal bad mood now. Being ignored wasn't fun at all, much no fun. She'd pat him on the butt and push him forward again.* - Sun Nov  1 13:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) frowned as she was being massaged. She was still sad that she was getting ignored, but it was getting a little bit better. Spinning around, she'd rub the raccoon lightly, but she still had that sad expression on her face.* - Sun Nov  1 13:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Wow theres a lot of racoons out. - Sun Nov  1 13:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked over at the giant raccoon that sat by her, making her feel like she were just a baby dwarf. Sighing, she'd stand up a little bit, pretty much out of boredom once again. Looking around, she'd find Kilm. "Hey Kilm, can we spar or something? I need something to do."* - Sun Nov  1 13:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) sighed and sat on the ground. "Thanks." With that being said, she'd pull out her sword and just move her sword around in the sand.* - Sun Nov  1 13:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) thinks: When I wanna have fun, they want to talk about training. When I want to train, they want to sit around and talk. Awesome.... - Sun Nov  1 13:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) blinked as she looked up at Chikyu, before sighing and looking back down at her sword and continuing to play with it in the sand. "It's fine, you were busy." After saying that, she'd look back down at the ground and continue playing with said sand and said sword.* - Sun Nov  1 13:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked up at her and smiled, slowly standing up from the sand and sheathing her katana back into its hilt. "Okay. What do you want to do?" She'd smile and look over at her, wondering what they'd do.* - Sun Nov  1 13:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) smiled and nodded again, taking a few steps back. "Okay, lets have fun with swords!" She'd smile and wave her sword around again, simply having fun with it until things got started.* - Sun Nov  1 13:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) turned to look at Chikyu and realized that she had to get back to her real self, the self that everyone always saw and lock up her childhood as she usually did. Nodding lightly as a sign of respect, she'd unsheath her blade without any real form. She simply chose not to use the Kendo form, she was just used to flowing the way she flowed, and the kendo form kind of didn't allow her to do that. Mom had taught her how to hold a blade, but she wanted to do it her own way.

Moving forward quickly, she'd grip the blade with two hands by the hilt before pulling it up slightly. She'd bring it crashing down, aiming to slash through the girl if this had been a real battle. Otherwise, she would be able to see the blunt end of the sword, showing that she weren't trying to injure unless Chikyu decided to first. And, this attack was also to have a sort of face to face clash, just to see if each other were serious. She, of course, would hold great proficiency in kenjutsu, which might not have been expected due to her playing around.* - Sun Nov  1 14:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) felt her body being pushed back, her eyes quickly locking on to the large blade that was being swung towards her, aiming to connect with her shoulder. Ducking down quickly, Nina would quickly turn her blade around now that she's able to control how much damage she did with this one attack. Swinging it to the side, she'd connect with Chikyu's leg before stopping it quickly, and then pulling it back just to give her a cut instead of taking off her leg.* - Sun Nov  1 14:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) turned her head to the side as she quickly jumped up. Stabbing her blade into the ground, Nina would quickly flip upside down, using just one hand to keep her balanced into the air. As the large blade collided with hers, Nina would put all of her strength into keeping the blade still, her blade stopping the girls with just a bit of resistance. Looking over at Chikyu, she'd grin a little.

"I told you I was good with a sword!"* - Sun Nov  1 14:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked at her as her hand reared back. Upon instinct, she'd lower her arm on the sword, before quickly shooting up into the sky. The hand would hit nothing but air, and Nina would begin landing just behind the girl. But, this wouldn't be without a single jutsu. Clapping her hands together, she'd allow her chakra to surge around Chikyu, a small tornado forming around her to scare her a bit. This wasn't anything that could damage her, but it was just to see how she'd react.* - Sun Nov  1 14:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked at her as she seemed to add dust into the rotation. She wasn't sure how that'd help the girl at all, but she apparently thought that it would. Without any other thought, she'd clap her hands together before moving through the handseals, keeping the tornado up just long enough for Chikyu to be blinded by the attack. Moving forward now, she'd allow her chakra to be sent forward.

The mud would seem to come out of nowhere but the ground, rushing over the girl and attempting to lock her in the gooeyness. If it hit, she'd most likely be immobilized, hopefully from the waist down.* - Sun Nov  1 14:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I think I'm going. - Sun Nov  1 15:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Got nothing to do. - Sun Nov  1 15:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll see you later. - Sun Nov  1 15:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) noticed the girl as she tried to dynamic entry through the tornado. Her foot would make it through, but after that the force would simply blow her away. Shaking her up and spinning her, she'd lose control of which way was which, making her dizzy as she spun around and was eventually thrown out of the tornado. And, of course, into the mud that would drag her away and immobilize her with its sticky earth substances.* - Sun Nov  1 15:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hehe, looks like I win.~ - Sun Nov  1 15:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) walks forward and allows the earth to crumble down around her. Nina would reach forward to grab her katana, and then to help up Chikyu.* - Sun Nov  1 15:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hehe. You'll get better. - Sun Nov  1 15:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Just like I need to. - Sun Nov  1 15:32:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) cut her eyes over towards Ortho, following after him and showing the most blatant obvious hatred for him at that moment.* - Sun Nov  1 15:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Here we are. - Sun Nov  1 16:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: The house I told you about, this is it. - Sun Nov  1 16:01:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Maybe something else. - Sun Nov  1 16:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Are you hungry? Want something to eat? - Sun Nov  1 16:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I can eat a few dumplings. - Sun Nov  1 16:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Consider it done, baby sis'. - Sun Nov  1 16:08:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: So.. I, uhh.. talked wth Index. - Sun Nov  1 16:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) just sat there swinging her feet, waiting for the food to come out. "Of course you did. Tell him not to hang out around me or something?"* - Sun Nov  1 16:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) crossed her arms as she looked at Ortho. "I never said you were the bad guy. You're just never around. I don't expect how you want me to act when you're not around through my childhood. It's all locked up in a box." After she said that, she'd look at the waiter and smile, waiting to dive into those dumplings the moment it was placed on the table.* - Sun Nov  1 16:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) simply shrugged and went down into her dumplings. "We'll see." This of course was just a ploy to get back at him for always leaving her. She loved him and always would. But he didn't know that, it was all apart of the plan.* - Sun Nov  1 16:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Yeah, my favorite drink. Hopefully you still remember that - Sun Nov  1 16:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: .....Apple juice, Ortho. - Sun Nov  1 16:33:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I just tried meditating. - Sun Nov  1 16:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That whole 'life on the line' thing ain't working for me. - Sun Nov  1 16:43:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Accepting myself, blah blah. - Sun Nov  1 16:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: All that good stuff. - Sun Nov  1 16:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Do you want to try again? - Sun Nov  1 16:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I want to see you achieve it before I do. - Sun Nov  1 16:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Well, lets try it together. - Sun Nov  1 16:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: How will you protect me if I get it first anyway? - Sun Nov  1 16:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I don't think the eyes would make much a difference. - Sun Nov  1 16:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: When it comes to me protecting you. - Sun Nov  1 16:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Well, if she only told us about them, wouldn't they have to be pretty strong...? - Sun Nov  1 16:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: But if you don't want to try, that's fine too. - Sun Nov  1 16:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll try, but I just want to assure that you get it first. - Sun Nov  1 16:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No matter what. - Sun Nov  1 16:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: So you do want to try it? - Sun Nov  1 16:53:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Where do you want to go? - Sun Nov  1 16:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Well, maybe somewhere calm. - Sun Nov  1 16:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Calm? In this world? - Sun Nov  1 16:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Have any place in mind? - Sun Nov  1 16:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: How about a waterfall? - Sun Nov  1 16:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Would that help? - Sun Nov  1 16:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmm, a waterfall.. - Sun Nov  1 16:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Where am I going to find a waterfall outside of Kirigakure..? - Sun Nov  1 16:58:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: So how do we do this? - Sun Nov  1 17:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Well, Marrisa said something about being at peace with yourself.. - Sun Nov  1 17:09:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: And not seeing death as something to avoid, but accept it. - Sun Nov  1 17:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: What do you mean? How would we do that through meditation? - Sun Nov  1 17:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I.. don't know. - Sun Nov  1 17:13:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ... - Sun Nov  1 17:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) nodded and sat on her butt, letting the chakra flow through her butt and legs so that she doesn't sink down into the water. "So all I do is meditate?"* - Sun Nov  1 17:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Mhm. - Sun Nov  1 17:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: You can't tell me how to....accept myself or something? - Sun Nov  1 17:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Realize who you are, what your goal are.. - Sun Nov  1 17:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: And just.. accept it. - Sun Nov  1 17:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I see..... - Sun Nov  1 17:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: It might take a while. - Sun Nov  1 17:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Take as long as you need. - Sun Nov  1 17:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll be here by your side through it all. - Sun Nov  1 17:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) sighed deeply as she sat down on the water, her legs crossing and her chakra flowing over the water to keep her afloat. Looking over at Ortho, she'd nod, gratefully, before sighing once more. She'd inhale deeply and, almost instantly, loose sight of the real work in front of her. It was as if she were sucked into her mental capacity, as if the outside world didn't exist. The waterfall helped keep her calm in the background, and it was slightly something to focus on outside of just what was going on at hand.

As she seemed to open her eyes in her subconcious, she'd stand up slowly, wondering what this was. It had to be inside of her body, inside of her mind, but what exactly was it? There was no name for it that came to her mind other than a void. Walking forward slowly and focused, there seemed to be....small floating circles that contained something. It seemed to be her worst traits, the things that she had hated the most about her life. Was it truely that easy to get to the fears and hatred inside of yourself rather than the good?

It seemed that this was simply a way to organize and access these hateful things, it was nothing more that she could do about them. This Nina in her own subconcious would seem to have to deal with all of these problems with their own interpretations. The first thing that she saw was, a young Nina coming out of the darkness. That's right, another Nina, a much younger Nina. Surrounding that Nina, was a group of adults talking quickly, minding their own business. It seemed that none of them wanted anything to do with Nina, other than the occational glance at her and lollipop to shut her up. The way Nina interpreted it, even though it seemed so long for her to get it, was her being young. An easier and easy solution, a temporary problem that she had anyway. It wasn't the youth that she hated, however. It was how she was treated by all of the people that were much older than her.

Nina honestly believed what was going on at the moment too. Even if she hadn't unleashed these mystical red eyes that Marrisa had from doing this, it was dealing with her problems, making her life much easier and controllable. The small Nina and the group of people seemed to simply wisp away, as if they weren't ever there. Hopefully that was a sign that she had delt with it for good, and that it wouldn't bother her much anymore. -Hopefully.- Next that came up, was Nina once again. This time, she seemed super buff and toned, very muscley. She seemed that she also had great chakra control, and great ninjutsu, kage clothing to show that she had become very powerful and everything else. And then, there were the people behind her. Ortho, Marrisa, Kilm, Lera and Violet, all of the people close to her.

In front of her was an army, what seemed like an endless army. No matter how hard Nina fought and ripped through the group, one of her loved onces always dropped in the battle in front of her. Nina had tears streaming down her face, though this was in her subconcious. "No!" She yelled at the top of her lungs, watching as the buffed out Nina fought these hundreds of ninja, and watched as the group never ended. The part that hurt her the most, even though she fought harder and harder than any of the shinobi, there were always a group of shinobi that slipped past and managed to kill one of her friends. This was an internal fear of hers for the longest of times, this was why she had been craving power.

"They won't die! Not around me! I won't allow it!" Nina seemed to watch behind a locked door as the stronger, kage'd out Nina fought through the large group of shinobi and kunoichi, ripping through plenty. It seemed one had darted through -everything- though. Friend and foe, right past Nina, and it seemed that she was going towards Lera and Violet, two swords going towards both of their throats. At the top of her lungs, Nina yelled, shattering the illusion that was going on in front of her. She fell to the ground, tears running down her face both in her subconcious and in real life, due to how strong the belief of this was. "I-I......" She seemed to stumble a bit, not accepting this one as easily as she accepted the age thing. She could always grow out of age, but this was a nightmare of hers since she'd become a kunoichi.

"I...Won't lose them....I'll be strong enough..." Just then, her mind began flooding her with doubt. Whispers saying, "...can't save them.....all die eventually..........doesnt matter." Accompanied by these whispers would be groups of people surrounding her, laughing at her. "Does she really think that she can save anyone with just power?" "I admire her for trying, but lets be honest here." It seemed that all around her was doubt, which Nina didn't want to accept at all, she couldn't accept. Not that easily. After what seemed like hours, days in her subconcious of the whispers and the laughter, she'd finally cracked. "Fine, FINE! I can't.....save them all. Not with just power, not on my own...." After she finally admitted this to herself, the issue seemed to wisp way as well, and Nina allowed more tears to shoot out of her eyes. But this didn't mean that Nina wouldn't try to save them. But it would make her take her time in life and not focus on the power.

The final obstacle was the one that was the hardest yet most truthful one of all. The one Marrisa had to go through with before finally getting those mystical red eyes. At this point, however, Nina didn't care if this had unlocked her those red eyes. This was something that seemed to make her life easier, and something that she would definitely do again after this, with those red eyes or not. But back to the point. As she looked at the next 'vision', or whatever you'd call it. She'd see that Nina was simply walking. A lot of her flaws were extremely self-centered it seemed. Another thing that she had found out about herself, whether it was for the positive or the negative. Anyway, it seemed that Nina had gotten shot by a powerful jutsu, which made her body lurch forward in pain, and after that pain was.....nothing.

The vision Nina would simply stop moving. No chest rising, no movemens, nothing to signify that she was still alive. "I-Is that....me...? Dead!?" She couldn't believe it. It was just not something that she could accept that quickly. Especially not this early in life! It wasn't real, it could never be real! There's no way that she could be dying at all! She ran up to the Nina that seemed to be dead, throwing a hand forward to shake the female. "Wake up! Wake up already!" As she said that, she'd continue pushing and shoving the fake Nina to life, not accepting the fact that she could have died at such a young age. Or even died at all! She had been doing so good with her life!

After a while of trying to rouse up the girl, Nina would sniffle hard and wipe her face of her tears. There was nothing that she could do at this point. She......had to accept the death of her fake self, and in doing that accept the death that was inevitable to come to her. Nina shook her head for hours, not wanting to accept it, but it had to be accepted. Nina was going to die. Maybe not now, maybe not later, but she was for sure going to die. It was simply how people were made, they had to die. And she was in that group that had to die as well. Nina groaned and wiped her face once more, tears seeming to form there against her will. She had to say it to herself, but the words seemed choked up in her subconcious. It seemed that they weren't going to come out at all. "Y-You're....going t-to die.....Nina. Not now! But, it w-will happen.....eventually....." Nina yelled and slapped herself, this was a major internal conflict. It was the truth and she had accepted it, but she hated that it was the truth.

Shaking her head, the vision Nina would finally wisp away, Nina had accepted these two huge flaws in her life that was holding her back from being a good kunoichi and accepting a nice life as a young girl. These two major flaws and one minor flaw that she -needed- to get over either way. But it seemed that there was one more vision. There was yet another Nina that had moved in, and beside her was Ortho and....some other guy. It seemed that it could be a boyfriend, maybe a husband. They were all significantly older now. And the picture slowly yet surely grew more and more. Nina would be met by Lera and Violet, and then Kilm. And then two small children in front of her. Random strangers joined sooner or later as well, all of them simply drifting into the picture as if they had been there all along. Maybe this was her future, this was definitely positive. It showed her that with everything she had accepted, she could have a family. She could have friends, and lots of them, as well as kids and a husband, her mothers and her trainers. All of it.

Nina was definitely satisfied with her trip to the waterfall. It was something that she needed. When she finally opened her eyes, her real eyes, she would be greeted by the brightness of the sun and the terrain around her. She'd wipe her face, some tears making their way to the real Nina through the traumatic yet overall positive meditation. She'd turn to Ortho with the biggest, widdest of grins. * - Sun Nov  1 18:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) sighed as she closed her eyes once again. Crossing her legs to sit indian style, she decided that she would give this meditation thing another go. It wasn't exactly fun, but it was something that was very enjoyable. It made all of the bad things in her life not disappear, but much easier to swallow and swirl into her everyday life. Much, much easier. And she believed that the more she did it, the easier that she would live no matter what had happened. She was much more accepting when she was doing this act, and it was helpful. She believed that this was more helpful to anybody, no matter what their state was.

And so, she slowly began blocking out everybody and everything. Except maybe, the calming waterfall behind her. It was just a start. And then she flowed into everything that happened in her life, the things that were bothing her the most. She began going into flashbacks, it seemed. Her eyes remembering back to Heiwa, how he had said that she wasn't family after what they had been through together. It pained her to remember what he had said, honestly. It injured her heart more than anything she could remember before. However, it happened, and there was nothing she could do.

Acceptance was a must, and that's what she did. She accepted what had happened, embraced it, allowed it to become a part of her. There wasn't much else to it. She had to fight it a bit to keep herself from completely breaking, but she accepted it, allowed it to mould -into- her, rather than moulding her in its image. She was accepting a lot more in the past few hours than she had in her entire life. She simply continued to go through these flashbacks, as if she couldn't help but accept the better feeling that it gave her.

These flashbacks wouldn't end at Heiwa at all. She suddenly shot back to when Kenshin was on fire, coming in burning as if he were like a burning meteor from space itself. It was by far the most traumatic experience that she had went through. This showed her that she was absolutely, extremely weak. She couldn't help anyone except one person, and that was only because of the new jutsu that she had just learned. This was something that was even harder to swallow. Slowly, Nina would exhale and open her eyes, yet continued to allow her body to focus on everything around her while focusing on nothing at all.

After that, she'd sigh and begin taking in the world, everything seemed brighter now. She had still been reflecting back on her life, with Heiwa and Kenshin, all of the death that Kenshin had caused back at that place. It was.....something. But Nina, somehow, had found a way to.....not accept it entirely, but she was able to tolerate the idea of not being able to help anyone. Nina smiled once more as she turned around and looked at the waterfall, her movements now calm and collected. She wasn't in a rush anymore, this was the perfect time to settle down and slow down when it came to learning things. All of this meditating was extremely helpful, she would certainly continue doing it, in all different ways until she had found the perfect one that fit her, not anyone else.* - Mon Nov  2 03:56:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ivel(OmniKage) says: Ryoumen? - Tue Nov  3 02:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) nodded as she looked at Ortho, and then over to Trilliam and listening to what he was saying. Closing her eyes, she'd allow her chakra to flow throughout her body, grasping on to what she could only assume was her lightning chakra. After drawing it out, she'd smile at the two, and close her eyes again and bring her hands together into what could be noticed as the rat seal, her chakra seeming to flare up a bit more.

After a while, she'd allow it to surge outwards, letting the chakra flow over her body without any hesitation. It was quite a useful jutsu since it took no handseals, but Nina added in one just to focus her chakra on. As it flew over her body, she'd turn her head over towards Ortho, wondering if she'd done it correctly. Judging from the outcome and how she didn't get her body fried, she assumed that she did.* - Tue Nov  3 02:16:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Anywho. - Tue Nov  3 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: He had all killing ash bones - Tue Nov  3 03:32:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I finished your scroll. - Tue Nov  3 03:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) sighed and looked up at Kyubishu. She'd chuckle a little bit as she looked towards him, almost through him it seemed. She'd sigh a little bit, before pulling her hands up. She didn't know exactly how good this character was, since she had never seen him spar or anything at all. And so, she'd decide to take it extremely easy at first. From there, she'd look at Kyubishu as she made an extremely loud clap with her hands, simply from clapping.

From that clap, she would flow through handseals, her hands moving quickly at chest level, clearly in view for everyone, but her chakra only being focused on one person. This genjutsu wasn't anything special at all, but it was a genjutsu after all. She'd let off a small smirk as she stared at Kyubishu, wondering what his reaction would be to this handseal.* - Tue Nov  3 03:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Elon. - Tue Nov  3 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Hm? - Tue Nov  3 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: .  . - Tue Nov  3 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Do you buy any chance happen to know what happened to the body that was here? - Tue Nov  3 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: by* - Tue Nov  3 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Oh, I buried it where we normally do. - Tue Nov  3 03:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: .... - Tue Nov  3 03:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Hmm. - Tue Nov  3 03:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) simply grinned as she looked at Kyubishu. This was too easy. There hadn't even been any concern for her handseals, he simply walked past it and ignored it. Those handseals could've been anything at all, and if they had been a much deadlier jutsu that might've been bad for Kyubishu. But that wasn't the case this time, it was only a little baby genjutsu this time, but a quite effective one for psychological damage. And so, it would begin to creep into his brain, taking its place in his mind.

As for him walking forward and punching her, she would quickly raise up her arm to block the attack with her arm, taking the punch in the arm instead of her cheek at all. "Leaf gale!" She said this as she pushed chakra into her feet to jump back quickly and out of the way of any further attacks. And, as the genjutsu had set in, Kyubishi would realize that a swirl of leaves would begin to move around him, blinding him. And when these leaves disappeared, he would begin to see his worst nightmare. The leaf gale was just a cover, but what was it a cover for, exactly?* - Tue Nov  3 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) watched as the genjutsu landed or something. And so from there, she'd move forward. Doing a single handseal, she'd allow two clones to appear on both sides of her, which would quickly aim on jumping on the boy that she was sparring. As they ran towards him, they'd quickly jump on him and simply explode into mud, which would quickly harden and aim to immobilize him. If it worked, she'd grin and look at him, crossing her arms. "Too easy, hehe."* - Tue Nov  3 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Wow, that was really easy.~ - Tue Nov  3 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I thought you'd be a bit more of a challange. - Tue Nov  3 04:08:44 2015
