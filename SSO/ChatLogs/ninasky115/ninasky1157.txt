<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) smiled and allows her hand to get grabbed, aiming to skip away with Lulu..* - Sat Oct 24 00:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Okay.~ - Sat Oct 24 00:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lulu(Reesespuffs) says: Here we are~ - Sat Oct 24 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Cool.~ - Sat Oct 24 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: So....... - Sat Oct 24 00:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lulu(Reesespuffs) says: Hmm - Sat Oct 24 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked at Lulu as she hopped into the water lightly. Laughing a little, she'd take off her shirt, looking at her the entire time. "So lame.~ Let me show you how it's done!"

Without any hesitation, she'd pull down her pants and take a step back, leaving her sandals underneath the pile of clothes before turning and walking away. After that, she'd spin around and begin running forward at full speed, pushing chakra into her feet as she jumped. She'd simply fly high into the air, doing a single flip before looking down again.

"Look out below!" She'd yell this as she started falling towards the water, tucking her knees in her chest as she fell into a cannonball, letting the warm water shoot outwards.* - Sat Oct 24 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) watched her run full speed, wondering if she should be just a tad bit mean. However, she decided not to do that. As the girl came in with a big bellyflop, she'd raise her hands up over her face as it splashes all over the place, deciding to inhale a large breath and fall back down into the warm water. She was like a shark!* - Sat Oct 24 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) smiled from underwater and swam up, popping up right in front of her. "Rawr.~" This wasn't to scare her at all, though. The rawr was more said than done, just to show the girl where she had went.* - Sat Oct 24 01:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) felt as she was suddenly lifted into the air, not knowing what was going on at first but suddenly catching on, and reacting quickly to it. As she was leaned back, she'd smile a little bit, deciding to cheat and have a bit more practice while having fun. Clapping her hands together, she'd allow her chakra to flow beneath where she would've fell.

Instead, a tornado would suddenly flare up, picking up a bit of water that Nina would fall into instead of falling hard into the water beneath her. As she hit the tornado, she'd allow herself to be pushed down lightly into the water, giggling as she looked at Lulu. "Hey, what kind of elements do you have? I'm curious."* - Sat Oct 24 01:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Haha, I can use fire and wind.! - Sat Oct 24 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: But I might learn another one from mom. - Sat Oct 24 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lulu(Reesespuffs) says: Must be cool. - Sat Oct 24 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Aww, don't feel bad. - Sat Oct 24 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: You can learn another one. - Sat Oct 24 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) blinked as she felt the hand planted on her hips, assuming it wasn't anything more than a friendly touch since she hadn't ever had a date or even a kiss.

"Mhm, plenty of time.~ It'll be fun to spar you one day."* - Sat Oct 24 01:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) 's eyes widened as she was pulled even closer and kissed on the lips. She was taken by surprised, her first kiss being taken in a hot tub without even permission. It felt good, causing her cheeks to turn red as she pulled back slowly, hopefully not offensively.* - Sat Oct 24 01:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Thanks...... - Sat Oct 24 01:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lulu(Reesespuffs) says: Want to kiss me back? - Sat Oct 24 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Umm, I don't know.... - Sat Oct 24 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lulu(Reesespuffs) says: Its okay. - Sat Oct 24 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lulu(Reesespuffs) says: Just relax and give it a try. - Sat Oct 24 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Alright then.... - Sat Oct 24 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lulu(Reesespuffs) says: Go ahead. - Sat Oct 24 01:53:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: So I'll take that as a no. - Sat Oct 24 04:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) ran up to him and threw her arms around him, not seeing him in she didn't know how long. "I missed you so much! How's the family?" She just continued to hold him and keep him close.* - Sat Oct 24 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Nvm - Sat Oct 24 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) kept her hugging posture over him, standing up and moving back a bit to look at him. She kept a smile on her face, though it was much smaller and less happy. "Well.....you can join me. I got a family now too, and I still need my best friend and brother around." She'd take a step back and smile at him, hoping that he would join.* - Sat Oct 24 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: I'm his daddy now.  - Sat Oct 24 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) thinks: Why I feel like he can see my ass crack from where he standing? - Sat Oct 24 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) thinks: I can see his ass crack. - Sat Oct 24 05:15:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Understood. - Sat Oct 24 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: I'll watch these bastards. - Sat Oct 24 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Pun intended. - Sat Oct 24 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) thinks: In all seriousness... The child has seen a lot. - Sat Oct 24 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) thinks: I do think he is fostering hatred. - Sat Oct 24 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) thinks: I'll have to watch him. - Sat Oct 24 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: Yo Daisuke. - Sat Oct 24 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: If I headbutted you. - Sat Oct 24 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: Ho- - Sat Oct 24 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) blinked a little bit, he had changed a little bit from the last time that she had seen him, but that didn't matter. She'd look down at him, staring into his eyes, before placing a single hand upon his shoulder. "Come on Heiwa, I want you to join me. You're my original family, the only one I have. We have to stay together."

On top of that, he was her first friend, the closest thing she had to one at that.* - Sat Oct 24 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: -omit- - Sat Oct 24 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) heard the words rattle through her skull, her arm falling limp to her side. She felt a loss for words, her eyes blinking as if trying to hold back the tears, before it suddenly came rushing down her face. "B-But......" She looked down at the ground, as if she were at a loss for words. She gripped her fists together tightly, looking up at Heiwa once again.

"I am your family. We're family, Heiwa. Whether you like it or not, I'm your family and I'm never dying, no matter what." She lifted her hands and wiped her face a little with her sleeve, taking a step forward. "You can hate me all that you want, or avoid me, but we will always be family. And so will Hideki and the others!"* - Sat Oct 24 05:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Nina... - Sat Oct 24 05:34:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) sighed deeply and crouched down, sitting back on her butt and simply crawling up into a little ball.* - Sat Oct 24 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: .... - Sat Oct 24 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Nina are you ok? - Sat Oct 24 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked up as she heard Violet speaking, tears still streaming down her eyes. Standing up, she'd walk forward, looking down at her waists. "Let me have one of those please. I want to get back to training right away."* - Sat Oct 24 05:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: ... - Sat Oct 24 05:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) grabbed the blade and pulled the hilt down to her waist, clipping it on so that it didn't fall off. "Thanks." After saying that, she'd turn and begin walking off.* - Sat Oct 24 05:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I think I'm leaving.... - Sat Oct 24 05:57:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: You're a great warrior. - Sat Oct 24 06:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) blinked a little as she looked at them, her eyes moving through the group as if looking for someone. It had been clear that she was crying just before she had come here. Spinning around, she'd begin walking to the training field, wondering if anyone had recognized her.* - Sat Oct 24 06:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: That must mean thank you... - Sat Oct 24 06:21:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) spun around at the voice that she had heard, remembering back to the man who had trained her for a bit, even though it wasn't anything but sparring a few clones. "Hey." As she said that, she'd stop walking and spin around, waiting for Jiki to continue walking up to her until they got into range enough to talk. "Look, I'm here to find Mister Fuji and Marrisa. I'm trying to train as hard as possible for as long as possible." She had a flashback to just a few moments ago, it seemed. Shaking her head, she'd look up at Jiki again and nod, showing that she was done talking.* - Sat Oct 24 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Tetsumi... i have a quick message to give you - Sat Oct 24 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) nodded, and looked back behind him towards the square, not at it but in its general direction. After that, she'd begin walking back towards it.* - Sat Oct 24 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: You passed down the scrolls you got from Fuji. - Sat Oct 24 06:43:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: Nina? - Sat Oct 24 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked up at Marrisa, her eyes almost focused on nobody but the girl in question. Pulling up her hands, she'd clap them together, her chakra shooting over towards Nalenth. As a tornado formed around Marrisa, Nina would duck down and rush forward as quickly as she could, one of her hands thrown back to place a hand on her hilt. She was prepared for anything. And, of course, she expected Marrisa to dispel the tornado entirely, which would give her a nice little surprise.* - Sat Oct 24 06:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: Who are all of these people?? - Sat Oct 24 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) watched as the girl had suddenly moved away from the area in question, sighing as she allowed a hand to release from her hilt. She would stop all movement before turning to look around the area, finally spotting Marrisa. Her face showed no emotion at the moment, at least none that would be positive. The people that really knew her face could probably get that of anger and betrayal from her expression.

"Well, you wanted me to show you my skills. Skills aren't just what I can do, it's how I can put them together in battle, right?" She'd tilt her head slightly to the side while looking at her, moving her eyes up and down over the girls figure.* - Sat Oct 24 07:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *sigh* - Sat Oct 24 07:19:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) turned her face towards Lera, and blinked, wondering why they followed her here. "Yeah, I'm training. And waiting for someone." After saying that, she'd begin walking towards the, looking up at their faces with her own.* - Sat Oct 24 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Yeah I did. - Sat Oct 24 07:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: .... - Sat Oct 24 07:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) turned her head towards Violet, showing no emotion still except the ones of hurt that had been shown before. She'd move forward and wrap her arms around her neck, embracing her tightly before letting her go. "I'll be fine. I need to get stronger already, and quick." Turning her head towards Ortho, she'd notice that he was training once again, never having enough time for her either way. Though she was pretty used to it, and didn't pay it any mind. Turning back to her family, she'd look between them, waiting for the next question.* - Sat Oct 24 07:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: What if you got hurt Nina? Do you know how sad we would be? - Sat Oct 24 07:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Everyone gets hurt by someone close to them. That's why I'm getting stronger, so that I won't lose anyone else. - Sat Oct 24 07:29:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) spun around to look at Ortho, taking the bag of yen that was thrown at her. She'd raise her hand to grab it, the situation suddenly awkward. "So....uhhh. Ortho, these are my parents, my mothers. Mothers, this is Ortho, my blood brother."* - Sat Oct 24 07:40:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) spun around and grabbed the hilt of her blade, her eyes looking off at her parents. "You two ready?"* - Sat Oct 24 07:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: How do I even know they're truly not moochers..? - Sat Oct 24 08:00:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked at the two, and then turned her head over towards Lera. She noticed that Lera wasn't getting involved, so then it'd be a two against one and that was just unfair. Without any words, she'd push chakra into her feet as she backflipped over the mud, landing on her feet, and then dropping to her butt in one movement. Sighing, she'd simply watch the outcome.* - Sat Oct 24 08:18:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked up at the five clones that were coming towards her. Moving without hesitation, it seems, she'd reach to the side and unsheath her katana that she had gotten from Violet. Maybe Ortho would notice her new skill in swordsplay. Taking her information on the clones that she had fought before, they would either be extremely hard to disperse like Lera when she had used that jutsu, or they'd aim to restrain her like Jiki's clones had.

With the katana, she'd move forward, allowing her chakra to flow over it. With one hand, she'd quickly slash forward into the first one, aiming to take its head off, before continuing to move and slash through the next. Her goal was to continue moving, making sure that she couldn't get surrounded. After a while, she'd suddenly push chakra into her feet to jump out of the area, noticing what damage she had done to the clones.* - Sat Oct 24 08:47:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) nodded at Saeza, then turned and began walking towards the training field. Something was definitely off about her if anyone had known how she used to be.* - Sat Oct 24 15:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hmm, no thank you. You may start.~ - Sat Oct 24 15:51:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: How interesting - Sat Oct 24 15:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked at the two clones that were coming towards her. Unsheathing her katana quickly, she'd look between the two before going forward, her katana held with both hands. Aiming for the one that attempted to attack high, she'd simply swing her katana powerfully and with aim, her intent to decapitate the clone completely, or at least go through it to make it disperse entirely.

As for the clone on the ground, she'd feel the sweep knocking her off balance, stabbing her blade into the ground and using one hand to balance herself on to it for a few seconds, just long enough that she didn't fall face-first into the dirt, and long enough that she could get her feet underneath her.* - Sat Oct 24 15:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: The one with the strange abilities over the minds of others - Sat Oct 24 15:59:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) thinks: Oh fuck the hell yes....A Kenjutsu user.... - Sat Oct 24 15:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) says: Not exactly lacking. - Sat Oct 24 15:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) says: I simply want to add to it. - Sat Oct 24 16:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) turned her head towards Saeza, her eyes straining to even see the female as she moved. Though, she did see the three swords that the woman had equip, and that was too much for her to deal with. Pushing chakra into her feet, she'd quickly jump backwards at a fast pace, the suimen meaning to propel her back quicker and farther.

Sheathing her blade quickly, she'd clap her hands together and begin flowing through handseals, her eyes focused on Saeza as she continued to move forward. She hadn't used this jutsu much, but she could only hope that this jutsu could land, it was a pretty good jutsu to say the least.* - Sat Oct 24 16:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) thinks that she had placed her jutsu well in the series of the spar. Since Saeza began to backflip to dodge an attack that wasn't physical at all. And thus, her plan was set in motion, at least the one that she had began forming just then, anyway. She had to think on the fly for the most part.

Clapping her hands together, she'd allow a tornado to spawn quickly, this was aiming to block the girls view and, over all, make the jutsu more believable. But at the same time, it seemed to be a jutsu set-up for yet another combo that she could use against the girl. If she was paying attention, she would also notice that there were slight amounts of leaves in the tornado, as well as sand and dirt that would come from the actual tornado.

Turning her head to meet the clone, her eyes would widen, She was so focused on the real one and landing a combo, that she had completely forgotten about the clone that had turned into a burst of bats. It seemed very useful in battle, and she wondered if she could use it. However, this wasn't the time to ask about that. She'd take the blunt end of the attack in the shoulder, holding in a yelp as she tried to quickly throw a punch at its chest to disperse it or at least push it back a small bit.* - Sat Oct 24 16:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) felt the kick to her chin, her teeth gritting and her eyes closing with pain as she flew up into the air. She wasn't going to lose, she couldn't, she had to get stronger to protect her family, to win over the family that she had lost for some reason. She wasn't going to accept a loss, and especially not to a damn clone.

Gritting her teeth tightly, she'd feel the kicks smashing against her body, each one causing more pain then the last. She couldn't allow that to happen, not even a little bit. So, in her barrage of being smacked into, she focused her chakra into her arm, a small spark being the only indicator that something was going to happen. And this was meant to be a surprise attack since she did no handseals at all.

As another kick came her way, she'd throw her arm up quickly, three fireballs shooting out out of nowhere, aiming to smash into the clone and explode, dispersing it and doing a small amount of damage to herself since she was such a close range. While falling from the air, she'd do a simple spin and land on the ground hard, her arm a bit burnt from where the explosion had done damage to her. It seemed that she was struggling to fight and fighting back tears, but she was still standing.* - Sat Oct 24 16:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) noticed the wind forming around her, the tornado blocking her sight slightly. She'd shake her head a little before clapping her hands together, before flowing through a quick flash of handseals. After completing these handseals, she'd force her hands forward powerfully, allowing her chakra to suddenly surge and shoot forward.

The wind would most likely disperse the tornado as well, and even blow Saeza back quite a ways back, the power of it being pretty strong. If she allowed the fire run jutsu to be released, it might be quite painful to Saeza's legs since she was aiming to simply redirect it back at her.* - Sat Oct 24 16:37:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) turned her head over to Sanoke, looking up at him. Crossing her arms, she'd stare at him for a while, inspecting him it seems. "Are you strong? If you're strong, I want to fight you."* - Sun Oct 25 14:42:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked forward at him, before dashing forward towards him in no time at all. Without any words, she'd pull her arms up to her chest as she got closer, before sliding to a stop in front of him and throwing a powerful punch towards his chest. This was just to get him moving, get something to happen. But the punch did show potential in her taijutsu skill.* - Sun Oct 25 14:57:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) felt the attack hit her arm, and tried to use it as a bonus to her. As her arm was pushed, she'd allow her body to flow with the attack. Throwing her body in the opposite direction of the push, her foot would come up quickly, her leg going high enough to kick him hard in the head, that was her intent. Though, if that didn't work, she'd simply be pushed back from the attack.* - Sun Oct 25 15:09:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) felt her arm getting grabbed, her body suddenly moving through the air as she was spun. "Hnng." She didn't want to admit how much stronger he was, there was no way she would do that. Especially not if it risked her losing family because she wasn't strong enough. As she was thrown against the ground, she'd struggle to pull her hands up, but after they were, they'd be thrown together in a flash.

Moving through the seals as she flew, she'd allow her chakra to begin converting in her stomach, her eyes locking onto Sanoke. Throwing her feet up, she'd allow her body to quickly roll backwards until she was stable enough to stand, and after she did stand, she'd quickly throw her head forward with pursed lips and shooting forward a giant, yet slow, fireball towards him.* - Sun Oct 25 15:23:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked over at the large amount of water that suddenly appeared out of nowhere. Knowing that she couldn't do anything about it, she'd quickly jump up into the air, using her suimen to keep her up in the air long enough. And the plus to that, if she fell to the ground, she'd land on top of the water instead of being washed away. 

Looking up to Kilm, she'd clap her hands together, allowing her handseals to flow quick, but not as quick as Kilm at all. Allowing the large fireball to shoot forward, she'd let loose the slow fireball to flow through the air, but it was going towards Kilm quickly and without wavering.* - Sun Oct 25 16:58:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked up at the giant raccoon, pulling her hands up quickly. She was already in the process of doing handseals, so that made it much easier for her. Without any hesitation, she'd wait for the perfect moment, and as soon as that tail went up and pointed at her, it was the perfect moment right there. She'd throw both of her hands forward and, of course they'd know what comes next.

A sudden burst of wind, chakra, and power would rush forward in a great burst, aiming to attack the raccoon with his own technique, and hopefully doing more damage than she could do on her own. Whatever the outcome would be, she'd slowly float down to the water, her eyes peeled just incase she would notice a lightning technique. It was rare, but she knew it existed.* - Sun Oct 25 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) felt herself being suddenly restricted, unable to move. The kunai was placed to her neck, causing her to suddenly freeze. "Damnit, I give..."* - Sun Oct 25 17:25:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Summoning? - Sun Oct 25 17:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You gotta be pretty prepared to learn how to summon. - Sun Oct 25 17:57:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You know Hideki is dead right? - Sun Oct 25 18:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I didn't know that. - Sun Oct 25 18:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: But for some reason, I'm not surprised. - Sun Oct 25 18:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see... - Sun Oct 25 18:02:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I'll work on strengthing my taijutsu, I can't be useless on the field as a medic. - Sun Oct 25 18:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Sun Oct 25 18:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well me and Nina are going then. - Sun Oct 25 18:06:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So. - Sun Oct 25 18:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Are you looking to specifically sign a contract for Raccoon summons or do you want to know how to find an animal with a contract offering? - Sun Oct 25 18:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I want to find an animal. - Sun Oct 25 18:07:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: The way I found the raccoons was by wandering the forest and helping them out. - Sun Oct 25 18:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: They then offered me a contract for helping them out which I signed. - Sun Oct 25 18:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I see. So then you can't really teach me how to do it? - Sun Oct 25 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Not really, I can only give you a contract to get raccoons. - Sun Oct 25 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I see...... - Sun Oct 25 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If you want raccoons that is. - Sun Oct 25 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: That's the only way to get one? - Sun Oct 25 18:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Right so, What else kind of training do you want today? - Sun Oct 25 18:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yeah. - Sun Oct 25 18:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Signing a contract is the only way. - Sun Oct 25 18:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: What happens if you try to summon one without a contract? - Sun Oct 25 18:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You can't summon one at all without a contract. - Sun Oct 25 18:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It just won't work. - Sun Oct 25 18:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I see. - Sun Oct 25 18:14:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I'll let you decide, you're the teacher. - Sun Oct 25 18:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I don't really know what you need training in. - Sun Oct 25 18:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So you choose what you want. - Sun Oct 25 18:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I can teach four elements at the moment since I'm still in the process of learning wind release. - Sun Oct 25 18:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I can teach genjutsu as well. - Sun Oct 25 18:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Well, I know wind release the best, so I suppose another element would be helpful. - Sun Oct 25 18:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: What other elements do you have? - Sun Oct 25 18:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I know wind and fire, that's about it. - Sun Oct 25 18:18:14 2015
