<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Does the village yet have a police force? - Tue Nov  3 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: This area should be blocked off for a few days. To see if clues can be gathered. - Tue Nov  3 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No. She wasn't able to decide rankings or the like before the death. - Tue Nov  3 07:05:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: To be able to do this while the village is on high alert means it was a very proficient shinobi. - Tue Nov  3 07:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Or someone that Kirie trusted. - Tue Nov  3 07:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Well then. . . You are a young shinobi of the village, yes? - Tue Nov  3 07:08:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: . . .It isn't hard. Also, have the men that guard the exits screen anyone that seeks to leave. The murderer could very well be taking an escape. - Tue Nov  3 07:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Screen them for what? - Tue Nov  3 07:09:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It can. Kirie wouldn't die that way. - Tue Nov  3 07:11:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..... - Tue Nov  3 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Ortho. Stop. - Tue Nov  3 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Now. - Tue Nov  3 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: No one. - Tue Nov  3 07:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: The village has yet to recover from the tragedy. . . - Tue Nov  3 07:12:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: To decide on decisions.. - Tue Nov  3 07:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Is it really expected for us to? It's been only a little bit.. - Tue Nov  3 07:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Those two. Scum. Both of them. - Tue Nov  3 07:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked at Ortho in anger, anger that she had never felt for him in his entire life. She'd take a step forward before speaking. "Ortho, bring your ass back here and stop acting like a jackass to Kirigakure. Show some damn respect." It seemed that she was extremely serious about this, and especially since it took someone close to her.* - Tue Nov  3 07:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Now now. . . - Tue Nov  3 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: I assume. . . An intelligent man such as yourself. - Tue Nov  3 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Woudl realize the suspicion that is immediately garnered, no? - Tue Nov  3 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: He doesn't care. - Tue Nov  3 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: What happened now? - Tue Nov  3 07:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: What are you doing?! - Tue Nov  3 07:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) watched as Ortho unleashed the giant fireball at the group of shinobi that belonged to Kirigakure. But she was the horrible one for going rogue. That made sense, didn't it? Ortho destroys some shinobi of the village, but she's the bad one. Mhm. Anyway, it was time for a reaction, and she knew the best one to get to Ortho. Something that had to be done. Running to be in the sight of Ortho at the very least, she'd begin yelling at him, quite loudly.

"Ortho, look at this!" She'd pull out her Kirigakure headband, holding it in blind sight. "You see this!? This means I am a Kirigakure kunoichi like those people that you just killed! And that means, you have to kill me too. Will you do that Ortho, huh? Would you erase all of those times you left me alone to keep me happy just to ruin it all in less than a minute!?"* - Tue Nov  3 07:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked down and gripped her hands tightly. Tears streamed down her face as she turned to Thaenan. Her hands were bleeding from the amount of pressure she was putting into them. There were too many emotions running through her body at once for her to control what was happening. Looking at his feet and nothing else, she would begin speaking to him. "You should stay here. After what happened, being with me isn't safe at all." After saything that, Nina would turn around and begin walking away. Not towards anywhere specific, just away from the area that she was in.* - Tue Nov  3 08:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) turned her head to look at Violet as she arrived, her course being redirected towards Violet. Walking over to her, deciding not to look at her at all but rather look down at the ground, she'd simply wrap her arms around Violet's waist and embrace her, tears attacking Violet's midsection. "I'm sorry that this happened, I only came to visit my moms. I hope you don't blame me." Then after that, Nina would turn away and once again begin walking away, before downright sprinting as quickly as she possibly could away from the village. Her eyes were planted on the ground. She just had to get away from this depression.* - Tue Nov  3 08:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I'm not going to let her be alone. . .from what I can gather bad things must keep happening. - Tue Nov  3 09:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) turned her head over towards Thaenan. "No, my hands are fine. You shouldn't even be here with me."* - Tue Nov  3 09:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) turned around and began walking, keeping her ears perked to hear anything behind her. "I said I'm fine. I don't need my hands checked." As she said that, she'd grab at her cloak and rip a few strips, using them to wrap around her wounded hands and to stop the bleeding. It was painful, but it would do.* - Tue Nov  3 09:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) continued walking forward, turning her head back. "Because you saw what happened, and I don't know what'll happen next." After saying that, she'd turn her head forward and continue walking on.* - Tue Nov  3 09:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) watched as she moved in front of him, and simply side-stepped around him and continued walking. Without caring much for what he was talking about, she decided to make an easy decision on how to decide if he would follow or not. Paying money to a Caravan, she'd step one foot into it before turning around and pushing a hand out. "Stay or go, last chance. You better decide well."* - Tue Nov  3 09:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Before we get where we're going. - Tue Nov  3 09:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Mind if I show you my first reason? - Tue Nov  3 09:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Fine. - Tue Nov  3 09:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: As I'll need to hide it where we're going as well. - Tue Nov  3 09:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I see, that's quite unique. What is the other reason? - Tue Nov  3 09:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: - - Tue Nov  3 09:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I decided to stick with you. - Tue Nov  3 09:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I saw you back there, and simply made the choice. - Tue Nov  3 09:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hm. - Tue Nov  3 09:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Now lets go, Ortho should be right around here. - Tue Nov  3 09:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . .Oh? - Tue Nov  3 09:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Let's go then. - Tue Nov  3 09:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) whispers: You gotta skype?) - Tue Nov  3 09:47:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) whispers: Added.) - Tue Nov  3 09:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) 's eyes locked on to Ortho as she walked forward, her hands flowing through hands silently. Moving forward, she'd purse her lips and suddenly begin shooting out wind bullets, all of them aiming to smack into the back of his head. These bullets were blunt, and were meant to cause damage, especially since he was off guard.* - Tue Nov  3 09:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I'm not playing, what the hell was that!? - Tue Nov  3 09:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: You think you can do things like that and get away with it? What if you hurt Violet or Lera?!? - Tue Nov  3 09:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) thinks: And what if she had hurt me? Only care who gets hurt when she knows them, then? - Tue Nov  3 10:02:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I have had it with these monkey fighting androids. In this monday to friday timeline! - Tue Nov  3 10:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) crossed her arms and stared at Ortho. It seemed that any trace of innocence and childhood that she had in her body had seemingly been whisped away and out of her body. "You're staying with me from now on, nothing else to it. Training or dates, we stay together." Turning her head back to Thaenan, she'd point at him and then look back to Ortho. "He's joining us as well." After speaking as such, she'd cross her arms back and turn towards the chick who was....talking to a plant? She got that they were interesting, but could they really hold a conversation? All questions for later. "Who's she?"* - Tue Nov  3 10:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) whispers: I have plenty of money. - Tue Nov  3 10:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) whispers: Hmph. I'll cover you. - Tue Nov  3 10:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) crossed her arms tighter, as if they had gotten into a competition. "Oh, speaking of money, I'd like some please. Or I'd at least like a sword better than this regular old Katana." Smirking a little, she'd look Ortho directly in the eyes. "And I want you to givve me a kiss on my forehead. It's probably a bad decision, but it's mine to make."* - Tue Nov  3 10:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Jeez, can't even get a kiss from my brother. - Tue Nov  3 10:20:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) whispers: And do you want me to lose a piece of my body that badly? - Tue Nov  3 10:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) whispers: He won't do anything. - Tue Nov  3 10:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) whispers: He just roasted half of Kiri. - Tue Nov  3 10:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) whispers: And you're telling me. . . - Tue Nov  3 10:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) whispers: He won't do anything? - Tue Nov  3 10:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) whispers: He did, and didn't lay a finger on me or you. - Tue Nov  3 10:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright.. - Tue Nov  3 10:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) clapped her hands together and began flowing through handseals quickly, already knowing what jutsu it would be based on the handseals themselves. As the wind bullets began coming forward, her earth wall would quickly shoot up out of nowhere, being quite sturdy and thick. It was capable of taking a beating.* - Tue Nov  3 10:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Fuck it. - Tue Nov  3 10:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I'll take them both on. - Tue Nov  3 10:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Ewwwwwwy - Tue Nov  3 10:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) quickly turned her head towards the earth that was coming up from the ground. Moving quickly, Nina would unsheath her sword and, flowing wind elemental chakra into it just to make sure it got the job done, she'd cut through the earth before they could really do any damage to Thaenan or wrap him up in an attempt to immobilize him. Nope, none of that was allowed.* - Tue Nov  3 10:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You missed a good fight, Nina. - Wed Nov  4 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Wed Nov  4 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Ortho. - Wed Nov  4 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: You know damn well who did it. - Wed Nov  4 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) 's eyes focused on the dead body of Violet. After all of the death that she had seen in her life, the events with Kenshin and Ortho on Manda, this was one final one. This was the one that pushed her over her limit, caused her to lose herself. Her body seemed to shake uncontrollably. So far, she could only see one person in her mother's blood, the only person that he saw holding her corpse. And on top of that, the only one that Ortho had blamed for being the one who killed his adopted mother.

She felt betrayed, but that was the understatement of the year. Moving forward as quickly as possible, she'd quickly grab and unsheath her katana while flowing fire through it. As she ran forward, she aimed to swing it high at Thaenan's neck, completely beheading him and moving on with his head rolling along the ground. Her eyes focused on Ortho then, the flaming sword still in her hand as she stopped in front of him. "What. Happened." She had no tone of compassion or love for anyone at that certain moment, it was as if a demon had taken control.* - Wed Nov  4 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) was blasted by water, causing her body to roll back against the ground before eventually coming towards a skidding halt on her feet. It was clear who had done it now, she knew exactly what happened. Sheathing her blade, she'd walk up to Thaenan and grab Violet's body lightly. After doing such, she would spin around and begin walking off without any words to any of them.* - Wed Nov  4 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) stopped walking for a second and turned her head. "If you weren't such an asshole of a brother and a piece of shit human, she wouldn't be dead right now either." And with that, she'd turn and walk off to have her peaceful meeting with her mother for the last time.* - Wed Nov  4 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) had simply continued walking away. She was ignoring the outside word, this was something that meditation wouldn't help for a long while.* - Wed Nov  4 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Leave her. - Wed Nov  4 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Let her have her moment. - Wed Nov  4 06:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) lied down Violet's body, her head turning towards the ground beside her. Moving her hands quickly, she'd allow a small earth wall to pop up, making it the perfect size of a body, especially being Violet's body size. It was almost perfect to her. Laying her on the ground, she'd allow a few tears to fall down her face. Nina would move forward to kiss her on the dead forehead, her last moment with the woman. And her last moment with her alive was her basically leaving Violet alone. This would ache in the back of her head forever, but she knew that she was going to get revenge. On both Ortho, and Kirigakure. They were also involved in this, and she knew that.* - Wed Nov  4 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . . - Wed Nov  4 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) turned her head towards Sanoke, her eyes void of any emotion, but her face showing the streaks of tears that had been flowing down her face just a few moments before. Stepping out of the grave without any words, she'd simply turn her body and touch the wall made of earth that she had created. Pushing it over on top of the grave, it would land lightly over Violet's body just before crushing her.

Dropping down to her knees, she'd kiss the ground just above her body and say, "Your daughter Nina, and your beloved  Lera, loves you very much. This will not be forgotten, nor forgiven." After that, she'd walk cautiously around the grave, a good amount past respectful that seemed to just be rediculous. Turning her head back over towards Sanoke, she'd quickly mutter a phrase. "Leave. This is a private and untouched place." And with that, Nina would do a quick flash of handseals that caused a large dome out of the surrounding earth to shoot above the grave, making sure it was untouched by the random animals passing by.* - Wed Nov  4 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) turned her head to Sanoke as she felt the hand on her shoulder. She paused for a moment, and then turned and continued to walk back to where she was coming from. "Leave me alone."* - Wed Nov  4 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) turned her hand and swatted his hand, using all of her strength with said swat. "I said leave me the FUCK alone! Can't you take a god damned hint, I don't want to talk to you!"* - Wed Nov  4 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) turned back towards the direction that she was walking. "My heart is already hardened." And after that, she'd begin walking away once again, and she wasn't stopping this time.* - Wed Nov  4 06:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked up at Sanoke, and placed a hand on her Katana. "Leave. Me. Alone."* - Wed Nov  4 06:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: No. Now leave me alone. - Wed Nov  4 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I can't. Well. . No, I won't. - Wed Nov  4 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) simply walked around him now. "You'll be alright. I have my own place to stay."* - Wed Nov  4 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) just continued walking.* - Wed Nov  4 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) unsheaths her katana, allowing wind to flow through it and increase its sharpness. "Don't try me Sanoke. Don't risk our friendship because you want a little girly pet."* - Wed Nov  4 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) turned her eyes and nodded. "Good, go and take her home. I don't need nor want your charity. And I damn sure don't want to go with you."* - Wed Nov  4 06:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) continued walking back to where she had come from.* - Wed Nov  4 06:54:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) turned her eyes back towards Thaenan. "Come on, lets go and train." After saying that, she'd turn and begin walking past Ortho, her face void of emotion.* - Wed Nov  4 07:04:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Slice neatly. - Wed Nov  4 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) was trying to keep a leveled head, but she was being pushed into a corner of hate, and she wasn't going to go down without a fight. She had finally broken. Shooting forward towards Ortho with her katana unsheathed, she'd quickly leap forward with as much speed as she could, which she doesn't have much of, she'd send a powerful horizontal slash towards his throat, similar to what she had attempted on Thaenan.* - Wed Nov  4 07:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) felt the threads wrapping around her body, her eyes quickly turning back at Thaenan. Grunting in anger, she'd turn her head over towards Ortho and his water gun that was shooting towards her. Gripping her katana tightly, she'd look up into the sky and let out a yell that seemed to shake the heavens and put anyone in dragon ball z to shame. With this scream, she'd allow her lightning element to suddenly surge out, both electricuting the water as well as the threats around her body.

This was intent on damaging Thaenan to the point where he would have to let her go, as well as send the lightning current up the water gun and hopefully effect him as well. She was new to this lightning element, but she was thinking more logically than anything else right now. That's right, she could make jokes while doing this.* - Wed Nov  4 07:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) was pulled away from the water, her eyes looking down at the threads. "Let me go..."* - Wed Nov  4 07:29:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) shrugged and took her blade, sheathing it quickly. "Oh well." Turning her head over towards Ortho now, she'd sit on the ground, her face twisted in anger and hate. One could only imagine of the horrible things she could be thinking right now.* - Wed Nov  4 07:35:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) sighed once again and closed her eyes. She needed an escape right at that second. She couldn't keep going through the pain at that moment, she had just lost her adoptive mother at the hands of her brother. That was enough to tear someone apart psychologically, and she was already losing sight of herself. She had to break away from it all, just like she had at the waterfall. This was all she could think of doing to get rid of all of the pain. She wasn't sure if she could accept the facts of what happened, but she could at least accept it enough to where it didn't feel like there was a black hole in the pit of her stomach that was trying to take her in as well as everything else around her.

She'd begin to slowly lose herself in her mind, her focus on nothing at all but escaping the world that she had been in at that moment. It was easy to slip away from the pain and suffering in that world through meditation, it was a neat technique that she had learned. She was extremely grateful for the fact that she had learned about it. Looking back, she was at least happy that she was able to peacefully bury her mothers body and say a few goodbye words. It was more than others got to do, so she was also grateful about that. But in the back of her brain, it ached her to think that Kirigakure simply sat around and watched her fight to death. And on top of that, they took her present that Lera had given her? Unacceptable.

But this was all things to think about in the future. For now, she simply allowed the events that took place to happen and relaxed her body and mind. There was nothing there but a haze, and she was focused on nothing at all. Her heart rate seemed to drop a bit lower than usual, but this was simply because of how calm she was. She didn't forget what happened, she simply let it go. Allowed it to blend into her psyche as a part of her being for the time being. But it definitely would cause things to be quite different in the future. Nina was a changed female forever, and the cause of it was both Ortho and Kirigakure. At least, in her eyes it was.* - Wed Nov  4 08:24:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Don't get mad at me. - Thu Nov  5 00:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'm trying to help you. - Thu Nov  5 00:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I'm going to get mad at you. You tried to -stop- me. - Thu Nov  5 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: To save your own skin. - Thu Nov  5 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Wrong. - Thu Nov  5 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Right. - Thu Nov  5 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I tried to stop you from doing something stupid. - Thu Nov  5 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: You know you can't beat him right now. - Thu Nov  5 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: No, no you're not. - Thu Nov  5 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: That's why you said. - Thu Nov  5 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: He'll know I said it. - Thu Nov  5 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: - - Thu Nov  5 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: To save your own ass. - Thu Nov  5 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) stabs the ground and sits on the ground. "Do whatever you want."* - Thu Nov  5 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . .I'll find you later, when we've both cooled off. - Thu Nov  5 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Don't count on it. - Thu Nov  5 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: - - Thu Nov  5 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: If you leave, there isn't any coming back. - Thu Nov  5 00:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: We can spar. And we can try to vent our pain. - Thu Nov  5 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: But trust me, it'll hurt you. - Thu Nov  5 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Like hell. - Thu Nov  5 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Thu Nov  5 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: That's what I'm used to. - Thu Nov  5 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Just, please refrain from kill me if you would. - Thu Nov  5 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Death and I don't sit well together. - Thu Nov  5 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I don't care for killing you, you'll be useful. - Thu Nov  5 01:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: - - Thu Nov  5 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: So I'm just a tool? I see. - Thu Nov  5 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: So that's what you think of me? - Thu Nov  5 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: After all that has happened, I think differently about a lot of things. - Thu Nov  5 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I've been thought of as a lot of things. - Thu Nov  5 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: A tool isn't one I like. - Thu Nov  5 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Prove you're something else then, like I am. - Thu Nov  5 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) crossed her arms and looked at Thaenan, her face and body expression was one of sheer emotionlessness. "If you plan on getting better, you'll have to fight and train as I have, so suck it up and lets get to it." If they had met a month ago, this would've never even popped into Nina's mind, but now things were different.* - Thu Nov  5 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) shook her head and turned her body, dropping down to the ground with a hand underneath her head. Looking into the sky, she'd sigh lightly and once again shake her head.* - Thu Nov  5 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) turned her head over towards him. "No threads for you to use then. Straight taijutsu."* - Thu Nov  5 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) stood up from her laying down position, before pulling her arms up. Her arms took a very specific style when she looked out at Thaenan. "None. Taijutsu is one of my professions." After saying that, she'd sprint forward, giving Thaenan just enough time to try to set up a defense.* - Thu Nov  5 01:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) quickly moved forward now, an evil smile appearing on her face. This was the first time she had time to actually vent without it being a death wish. Ducking down slightly, she'd bring her fist up hard in an attempt to uppercut him, taking him off of the ground a bit from the punch. But she wasn't done there, if she was successful, she would continue to throw the blurs of attacks with no hesitation.

In this uppercutting attack, she aimed to keep him up in the air before pulling back her right arm. Taking a step forward, she'd throw her fist forward hard, aiming to connect with the center of his stomach and send him flying back against the ground. If this had worked, she'd quickly begin following after him with her arms thrown backwards, but she was prepared for any of his attacks to come towards her.* - Thu Nov  5 01:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) sighed as she stood up and crossed her arms. "No thank you. It's too easy...You won't even put up a fight."* - Thu Nov  5 01:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: As I said before. - Thu Nov  5 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Even if I did. - Thu Nov  5 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: It wouldn't matter. - Thu Nov  5 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: The outcome would be the same. - Thu Nov  5 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: It would be better than just sitting around beating on someone. No thank you. - Thu Nov  5 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Okay, then nothing will happen. It's that simple. - Thu Nov  5 01:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) didn't care to actually look in his direction. She didn't even try to show him that he had a chance. She said she was done now so she was exactly that. Raising up her hand, she'd simply catch his fist and push him back on his ass. "I said I'm done."* - Thu Nov  5 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Well, do what you decide to do, and I'll decide what to do in return. - Thu Nov  5 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: It could in the future, you never know. - Thu Nov  5 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: But it isn't now? - Thu Nov  5 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Like I said, you never know. - Thu Nov  5 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'm not asking of the future. - Thu Nov  5 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: What if you leave and someone tries to attack me. - Thu Nov  5 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Two against one could scare them off. - Thu Nov  5 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: So, like I said, you never know. - Thu Nov  5 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Let me rephrase. - Thu Nov  5 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Do you want me here? - Thu Nov  5 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I don't care if you're here, as long as you're on my side. - Thu Nov  5 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Thu Nov  5 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hell, I don't care if Ortho is here. - Thu Nov  5 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: That doesn't exactly help my problem. - Thu Nov  5 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Look, I'm going to be straight to the point. If you want to leave, then leave. - Thu Nov  5 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: That's on you. - Thu Nov  5 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) shrugged. "Power is a reason enough. As for a reason to leave, things are going to get ugly between us and Kirigakure. They're filth and cowards."* - Thu Nov  5 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Whoever sit around instead of helping Violet will die. - Thu Nov  5 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: By my hands if need be. - Thu Nov  5 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: And the one with her swords will die slowly. - Thu Nov  5 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: No matter what village they are occupied in. - Thu Nov  5 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . .I see. - Thu Nov  5 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: As I said, I came here originally for you. Though if you plan to go on some big revenge, why are you still with Ortho? He was the main cause to it. - Thu Nov  5 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Would not have happened if the village had helped instead of letting her fight alone. - Thu Nov  5 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Thu Nov  5 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Multiple people died fighting him. - Thu Nov  5 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Multiple people also sat around watching them fight because they're cowards. - Thu Nov  5 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: The ones who didn't help were either not there at the time, or were too weak. - Thu Nov  5 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I'd rather fight and die with someone than to live and watch them die. - Thu Nov  5 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) turned her head towards Thaenan once again, her eyes focusing on him without any positive emotions. "It might be because I am related. The simple fact is, whoever has her swords or watched her die, will die along with her. Either you believe in that, or you will leave." After saying that, she'd turn her head once again and look back up at the clouds. It seemed that she honestly had no emotions anymore.* - Thu Nov  5 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) turned her eyes over to Thaenan once again. After that, she'd shrug and look back up at the sky.* - Thu Nov  5 02:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'm not going to lead a village when I can't even defend myself. - Fri Nov  6 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: .... - Fri Nov  6 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Speaking of. - Fri Nov  6 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Will you two excuse me? - Fri Nov  6 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Fri Nov  6 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I wish to speak with my sister dearest alone. - Fri Nov  6 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I assume we'll finish this conversation afterwards? - Fri Nov  6 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Of course. - Fri Nov  6 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: ....What's this about. - Fri Nov  6 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I'm fine. What is this about. - Fri Nov  6 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I got word that you wish for me to be dead, and for every person that watched Violet die.. to be the same. - Fri Nov  6 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: So here I am. - Fri Nov  6 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Kill me. - Fri Nov  6 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: No. You'll come when I get stronger later, when I know that I can take you. - Fri Nov  6 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You can take me now, I'm sure of it. - Fri Nov  6 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Make your move, Nina. - Fri Nov  6 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Like I said. - Fri Nov  6 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: You will come later when I know I can take you. - Fri Nov  6 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Come, fight me. - Fri Nov  6 02:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Now. - Fri Nov  6 02:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) stepped to the side and sighed, turning her back on him. "You really do not listen. Not one bit."* - Fri Nov  6 02:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: ....What are you trying to pull? - Fri Nov  6 02:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Nina.. Just come and meditate. Sit in front of me. - Fri Nov  6 02:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) stared at Ortho for a second, and took a step forward. "If you try anything, I won't be so forgiving." As she said that, she'd slowly sit down on the ground in front of him, her hand being pulled back to her hilt.* - Fri Nov  6 02:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) released her hilt and slowly closed her eyes, letting her hand flow over towards her lap as she sat there. She wasn't thinking about anything, there wasn't any emotion in anything. She just sat there waiting for whatever the point of this was. If this was his way of trying to be forgiven, it was far from working.* - Fri Nov  6 02:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) snarled as she looked at him and slowly stood up. She grit her teath a bit before slowly starting to do jumping jacks. She just sat there and did them, her hands going up and down and her legs going out and then back in. Nina didn't understand the point of this, but she was doing it.* - Fri Nov  6 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) sits down before Ortho, as instructed, and begins to meditate.* - Fri Nov  6 02:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) groaned as she looked at Ortho, but quickly let out a sigh as she sat down. Taking up her meditative pose, she'd release the air in her lungs once again and simply sit there in her pose. She was just sitting there meditating, really.* - Fri Nov  6 02:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright, Nina. - Fri Nov  6 02:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You did good, but it's time you and I just talked. - Fri Nov  6 02:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Open your eyes. - Fri Nov  6 02:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: And explain to me.. what you are feeling now.. - Fri Nov  6 02:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) heard Ortho speaking to her, and once again opened her eyes to look at him. Staring directly up into his, she'd clearly say, "Nothing."* - Fri Nov  6 02:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: How do you feel about Violet's death? - Fri Nov  6 02:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Does it matter? I can't bring her back. - Fri Nov  6 02:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: But I will get revenge. - Fri Nov  6 02:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright. I'm going to need you to hold back on the whole 'defensive' attitude and be straight up with me. - Fri Nov  6 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Everything I ask you and tell you is for your own good. - Fri Nov  6 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Now, lets try this again. - Fri Nov  6 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: How do you feel about Violet's death? - Fri Nov  6 02:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I feel like I'm going to slice your neck if I have to say it again. - Fri Nov  6 02:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..You're making this shit pointless.. - Fri Nov  6 02:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You really are.. - Fri Nov  6 02:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Anyways. - Fri Nov  6 02:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Who are you going to exact revenge on? - Fri Nov  6 02:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: It doesn't matter, it is pointless. I keep telling you this. - Fri Nov  6 02:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: You were the same way when mother died, I remember you telling me the stories. - Fri Nov  6 02:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I had you to take care of before we found a village to live in.. - Fri Nov  6 02:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I couldn't afford to have emotions. - Fri Nov  6 02:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Now, once again, it's just you and me. - Fri Nov  6 02:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: So again.. who are you planning to exact revenge on? - Fri Nov  6 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: You. Whoever sat around and watched her die instead of fighting, whoever took her swords. - Fri Nov  6 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I see. Once you exact your revenge on me and who ever else, what then? - Fri Nov  6 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I'll find a life to live. - Fri Nov  6 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Doing what? - Fri Nov  6 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Being alive. - Fri Nov  6 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Do you have an idea where? - Fri Nov  6 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: No. - Fri Nov  6 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You're going to end up committing suicide. - Fri Nov  6 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You're driven by revenge and don't know what you're going to do afterward. - Fri Nov  6 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: If you hadn't killed Violet you wouldn't have to worry about this. - Fri Nov  6 02:57:29 2015
