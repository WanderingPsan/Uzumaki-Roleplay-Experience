<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) turned her eyes towards Abraxas, before quickly taking off. She was just as fast as the dragon, and had enough reflexes to dodge it without it being point blank range, so she was perfectly fine at the moment. Taking her Kung Fu stance while running forward, she'd turn her eyes towards Abraxas. "You dare attack a Hassan while she is talking, who didn't agree to a spar? Show some respect."

After she said that, she made a bee line towards Abraxas, her fists pulled up to her chest as she got nearer. Without any hesitation, she would send a strong fist towards Abraxas's jaw, aiming to do some massive damage to him before continuing to run forward. Should this plan work, the dragon behind her would also smash into Abraxas, doing another set of damage to him.* - Fri Nov 27 05:24:41 2015

But still, it was quite a powerful collision. "Hm, guessing that jutsu -was- weak, seeing as how you had to use a different one AND attack me off guard without me agreeing to a spar." Turning her head over to Ivel, it was clear that she had anger behind her eyes. "Lets start our spar now."* - Fri Nov 27 05:38:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) nodded as she walked up to the rock. Tilting her head to the side to look at Hiroshi, she'd smile. "Hi there, Miss Supa Kick will make your training ten times harder. Heh." After she said that, she'd take a step back and enter her Kung Fu stance once more, looking directly at it. 

After getting into the stance, she'd grin and lift up her elbow to be horizontal with her chest. With that, she closed her fist tightly and aim her elbow directly at the wall. Moving forward quickly, her eyes focused on one point of the rock where her elbow would move towards. This was going to be something special, lets see who was better at taijutsu training between the two.

Moving her elbow forward, Kinami would yell slightly as her flat palm moved forward to collide with the rock, adding on to the force that was colliding with the rock. She was sure that the rock would've moved if it wasn't for Hiroshi, so she felt quite content with herself for doing this much in her very first attempt.* - Fri Nov 27 18:22:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) took a step forward powerfully as she brought up her arm horizontally once more. Without any hesitation, Kinami would throw her arm forward towards the wall, pulling up her other hand to push in her fist and allow the elbow to connect with the rock. However, when she felt the rock moving a bit more her way, she'd chuckle. "Fine, I guess we should get much stronger."* - Fri Nov 27 18:32:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Hehe smoke. . Good idea. - Sat Nov 28 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's face twisted as she allowed a small sigh to escape her lips. Looking through the smoke again, she'd cross her arms. The last time this happened, it was just a hassle, not really anything to push her back too far. As the three clones came out, Kinami's first instinct was to look down. Last time she had done this, she used the same three clone method.

However, there was an easy tell. Something she remembered from the academy. And since she had already used this tactic before, Kinami would see this as a perfect way to test this out. "Come on Momura, the same trick twice in a row?" As she muttered this, the arms would've flew right through her, most likely dispersing themselves upon impact.* - Sat Nov 28 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Sure wish I could see. - Sat Nov 28 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's eyes quickly shifted over to Momura, expecting an attack since the clones were just a distraction once more. Pulling up her arm, Kinami would aim to throw a quick elbow to lessen the blow a bit. Though when she connected, she barely felt anything. And as a result, this caused Kinami to quickly shoot into an attack as well.

Pulling her other arm up, Kinami would allow an open palm to slam against her closed-fisted elbow, pushing her attack forward against Momura to inflict damage to her arm. It wasn't exactly the jutsu that Momura used, but she could possibly tell that Kinami was learning that jutsu from how similar it was to it.* - Sat Nov 28 03:37:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: We can just start here. - Sat Nov 28 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Hmm seems like the training area is getting busy. - Sat Nov 28 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's eyes focused on Momura as she moved. It seemed that she was getting a bit more serious. Sliding into her stance as well, she'd chuckle and kick out her leg a bit. "Well, lets do this.~" As she said this, Kinami would look directly at the female as she decided to run forward. The moment the foot went up, she acted.

Moving her hand forward quickly, it was as if Kinami was trying to catch a fly. Her hand shot out towards the ankle of the kick that was thrown, wrapping her hand around said ankle and stopping all of the momentum that she had behind it. From there, she'd nod slightly.

"Hehe." Spinning the girl slightly, Kinami would lift her up into the air before aiming to kick her directly in the stomach. This was a straight side kick so it would do some damage as well as send the girl flying back as well. The aim was to kick Momura out of the smoke and landing directly in front of Hiroshi.* - Sat Nov 28 03:49:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) noticed the kick coming her way, quickly causing her to lower her head. As such, she took the kick to the chin instead of to the throat, meaning that she wouldn't be stunned as much. And as a result, Kinami would follow through with her actions, before beginning to emerge from the smoke. "Come on Momura, you're doing good. We're both getting some fine training."* - Sat Nov 28 04:00:38 2015
