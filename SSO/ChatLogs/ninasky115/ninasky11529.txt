<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) <27>sighed as she spread her legs and activated the first gate as well, not allowing Geo to just try as hard as he could without her even being ready. Her eyes followed after Geo the entire time, and she could tell that he had something against her at this moment. She wasn't dumb at all, and he was making it more than obvious.<45>

<28>Kinami took not even a second to prepare and attack as she moved to the side slightly. Her focus was completely on dodging the fast attack, so she had no time to counter-attack. However, as she did this dodge, Kinami would swing her arm back to unsheath a long, brand new iron katana. Her eyes focused on Geo and she winked at him slightly, knowing that he was already upset. <46>* - Wed Dec  9 10:29:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: I hope she don't cut this man. . .  - Wed Dec  9 10:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) <29>chuckled a bit as she found out that he was afraid of bladed weapons. Considering the amount of bladed weapons she had on her, this would be kind of interesting if she really needed to get to him. Without her even thinking about it, Kinami would move forward just as Geo had once again, meaning that they would meet halfway once more.<47>

<30>As she moved, she noticed Geo'd leg coming forward out of nowhere. Instead of thinking logically, she was just having fun at the moment. If he -really- wanted to hate her and Hiro, she'd give him something to hate. As the leg was swung outwards towards her, Kinami brought the blade up quickly and swung it directly at said leg.<48>

<31>Kinami spun the blade quickly before bringing it up, so that he wouldn't get cut but he's get scared out of his mind. If this worked, assuming that he would be too horribly scared out of his wits to attack, Kinami would jump back. She'd giggle lightly as she put the blade away, however she was still focused and ready to jump back on the defensive if need be.<49>* - Wed Dec  9 10:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Oh jesus. . . Oh lord. . Oh God. . . O my precious savior. . . - Wed Dec  9 10:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Aww fuck. . .  - Wed Dec  9 10:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) <32>continued to look onward as she saw him kick her sword to shattered pieces. This was the last straw, she had saved up so much money for that sword, and the first time she used it he decided to break it? That wasn't acceptable. "........Okay." Kinami seemed to be in the worst kinds of rages, the calm and acceptable rage.<50>

<33>Taking off at full speed, Kinami decided to give Geo the kind of spar that he wanted, taking no more precautions and not holding back at all. As she moved forward, Kinami's arms moved back quickly and gripped three shuriken, slinging them forward directly at his chest. They were in a wider arc, so the only chance that he had was to duck down or jump up, most likely anyway.<51>

<34>Whatever the case may be, Kinami was waiting on a reaction. The moment that he moved, she would be aiming to be right in front of him, kicking upwards against him quickly and sending him flying up into the air once again. If this worked, she aimed to leave him stranded in the air once more, just like she had last time. Only this time, he had an actual obstacle to dodge first, drawing his attention.<52>* - Wed Dec  9 10:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Yo, yo. - Wed Dec  9 11:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: If this is going to get personal, you both need to stop. Fuckin godamnit.. - Wed Dec  9 11:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Stop this -now- - Wed Dec  9 11:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) <32>felt her body being thrown back out of nowhere, feeling the powerful technique hitting against her foot. Kinami quickly recovered, however, and came to a skidding stop out of nowhere. From there, Kinami would burst to the side once again, moving at extreme speeds. She aimed to keep Geo on the defensive from now on.<53>

<33>Shooting her arms back once again, Kinami would quickly throw the shuriken forward once again, three of them going directly towards his arm. Based on prior knowledge, she assumed Geo wouldn't pay any real attention to the shuriken since he would simply swipe them away once again, if he could do that then why would you pay close attention to them?<54>

<34>However, even with that, Kinami believed her plan wouldn't work. The moment he went up to swipe the shuriken, the red tag attached to the right one would suddenly explode, blowing the shuriken apart. The shrapnel was extremely weak, so if he was smacking away regular shuriken, then the shrapnel was no problem.<55>

<35>But the real one damage would most likely be the explosion from the tag in the first place. She assumed he'd be writhing in pain from it, giving Kinami the perfect time to attack. Appearing on the side of him, she would show a stone-faced gaze of anger as she pulled her arm back. Without a word, Kinami aimed to use his own technique against him, smacking it hard against his arm. And then, in an instant, pulling back and throwing yet another fist towards him to send him flying back.<56>* - Wed Dec  9 11:25:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) <36>'s mind was in a dark place right now, she wasn't even sure she completely understood what was going on right now, but she knew that she was extremely mad, and she had a lot of anger issues. Kinami brought her hands up and cracked them a bit, allowing them to let out an audible cracking sound.<57>

<37>As she heard Mitsunara speaking about not breaking her, Kinami's face didn't change even a little bit. She showed no emotion, she just allowed her power to shoot up to that of someone who had opened the first gate. She quickly began to run, taking off at max speed towards Mitsunara in a sudden blur of speed.<58>

Moving this quickly, she aimed to send a powerful punch towards Mitsunara's chest, sending her flying back into the wall behind her. If this had worked, Kinami would simply stand up with her fists gripped and wait for her to come out of the hole that she was in, if she could.<59>* - Wed Dec  9 12:10:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt the fist connecting, as well as feeling the giant sword as it crashed against her. Kinami's body fell into the ground, trying to withstand the attack but not being able to. Her body fell to the ground powerfully, leaving a small crator in the ground, blood beginning to leak from her shoulder. The only difference, however, is that Kinami would stagger back up.<60>

Kinami saw the girl in the wall, and even then she didn't hesitate at all. Moving quickly, she appeared in front of Mitsunara, not knowing if she was concious or not. She was completely ignoring Chikyu at this point, the same way Chikyu had ignored her when she was hit. Grabbing Mitsunara by the arm, Kinami would pull her, hard enough to yank her out of the wall.<61>

After doing that, she'd pull Mitsu away from said wall a bit of ways away, and then lightly lower her down on the ground, making sure that she went literally an inch per hour. "I'm sorry, I need to be going...." After she said that, she'd begin walking away, leaving Chikyu to put the girl in the hospital, if she chose to. However, it didn't matter, Kinami just began walking away.<62>* - Wed Dec  9 12:27:56 2015
