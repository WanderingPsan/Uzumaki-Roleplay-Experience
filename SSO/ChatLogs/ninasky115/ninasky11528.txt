<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: We are Gravel..After I see if Kinami-Sensei has anything to teach me. - Tue Dec  8 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gravel Dude(S3an) says: We gotta be quick then. - Tue Dec  8 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Man. We got ten years. - Tue Dec  8 00:25:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) sighed as she stood up from her lap pillow. "Fine, fine."* - Tue Dec  8 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Whip his ass, he made you move. - Tue Dec  8 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gravel Dude(S3an) says: If you defeat him quickly we can get down to training. - Tue Dec  8 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: You mean her. . . .  - Tue Dec  8 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) simply walked over to Geo, a while back away from him so that she couldn't suddenly get jumped on.* - Tue Dec  8 00:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) <1>sighed as she slid her legs to the side slightly, allowing her legs to be as wide as her shoulders were. Without any hesitation, Kinami would begin shooting off towards Geo, her body completely toned and moving seemingly on its own. She was used to this movement, and her body could do this from sheer muscle memory.<22>

<2>When she was close enough to Geo, Kinami would chuckle as she threw a quick punch towards Geo, the punch aiming to rattle the boys brain. If that had worked, Kinami would bring her leg up to kick him in the head as well, in the same side that she had just hit him in. This aimed to make him stagger slightly, noting her kickboxer style as well.<23>* - Tue Dec  8 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) <3>felt praise for her kick, giggling a little bit as she rushed forward once again. Her head was suddenly grabbed out of nowhere, yanking it down. The directness of this attack kind of took her off guard, since she wasn't used to being grabbed without some sort of distraction being in place first. However, she quickly reacted.<24>

<4>Her arms shot in front of her face, her arms feeling the impact of the attacks. She had put her arms horizontal to take the brunt of the attack better. However, her body wasn't as tough as it used to be for some reason, probably because of her slacking off for training. However, that was no matter of her since she was still high enough to take most attacks.<25>

<5>While her arms were getting kicked painfully, Kinami would realize an oppening that Geo probably didn't see since he would only see her. When he lifted his foot once more, Kinami quickly shot out with her powerful legs, aiming to attack the free leg that Geo had on the ground. This would probably result in him hitting a split....if he had hit the ground.<26>

<6>If that did work, Kinami would quickly capitalize on it, using her naturally high speed and attacking speed to drop to the ground, folding her leg and arm up. Placing her foot perfectly underneath him, she would suddenly spring up, kicking him in the jaw and sending him flying into the air while she was still on the ground, the perfect set up to Shadow of the Dancing Leaf.<27>* - Tue Dec  8 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) <7>chuckled as she felt her attack work, which caused Kinami to grin. "Let me show you a new jutsu of mine, that I developed on my own!" As she said this, Kinami would grip her fists together and focus intently, the rocks around her slightly shaking before it stopped. "Gate of Opening, open!" After yelling that, Kinami shot off.<28>

<8>She didn't hesitate at all, her eyes staring directly at Geo's head as she appeared behind him. Kinami chuckled as she shot her arms forward quickly, the bandages around her arm suddenly moving around Geo as if it were by itself. With this, and Geo confined into the cocoon, his strength would be significantly reduced due to how tight it was, making escape near impossible. What would he do?<29>* - Tue Dec  8 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) <9>yanked the wraps even tighter as she wrapped around the boy. With this, Kinami also places her hands on either side of Geo, gripping his arms through the wrapping to make sure he stayed in place even better. From there, Kinami would grin as she pulled back, her body facing downward towards the ground along with Geo.<30>

<10>Their bodies also began to spin, they spun so quickly that a trail of wind could be seen trailing them as they fell to the ground, it was something to see for sure. Not everyday someone has this level of technique. It lacked luster against a dummy or so, but a human example would be much better. However, this wasn't the case with Geo, this was simply to show him in a spar.<31>

<11>"Primary Lotus!" The name of the jutsu was said by Kinami as they collided to the ground. She pulled Geo back up as best she could to not give him the -full- brunt of the attack, but it'd surely hurt him. After connecting, it seemed that they both would've hit their head against the ground, but that wasn't the case as Kinami came backflipping out of the large cloud of smoke with a grin.<32>* - Tue Dec  8 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) moved to the left. He was too slow.* - Tue Dec  8 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) <12>felt the attack coming out of nowhere, as she tried to push her chin down to use her strong body to block against it. However, it was true that her body was quite weakened as she was knocked up into the air from the sheer power of the attack. Kinami yelled out slightly as she hit the ground, but quickly recovered by hitting a backroll on the ground.<33>

<13>Standing up, she'd chuckle as she rubbed her chin. "That's a cool move. It's pretty nice to know, I bet. Heh." She crossed her arms and allowed her first gate to drop, assuming that the spar was over. However, she's going to snap back on the defensive if she had to. <34>* - Tue Dec  8 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) raised her arms up lightly as she felt the pressure of the hits. She chuckled and nodded. "Nice."* - Tue Dec  8 02:00:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: If you just grab them with your arms, they could find a way to squirm out or something. - Tue Dec  8 02:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Eh, this suit is rather good for fighting but it's a bit constricting. - Tue Dec  8 02:18:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) looked at the cactus, and quickly struck it from all different sides to get rid of the prickles. "Take this cactus for example. Once you get someone in position and use Shadow of the Dancing Leaf, you move. It'll take a few tries to get the bandages perfect, but after that, it's easy." As she said that, she threw the cactus up into the air. Jumping up behind it, she'd throw her bandages around it. "From there, you grab the sides to get a secure grip, point their head towards the ground and rotate. Gravity will do the rest." After saying that, she'd do exactly what she said to smash it into the ground.* - Tue Dec  8 02:24:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Basically. - Tue Dec  8 02:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: But it requires the first gate to be opened. - Tue Dec  8 02:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: As does mine. - Tue Dec  8 02:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Very well. - Tue Dec  8 02:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: *yawn* - Tue Dec  8 02:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) <14>nodded as she turned her head towards Hiroshi. "Haha, I love you too hunny." As she said this, she'd blow a kiss towards him before turning her body to the side, facing the large rock that seemed to always be there. Moving towards it, she'd look up at the large size of it. By the time that she learned the jutsu, that rock would be gone.<33>

<15>Out of nowhere, Kinami would burst into a powerful stance as she activated her first gate without any hesitation at all. Moving forward towards the rock, Kinami would chuckle as she put her hand against it, and then closed her eyes and sighed. This was going to take some work to learn, for sure. But Kinami wasn't worried, she was dedicated.<34>

<16>Kinami turned back and walked a way a bit, before spinning around to look at the rock again. Pulling her arm up quickly, she'd look towards the rock and smile, wondering how she'd do this. Throwing her fist forward lightly, she'd make the technique shoot forward swiftly, wondering how this would effect the rock overall.<35>

<17>However, it didn't do anything at all. This made it absolutely useless in reality. It was indeed quite a difficult jutsu to learn, and she was excited a bit by the difficulty. Smiling and jumping up lightly out of excitement, Kinami would pull her arms up once again, remembering that Geo had actually punched two times in quick succession of each other.<36>

<18>Kinami's body quickly shot forward once again. Bringing up her right arm, Kinami would throw a punch forward quickly, and on top of that pulled her arm back and shot another fist forward once again. This caused the other power of the punch to shoot forward in a weak concussive blast, barely even moving more than an inch in front of her.<37>

<19> After doing that, she chuckled and knew that she was close to knowing the jutsu perfectly. Pulling back her arm far this time, she'd spread her legs just a slight bit, her eyes focusing on the center of the rock. Without any hesitation, her arm shot forward, marking a place in the air with her sheer strength. Kinami then blinked lightly.<38>

<20>Pulling her arm back as swiftly as she could, she could almost see an afterimage of the arm in front of her, she was moving just this fast. And after that, Kinami would punch forward yet again, making a powerful burst of power add on to the previous attack. And on top of this, she caused the attack to burst forward.<39>

<21>The attack rushed forward quickly and connected with the rock in front of her. It took a while to take effect, but out of nowhere, it would suddenly begin cracking along throughout the rock, not just on the outside but actually inside of the rock as well. It didn't seem like it would do anything but that for a while, and then Kinami turned around.<40>

<22>As she walked towards Hiroshi and Geo, wherever he was in the air at this point, the rock would suddenly explode. Pieces would begin flying through the air and falling towards the area, showing the sheer strength in the taijutsu as well as the strength that she had on her own. It was awesome, to say the least, very awesome.<41>

<23>With a smile, she'd throw her hand forward to meet Hiroshi's, getting a splended high five for her work on the jutsu. Then she went back to lying on the floor, her head lying in his lap if Hiroshi was still on the ground. If he wasn't on the ground, she'd just lay her head on her hands.<42>* - Tue Dec  8 03:34:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt the slap on her butt out of nowhere, causing her to blush a little and move back towards Hiroshi. She'd hug him from behind before he could put his clothes on, pressing her chest against his bare back her hand sliding over to to wrap around his member as she lightly stroked it and kissed the base of his neck.* - Tue Dec  8 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) continued rubbing him lightly as she leaned back, spinning Hiroshi around lightly. After spinning him, she'd wink up at him and nod at his question, bringing her face close to his member before hesitating. After a second or so, she'd stick her tongue out and lick the tip lightly upwards, wondering how he would react to it.* - Tue Dec  8 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) looked up at Hiroshi once again as he fell back into the couch, looking like he was enjoying himself. With a cute giggle, she'd move a little further and allow her lips to slide over them lightly, pressing her lips just past the tip of his member and allowing her tongue to rotate all around it at full speed.* - Tue Dec  8 06:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) continued to rotate around his head, slowly pleasuring her soon to be husband. Moving forward now, she'd take it in deeper, her tongue rubbing against its underbelly lightly. Kinami's head continued to bob back and forth as her tongue flicked around on his member, pleasuring him as much as she possibly could.* - Tue Dec  8 06:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt her head being grabbed and thrusted into. She tried to make a sound and squeel to get him to stop, but it was already to late. She didn't want to use her strength, but when the first wave of cum hit her mouth, she quickly shot backwards and coughed a little bit, using her hand to block the rest of the stringy shots.

"Jeez Hiro, I thought you'd at least give me a while before expecting me to swallow that stuff..."* - Tue Dec  8 07:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) coughed up a little and shook her head as she was swept up. "Oh, no, I don't need a turn." As she said this, she felt her legs being spread apart and fingers grazing her private spot. She bit her bottom lip hard as the sudden finger entered her body, her eyes closing as she moaned in a low tone.

Her eyes stayed closed as a finger continued to press deeper into her privates and clasped her hands tightly on to the couch. "S-Seriously....Hir-roshi. I'm.....fine.."* - Tue Dec  8 07:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt as her body was assaulted by the pleasuring hands of her boyfriend. She groaned out as her nipples were pinched and her breasts fondled, as well as her clit being licked and two fingers sliding into her instead of one. Kinami's eyes closed tightly as she moaned once again. "P-Please Hiro......it's embarrassing..."* - Tue Dec  8 07:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) started to succumb to the pleasure that she was going to, her pleas for him to stop being ignored for her own pleasure. When she really did want to stop, he just couldn't accept it. She was continuously licked and groped all over the place, causing her body to begin convulsing out of nowhere, a stream of liquids shooting out onto Hiroshi's face as she was forced to cum.* - Tue Dec  8 07:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) had already come, but he was still assaulting her body with pleasure. Kinami was dripping wet already, but she already had enough pleasure for one night. Shaking her head, she'd pull away from Hiroshi, smiling. "That's good enough honey, I'm honestly satisfied. Mhm."* - Tue Dec  8 07:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) moved over to get hugged and held by her boyfriend for a little while.* - Tue Dec  8 07:55:18 2015
