<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) raised her hand to catch the scroll, giggling. "Come on Mitsunara, no need to be scared.~ You know I love you like a sister."* - Thu Dec 10 23:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) thinks: Maybe I should just attack one of them to start it -omit- - Thu Dec 10 23:29:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) nodded and tucked her scroll into her pocket, starting off with a light jog forward. It was clear that she would be holding back quite a bit this spar, as she didn't use her full speed nor her fighting style. Her body would continue to move forward slowly, well it was slowly to her, as she was used to fighting in the first gate often times. When she got close enough, she'd throw a simple front punch at the girls chest, holding back extremely.<63>* - Thu Dec 10 23:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Hmm didn't know she was here. . .  - Thu Dec 10 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Kyu, you ready to go? - Thu Dec 10 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) watched the girl's body move fluidly out of the way, causing Kinami to pull her arm back into the safety of her own personal bubble. This pull back was quick, but still only barely dodging the cresent attack that was sent at her wrist. As well as that, she saw the punch coming towards her stomach, causing Kinami's body to quickly flick to the side with all of her speed. <65>

The strong centered punch became a weaker brush of her midsection, just barely nipping her lower side, however Kinami did jump back as she felt a bit of the pain that hit her. However, when she heard that the girl could do better without the gates, this made her feel much better, and called her out of holding back. In fact, it was time for a drink.<66>

Pulling out a sudden bottle of sake, she grinned and pulled it up to her lips. She giggled loudly as she began downing the bottle, fully aware that Chikyu knew what this was. Only, this wasn't anywhere near as deadly as the first gate. With a small hiccup, she'd chuckle and begin wobbling back and forth, her eyes focusing on Mitsunara as she beckoned her forward.<67>* - Thu Dec 10 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: You guys can go do the mission without me. - Thu Dec 10 23:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Seems like we walked in on a spar Bro. - Thu Dec 10 23:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Hmm?  You sure? - Thu Dec 10 23:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Yes, I'm sure. - Thu Dec 10 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: M'kay - Thu Dec 10 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) continued to go for her drink as Mitsunara began to aim for it. As the cresent came forward, Kinami would duck down, allowing the top of the bottle, or in this case the bottom since it was upside down, to be cut. This still gave Kinami the three gulps needed to make her drunk, and from there, the real spar would begin, since Kinami would lose all sense of herself.<68>

Kinami would drop the shattered bottle to the ground and allow a small hiccup to escape her lips once again, her cheeks bright red as if she were blushing. Her arms were waving across the ground while she was crouched, as if she had no control over them at all, couldn't even lift them up. This just showed how drunk she was.<69>* - Thu Dec 10 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: *Shrug* Alright, it shouldn't take us too long anyway. - Thu Dec 10 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: She's totally wasted. . . . Eh, they will handle it. - Thu Dec 10 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Come on Green. - Thu Dec 10 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Kay - Thu Dec 10 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's body slowly began to creep up from the crouched position, as she noticed the sword coming towards her. Kinami's hand would throw itself upward to grab the weapon by the hilt, almost carelessly, as her eyes focused once more on Mitsu. She let a wide grin spread across her mouth as she began to shoot forward, her arms droopy and her body unpostured.<70>

Without any hesitation, Kinami would seemingly trip out of nowhere, her face eating a face-full of dirt. However, it seemed the sword would move ahead of the girl's body, aiming to slash the girl right in her left ankle, taking a chunk of meat and blood right from said leg from the ground. Whether that worked or not, Kinami would spin over and look Mitsunara right in the face.<71>* - Fri Dec 11 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) noticed the Nodachi suddenly coming down to block the girls attack, but not entirely. She hiccuped lightly as her body suddenly lurched to the side just to dodge the attack, seemingly impossible due to her drunken state and how close they were. However, anything was possible when Kinami was drunk, it wasn't even funny.<72>

However, Kinami's body suddenly rolled on top of the blade, her body laying across it at her midsection, as if it were a pillow. The katana was still in her hand when the snores seemed to come out, as if she were asleep. Could she really fall asleep in such a spar against such a huge weapon in the mix? Again, anything was possible when she was drunk.<73>* - Fri Dec 11 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Is she alright? - Fri Dec 11 00:15:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Probably? - Fri Dec 11 00:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's body completely began shooting out when Mitsunara released the sword. Kinami's body began rolling outrageously fast over the blade, her body rotating more and more over the blade as she neared Mitsunara. By the time she was able to form those dark spears, she'd be three/fourths the way there.<74>

Kinami quickly popped up off of the sword, her body being completely boneless it seemed. It was as if her entire body were numb and she had no movement in them. Her body spun quickly as she zoomed through the spears, her body going near 154 miles per hour.<75>

If this worked, Kinami's body would continue to flow forward, smashing against Mitsunara's chest with the center of her head. Whether that connected or not, Kinami's body would hit the ground with a small thud, before slowly crawling up as if she had a demon inside of her. It wasn't anything pretty when she fought drunk.<76>* - Fri Dec 11 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt the attack landing against Mitsunara, though she had her own counterattack. The blade would shoot up out of nowhere and hit Kinami directly in the center of her body, both her and Mitsunara falling to the ground. Howeer, Mitsunara made the mistake of holding back.<77>

After she felt the attack land, she'd suddenly pop up into a ball out of nowhere. Kinami would roll forward slightly like a rolly polly, before jumping up from the ground and basically body slamming Mitsunara, throwing her body into the other womans with full force, also trying to knock them down on the ground as well. She took absolutely no damage from the sword at all.<78>* - Fri Dec 11 00:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) lays on Mitsu's body, her head being pulled up out of nowhere. "Thirty.....Push-ups....." Out of nowhere, Kinami's head began to shoot down and back up as she did push ups, each time she went down her head smashing against Mitsunara's chest at full strength. Nothing would break of course, the most there would be was major bruising.<79>

However, half-way through her push-ups, Kinami woud begin to sober up lightly, blinking as she lay on top of Mitsunara. All of her attacking ending as she tried to find out what was going on.<80>* - Fri Dec 11 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) blinked a little as she looked down at Mitsunara, rolling her arms underneath the girl to lift her up. "Looks like I win again. I love sparring you, I can fight a little more serious without breaking you." She'd nod happily and kiss the girl on the forehead.* - Fri Dec 11 00:49:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) sighed as Momura took up her little ant form again, and went back into digging underground once again. Kinami spread her legs and opened the first gate instantly, already having an idea of where she would come out from. If she had come out from there, the girl would be in trouble.<82>* - Fri Dec 11 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (ur a witness, predicting icly she'll pop up behind me) - Fri Dec 11 03:52:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Good job. - Fri Dec 11 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt the ground underneath her beginning to shake the moment Momura came up. Moving her body back lightly, she'd feel the brass knuckle hitting her hard in the thigh, however it did nothing but give her slight bruises at best, the slight hit not really being enough to propel her into the air the way Momura would've wanted it to, most likely.<82>

However, Kinami would've reacted quickly and lowered her body. With this, Kinami would lift her fist up and thrust it forward, aiming it directly into her stomach. The girl was holding back extremely, but she still wanted to practice this technique. Since she was crouching down now, her face would be right where Momura's stomach was.<83>

Shoving her fist forward, Kinami threw her fastest attack into the girl's stomach. However, there was much more than this attack held in store. As the punch connected, Momura would've felt a sudden explosiveness behind it as if she had been hit with another freight train directly in her stomach, sending her flying back most likely out of breath.<84>

Kinami would sigh and stand up, looking at Momura to see what she would do about such a hit. Had Momura learned a technique of such caliber yet?<85>* - Fri Dec 11 04:05:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Momura(JustCallMeGnar) whispers: (damage is same. - Fri Dec 11 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) watched as the attack connected against the girl, however she wasn't blown back for some reason or another. Kinami wasn't really worried about it, however, because she was durable enough to take something like that. Her eyes quickly focused on the girl when she threw the attack at Kinami's neck.<86>

Her body would've quickly shot to the side to avoid the attack connecting against her, the attack being quite quick and somewhat difficult to avoid. However, it wasn't something that would instantly connect against her or anything like that. From the side, Kinami would throw a quick spinkick towards the girls arm, similarly to 18 kicking Vegeta.<87>* - Fri Dec 11 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (40 damage) - Fri Dec 11 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt the kick connecting against the girls arm, which would've proved quite powerful against Momura, even if she hadn't gotten a broken arm, it'd most likely be bruised or fractured a bit. But with the grabbing of her leg, she'd sigh as she allowed her body to be grabbed out of nowhere.<88>

Her body would suddenly be thrown into the air, but luckily she didn't have to be directly on someone's face to punch them now. Pulling her arm back, she'd look towards Momura, and throw forward a powerful kick towards the girl's chest, which was aimed to sit her flat on her butt.<89>

Whether this had worked or not, Kinami would continue to fly through the air, doing a simple backflip as she landed on the ground. Her eyes would focus on Momura once again as she chuckled. "Lets take this up a notch, eh!?"<90>* - Fri Dec 11 04:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) says: Yo, Kiyoko, Lera. Sup? - Fri Dec 11 04:36:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: That shit hurts. . . .  - Fri Dec 11 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt the girl suddenly wrapping her arms and legs around the girl's body, pushing her towards the ground. Chuckling lightly, she'd tilt her head upwards towards the ground to brace herself. This was quite interesting that the girl developed this from her own attack.<91>

As she hit the ground, a small bit of sand would appear up to block the scene just slightly. Kinami's body would've stood up straight for quite a while, before it finally slumped over and fell to the ground. However, Kinami would suddenly stand up and rub her head. "Jeez Momura, that technique hurts. I love it."<92>

With a slight groan, she'd rub her head a bit as she put her hand out towards Momura, aiming to shake the girls hand. However, if the girl did try to do something, Kinami was quickly on the defensive, ready to counterattack with everything she's got.<93>* - Fri Dec 11 04:52:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's handshake was completely ignored, and she was told to go up and fight seriously. With a sigh, she'd suddenly get a little bit upset. Closing her eyes slightly, her hand that she was pushing out to shake the girl's hand quickly shot up to grab the elbow of the woman.<94>

"Gate of Healing.....Open." As she said that, Momura would suddenly feel that the grip was even tighter over the girl. It seemed that Kinami wasn't even tired anymore, not that she really was at first, but it seemed as if the girl had suddenly taken a five hour energy. From there, Kinami's body would begin to move, preparing to take the girl on at full strength.<95>

Pulling the girls elbow back slightly while dropping to the ground, her feet would suddenly be thrown upwards as Kinami's body sprung up, aiming directly into the girl's chin. This kick would also elevate the girl, leaving her suspended in the air and leaving her wide open to some powerful attacks. Which she was banking on using.<96>* - Fri Dec 11 05:05:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) cracked her knuckles a tad bit while she walked onward, her eyes focusing on the area that she had to overlook. She wasn't sure if she would actually like gate duty, but she was going to see what was happening at the gate and how things would go for her today.<94>(1)

Turning her head back at Aoi, she looked over the small girls physique, wondering what she was going to do about this training as well. With a slight chuckle, she looked down and continued to walk forward. "So, tell me, what exactly made you want to take me up as a master?"<95>(2)

After she said this, Kinami would turn her head back over towards the area that led up to the walls of Sunagakure. It wasn't really hard to see anyone coming or anything, there really was no way to miss anyone walking up to the village or anything like that anyway, so she could split her focus between two things.<96>(3)* - Fri Dec 11 05:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) sighed as she jumped up onto the wall, simply sitting there and watching outward into the horizon. She sighed as she threw her head back, and her momentum followed her as she rolled backwards. Taking off her shell, she'd sling it over the wall towards Aoi as if it were weightless, however it would've been much heavier when it hit the ground or Aoi grabbed it.<97>(4)

"Put that on and do ten push-ups." As she said this, Kinami would throw her body upwards into a handstand as she did multiple times before. From there, Kinami would begin to bend her arms as she lowered her body, her arms bending slightly to get down closer to the ground.<98>(5)

After that, Kinami would push her body upwards once again, her push-ups being much harder since all of her weight was pushing down instead of just her upper body. Her eyes were continuing to look forward at the distance, making sure that no one was appearing and walking up to the area.<99>(6)

She sighed slightly as no one was coming through. She guessed that was a good thing, however as she said that she'd look over towards Aoi once again. The girl would most likely be struggling to do even one push-up with her weights on. But, perhaps the girl had some hidden talent in taijutsu and a lot of strength.<100>(7)* - Fri Dec 11 06:15:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) continued to do her push-ups from her handstand position, all of the weight above her arms being enough to push her down on the ground even harder. This caused her to get a much better workout from the push-ups, compared to just the chest-weight as she muttered last time. Turning her head to Aoi once again, she'd shake her head slightly.<101>(8)

Watching the girl, Kinami would bend her body as she allowed her feet to curl downwards and touch the ground. From there, Kinami's body would stand up fully, before looking over at her once again. Jumping forward at full speed, Kinami would appear next to Aoi in an instant.<102>(9)

Grabbing the shell from her back, Kinami would left it up and off of her person, letting the weight completely woft over here and becoming nonexistant on her. "Lets go, we're going to train now." As she said this, she'd begin walking off, already expecting the girl to follow after her.<103>(10)* - Fri Dec 11 06:59:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Yes, now come on. - Fri Dec 11 07:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's eyes focused on Aoi as she moved forward, making sure to keep her eyes on the girl. She wasn't awefully that fast, neither was her attacks. Kinami wouldn't really have to try on this one, but this only proved her point that she was a wonderful sensei for the girl.<104>(1)

Moving her hands up to her chest, her fists were tightly gripped. She seemed to have taken on the form of a boxer without the jumping around. As the girls attacks came towards Kinami, she'd analyze them quickly and easily, her attacks being extremely slow. Kinami could read the girls every move without so much as a second glance.<105>(2)

As the strike came towards her, Kinami would move her head to the side slightly, throwing forward a weak punch, holding back extremely as to test the female. Her left fist would connect against Aoi's nose, pushing her back great measures as she pushed against the girl, however it was clear that she was holding back more than just a little bit.<106>(3)

"Your attacks are slow. You move pretty quick, however. Focus your movement in your attacks as well as your overall speed. There's no point in moving around extremely fast if your attacks are much slower." As she said this, Kinami would cross her arms, not planning on making any sudden attacks against Aoi.<107>(4)* - Fri Dec 11 07:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's eyes focused on Aoi as she nodded, she had indeed been punched in the nose. It was extremely lightly, but it had still landed. Her eyes would be trained on Aoi the entire time as she moved, not really hesitating at all in the midst of training this young woman. She had a lot to learn, and they were almost the same age.<108>(5)

Watching the girl intently, she noticed the girl bursting off in speed once more, deciding not to try anything to see the girls damage output. As she was hit in the side, she wouldn't even flinch, which would be noted by Aoi. Her side didn't even jiggle, it was like hitting an iron wall, most likely Aoi hurting her own arm.<109>(6)

"Your attacks are still sloppy and lack firepower. You will need a strong amount of training. Your reflexes are also slow and you have no center of balance." With this, Kinami would move to kick the girl's leg from underneath her, allowing her to fall to the ground. She eyed Aoi intently as she fell to the ground, simply inspecting her.<110>(7)

"I enjoy you as a student, however. I am not saying this to discourage you, I am saying this to let you know that I will always tell you bluntly your mistakes so that you may correct them. This is nothing but me being tough on you." After she said that, she threw a quick attack at her chest once again, her hand fondling the girl slightly.<111>(8)

This one was just to upset her a little more, to see if she had gotten better when she was upset and angry. If not, that would be a wasted measure, but you never knew with certain characters. She kept her arms closed and crossed tightly against her chest, something seeming to suddenly change in her. Had she changed her fighting style with just a step?<112>(9)* - Fri Dec 11 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) blinked a little as it seemed that Aoi ws suddenly moving much quicker. She smiled, the girl had techniques under her sleeve that even Kinami hadn't seen yet. As the punch connected with her right cheek, she wouldn't flinch still as she looked down at Aoi. "Nice technique, I'd love to learn that some day." This was as true as anything else in life.<113>(10)

"However, it's my turn..." From there, Kinami would suddenly move backwards, the weights being the only thing that kept her from phasing away of Aoi's vision. Had it not been for the weight, Aoi might not have even seen her disappear. When she had gotten her distance from the girl, she'd grin and look at Aoi, pulling an arm back.<114>(11)

"Let me show you true speed and power!" When she said that, she threw her fist forward powerfully and quickly, Aoi probably not being able to recognize what had just happened. From Aoi's point of view, she'd probably go from seeing Kinami's arm down to her waist, to it suddenly being extended to her from such a distance. There was no way that she could be hit from there....right?<115>(12)

Suddenly a burst of wind would smash against Aoi's body, her first gate activating only for the split second that she needed it to use the technique, before dying back down. It'd be completely unseen due to how quickly she had done the technique. After doing that, she'd look at Aoi to see her reaction, wondering how she'd take that.<116>(13)* - Fri Dec 11 08:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) lowered her hands slightly as she looked at Aoi. Without any hesitation, Kinami would take a step forward, as if she already knew exactly what Aoi was going to do. "You're too slow..." As she said this, Kinami's leg would quickly shoot upwards in a large swinging arc, most likely meeting and overpowering Aoi's punch to toss it to the side.<117>(14)

After doing such, she'd continue to spin as she moved in a complete flash to Aoi, probably not even seen moving. Her body dropped down quickly as she swept the girls legs, dropping her to the ground. This was a technique the girl may or may not have known, as it was one of the most basic taijutsu that she knew. "You're done, I know what to work on with you."<118>(15)* - Fri Dec 11 08:30:43 2015
