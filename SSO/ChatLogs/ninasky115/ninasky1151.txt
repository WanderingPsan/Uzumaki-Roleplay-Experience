<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) blinked and tried to sneakily sneak past them, though it was pretty loud and playful.* - Wed Oct  7 04:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) blinked at the conversation that she heard as she walked up, not knowing what the guy had said at all. She was very confused right now. "Umm, what are you saying?" She assumed she was saying this from behind him, and him turning around might confuse him as he wouldn't see her since she had the height of a nine year old girl.* - Wed Oct  7 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) blinked as he talked, nodding at him before turning her eyes over towards the younger boy. Walking over towards him slowly, she'd wave friendly at him as she approached from the side. 

"Hey, do you mind if I train with you?"

Hopefully she could get a friend in the process of practicing her jutsu.* - Wed Oct  7 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) shook her head as she turned at the water on the ground. Turning back at him, she'd shake her head again as if he didn't see it.

"I use wind ninjutsu, I just don't want to train alone. And I can help make your jutsu stronger later in the future." She'd smile and push a thumbs up towards him.* - Wed Oct  7 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) blinked a little as she looked at Heiwa, staring in his eyes as she waited for his response. "Just uhhh, practice your jutsu, and I'll use my jutsu. I just don't want to be alone when I do this."

Turning her head over towards the side that he was shooting, she'd smile and nod, signalling him to keep going.* - Wed Oct  7 05:25:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: *sigh* - Wed Oct  7 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Alrighty.~ - Wed Oct  7 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) nodded and walked over towards towards Cypher. "Okay, lets do this then." Dropping to the ground a bit, her playful demeanor seemed to disappear as she had began trying. Moving forward as quickly as she could, she tried to approach Hideki quickly enough to get in a close enough to engage in close-quarters combat.

Without a single hesitation, she'd slide forward and pull both of her hands up to cover her face yet give her enough room to see Hideki and his actions. Moving forward, she'd attempt to jab her left arm forward towards his stomach region, since she was pretty short compared to the young adult.* - Wed Oct  7 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) watched as Hideki had jumped back from both attacks, the boy beside him seeming to appear out of nowhere. Though, she was pretty focused at that moment. Pulling her hands together, her feet steady on the ground, she'd attempt to flow her hands through a series of handseals fluidly, nothing too special.

Pulling her head back, she'd hold the seal up to her chest and move forward, her mouth shooting forward four air bullets towards him. They were blunt, but moved fast as a bullet of wind. They flew towards the center of his chest, left, and right knee. Hopefully it'd hit him hard enough to immobilize him for a few seconds so that her partner could capitalize on the attack.* - Wed Oct  7 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) was panting hard now, moving back a bit as her arms dropped to her sides weakly. "I'm sorry, I thought I'd be better than just three...." She hadn't even noticed how much the bullets took out of her reserves.* - Wed Oct  7 23:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) blinked as she watched that everyone was about to leave. Sighing a little, she'd sit down in place and just sit there, maybe even meditating. She'd bat her eyes open lightly when she heard the scroll hit the ground. "Thank you."* - Wed Oct  7 23:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Mhm. - Wed Oct  7 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked down at the scroll lightly. First, she'd read the scroll a bit to see what she was getting into, trying to see what she was really getting into. Looking down at the text, she'd sigh as she stood up, keeping the scroll on the ground. She comprehended everything that the text had said before turning a bit. "Hm, lets see what this'll do."* - Thu Oct  8 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) turned her head towards the distance once again. Nodding as she'd get back to work, she'd grin and bring her hand up. "Shunshin no Jutsu!~" After saying that, she'd aim to shove her chakra through her system to allow her a quick burst of movement in which she'd move faster than the regular human eye.

With that, she was capable of creating the puff of smoke easily, but that was about it for the first try. "Damnit..." Turning her head lightly, she'd notice the boy had come back from wherever he'd went. "Hey there." With this, she'd wave at him and turn her head back over towards the distance where she was trying to move to.* - Thu Oct  8 00:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Learning. - Thu Oct  8 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Learning what? - Thu Oct  8 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: A jutsu. - Thu Oct  8 00:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: It's called Shunshin. - Thu Oct  8 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What's it do? - Thu Oct  8 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Makes me move fast. - Thu Oct  8 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Basically, anyway. - Thu Oct  8 00:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Is it what Uncle Hideki gave to you? - Thu Oct  8 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Yeah.... - Thu Oct  8 00:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Is it a wind jutsu? - Thu Oct  8 00:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: No it isn't. - Thu Oct  8 00:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Oh.  - Thu Oct  8 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) nodded as he turned his attention to the reading, before standing up. Smiling, she'd look towards him and pull her hands up once more, doing the handseal. Pushing her chakra once more, she'd suddenly appear behind him with a smile, her only phrase being, "hi again.~" Of course she'd be a bit woozy so she wouldn't be doing too much moving.* - Thu Oct  8 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hehe.~ - Thu Oct  8 01:08:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Nothing at all huh? - Thu Oct  8 01:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I have a shuriken..and some string.. - Thu Oct  8 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: No thank you, I prefer jutsu. - Thu Oct  8 01:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..You don't have the fire or water element. - Thu Oct  8 01:19:47 2015

Cocking her head back, she'd feel her wind in her lungs begin to get infused with chakra, as if the chakra was moulding it already. Molding it as it moved up her throat, she felt the chakra leech its way up her esophogus, ready to be released.

Pushing her lips forward, she'd spew the one wind bullet out towards the fence, hearing it connect pretty bluntly against the fence, leaving just a small noticable dent in where it had connected to said fence.* - Thu Oct  8 11:58:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) continued to poke him in the stomach playfully while looking up at his face. She was still young, so she couldn't tell the difference between emotions as well as everyone else in the area. "But you look so sad!~" She'd smile and poke him a little harder, as if it was a light punch. "Lets go and play."* - Thu Oct  8 16:17:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) frowned a little as she was pretty much ignored. "I was only trying to help." She'd turn back to walk back to where she came from, then simply took a seat on the ground, looking down at her hands all by herself.* - Thu Oct  8 16:28:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Okay, so what's first?~ - Thu Oct  8 16:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) blinked a little bit as she looked at Ortho while he talked. She was happy for a long time hat he decided o come and help her out, but after he had finished talking and turned around, she felt as though she was simply thrown away to do her own thing. She might as well had come and done it on her own, there was no way she could really impress him if she wasn't given anything to work with.

Sighing lightly to herself, she'd bring her hands up before looking forward. In the space that was between the two who had joined her, she'd nod to herself and inhale deeply, pushing just one foot forward to stabilize herself and looked forward in a straight line. Raising her hand up to her mouth, she'd use it s if aiming and straightening the attack that she was going to use.

Finally, forcing the chakra out of her mouth, she'd exhale the bullets quickly, allowing them to shoot forward quickly and confidently. After a while, they'd simply fall to the ground, leaving a small yet visible dent in the ground. There wasn't much to do with that, but the training was simply good enough for her to work with.* - Thu Oct  8 17:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: So mister Ortho, when do I get to learn something...? - Thu Oct  8 17:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You're rushing yourself too quick. Master the techniques you have thus far and advance at a pace where you don't burden yourself. - Thu Oct  8 17:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I am merely here to oversee your progress, not to hand you techniques when you haven't mastered the ones you already have. - Thu Oct  8 17:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Yes sir. - Thu Oct  8 17:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) closed her eyes as she exhaled softly, as if releasing some pent up carbon dioxide that she had in her body. Opening her eyes slowly, she'd let the sunlight seep into her eyes, as if bringing new light to a dark abyss. After her eyes had opened completely, she'd look forward towards the fence in front of her, aiming to hit said fence with her bullets.

Taking a few steps forward, she'd bring her hands up to her chest again, pulling a confident wave of air into her nostrils  while doing them. After being side by side with Ortho, who seemed to be her trainer at the moment, Nina would cock her head back and allow chakra to seep into her lungs once again, aiming to use it in an attack.

After all of this was done, which wouldn't really take all that long, she'd cock her head back and bring her hand up to her mouth, allowing a finger to curl around just in front of her lips, as if to guide her aim. Shooting them forward quickly, she'd watch as the bullets of wind went forward, gliding through the air until they each smacked against the fence, the sound traveling all the way back to her ears.* - Thu Oct  8 18:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) watched as the bullets went forward and heard them clang against the fence in front of her, even though it was quite a bit of ways away. She felt an accomplishment in herself that she had increased herself in a way that she hadn't done since her graduation in the academy. Though, this was no time to celebrate, she had to keep it going and continue increasing through the ranks, whether it was for a good teacher or for herself.

Pulling her hands up quickly, her eyes focused on the fence in front of her once again, her eyes snapping to it almost instantly. She'd focus solely on one place in the fence, her hands being pulled up to her chest once again. With a smile, she couldn't help but think that, against an enemy, these attacks would be devastating against aan enemy, even if they were of a higher rank.

Her hands would quickly snap together once again before they started moving fluidly into one another, forming seals that were so familiar to her as if they were hardwired into her brain. Of course she had been using this jutsu for a long time so in a sense it really was hard wired, but it didn't really matter since training it was the focus of this, and it was only making it even more hard wired.

Moving forward once more, she'd poke out her lips and allow the wind to take shape, coming up her esophogus and into her mouth. As they were exhaled out of her mouth, they'd quickly be formed into that of a spinning bullet, cutting through the air and moving towards the fence at a high speed. She could feel the chakra needed was lessened now, and it seemed a bit more powerful and slightly faster.* - Thu Oct  8 18:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) watched the bullets whizz through the air once again, they'd shoot forward with pretty good speed before clanking up against the fence further down the road. She'd look towards Ortho just to see if she had any type of expression on his face about her. Though, whether he did or not, she'd turn back towards the fence and prepare to do the same thing. It was pretty repetitive, but she could feel herself increasing in her prowess for the jutsu.

Once again, she'd pull her hands up to her chest, her eyes focusing now on, instead of the fence entirely, the holes in the fence. This would help her aim a bit more than simply hitting the fence as a whole. Her face turned into a bright smile now, thinking that this was a wonderful idea that she had come up with all on her own. Her eyes scanned through one section of the fence, and took her aim. Instead of one, she'd aim to go through multiple holes.

Pulling her hands up, she'd clap them together softly, but hard enough for a sound to be heard by both of her spectators who were in the area. Her hands would move through the handseals quickly, almost quicker than ever before since she had used the jutsu so much and since her mastery was going up so quickly, that it was as if she was becoming a master by the end of the day.

By now, her chakra had already began seeping into the wind in her lungs, it was clear that she was doing this on instinct by now. She used much, much less chakra this time than she had ever done, so it was a clear sign that her mastery over the jutsu was increasing. She had always progressed pretty quickly, even when she was a small child.

Shooting forward, she'd allow the wind to form in her mouth, her lips pushing forward and allowing the bullet to shoot out quickly. The aim of the bullets improved as well, and the bullets would quickly shoot out of her mouth at an extremely quick pace. Moving forward towards the fence, she'd watch them cut through the holes, the sound completely silent as they passed through the holes.* - Thu Oct  8 18:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hey, I'm getting better aren't I?~ - Thu Oct  8 18:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmm. - Thu Oct  8 18:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Don't you think so? - Thu Oct  8 18:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I do. - Thu Oct  8 18:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: So should I keep going?~ - Thu Oct  8 18:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) sighed lightly as she looked towards the fence once again. Without another sound, she'd look at the fence once more, looking at it hard and picking her spots like she always does. Her eyes picked up specific things now, one of them being one of the holes in the fences, and the other being some of the bigger and easier things to hit.

Pulling her hands up quickly, she'd clap them together at chest level and begin flowing through the handseals that she knew and loved so much. Of course it was her only jutsu, so it was quite helpful, and she'd probably used it well over fifty times so it was nothing but natural to her by now.

Pushing her lips forward quickly, she'd chuckle before allowing the bullets to begin shooting out, hitting her marks pretty will considering that she hadn't really tried to practice her aim at all. But with her bullets, her aim was pretty well overall.* - Thu Oct  8 19:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) sighed as she turned her head towards Takeda, then looked back forward at the fence in front of her. She was kind of tired of training, but it's seriously helping her in the long run. This would hopefully be the last time that she had to do this overall, of course when it came to this spammage of training that she was doing anyway.

Bringing her hands up, she'd focus her hands on the handseals once more. Looking up at the wall, she'd flow her hands through the series quickly and quietly, her hands moving in almost a flash due to her new mastery over the jutsu. Her progression was serious outstanding when it came to everything.

As she increased her jutsu through the hard training, she'd sigh once more. Pulling in another breath after doing so, she'd lean forward and allow her her chakra to focus into the wind that was built into her chest. And with that, the jutsu was already in motion and there was no stopping her now. And now, she'd allow it to go off.

The balls of wind would quickly be formed into those that seemed like bullets, before she released them forward, not caring what she really hit in all honesty. It was just about the training now. She had to master this technique already, it was simply a must.

After blasting the jutsu outwards, she'd sigh and turn her head towards Takeda. "I'm bored. This training is really getting old now. She'd sigh to herself once again, needing a but more fun in her life. * - Thu Oct  8 19:55:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) turned around and quickly started sprinting away, her eyes wide with fear as she moved. She had literally seen a person disappear from view just from moving fast. She hadn't even been a kunoichi for a week.* - Fri Oct  9 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: YOU KILLEd - Fri Oct  9 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) continued running away from the man who seemed to be disappearing from the scene. She was too young, too unexperienced to do anything, but she knew she couldn't just stand around and get killed. Kojiro told people to run away, so that's what she was going to do as hard as she possibly could. There really wasn't anything else.

Looking at Heiwa, she'd see that he was stunned now, taking all of the paim and emotions in as if his brain had shut down. "Move already! Run!" She'd continue running, smashing into him a bit but never stopping her run. As she ran, she'd attempt to wrap her hands around him and do a series of handseals, holding tightly on to him. If she was successful, she'd hopefully shunshin away, as well as Heiwa in her arms.* - Fri Oct  9 01:36:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) finally got away from the carnage, her body feeling woozy and her mind feeling disoriented beyond what she could have been apart of. She'd fall to the ground, not knowing where she was, hopefully Heiwa was okay enough to take care of her for the time being.* - Fri Oct  9 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) slowly leaned upwards, her hands on her knees and her mind rattled, her face looking as though she might even though up. Which, after a while, she does. From both the sight and fear of what happened. And on top of that the sudden movement that disoriented her so much. It was impossible to hold it all back and survive what had happened, she barely had enough mind space to talk.

But she had to snap out of it, looking up at Heiwa. She couldn't help but feel as though she was the target of his rage. "W-We got away.......I had to get us away from there, there was nothing we could do."* - Fri Oct  9 02:01:10 2015
