<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm the bad guy because I don't show you sentimental love. - Fri Nov  6 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I never had the chance to learn that. I had to grow up fast as hell to take care of you until you found a steady home. - Fri Nov  6 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm the bad guy. - Fri Nov  6 03:28:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Then so be it. - Fri Nov  6 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Water is thicker than blood to you. - Fri Nov  6 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I -been- accepted that. - Fri Nov  6 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Did you accept that when you killed Violet and planned to kill Lera? - Fri Nov  6 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Way before that. Waaay before that. Back when we were in Sunagakure and you cursed me out for them. - Fri Nov  6 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: From then I knew where you stood. - Fri Nov  6 03:29:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yet you can say and do as you please? - Fri Nov  6 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Pfft. - Fri Nov  6 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Whatever. - Fri Nov  6 03:30:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Whatever. - Fri Nov  6 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll spit on Violet's grave before I admit I'm wrong for taking her grave. - Fri Nov  6 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I told her to leave three times. - Fri Nov  6 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: She continued to charge at me.. - Fri Nov  6 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: She got a spike through her chest. - Fri Nov  6 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Not my fault. - Fri Nov  6 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) pushed her hand back to grab her katana, her eyes staring at Ortho. After she did that, she'd point the tip at Ortho, specifically at his neck if she were able to. "Shut up. Now."* - Fri Nov  6 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) felt her arm being raised in the air, her eyes still focused on his. "You killed my adopted mother, threatened to kill my other one, and you left me alone for god knows how long. You think you're so innocent because you're my brother who was never around? I'm not like you."* - Fri Nov  6 03:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) closed her eyes as she heard Ortho talk. She was tired of this. Pulling her hand back as hard as she could, she'd simply sheath her blade and jump back away from him. "Just because you are my brother does not justify the killing of any of my family. I love you as a brother as well, but you won't just be given a 'best participant first place' ribbon for it. Especially if you think killing Violet and Lera are good enough for you." After saying that, she'd finally open her eyes, allowing the red in them to glow and the one tomoe to swirl into the corner of her eye. "I am not some little unprotected girl now, I am a protected shinobi who can fend for herself when it comes to living. And you can't do whatever you want and think I'll be okay with it because you're my brother."* - Fri Nov  6 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I get it Ortho, you're not the bad guy. - Fri Nov  6 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: But you're far from the good guy. And I want you to know that. - Fri Nov  6 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Been acknowledged that, tell me something new. - Fri Nov  6 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Okay, how about. - Fri Nov  6 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I won't sit around and let you kill Lera, brother or not. - Fri Nov  6 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Water is thicker than blood apparently. - Fri Nov  6 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Tell me something new. - Fri Nov  6 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: How about. - Fri Nov  6 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: If water is thicker than blood, your head would've been rolling like Thaenan's almost was. - Fri Nov  6 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I would not have hesitated. - Fri Nov  6 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You hesitated because you knew I could counter. - Fri Nov  6 03:55:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I hesitated because you're my brother. - Fri Nov  6 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Don't believe that. You'll kill me on a whim for your water-family. - Fri Nov  6 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Tell.. me.. something.. new. - Fri Nov  6 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: ......no. - Fri Nov  6 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It's funny how there is so much that you don't know, and everytime I try to explain you dig down my throat and refuse to listen to me. - Fri Nov  6 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm done talking. Tell me something new. - Fri Nov  6 03:57:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Like you risking your life to find me a place to live? - Fri Nov  6 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: That you keep throwing at me every second? - Fri Nov  6 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Nope. - Fri Nov  6 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Don't care about that anymore. - Fri Nov  6 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I tried that. - Fri Nov  6 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Bet money if it was anyone else that told you that, you'd run into their arms and thank them. - Fri Nov  6 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: But since it's coming back from the Big Bad Ortho, it means nothing. - Fri Nov  6 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Okay, you think that then. - Fri Nov  6 04:00:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) heard Index's words as she drew closer to the area, hearing that he was going to end Ortho. Now, she couldn't let that happen at all. She might have been mad at him, maybe even hated him for what he had done over time, but she couldn't let him die. She was his brother, and she actually did have love for him, more than anyone else. And so, she would try to see if she could sway the battle with words first, something had to get to them after all, and maybe it was a young child that they both cared for.

As she approached the battle, she'd look at the both of them, her voice raising as she spoke. "Index, stop this right now! You're not killing Ortho and he's not killing you, now both of you stop!" As she said this, she'd run forward a bit, her hand on her katana just in case she had to prepare fighting.* - Sat Nov  7 00:14:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) continued to run forward as she saw the two going at it, confident enough in her strength that she could stop the two. Bringing her hands up quickly, she'd quickly begin to flow through multiple handseals before throwing her hands forward. This was, of course, aiming to blow both of them away and to knock some sense into them as well as bring their attention to her, the source of the powerful wind blast that she used against them. Stepping forward, the short girl would begin yelling at the two.

"Stop fighting, both of you! You think this will make this any better for either of you!?" She'd look at the two of them, shaking her head if she was able to stop them. If she was just a distraction, she would still continue to run forward, trying to get closer to the both of them so that she could stop the fight all together. She didn't want to pick sides, but she knew exactly which side she would pick if it had come to that.* - Sat Nov  7 00:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) stepped beside Ortho specifically as she looked up at him, and then over at Index. "What is this about? Why are you two trying to kill each other?" The young girl was right to the point.* - Sat Nov  7 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) quickly moved in front of Ortho, her hands moving quickly and without any hesitation. She was going to protect her brother, even if it killed her in the process as well. As she moulded said handseals and allowed her chakra to spike slightly, she'd crouch and slam her hands down into the ground. She made the wall twice as thick this time, knowing very well of the destructiveness of the jutsu that Index had used. She -needed- to use two Mud Walls to protect them even the slightest bit.

If this had worked to protect them, she'd turn around and eye him, slapping him in the face if she were able to. She'd look him in his eyes, even though she was quite short and had to do a little hop to slap him in the face. "If you want it to be told straight, you need to get a hold of yourself and realize that if this keeps going, a lot of people here are going to die. People that both of you love!"* - Sat Nov  7 01:21:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) walked around from her mud wall that she had placed, her hand moved over to Ortho. She wasn't as close to Ume as the other two were, so she hadn't really felt that much pain as her brother and the other did. "It's okay, you'll get over it. It's not your fault, he's the one who killed her with your jutsu. He's the one who left her body like this. He hadn't even tried to help. Even after it happened, all he could do was shift the blame so that he wouldn't feel dirty. He's the evil one here as well. You are not." As she said that, she'd reach underneath his arm, aiming to pull him up from the body and away from the area as well. Her eyes cut to Index, someone who she had considered a best friend, now different. There seemed to be war now, a war that would take quite a while to dispute. Hopefully she could be the voice of reason later, but her brother was the most important at this point in time.* - Sat Nov  7 03:00:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) groaned as she turned towards Ortho. She regreted what she was about to do, but she had to do it to get him out of the state that he was in. Hopefully he'd wake up and be better. Standing up fully, she'd turn her head before pulling her head back. Throwing it forward, she'd aim to connect with her jaw and knock him out quickly and painlessly, especially since he was in the middle of all of this that was going on.* - Sat Nov  7 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) nodded and did the clone seal, moving her chakra into her earth element to create an earth clone. The clone would grab Ume's dead body while Nina grabbed Ortho's. And from there, they would begin to walk away from the area and head to Nina's house that Ortho had built.* - Sat Nov  7 03:32:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) moved in front of him and reached up high, grabbing him by his collar and pulling his face down to her level against his will. "Your punishment is to keep me happy, yes. I'm a selfish asshole, just like you. We're perfect siblings." After that, she'd release him and fix his shirt where she had scrunched it. The only way she could get to him was through pain and harsh words, he wouldn't react to love at all. "Your other punishment is to stay alive and protect me -without- leaving. I don't care about what pain you're feeling, you know how I felt when Violet died now. And, just like you, I don't care about her death. Fuck her in all honesty." * - Sat Nov  7 04:01:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hello. - Sat Nov  7 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked at Paine as she had finally arrived at the place that she had lived. She smirked a little, but it wasn't big at all. She was also emotionless here around. Something had definitely changed since the last time they had met each other, that much was obvious. Nodding in her direction lightly, she'd look off at the girl, wondering what sort of test this would be. "What do we do first?"* - Sat Nov  7 05:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: kk ziare u did at least 10 RPies using the parent jutsu, yes? - Sat Nov  7 05:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Ortho, what did I tell you about picking up girls? You better have a condom this time! - Sat Nov  7 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked up at Paine, as if studying her body and stance for any weaknesses, before shrugging.

"That's fine, I need a work-out anyway." After saying that, she'd turn to the side and release her sheathed katana, throwing it towards Ortho who seemed to have a knocked out chick in her arms. Sadly, that wasn't the strangest or most worrying thing he had done.

Turning towards the lady known as Paine now, she'd lift both of her arms up as if she was a boxer, because she was. She awaited her arrival.* - Sat Nov  7 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) 's eyes focused on Paine as she jumped up and down for a bit, Nina simply shaking her arms to loosen them up. She wasn't one to stretch between battles much, which was a bad habit of hers, but you're not allowed to stretch when you're out on the battlefield so maybe it was a good thing that she hadn't really stretched before a lot of fights. Regardless, Nina kept her eyes trained on Paine, and kept her focus on nothing else but the female.

As the foot came towards her ribs, Nina would quickly drop one arm to take the attack, aiming to negate the damage done to her ribs by sending it through her arms. With this movement, Nina would throw her arm forward in an attempt to do damage with her left arm, since she trained both arms equally they would put out the same amount of damage anyway. Her arms moved as if they were trained because they really were, and it seemed that her attack was on another fighting level, moving directly towards the center of her chest quite quickly.* - Sat Nov  7 06:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: f-fell...a-asleep...mmm... - Sat Nov  7 06:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) smiled as she continued looking up at the girl as they fought from such a close range. Nina was moving quickly, as she sure the figure was as well. They were moving at paces that most people weren't able to see probably, such was the skills of a taijutsu user. And now she had a real teacher to teach her real, proper techniques. Nina would also jump back as well, gaining a bit of space before going back in there.

Looking up at Paine, as she stepped forward, Nina would throw a quick punch towards the girls nose. Hopefully she had proen herself enough to show that she could be a good enough student, but if not, then onward they would flow. The punch aimed straight towards Paine, aiming to knock her out potentially if the attack had landed.* - Sat Nov  7 06:47:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) nodded and crossed her arms, waiting for the next test.* - Sat Nov  7 15:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: hmm....u-umm...h-have you e-ever heard of the t-term l-og t-training? - Sat Nov  7 15:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: No, I have not. - Sat Nov  7 15:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) nodded at Paine, and sighed. She decided that she wanted to end this quickly, so she would try her absolute hardest. She imagined it as if she were fighting more than one opponent, so the different strikes from different areas and such made much more sense to her. Closing her eyes, she'd exhale slightly before sending chakra into her eyes. When they opened once again, she'd look Paine over completely, looking at her differently.

And then it started. Nina would quickly strike out towards the girls leg, kicking it to get Paine started with the spinning. After she had done that, she'd turn over to the other side that the strike was about to come from, and she would easily punch the arm back the other way, an ongoing experience that she would continue until she had passed or been struck. She did not slow down, and seemed to keep pace with the spinning of Paine.* - Sat Nov  7 16:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) noticed the change in the arms, which caused her to strike quickly and react even quicker. Ducking down for the arm that reached up, Nina would quickly grab the second arm that was coming towards her, before kicking the girls leg to get her spinning once again. This was the least she could do.* - Sat Nov  7 16:33:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Maybe ten? - Sun Nov  8 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Fifteen? - Sun Nov  8 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I'll have one, because I'm not a jackass like you. - Mon Nov  9 00:00:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Too bad you're more focused on hating me than working together. - Mon Nov  9 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Working together? That's actually a nice idea. - Mon Nov  9 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yeah. Right. Until I can't put my full attention on you, then you go and fuck around with my bestfriend. - Mon Nov  9 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: And pull the "i was lonely" card. - Mon Nov  9 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I don't even know who your best friend is.  - Mon Nov  9 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: You were never -around- to tell me. - Mon Nov  9 00:02:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: How was I supposed to know that. - Mon Nov  9 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I barely talked to him. - Mon Nov  9 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: But when he was around we had bestfriend times. - Mon Nov  9 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: More than you, anyway. - Mon Nov  9 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yet you kissed him. Then he goes around gloating he fucked "Ortho's little sister" around Sunagakure. - Mon Nov  9 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Ever since he and I fought in Kirigakure. - Mon Nov  9 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Smart, Nina. Smart. - Mon Nov  9 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Maybe you shouldn't have fought then, smart ass. - Mon Nov  9 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That little 'games' he play is just a hit list. - Mon Nov  9 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Maybe I shouldn't have fought? He attacked me. - Mon Nov  9 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Or were you too blinded by Ortho Hate - Mon Nov  9 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: To see that? - Mon Nov  9 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: And then when we calmed you both down, what happened? - Mon Nov  9 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: You shot a fireball at him. - Mon Nov  9 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Instead of calming the hell down. - Mon Nov  9 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Right. - Mon Nov  9 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Nina allows to throw a fit when shit don't settle for her. - Mon Nov  9 00:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: But when Ortho gets tired of something and throws a fit. - Mon Nov  9 00:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: He's wrong. - Mon Nov  9 00:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Yep. - Mon Nov  9 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Anyway, stop fighting and lets "work together" as you suggested. - Mon Nov  9 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You're too conflicted for us to work together. - Mon Nov  9 00:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Well when I suggest something and you try to deny it like that. - Mon Nov  9 00:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Then yeah. - Mon Nov  9 00:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Just like when I say something and you're quick to jump down my throat? We have a love-hate relationship as siblings. Organizing a way for us to "work together" will have us argue. - Mon Nov  9 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Instead of thnking about "working together", we just do it. - Mon Nov  9 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No questions asked, just actions. - Mon Nov  9 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Yeah, but that'd be better with practice and talking. - Mon Nov  9 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: What we do while working together is fine, that can be discussed. - Mon Nov  9 00:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: But to sit down and talk about feelings, hate, love, all that mess.. no. - Mon Nov  9 00:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No thank you. - Mon Nov  9 00:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: But... - Mon Nov  9 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) was suddenly hugged, her head turning away from the hug before turning her head back towards him. "Oh yeah?" She'd smile and wrap her arms around Ortho's body, increasing the strength in the hug until he gave in. This was definitely the start of a whole new world, que music.* - Mon Nov  9 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Oh how sweet. - Mon Nov  9 00:20:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) was suddenly lifted up by the constricting snakes, a smirk on her face as she looks down at him. She hadn't even seemed worried. "Aww, you call it a love-hate relationship but can't handle a little tough love?" She'd giggle a little bit and look down at the snakes, and then back up at Ortho. "How about letting me down, will 'ya?"* - Mon Nov  9 00:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) was hugged this time, unable to lift her arms up from him holding them down. She'd groan and turn her head away from him, holding her breath it seemed. "It'd be easier if you ever took a shower. I need to get some perfume for you."* - Mon Nov  9 00:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) blinked a little and turned over to the girl who had walked away. "Seriously though, who's your new girlfriend? Is she fun?"* - Mon Nov  9 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) shrugged and turned around, walking over to the girl that was oh so far away. As she got closer, she'd look up at the old girl, waving at her. "Hi, who are you? I'm Nina."* - Mon Nov  9 00:50:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) blinked a little and pointed back at him. "Why were you saved by him? He's selfish." She'd shake her head and grab the girl by the hand, beginning to walk her back over towards where everyone is at. "No no no no no, I'll be the one protecting you. I'm better for it anyway."* - Mon Nov  9 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: My name is Nina, mhm. - Mon Nov  9 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Mon Nov  9 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) smiled and looked back at Owari. "I am twelve, and I am the best twelve year old around. I'm stronger than Ortho, that I am." She'd nod a few times and continue walking at a quickened pace, seemingly just happy at life itself.* - Mon Nov  9 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) whispers: Ah..that's what I've decided to call Owari.. - Mon Nov  9 01:07:50 2015
