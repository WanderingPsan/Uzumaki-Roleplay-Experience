<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) decided to continue with her attack, taking the kick to the face while repeatedly kicking up into the air. Her nose would begin bleeding from the attack, and her body was slightly strained as she defied gravity and continued kicking Paine up into the air, before finally kicking Paine upwards with her back facing the ground and Kinami falling down to the ground swiftly. Paine seemed to sort of float in the air for some reason, it was really a spectacle. While on the ground, Kinami would wipe the blood from her nose, before looking up at the woman and smiling. Her signature attack was up next.

Without a word, Kinami would suddenly jump up, disappearing in an instant. She would appear behind Paine in the perfect shadow of her, every inch of their body part the exact same. And, out of nowhere, Kinami woul send a slow and weak kick to her left side. This attack was easily able to be blocked, and when it was, the action would really kick off quickly. Twisting her body, she'd quickly kick Paine in the opposite side, using the moment of her blocking to take advantage of her opening. From that kick, she'd grin and use the momentum and torque to spin and kick her once more, this time in the chest. 

All of these attacks were adding more and more momentum to them falling to the ground, but Kinami knew exactly how much time it would take. With yet another kick, she would inflict another attack on Paine while finally getting the higher ground in the air. And now, was the final kick that would hopefully prove her taijutsuship. Throwing her leg widely, she'd aim to kick Paine directly in the stomach at the exact same moment that she was hitting the ground, causing the two opposite forces to collide in the center of her belly. As well, she aimed to leave Paine in a crator in the ground, flipping away from her and letting her stance drop, wondering how Paine would take that attack.* - Fri Nov 20 06:48:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Sat Nov 21 01:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) stared off at Aza as he moved forward. Her eyes focused on how he moved and held himself, it didn't seem he was much of a taijutsu fighter just yet, but you could never be too sure at any moment. As the fist came her way, she'd be well into her basic fighting stance, her Kung Fu stance, before looking out at the fist. Throwing her hand forward, she'd aim to grab the fist and halt the attack, before pushing him back a bit. "If you're going to spar me, at least take it halfway serious, that's all I ask." She'd smile and wink at him, getting back into her stance and looking at him.* - Sat Nov 21 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: mmm... - Sat Nov 21 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) smiled as she took a step back and pulled her fist back. She wasn't really getting serious for a while, she was just playing around. But since he wanted to see her seriously, she'd fight a bit more seriously. As the fist came her way, she'd turn her body to the left, her eyes quickly turning to look upon her opponent. With her hands being pulled up quickly, she'd punch forward directly at his nose, deciding to hold back a bit on the damage just in case he wasn't much of a defensive fighter.* - Sat Nov 21 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: O-Oh.. - Sat Nov 21 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: Alright.. - Sat Nov 21 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt her punch connect against his cheek, feeling a certain toughness over it. Jumping back slightly, she'd look at him now, wondering what had come over him. She'd blink quite a bit, before smirking. "Heh, you don't scare me away. It's now just an obstacle I need to overcome!" After saying that, Kinami would shake her body a bit by jumping and waving her arms, before looking intently at Aza. It seemed she was getting a bit more serious as well.

Running forward quickly, Kinami would pull both of her arms up to her chest, hands balled up into fists. Without any word of caution, Kinami would throw a quick punch towards his face once again, and quickly move to the side just in case he tried to attack. After that attack, whether he flinched or not, Kinami would quickly do a small spin before throwing a roundhouse kick towards his head as well.* - Sat Nov 21 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Big pappy) thinks: I wouldn't ever let either of them get close to me. I'd put  them to sleep before hand... - Sat Nov 21 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) watched as she still hadn't done any damage to him, not even a little bit. All of her strength was put into those attacks and they didn't do anything. Sighing lightly, she'd continue to look at him intently, noticing him dashing forward at her with the intent to attack her. Kinami was still quicker than him, however, so she wasn't really too worried about that.

Moving in one swift motion, Kinami would use her taijutsu prowess to quickly spin and take a step to the side. But, during that spin of her getting out of the way, Kinami would quickly take this oppurtunity to attack him once more. Her leg would quickly shoot out and aim to kick him square in the jaw, hopefully launching him upward even a little bit. She hadn't expected it to damage him in the slightest, but at least it would raise him up just a tad bit.

If this had worked, Kinami would quickly lean forward to do a handstand before pushing her body up quickly. She aimed to kick up multiple times into his chin and chest, knowing that his body wouldn't feel it at all but getting his body higher up into the sky, his body hopefully suspended in the air as Kinami kicked off towards the ground, doing a small flip to land on the ground. "Hehe, now it's time for my signature technique.~"* - Sat Nov 21 02:51:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) quickly fell back down to the ground swiftly, looking up to the arm that was shooting her way from his body. Without any hesitation, Kinami would look forward before moving at top speed. As the arm came crashing down towards her, Kinami would swiftly jump up and land on it, before kicking off of it with all of her strength and speed, suddely disappearing from the area.

The next place they would see her directly underneath Aza, her body the exact same as his positioning, as if he were her shadow. Throwing her legs out quickly, she would aim to kick Aza a good three times in the air, their body quickly spinning and falling towards the ground at the same time. For the final kick, she'd aim to land it directly in the stomach the moment he hit the ground.* - Sat Nov 21 03:25:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) nodded, and followed after Akira. "To make things fair, I'll only use one arm as well."* - Sat Nov 21 11:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) nodded as she looked at Akira, smiling at him as she nodded at him. Without a moment of hesitation, Kinami would pull her arm into her shirt sleeve and move her arm behind her back, leaving her no chance at all to use her other arm without ripping her shirt completely. "Would you like to begin, or shall I?" She'd grin once again and wonder about his answer.* - Sat Nov 21 11:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You can... - Sat Nov 21 11:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Are you sure? - Sat Nov 21 11:53:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah...just start... - Sat Nov 21 11:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) shrugged a little and ducked down slightly. After that, she'd run forward swiftly, her body accelerating in bursts of speed. It was almost amazing, if she had actually been fast. But regardless, Kinami closed the gap quickly with her one arm outside of her shirt balled into a powerful fist. She'd smile slightly as she approached.

When she looked him in his eyes, she'd punch forward towards his lower jaw, aiming to knock him around lightly with restrained strength just to test the waters a bit. She wanted to see if he would be able to dodge or tank the attacks, or if they'd just simply get knocked out or so from an attack like that.* - Sat Nov 21 11:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) looked over at Akira as he staggered backwards. Kinami would frown slightly as she turned to look at her grandpa. "What am I sparring him for Grandpa? He's really injured, it's not a ploy or anything at all." Turning back over towards Akira, she'd look at the fist coming up towards her chin. The moment it connected, Kinami would smile lightly. Her head wouldn't have moved at all, not even a little bit. It wasn't even an inch of movement. Kinami simply looked at him. "It's okay to give up now if you'd like. But I'll continue if you're willing."* - Sat Nov 21 12:16:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I won't stop you. - Sat Nov 21 13:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) blinked as she saw Paine simply poke Akira in the bum, sending him flying up and such. That wasn't really a technique that she wanted to be involved with at all, but it did show how strong she was with the simple poke in the butt. She chuckled a little bit, revenge was served and she didn't even have to lift a muscle at all. It was a great satisfaction to her. But when she turned and saw him grab a kunai, things were a bit more serious.

Moving quickly, Kinami would move in front of him without hesitation, lifting her right arm as swiftly as she could. With said arm, she'd block his arm, and therefore stop the kunai from hitting her. And with the left arm, Kinami would bring her fist up and send a powerful straight punch towards Akira, aiming to punch him square in the chest and send him flying back and away from everyone in the area that he could possibly danger.* - Sat Nov 21 13:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt her fist connect with her target, knocking Akira back as she had blood splattered on her as he coughed from the attack. This was growing old, and it was getting much ore dangerous. When she saw Akira put the kunai in his mouth and reach for another, she would slightly spread her legs to be shoulders width apart, taking her judo stance and preparing to end this quickly.

The moment he threw the kunai, Kinami would burst off quickly, hopefully moving faster than Akira could even register. As she moved, she aimed to zig zag forward and close the distance on Akira, her fists balled up once again. Using her speed to her advantage, she'd take a full-power swing at him, throwing her fist forward and pushing back with it after it connected. If it did connect, it would probably kill him, perhaps shattering and caving in his chest completely. Unless he had a trick up his sleeve, which who would know if he did or not?* - Sat Nov 21 13:37:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt the chest push inward the moment she punched him. Turning her head to Muhammed, she'd look down at the blood on her clothing and her face, not knowing how to really react to that feeling. She knew what she signed up for as a kunoichi, but this wasn't what she had expected. "I....killed someone..."* - Sat Nov 21 13:59:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) blinked a little as she thought she understood what she wanted to see. Bringing her arm up, Kinami would throw a quick and powerful punch out, a very trained one after all. Kinami was a wonderful boxer after all.* - Sat Nov 21 14:17:10 2015

Throwing her fist forward, she'd punch extremely hard, letting the sweat listerally be thrown off of her arm and the air to slightly quiver from the power and speed of it.* - Sat Nov 21 14:24:51 2015

"I'd much rather spar you than sit here and punch the air six hundred times. I've done that enough in the academy. You're too busy for me anyway, right?" She'd cross her arms as she looked at Paine. That sentence kind of upset her a bit, causing her to lash out as she was doing.* - Sat Nov 21 14:37:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: This is a waste of time. - Sat Nov 21 17:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) looked over at Chikyu as she spoke, allowing it to flow into one ear and out of the other. She didn't even know who this random woman was, and she was trying to tell Kinami how to go about training? Such disrespect, much offensive, many rudeness. Even though she held the upbringing of respect outside, it honestly went into one ear and out of the other. Without even turning to look at her, the girl began to speak.

"I have done this already, my base is as good as it'll ever be. I've done right jabs at least two-hundred thousand times in my life, as well as left jabs, right and left hooks, crosses, and kicks. My entire life is taijutsu, so why would I want to sit around and do this all over again?" Crossing her arms without really caring for her response, she'd look over at the woman in front of her known as Paine, wondering if she'd speak at all. "I don't mean to disrespect your methods, but this is simply useless for me. I have focused on nothing but taijutsu all of my life, and going back to this is stupid. It's like going back and crawling after learning how to walk."* - Sat Nov 21 17:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Well how about this, let us spar and see which one of us is better. If I lose, I'll keep doing this little punches that I've been doing since I was three. - Sat Nov 21 17:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) chuckled and turned to begin walking a bit. "It'll be fine, she doesn't want me to do anything but straight punches anyway. She honestly could give a crap less about what I can do." After saying that, she'd spin around and look at her opponent, cracking her knuckles. She believed one hundred percent in what she just said.* - Sat Nov 21 17:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Lord Hassan it's a pleasure to see you. - Sat Nov 21 17:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) chuckled slightly as she looked up at Chikyu. She hadn't been taught a single thing except how to finger someone without their permission, and how to do a right jab that she'd been doing for her entire life. It wasn't much of anything to teach, but she wouldn't say anything, she was more focused on the fact that she of all people was called disrespectful. It was quite amusing to her.

Moving forward now, she wouldn't hesitate even a little bit as her body took her forward quickly. Kinami would be fighting in her judo stance right now, and was moving off of pure instinct. To think too much before acting would give much less time to react. As she grew closer to the girl who had a large sword, Kinami would quickly pull her arm up and attempt to throw a basic right punch towards Chikyu's nose, which she always did to start off a battle.* - Sat Nov 21 18:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Hm...Watching these two and having this broken arm has made me realise I need to work on my taijutsu more... - Sat Nov 21 18:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) watched as her arm was suddenly redirected, smiling slightly. This meant that the girl would actually be somewhat of a challange. With a smile, she'd eye the sword coming towards her throat, and turn her body to the side without any hesitation. This would most likely cause the attack to miss her all together, and give her the time to attack. With a sudden movement, she'd throw her right leg up and forward, aiming to smack it hard into Chikyu.

This time there was no holding back, she shot forth the quickest kick that she could towards her stomach, and after it connected Kinami would push forward with it even more, which would most likely cause the girl to be sent flying back from the force of the impact. If this had worked, Kinami would grin slightly. "You're pretty good, you might make an actual nice rival."* - Sat Nov 21 18:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) smiled as she decided to attack after the girl had retreated all of the way she had wanted to. Waving her hand widely, she'd chuckle. "Come on, why are you backing away?" After saying that, she'd take a simple step forward before saying, "I have to show you what respect really is.~" With that, Kinami decided to get much more serious with the spar, deciding to end this a bit quicker. Without holding back, Kinami would shoot forward, moving at 90 miles per hour while pushing herself to the max.

It seemed that she'd attack from the front, but this wasn't the case. "Behind you!" With this being said, she'd wonder how Chikyu would react to this, but regardless of what she did, Kinami knew exactly how she would attack the girl. Appearing on her side, Kinami would quickly kick her leg upward from a crouched position, aiming it just under the girls chin to send her upwards towards the air. * - Sat Nov 21 18:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) grinned as she turned her head to Chikyu, who was soaring up into the air. This left her stranded, unable to really get any leverage from the ground. Crouching down slightly, she'd chuckle before saying, "You've lost." It was her signature move, and it was quite an effective one. As she jumped, she'd quite literally disappear from view, perhaps causing people to look around for her, yet she wouldn't be found if they were looking on the ground. She mirrored Chikyu's stance perfectly, almost as if she were the girls shadow.

But there was much more than that. Kinami quickly moved her left leg outwards, quickly sending a powerful kick towards the girls hip. This, however, was slower than any other of the kicks, which made it an easy block. But whether the girl blocked or not, Kinami would use that leverage to continue her attack, quickly throwing her right leg smashing into Chikyu's right side while she was blocking the other attack. These kicks were devastating, and most likely damaged her quite a bit.

Kinami wasn't done with just that kick, however. After that kick, she slowly began gaining the higher ground, kicking the girl once again on her right side with a devastating kick to the upper arm, perhaps even fracturing if she weren't powerful enough to take the attacks head on. And then, as they came falling towards the ground, the final kick came. This was send directly into Chikyu's stomach, connecting the moment she hit the ground. Two colliding forces as gravity and her kick pulled her down towards the ground, the focal point being the center of her stomach. After using that technique, Kinami would kick off and do two simple backflips, landing a bit of ways away.* - Sat Nov 21 18:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) smiled lightly as she felt the grip on her leg. However, that wasn't the only attack that she had. She still had arms, two of them. As her leg was grabbed, she'd quickly react, not allowing her to complete her technique. Instead, moving simply on instinct, she'd reach out and grip her shirt, smiling. "Fine then, lets play chicken!" Pulling her right arm back, she'd chuckle before sending a powerful punch towards her right arm. It wasn't to break it, and hopefully it wouldn't fracture it either. But it'd definitely be a pain to use.* - Sat Nov 21 19:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt her punch being completely interrupted by the wrapping of the girls legs around her neck, deciding that this is what would end the spar for Chikyu. This time there would be no holding back. Wrapping her legs around Chikyu's neck as well, she'd smile and tighten them with all of her strength. And from there, using her superior strength, she'd try to squeeze the girls neck into submission until she was weak from the lack of air. Kinami would also flop the girl down towards the ground, meaning that if she couldn't gain the upper hand, she'd crash down into the ground right on top of her own head.* - Sat Nov 21 19:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Maybe I should get Koji's opinion as well...maybe later. - Sat Nov 21 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt the legs gripping her throat, attempting to cut off her breath. This was a dangerous situation for the both of them. Bringing her hands up quickly, she'd grab both of the girls legs and rip them away, freeing her throat and allowing her to breath. As for Chikyu and her soon to be head crashing into the ground, Kinami would quickly push herself off of the girls body, attempting to rip free of the girls leg grip as well with all of her power.

If she was able to do this, she'd flip until she was able to land on her feet. And, from there, she'd push her arms out to grab Chikyu bridal style, before placing her on the ground. She didn't know if Chikyu could hit the ground and survive that easily, so it'd be much easier to save her from taking any damage at all.* - Sat Nov 21 19:33:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt the smack on the back and took no damage because she had that super body. Turning her head to Chikyu, she'd chuckle. "Psh, you should do damage to me before talking about my mistakes.~" With a wink, she'd chuckle and tease her new rival.* - Sat Nov 21 20:11:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) blinked a little as she quickly spread her legs to be shoulder width, making sure that she got into her judo stance as soon as Momura ran forward. Using this moment to lift her leg, she aimed to do what some fighters were able to do in the ufc, which was a one hit KO. But she held back, not knowing how much damage the girl could take. Throwing her right foot up, she'd aim to straighten out her leg and knock out two birds with one stone. As she kicked her leg out, the idea was that her upper leg, around her knee area, would smack the arm off course while her foot connected to Momura's head. But of course, that was only the plan of what would happen.* - Sat Nov 21 21:32:22 2015

Faster than even Kinami, and while that wasn't all that surprising, she didn't really expect it from any of the genin. Then again, she only assumed that Momura was a genin in the first place. The bullet, however, wasn't moving nearly as fast as she was, so that was easily picked up on. As the black bullet came towards her, Kinami would shift her head to the side, allowing it to fly over her. However, her eyes widened as she saw the girl coming in for a quick sweep.

Her legs were clipped quickly, however she didn't take any damage from it. The girl must've been holding back as Kinami was. And since she wasn't focused on the damage since she didn't feel any, Kinami took it upon herself to take advantage of her own attack. As she felt her legs being kicked from underneath her, the girl would throw both hands onto the ground quickly, quickly getting a glimpse of Momura since she was much slower while attacking. Kinami, however, was quite the opposite.

Throwing one of her heels towards Momura's temple, she aimed to end this. Her attack would be a quick blur of uncomprehensible movement, and aimed to knock the girl unconcious at least for a few seconds, enough for her to be declared the winner. She would still hold back on the power since she didn't want to break any bones, but she was hoping to knock the girl out from the attack.* - Sat Nov 21 21:53:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) looked over at the two and chuckled a little bit. "Hey, hey. Keep it pg thirteen around here."* - Sat Nov 21 23:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: D-Do you want a m-massage to kinami? - Sat Nov 21 23:31:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Hmph.~ - Sat Nov 21 23:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) watched Momura's hands lift up to her sides. Luckily, it wasn't a super sensitive tickling spot to the average human. Like....say for instance.....the arm pit! Using her quick hand speed, she'd shoot a single and underneath one of the girls arms and begin tickling their arm pit, using the other arm to play in the girls hair while looking over at Chikyu and watching her.* - Sat Nov 21 23:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) decided to make sure Momura would be laughing for quite a bit, deciding to make her feel the wrath of the most op tickling jutsu in existance. Standing up from underneath Momura's head, Kinami's hands would shoot right down to Momura's neck. With extremely light brushes and quick hands, Kinami would tickle multiple spots before they had the time to react. From there, she'd tickle the neck, them move to the armpits and brush down her sides with extremely light yet ticklish movements. From there, she'd brush over the girls belly, and allowed Chikyu to handle the feet. From the movement, she aimed to cause it all to hit her at once, all of the tickling power to shoot into the center of her body and explode outwards. That's the power of the tickling!!!* - Sat Nov 21 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) smiled as she looked at Momura. She was at their mercy, but at the same time, Chikyu was as well, and it'd be unfair if only she got tickled right? Moving quickly, Kinami would turn around quickly with the same hand speed and use the same technique on Chikyu, all of it would hit her at once and she'd most likely burst out laughing. She was, indeed, a tickling master!* - Sat Nov 21 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) moved quickly enough to catch Momura in the act. Instead of getting tickled, she'd lift up Chikyu's arms even higher to amplify the tickling done to Chikyu, and then back away from what was happening. She totally wasn't involved in that for now.* - Sun Nov 22 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) sat there with a stone face, because she wasn't ticklish.* - Sun Nov 22 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) tried to slip out of the area while sending a tickle here and there. She was too sexy for all of this.* - Sun Nov 22 00:07:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) sighed and wrapped her hands around Chikyu and Momura. "Fine then, be like that!" After saying that, she'd use her strength the flip the two over and onto the ground, and use that time to jump away.* - Sun Nov 22 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) was totally not involved in that, she was staying away from that completely.* - Sun Nov 22 00:13:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: We weren't tryiing to kill you. Just make you laugh! - Sun Nov 22 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) leapt to the side and grapped a pillow, smacking Momura lightly across the face with it. "Don't you dare!~"* - Sun Nov 22 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) raises her pillow similar to how that one guy raised Sokka in Avatar in that riot scene. "I am the Queen of Pillows! Hahaha!"* - Sun Nov 22 00:17:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) scoffed loudly as she had been challanged. "Betrayer!" She'd swing the pillow wildly at Chikyu, aiming to hit her in the sides with it.* - Sun Nov 22 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: S-She's gonna use me a-as a pillow. - Sun Nov 22 00:21:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) was suddenly grabbed inappropriately, her face turning a bright shade of red as her hand quickly shot behind her and she kung fu flipped Momura over on her butt. "I told you to keep it pg thirteen, that's not very pg thirteen of you!"* - Sun Nov 22 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Why'd you touch my butt? - Sun Nov 22 01:13:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Why would Hanai be worried about that? - Sun Nov 22 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: I don't know, but he will! - Sun Nov 22 01:24:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Its not like, Momura is a lesbian... so what would be so bad about her squeezing your butt? Guys slap each others butts all the time. - Sun Nov 22 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Hmph. Next time you guys do it, the queen of pillows and her followers shall rampage. - Sun Nov 22 01:28:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) noticed the sudden grabbing of a pillow, which made Kinami drop down to her hands. Moving swiftly, she'd aim to sweep Chikyu off of her feet before rising up. If all happened successfully, she'd be holding Chikyu bridal style with a grin. "You're so slow, hehe.~"* - Sun Nov 22 01:33:00 2015

Without a second thought, Kinami would push the girls hand down with full force, stopping only if she thought she was about to break Chikyu's arm.* - Sun Nov 22 02:38:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) slides over in front of him, and places her arm out, elbow on the table. "Come on Hanai, do it for her ice cream.~"* - Sun Nov 22 02:42:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) smiled as she put her much smaller arm against his and wrapped her hand around his. She'd let her small muscle bulge up just a bit, but it was still nothing compared to a toned mans arm. "Maybe.~"* - Sun Nov 22 02:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) would begin pushing back against Hanai as well, feeling her hand being pushed back down towards the table, she'd found someone much stronger than her now. With a slight grin, she'd grip the hand tighter, trying to use her durability to keep her in place just a bit longer and get Hanai to struggle against the pushing.* - Sun Nov 22 02:48:06 2015
