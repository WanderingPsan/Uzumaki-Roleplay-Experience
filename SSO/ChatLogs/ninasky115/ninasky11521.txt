<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: M-mmmmm.... - Sat Nov 28 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) nodded and looked over at the rock as it slid. Pulling up her arm so that it held horizontally to her chest, her shoulder poking out towards the rock, Kinami would grin a little. Moving forward quickly, Kinami would thrust her elbow back with assistance from her other hand, pushing the elbow even further into the target.* - Sat Nov 28 20:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: a-again - Sat Nov 28 20:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) groaned as she already knew how this was about to go. So, she prepared to do this -same- move over thirty times because that's what was about to happen. Stepping back a bit, she'd pull her arm up once again and throw it forward, using the other arm as support once again to smash against the boulder and push it back slightly.* - Sat Nov 28 20:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yi(Rikuto Katsu) thinks: Ooh, so cool!  - Sat Nov 28 20:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) stepped back as she felt her elbow connecting with the rock. It tickled a little when she made contact. Stepping back a little before staring the rock down, Kinami would bring her elbow up once again. Rushing forward even more, she'd throw her elbow into the rock, but this time she paused before thrusting her other hand into the closed fist.* - Sat Nov 28 20:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) quickly did a backflip after landing the attack, taking two steps back when she landed, before shooting forward once again. Kinami took no hesitation against the rock, knowing that it wouldn't suddenly surprise-attack her or anything of that sort. As her elbow connected with the rock once again, she'd push said rock back with a grin.

And then she'd take a step back, rotating her body just slightly and thrusting the arm into the rock once more to push it back again. This, of course, showed that she was showing some skill in the technique after all. She was pretty good at it, but she hadn't perfected anything just yet.* - Sat Nov 28 20:58:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) read the scroll continuously as she went over it. She wasn't sure what she was going to teach exactly, but she could always just teach a few things in one sitting. She could definitely teach what taijutsu is, and the difference of it compared to ninjtusu or genjutsu. This, of course, was quite obvious to her along with other things.

As she walked into the classroom, she looked around to see the different types of students that were in there. There seemed to be some that seemed physically fit as well as some that were physically frail. She could tell who could be taijutsu user and who couldn't simply based on how they looked. But maybe that would all change in time.

With a bright smile, Kinami would look at each of the students personally before speaking. "Hi, my name is Kinami." She didn't expect any of them to know who she was at all. After she said that, she smiled and sat down in the chair behind the desk. "I'm one of the old Kazekage's grandchildren. He was a really great ninja."

"Who all wants to become the Kazekage here?" After she asked that and watched the hands go up, Kinami would smile and nod her head. "That's wonderful. It's good to have aspiring goals. If you're lucky, you'll become great ninja!" She considered being the positive reasoning that the shinobi needed to hear.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: Well, why not? You don't have any type of earth jutsu to let you do that? I saw you come up out of the ground before. - Mon Nov 30 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: I'll handle the scouting them while I'm guarding. - Mon Nov 30 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: How can you scout if you're here guarding the flag? - Mon Nov 30 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (kuro, problem is) - Mon Nov 30 01:29:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Don't question my skills kiddo. - Mon Nov 30 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: Well, I suppose you have something under your sleeve. - Mon Nov 30 01:30:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Hm? - Mon Nov 30 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) says: And we have a late entry.. - Mon Nov 30 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) says: Damn. - Mon Nov 30 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) says: This would be great if Mizora wasn't sick. - Mon Nov 30 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Who's team? - Mon Nov 30 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) says: I'm deciding. - Mon Nov 30 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) thinks: Bah. This makes things uneven and unfair.. - Mon Nov 30 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Four on three. - Mon Nov 30 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) says: No. - Mon Nov 30 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) says: Hideo will be on the other team. - Mon Nov 30 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) says: Your points will be changed accordingly to accomodate. - Mon Nov 30 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Don't worry Ai, we're not dumb little kids. - Mon Nov 30 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: We're shinobi just like you. - Mon Nov 30 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Not that, I like to finish things without my teammates taking damage. - Mon Nov 30 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Sanoke. - Mon Nov 30 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: When do we start? - Mon Nov 30 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: I'm not sure what Izanami can do, and Paine can damage me quite well. If you handle those two, I can handle the others. - Mon Nov 30 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: With backup from Kuro. - Mon Nov 30 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Get into ya places then. - Mon Nov 30 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) nodded as she stook a step forward. "Kuro, you should hide yourself." After she said this, she'd sigh. This was going to be quite boring for a while. She didn't really have a job until they found the flag or their flag was being attacked, and so she just waited.* - Mon Nov 30 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Hand me the scroll. - Mon Nov 30 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) hands her the scroll.* - Mon Nov 30 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) says: Koji. I want you to proctor. - Mon Nov 30 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) says: Be on the field, and observe the two teams. - Mon Nov 30 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) says: I'll be taking your opinion over their performance. - Mon Nov 30 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: No one that can handle seals, no one can take it. - Mon Nov 30 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Hold onet me see if an admin will fix my grab - Mon Nov 30 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Dick.. - Mon Nov 30 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Hm, it was a good idea. - Mon Nov 30 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Why not bury it under the flag and cover it with sand? They won't expect that, they'll expect it to be on one of us. - Mon Nov 30 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: I'll take it into paper with me.. - Mon Nov 30 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Eh, go ahead. - Mon Nov 30 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) nodded, and walked forward with the scroll. Lifting the flag up, she'd dig a bit of ways underneath the sand and place the scroll. And then she'd cover the scroll with sand and put the flag back down.* - Mon Nov 30 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: Now, the only other precaution I can think of is to have a decoy scroll... - Mon Nov 30 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) thinks: And the way that I put it, if they do happen to get our flag, they can't get our scroll without knowing it's directly under the flag. - Mon Nov 30 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Alright. - Mon Nov 30 01:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Osmanesanogo) says: .. - Mon Nov 30 01:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) saw the paper rise up to block the shuriken, as well as her eyes looking upwards. "Attacking from above? Must be Iza. Neither of the other two can do that." She couldn't really attack the girl from long range, so without any worry, she'd run towards the windmill that was stuck in the ground. Running around it to do a quick overview, she would reach out and grab it if she knew that it didn't have any explosive tags directly in view. And if it wasn't, she'd look up at Izanami. Gripping the weapon hard, she'd throw the giant windmill back up into the sky towards her, however her aim faltered and the windmill flew way past her. * - Mon Nov 30 02:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) whispers: As is21.8 stength is 26.9 and tai is 29.51 Nami) - Mon Nov 30 02:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) whispers: Need anything else?) - Mon Nov 30 02:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) 's eyes blinked as she noticed Hiroshi suddenly appearing out of nowhere. It took her by surprise as she was suddenly kicked in the chest, her body being blown back a bit until she caught herself on the ground. Two against one wasn't something she could do easily, especially not on her own. "Jeez, looks like you've gotten stronger. But I've been holding back as well. Hehe." Spreading her legs a bit, she'd get into her Kung Fu stance. But then, something happened....

Out of nowhere, Kinami's muscles seemed to get slightly buffer as she began to yell. She was sweating slightly already, but it was clear that something was different about her. Moving forward without any hesitation, Kinami seemed to blur through the air, her body appearing next to Hiroshi. With that, her foot seemed to swing towards his temple, aiming to knock him out quickly with one attack since she could only focus on one person at a time.* - Mon Nov 30 02:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (speed 14.4, as 17) - Mon Nov 30 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) whispers: Not u but whats da damage?) - Mon Nov 30 02:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (54 rounded up.) - Mon Nov 30 02:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (and it's non-lethal. if it's in lethal damage then just take the KO, if you're taking the hit that is) - Mon Nov 30 02:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) whispers: O god girl) - Mon Nov 30 02:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) whispers: Dura twice right?) - Mon Nov 30 02:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) whispers: What did I just do to myself LOL) - Mon Nov 30 02:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt the attack connect with his body, her body quickly dropping her stance but still zooming forward. After the attack, Kinami would continue to press the attack, following aafter Hiroshi after he was sent flying most likely. This time, she appeared in front of Hiroshi and pulled her fists up to punch him hard in the center of his stomach, lifting him up and them bringing it crashing down onto the ground. After she did that, she'd allow her gate to drop since the attack would've most likely knocked him out.* - Mon Nov 30 02:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) whispers: U remember da as right?) - Mon Nov 30 02:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) felt the punch connect to his chest, most likely knocking him out. However, when he did that backflip, she felt the knee in her stomach connect, causing a bit of pain. Nothing that'd really stop her, but it was something to note. It hurt like hell. Kinami moved through the pain, however, and quickly went back to moving. Izanami was wide open, and she planned on taking advantage of that. She tossed Hiroshi -lightly- to the side where their base was, since he was knocked out and couldn't act.

Jumping off of the ground at full speed, she'd move at a blur towards Izanami. Since Izamani was also focused on grabbing the flag as well as Ai's clone, she felt that this was the perfect time to act. Appearing behind the girl, Kinami threw a powerful kick towards the back of her head, aiming to knock the girl out as well since she wasn't even paying Kinami any attention. She didn't hold back at all, but the plan was simply to knock her out, so it wasn't -full- power. (non-lethal.)* - Mon Nov 30 02:49:48 2015
