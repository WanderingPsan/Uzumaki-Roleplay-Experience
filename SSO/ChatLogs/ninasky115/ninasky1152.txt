<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked over at the water and sighed as she walked forward, her eyes looking over the water intently. She heard and watched Hideki do the technique just a few seconds ago, and so she was going to learn how to get on this water and not only walk, but skate over it. Pushing chakra into her feet, she'd take the first step on the water, but instead just fell into the water underneath her. "What the heck..."

After pulling herself back up from the water and crawling out of it, she'd sigh and stand up, turning her head over towards the water once again. Putting her chakra into her feet once again, she'd walk towards the water and slowly push her foot on top of it once more, feeling it grip on the water now. With a smile, she'd move her other foot over the water and feel it grip. And, after that, she'd began doing just what she said she'd do, literally skating over the water just for the fun of it.* - Fri Oct  9 16:14:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) started rushing out of her room as she heard all of the things going on outside, noticing that something had to happen. Turning her eyes towards the Anbu person, she'd quickly bring her hands up, knowing that she had to do something. She tried to make no sounds at all, her eyes locked onto him fully and completely. As her hands neared each other, they'd begin moving through the handseals quickly, knowing exactly what they were before even looking at them.

Pushing her head forward and allowing her eyes to dart towards where she'd take aim, she'd pick her targets carefully as she acted. Shooting forward the chakra built up in her body. she'd release the wind bullets to smack into him quite powerfully. They were aimed to hit him in the back of the head, the back of his left, and the back of his right knee. She shot two bullets for each, aiming to either knock him out or at least knock him off of his feet.* - Fri Oct  9 19:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) rushed into the room to see the dead body of Lyala. There was nothing she could do, even with her strongest jutsu, there wasn't anything she could do. She couldn't even cause a single injury. Gripping her fists together once again, she'd look down and close her eyes, allowing tears to begin streaming down her face. "Heiwa...."* - Fri Oct  9 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) sighed as she walked forward towards Heiwa, wrapping her arms around the boy and trying to drag him away. "Stop Heiwa, stop it now." She'd continue to try and pull him back, not caring for any hateful words or anything else that he could've done to her. She wasn't taking that at all, he had to keep his dignity now.

"You can grieve later."* - Fri Oct  9 21:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) picked up the scroll on the way out and kept dragging him out of the house. Bringing up a hand, she'd throw her hand forward and aim to slap him hard on the side of the face. "Snap out of it!"* - Fri Oct  9 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) kept dragging him away. "Hate me all you want, we're going."* - Fri Oct  9 21:54:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) felt her grip over Heiwa tighten as the blade was pressed against her neck, her eyes having tears already flowing into them. "Fine. Kill me, I'm trying to help him get to his family." She hadn't wanted to spill the beans, hoping that Heiwa would tell her so that she didn't have to.* - Fri Oct  9 22:22:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Unless he attack 2 weeks from now - Sat Oct 10 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) pulled her fists up quickly, similar to how Annie fought. Moving forward with what seemed like calculated steps, she'd take a quick step forward as the girl ran forward with her blade out. She had to be careful in this match, making sure to calculate everything that she did, while still staying on her toes since she had high-ranking people watching her. 

As the blade was swung, she'd take a step forward and duck down, hopefully moving quickly enough for the blade to move just over her head. And if that were successful, she'd throw forward her hands quickly and with power behind them. She aimed to hit the girl in her hips twice before quickly sliding back, preparing for another attack that would come at her.* - Sat Oct 10 05:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) felt the attack missing, her eyes trained on the girl as she seemingly danced around her. Moving forward as she continued forward with her momentum, she'd jump forward and jump as quickly as she could, her head moving forward before the rest of her body. As she was upside down, she'd train her eyes on Violet once more, presumably when the strike was happening.

If she was out of range of the strike, which she hopefully was, she'd pull her hands up and begin doing a quick series of handseals, she'd aim her head towards Violets' knees and her right wrist. Of course there was still a chance that she'd miss her intended targets, she just aimed to shoot her blunt bullets with enough force to effect her movement and her attacking arm. Though, this still left her stranded in the air and easily able to be hit.* - Sat Oct 10 06:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) quickly rotated her body and allowed her feet to skid against the ground. Pulling her head up, she'd push the handseals together once again, her eyes focusing on the good leg and releasing a barrage of them, aiming to at least her her twice in the knee, but she fired a total of five all together. Whether this had hit or not wouldn't be of her concern much.

Standing back up, she'd pull her boxing stance back up once again, her eyes trained on Violet. Hopefully this crippling would've turned the tide of battle, but of course she could still get serious with her kenjutsu and end the fight, which really wasn't a fight at all. Nina was simply trying to show her strategy of fighting when she absolutely had to.* - Sat Oct 10 06:28:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) moved forward and grabbed the three kunai by the handles, moving forward to hug her around the waist. "Thank you.~" After saying that, she'd spin around and start walking off, going to finish those missions and then her training.* - Sat Oct 10 16:47:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: One more Nina - Sat Oct 10 17:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) smiled at the Mizukage as she looked at the tall woman, turning her head and walking off with a sturdy stomp, as if she were one of the seven drawfs going off to the mines for work. She had her trusty orange hard hat and her shovel over her shoulder, like she was an actual construction worker. The nine year old looked cute in the outfit, or she thought so herself anyway.

As she looked at the giant mound of dirt that she had to fill a hole with, she felt a bit surprised. The dirt was almost taller than her, and she had to fill an entire hole with the mound. She'd sigh and stab the tip of the shovel into the large mound, pushing it as far in as she possibly could so that she could get a lot of the dirt at once. Pulling it back, she'd drop the dirt into the hole, and that'd begin the beginning of the cycle.

Moving back and forth, she'd stab into the dirt and move it into the hole, stab the dirt, into the hole. She did this repeatedly, getting more and more dirt into the hole. It was pretty boring, but she didn't know how to make it anymore fun. So, she'd just sit there, throwing the dirt back and forth. Some fell directly in the middle of the hole, and some fell against some of the walls on the outside.

After the hole was all filled up, nice and pretty, she'd pat it down with her shovel, nodding at her work. Moving back to a field, she'd grab some flowers and grass and everything. She'd try to make the dirt look as pretty as it possibly could before marching off. Looking towards the Mizukage, she'd look at her and smile, putting a thumb up towards her. "Construction worker Nina reporting for duty!~"* - Sat Oct 10 18:04:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked down at the scroll, reading what it said of course. Nodding as she read it, she'd run her finger over the words just to check and see, making sure that she hadn't missed a single word or anything like that. Turning her head to the water, she'd sigh and stand up, wondering if she could successfully learn it.* - Sat Oct 10 18:20:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) frowned as she walked home from the area into the house that she had built. Walking in, she'd grab her orange hard hat and the shovel that she had, and turn around back to the door. "Back to digging...." She'd sigh and walk out of the door, walking out towards the field where she had to dig the hole.

With a frown, she'd turn and stab the tip of the shovel into the ground, jumping up and landing on the edge to push a bigger portion of the shovel into the ground. Pulling back hard, she'd lift the large chunk of dirt and grass out of the ground and throw it behind her, She'd continue doing this, pulling the dirt back and throwing it back over her shoulder.

Wonderfully, all of the dirt would land on top of each other instead of falling around or anything like that. She'd continue the digging, bouncing on the shovel and pushing it deeper into the hole so that she could pull it back and throw it back on the big mound of dirt that had accumulated behind her.* - Sun Oct 11 21:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) sighed loudly as she turned around and saw the bodies on the ground, feeling sorry for them. Using all of her strength, she tried to pull the two bodies into the grave, hopefully they were together so that they could stay that way forever. And, she'd attempt to lightly lay them into their grave that Nina had just dug, laying them down with a thud after the bodies had slipped.

She'd sigh and turn her head over to the big mound of dirt, stabbing it with the big shovel that she held in her hands. Flicking it back into the ground, she'd allow the dirt to flow over the bodies, landing pretty hard and a small audible sound could hear about it.  Turning her body back towards the dirt mound, she'd shove her hands forward hard to get the shovel into the dirt.

Pulling it back from the mound, she'd spin around and flick the giant wad of dirt back into the hole and on top of the bodies. She'd do this continuously, spinning back and forth to grab more dirt and throw more dirt into the hole, covering the bodies quite quickly as she moved around to grab more and more dirt.

After she had finally filled it entirely, she'd smile and pat it down with the bottom of her shovel, turning back and running off somewhere for a while. After coming back, she'd smile and crouch down on the hole, putting those small petals of flowers on the hole. Hopefully this would help them rest more peacefully with each other and that they'd be alright in the afterlife.* - Sun Oct 11 21:31:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) says: So... Lera. Could you do the duty of taking care of me, since Violet hasn't? - Mon Oct 12 03:19:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I'm stuck in a wheelchair for the next two weeks. - Mon Oct 12 03:19:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I don't see how you maintained a romantic relationship like that. - Mon Oct 12 03:21:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Huh. - Mon Oct 12 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) looked off at Violet as she came forward. Pulling up her trusty kunai that she owned, she was finally able to use her new jutsu in an actual combat situation. Bringing her kunai up to her mouth, she'd blow a large amount of chakra onto the blade, allowing wind to flow over said kunai to the point where her wind chakra would cause it to be extremely sharp.

Looking up at Violet, who was completely outranking her, she'd aim to move forward and attack, but noticed that the girl had already moved. Trying to react quick enough, she'd quickly move to the side in an attempt to dodge the technique, but it wasn't any use. Instead of getting hit dead center of her stomach, she'd get hit more off to the side, not knocking the complete wind out of her.

As she was about to get tripped, she knew that she couldn't allow herself to get completely clowned, even by someone so much higher in rank than her. Jumping back, she'd force chakra into her feet to burst her even higher than her regular jump would, and as well she'd aim to throw the kunai down towards her with its enhanced wind power, hopefully preventing her from advancing too quickly.* - Mon Oct 12 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) landed on her feet, taking a few steps back before falling back on her butt, pushing chakra into said butt so that she wouldn't have to sink under the surface. Looking up, she'd frown, looking at Violet. "That's so unfair, you're super strong and fast."* - Mon Oct 12 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) frowned at her and took her hand to pull herself up. "You sound just like a parent. 'You can do this when you're older, you're not old enough yet.' So unfair." She'd pout and cross her arms, looking up at the woman.* - Mon Oct 12 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) was picked up and kissed on the forehead, seeking the oppurtunity. Pushing her hand forward, she'd poke the girl in the shoulder. "Sneak attack!!"* - Mon Oct 12 03:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) was flicked on the forehead, not very hard at all, and pout hard as ever. She'd cross her arms and fall on her butt, looking away from Violet.* - Mon Oct 12 04:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nina(Ninasky115) kept her arms crossed when she was placed on land, waiting for Violet to move so that she could follow. "I'll be mad at you forever, and ever!"* - Mon Oct 12 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: You will get over it I believe Nina...  - Mon Oct 12 04:11:18 2015
