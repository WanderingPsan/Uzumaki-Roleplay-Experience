<br><br><font color=yellow>*Noburo(Simple.Sloth) blinks, he thought it odd that the Mizukage would openly guard a gate when the would have much killing to do but a mental shrug and a scratch on his forearm later, the boy responded.

"Noburo, why're you out guardin'?"* - Fri Nov 13 05:03:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Noburo(Simple.Sloth) slowly strides towards the gate to assume his duty once again but someone else caught his attention as he made his way back. A pause between them let Noburo know that something was to be expected, seconds later a wave was issued. His tension faded slightly before raising a hand to return the wave.

"Hey....you're from here?" he inquired.* - Sat Nov 14 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Noburo(Simple.Sloth) blinked a few times as the elder individual spoke truly, at least to his knowledge. A nod would be issued afterwards and it would only be right to explain why he was asking lest the curiosity from Noburo's point of view can be percieved as sketchy and odd.

A hand rose to point towards the gates.

"Yeah I saw those new guys guarding the gates. So you're with them, eh?"* - Sat Nov 14 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Noburo(Simple.Sloth) wasn't exactly well versed with documentation when it came to the citizenship of Kirigakure but it was something he would embedd in his memory should he cross another who does not openly display their headband. He glared toward the paper and skimmed through the words to get the general idea. The child understood completely and bow like a little soldier before responding.

"Welcome to Kirigakure, sorry for the trouble Eiyu." with a smidge of militance in his voice.* - Sat Nov 14 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Noburo(Simple.Sloth) says: Is there anything else I can help you with? - Sat Nov 14 05:54:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Thank you. - Sat Nov 14 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Noburo(Simple.Sloth) waved back and nodded whilst he headed to the west.

"Your welcome, until next time."* - Sat Nov 14 05:57:32 2015
