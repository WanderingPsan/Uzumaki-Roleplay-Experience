<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Yuudai(TheUnidentified) would have taken the pair of wooden weaponry into his hands, examining the dull carvings of it. Though despite them being simply wooden toys for the child, he still had the vibrant imagination that all children had. Instead seeing them as a pair of deadly weaponry, he bit the inside of his cheek slightly before looking towards Izanami. It was clear he had no real idea of how to handle them, tossing one of them at her with a "Hyah!" though it wasn't very well aimed, nor would it have gone very far considering his lack of experience. Though regardless, the child would have began to giggle lightly to himself with content. Chasing after the shuriken to pick it up whether it had hit his sibling or not.* - Sun Oct 11 23:27:08 2015

Instead, pausing to watch the demonstration she had for him, the other wooden object still within his hand before he adjusted it. Fitting it between his own thumb and forefinger just as she had shown. He glanced towards where the Shuriken had landed, and then back to his sister before biting at the inside of his cheek lightly. Bringing his wrist back before flicking the shuriken outward, the result being a bit better than his original throw. But it was clear he had the release timing wrong, and his wrist didn't seem to flick nearly fast enough. Instead, the shuriken landed only several yards away.* - Sun Oct 11 23:43:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Yuudai(TheUnidentified) he frowned slightly at his result, having probably not even performed half as well as his already adept sister. He seemed to pout about it for only a brief moment, before he twisted towards her, instead leaping at her to pull down at her arm playfully with a "Hyahhh!"* - Sun Oct 11 23:51:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Yuudai(TheUnidentified) he tugged at her arm a little bit more, as if waiting to see if he could get a retaliation out from her. But upon seeing no response from his sister, he let out a sigh before picking himself up from the sand. Brushing at his arms a little bit to get the gritty feeling of sand off of him before nodding, "Okay!" and with that he'd have bolted towards the shuriken where they had been tossed. Well, atleast. As fast as he could, considering that sprinting through sand wasn't exactly easy to do, instead the shifting soil nearly tripping him onto his face as he neared the wooden toys.* - Mon Oct 12 00:04:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Yuudai(TheUnidentified) he huffed slightly as he reached the pair of wooden toys, turning towards his sister with a wide grin. Giving her a nod as she explained the rules of the game. Though, before he could even have the chance to release an attempted throw at the 'bad ninja', she had already bolted away. He quickly dashed after her, in attempts to close the distance between the two, giving a short bout of childish laughter as he went.* - Mon Oct 12 00:15:47 2015
