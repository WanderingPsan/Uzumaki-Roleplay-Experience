<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: As usual. . .your start. . . - Sat Dec 12 18:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Watching the shadow coming towards her, she'd do what she had so many times so far, though, not having her byakugan working, she'd do her best to keep her eyes on it and follow it, staying on her toes and digging in, trying to jump back away from the shadow before then cutting to the right, letting chakra flood to her eyes as she ran so that she could catch sight of where the shadow was behind her. Once she had done this if she could continue to avoid it, she'd aim to widen the gap between them, staying only on the front of her feet the entire time. Looking to Ziare she'd nod a bit, as if to say to do his best to keep her away. <43>

Having done such, if she had managed to get to where she wanted, she'd look to Ziare, ready to make her rush. This look, letting him know, she'd again dig her toes in, making her rush towards him, though she'd also be warry of any shadows he might manipulate to come at her, and thus, she'd be holding back just a small bit so that if he shot on straight for her, she'd have time to jump to the side, of simply stop completely and jump back. Though, only on the look out for such as now, she'd continue her rush, aiming to get in close to Ziare, continuing to stay on her toes. <44>* - Sat Dec 12 18:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: dpzed off - Sat Dec 12 18:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: * - Sat Dec 12 18:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking at him with glee when she saw him starting to try to go hand to hand with her, she'd take this chance to dodge, and avoid for now, trying her best to weave past the punches, and avoid them before they got close, which would seem to be harder than she thought as she tried to dance around him a bit, staying on her toes as she was still forcing herself to take up the technique. Having a few close calls while she was worried about her feet, she'd have to quickly dig her toes in and jump back, avoiding being hit before again having to charge back in, sick of just dodging now.<45>

Having her usual frown on her face now, she'd move to continue to dodge, while now adding in her own counters, doing her best to land as many fast hits as she could, lacking any real force, while dodging the ones he was throwing. Wondering if she'd still be hurting Zaire, she'd keep up the speed, but pull back even more on the force. Trying to drive herself to attack even faster, she'd sacrifice her reflexes a bit too much as she'd likely get hit by Ziare at least once, falling back into the grass as her stance on her toes left her a bit open to being knocked down. 

Standing back to her feet, she'd mutter, "It's so on~" <46>* - Sat Dec 12 19:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Watching the shadows around her, she'd sigh, she didn't want to actually hurt Ziare, but he seemed to want to continue to try and challenge her in hand to hand combat. Moving forward, she would do what she had all the way to this point. Keeping on her toes, literally, she'd bob and weave past Ziare's attacks, trying to continue to dance around as she was avoiding him at all cost, she didn't want to be knocked down again as easily as she was before. Thinking this, she'd speak while she danced around him, "Ziare, you seem happy all of a sudden? One hit and you think you're all that~?" <47>

Having teased him, she'd suddenly move in, trying her best to attack him with light, yet fast attacks, trying to avoid at the same time. Thus, much like a boxer, she'd be on her toes now dancing around him, avoiding any throws he'd send her way, while also aiming at his midsection, trying the best to hit him as fast, and as many times as she possible could, figuring that being fast over being strong in her case was a good thing. Once she felt like she had danced around on her toes long enough, and hit him enough, she'd look notice the shadows still behind her in her Byakugan. "Let me avoid some more, I need to keep my reflexes up, try harder, actually try to hit me." saying such she'd be ready. <48>

Once Ziare had likely taking up her challenge she'd again be back to just trying to dodge, his attacks perhaps being faster now as she continued to dance around him on her toes, her head moving side to side along with her body to escape taking any hits from him. She was the one who was well versed in hand to hand, if she lost now, she'd never be able to live it down to herself, no matter how strong Ziare was. Thus, once she felt her legs and feet tiring, she'd know she woud have to end this sometime soon. Finally stopping long enough for him to get a read on where she'd be standing, she'd look to him, "Time to quit, I'm getting tired." <49>

Speaking to him about such, she'd make a show as if that this would be her last push. Staying on her toes, she'd try to attack him head on now while barely moving, jumpping side to side to avoid any attacks from him. Forcing her arms and hands to attack him as fast as she could, she'd aim or numerous hits, over a very few hits with power. Though, finding her body once again tuckered out like the past day from all the training, she'd simply stop, though still standing on the fronts of her feet, "Ziare-kun. . .I think I got it now. . .Heh, though I'm too tired to keep going. . .you beat me. . again." frowning at such she'd simply shrug tiredly, her legs and arms burning. <50>* - Sat Dec 12 19:45:39 2015

Moving to the cabnets, and pulling out a dish to make said chicken in, she'd set the oven and the such. Pulling out the chicken, going about it, obviously more skilled than she had let on to, she'd clean in and the such, trimming away any parts she deamed worthless. Reasoning in, and sticking it into the oven she'd move on.

Pulling out a sack of potatoes that likely had, she'd peal, cute and wash them before boiling. Eventually making it to the point where they had home made mashed potatoes, and she'd also boil some corn that she'd find in the fridge, going about it all as if it was nothing.
