<br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Hearing him speak up, about not letting anything happen to her, she'd blush, hearing how serious he was. Feeling very weird from his words, she'd suddenly act out of character, stopping and grabbing his arm. Looking to him a bit, she'd blush, "This is. . .the only one you'll ever get from me." saying such, she'd quickly lean forward and kiss him on the cheek.

Once she had done this, she'd force her girly side back down and let her normally, very antisocial side come back to the surface, "Hmph." letting out this noise, she'd move forward, past Ziare on the path they were walking on, her chest full of butterflys.* - Wed Dec  9 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Having walked by him, her head feeling a bit light, she'd sigh, saying, "How much longer until we get there?" asking such as she continue to rub her hands on her dress, a bit nervous. 

Ignoring what she had done, she'd eventually take a deep breathe, letting it out as she brought herself back to being herself once more. Ziare kept dragging things out of her that she didn't know existed in her.* - Wed Dec  9 20:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Hearing him, she'd nod lightly, Glancing back to him a small bit as a bit of red remained on her face. "I thought you were used to me by now." saying such, she'd shake her head lightly and let her face tighten into her usual frown, looking to her dress, "Gah. . .I wonder if they sell them there as well. I may as well start collecting."* - Wed Dec  9 20:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I am usually used to you. - Wed Dec  9 20:26:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Of course. - Wed Dec  9 20:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) thinks: We really do know each other pretty well...I can't say that's not too nice. - Wed Dec  9 20:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Hmm. - Wed Dec  9 20:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Would be standing a bit behind Ziare, looking Takuma over with her pale white eyes. A slight frown ever present on her face as she had a well fitting black dress that seemed to flow nicely, looking to Ziare she'd mumble, "Ask about Tea."* - Wed Dec  9 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Do you know where the tea shop is? - Wed Dec  9 20:44:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: Worthless village. - Wed Dec  9 20:45:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: I kid, I kid. - Wed Dec  9 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Phew... - Wed Dec  9 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: We got a tea shop, and a ramen shop in one building. - Wed Dec  9 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You had me going there.. - Wed Dec  9 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: My bad homie. - Wed Dec  9 20:46:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: I was about to leave. - Wed Dec  9 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Shrugging a small bit, she'd look between the two men, sighing lightly. She just wanted some Tea, and these two almost upset her with the thought there wasn't any in this village.* - Wed Dec  9 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: You two have fun now. - Wed Dec  9 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: ... - Wed Dec  9 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Seeing the ox thrown, and then Ziare catching them, she'd already find herself annoyed, she had no intention of doing any of the sort with such. 

Though, hearing Ziare say he didn't want them, she wasn're sure if it meant he was looking out for her, he didn't want to use them, or he simply straight didn't plan on ever doing it with her. Obviously hoping that it was him realizing she had no want to do such things.

A glare shooting between the two men, she'd huff, moving to walk west, no clue where she was going, but she had no intention to stay around such pervertedness.* - Wed Dec  9 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: S-sorry about that. - Wed Dec  9 21:07:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: But, the tea shop is in the opposite direction. - Wed Dec  9 21:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Wed Dec  9 21:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Sighing, shaking her head, she'd ignore him, yet she'd turn around and walk back to the Tea shop.* - Wed Dec  9 21:10:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Glancing to him, she'd sigh, "No big deal. I'm past it now. Who have you been talking to?" asking such she'd yawn slightly, her hands wrapped around a hot cup of tea.* - Wed Dec  9 23:48:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking to him, she'd mutter under her breath happily, "I'll go change." saying such, she'd move and kiss him lightly on the cheek again. Quickly walking away before he could respond.* - Thu Dec 10 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Having run back to the room that Ziare had paid for, she'd quickly pull something otu she had been hiding since she had left Konoha, thinking she'd never be able to use it. Quickly changing into it and wrapping a towel around her body she'd back, looking to Ziare, "No staring."

With these words, she'd remove the towel, revealing a periwinkle colored top, and a bottom such as a skirt like version that would been seen on some swimsuits which would fit her body almost perfectly. Wearing this two-piece, she'd mutter, "You better not laugh. . .or be perverted. . .o-or let anyone else see me."* - Thu Dec 10 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Shaking her head she'd mutter, "I-I thought you'd be more blown away. . .you look like it didn't even affect you." saying such with a frown she'd look away. Looking back to him she'd almost start to talk when she saw him stripping to his boxers, "W-What are you doing! G-Go get a swimsuit!" she thought he was trying to make a move.

Trying not to stare at his body, she'd quickly move around and away from him, "P-Pervert." moving away, she'd quikly, and gracfully allow herself to get into the water, almost making so wake as the water seemed to move at her beauty, a few drops shining against her somewhat pale skin. "This is why I hate people. . .never act how you want them too. . ."* - Thu Dec 10 05:14:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Hearing the way he spoke, she'd blush, her body that was usually hidden behind a large dress how almost fully open for show. Covering her stomach and such in embarassment, she'd never even realize his issue. Though, her frown never leaving her face she'd see him run off. Shaking her head, she'd sigh.

Watching him hope in the water, she'd nod, "Pervert." only saying this, she'd sink all the way in the water up to her neck, her pitch black hair floating in the water around her, hiding her body, knowing if she didn't Ziare would stare, even if she was in a swimsuit.

Noticing what seemed to be someone walking up, she'd glare and move a good distance away, making sure the person couldn't catch sight, she hated people from the start, and had no plan to show off her body.* - Thu Dec 10 05:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Simply stays back away, body hidden under the water.* - Thu Dec 10 06:05:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking to him with wide eyes, they cut into a sort of glare, "What did you ask him? Was it something pervy?"* - Thu Dec 10 06:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . .What did you ask him? - Thu Dec 10 06:26:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Would nod, slowly diving under the water for a moment, enjoying it, though coming back out, she'd push her wet hair back out of her face, water dripping down her face and shoulder as just a small bit of her torso was above the water.

"Thanks. . .I didn't want to be seen. . .Ziare-kun." saying his name as such, being that she hadn't in some time.* - Thu Dec 10 06:32:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Y-Yea. - Thu Dec 10 06:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Saying such, she'd slowly walk out, water dripping down her body, the swimsuit clinging to her from being wet. Quickly wrapping a towel around her before Ziare could be perverted she'd say, "L-Let's go."* - Thu Dec 10 07:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Quickly removing her towel she'd mutter, "Look away, I'm serious this time. I-I have to change." saying such she'd toss the towel at him. Waiting for him to look away, she'd slip out of the suit and into her underwear and dress, fitting her nicely as normal. Her normal frown on her face as always, she'd pull her wet hair back into a pony tail, tying it back out of her face quite cutely.

Looking to Ziare's back she'd think, <Why is this man changing me so much?> shaking the thought off, still frowning, she'd say, "Done." if Ziare were to look around, he'd like see another swimsuit that had been on the bed, much more reserved than she had worn. Though, turning away so he could change she'd notice it, "O-Oops." walking to it, she'd grab it and toss it with her things, still not looking to Ziare while he likely changed.* - Thu Dec 10 07:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Shaking her head at his comment about seeing him naked, she'd go to pack up her things, being she was wearing her -dress- she'd pat it down, making sure it wasn't wrinkled, "You're a pervert Ziare-Kun. . .who would want to see that." saying such with a blush, she'd sigh lightly.

Once she had cleaned up her clothes and such, she'd hide away a large stash of green tea, she had managed to find what she needed to make it earlier in the day. Turning back to Ziare, she'd move the pony tail she had made her hair into to hand over her shoulder and slightly onto her chest. "The water felt nice. . .I guess."* - Thu Dec 10 07:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Watching Ziare closely, she already knew something was coming that she didn't like. Stepping forward after what he said, she'd simply shake her head, blushing lightly as she approached him.

"Shut up Ziare-Kun. I don't want your compliments. You didn't even mention my pony tail~ I thought it looked cute." the though of the lake already behind her as she spoke in her usual soft -serious- tone. Her face looking serious, and somewhat angered as she put on an act.

"Though, I guess all mean can think are perverted things anyway. Tch." Continuing to be grumpy she'd be right in front of Ziare. Looking at him with her usual face, her pale eyes glaring. Leaning in she'd say, "Worthless, all people." before suddenly leaning forward to lock lips with him quite hard, and for a good few seconds. Though, once she was done, she'd quickly pull away, -running- to the bed. Suddenly acting like a small confused school girl, she'd hide under the blankets and cover her head with the pillow.

"Now go away." saying such, her mind raising she her thoughts were accidently spoken, "Why did I do that. . ." though, realizing her mistake, she'd -think- , <I hate people. . .I-I mean I like Ziare-Kun. . .but I hate contact. . .I'm so confused. . .>* - Thu Dec 10 07:39:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Hearing his words, she'd break a bit, her outter shell may as well had a visable crack going down her. Shaking her head, trying to glue it back up, she'd mumble, "K-Keep that to yourself. . .stupid. ." though on the inside, she may as well have been jumpping for joy. This one man had done something dozens of people couldn't do, he had someone gotten under her skin, and into her emotions. Would she tell him this anytime soon? Who knew.

"Y-You're just saying it cause. . .I did that." saying such as she stayed burried under the blanket and pillow she'd continue to blush, questioning herself. <Why. . .>* - Thu Dec 10 08:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Shaking her head she'd lift the pillow just enough where one of her milky white eyes would peer at him.* - Thu Dec 10 08:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Hearing his words, her outter shell may as well have spider webbed. Gulping, she'd again hide her head under the pillow, hiding her blush, "S-Shut up stupid. . .Y-You're. . .making me feel weird." her heart beating way faster than it ever had, she wasn't sure how to answer him. Her two sides clashing. One one had, she had feelings for this man, he broke through her shell like it was nothing on a daily basis, while on the other hand, that personality hated people, and affection. She was torn.* - Thu Dec 10 08:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Nodding slightly under the pillow and blanket, she'd barely feel his embrace from the inside of it, mumbling, "Perhaps we should go walk around some? I-I need to clear my head."* - Thu Dec 10 08:42:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Popping out of the blankets and from under the pillow, she'd lean over from the bed and hug him, her cheek rubbing against him, "I-I can't say it. . but. . ." she'd nod slightly trying to get across what she meant. Breaking this hug, she'd stand to her feet, moving away and towards the door as she tried to brush herself off some, smoothing her clothes.* - Thu Dec 10 08:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You don't have to say it. - Thu Dec 10 08:50:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Would walk over to him, pull a bag out, setting it in his hands. While he hopefully went to look at it, she'd kiss him on his forehead while she turned to go sit against the wall.

The bag contained 100k yen.* - Thu Dec 10 10:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Shaking her head, she'd walk back back him, dropping him another bag of money, "Get yourself some new clothes too. . .cause. .yea." saying such she'd shrug, a bag of 60k being given this time. 

"I want tea." saying such she'd move to walk back to the door again.* - Thu Dec 10 11:03:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Oh. - Thu Dec 10 11:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Simply made her way from the house to the place she had been directed to for tea when she had first arrived. Having yet to have tea here, she'd quickly order for such to be brought to her, even though it was so late.* - Thu Dec 10 11:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Being that she had been sitting, waiting for her tea to show up, she'd be happy when it did, even if it didn't show on her face. Moving to grab the cup, sipping at it right away, caring not for how hot it was, she'd eye Ziare, "Tch.." not giving her opinion on the new wear.

She'd also be oblivious to Yuriko, being that when it came to having tea, it was all she could do to even force herself to pay attention to Ziare. * - Thu Dec 10 11:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: I missed tea so much~ I forgot he mentioned it was here~ - Thu Dec 10 11:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You really do love tea. - Thu Dec 10 11:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'm not suprised by it anymore though. - Thu Dec 10 11:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Lost in her semi-own little world as she finally got her chance to enjoy her favorite drink again, she'd sigh, her usually hard exterior softening just a small bit. "I missed this." mumbling such to herself, she'd know Ziare was there, but wouldn't pay but so much attention.* - Thu Dec 10 11:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Eventually zoning back in, her frown still on her face, as it always was, she'd look to the puzzle with curiousity, "Done knitting already?"* - Thu Dec 10 11:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Mhm.. - Thu Dec 10 11:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Hmph. . .I was curious to what you were going to make. - Thu Dec 10 11:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Uhm...I kinda do it to keep myself busy. - Thu Dec 10 11:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I never tried making anything. - Thu Dec 10 11:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Maybe i'll give it a shot. - Thu Dec 10 11:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Knitting is a making? - Thu Dec 10 11:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Hm. .  - Thu Dec 10 11:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Well. . .we are up here. . . - Thu Dec 10 11:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Y-You could make a scarf. . .it's kinda cold. - Thu Dec 10 11:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'll give it a shot. - Thu Dec 10 11:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Scarf....knitting is making clothing? - Thu Dec 10 11:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Hmph. - Thu Dec 10 11:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: That is not making clothing. - Thu Dec 10 11:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Hm. .N-Not that I was hoping you were making something originally. . . - Thu Dec 10 11:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: weird pieces.... making clothing...knitting? This knitting makes no sense. - Thu Dec 10 11:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Shaking her head lightly, she'd grab her tea again, already being half way through the glass. Stretching a bit, she'd yawn, the tea relaxing her. Would she have done it if she realized someone was so close by watching? Not a chance.

"Well. . .when are you gonna keep working on it?"* - Thu Dec 10 11:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: When we get back to the hotel. - Thu Dec 10 11:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Tch. - Thu Dec 10 11:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Whatever. - Thu Dec 10 11:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Hearing Ziare speaking up, thinking he was talking to her, she'd glance over, catching sigh of Yuriko. Her face instantly diving back to the original look it had, frown and all, she'd look away, moving closer to the wall.* - Thu Dec 10 12:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: Tch. A person. . .a very. . .nosey. . .close . . .person. - Thu Dec 10 12:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Nope. - Thu Dec 10 12:01:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . .He is doing a puzzle. . . - Thu Dec 10 12:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: Hurry up and go away. . . - Thu Dec 10 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: A puzzle.....is that like a gaaaaaaaaaaaaame? - Thu Dec 10 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking to him somewhat tired, she'd shrug, sipping at her tea. 

"Good morning Ziare-kun." saying such and ignoring his question, she'd stretch before putting her arms on the table, her head following on top of them.* - Thu Dec 10 21:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Feeling his hand on her back, she wouldn't fight it, only letting it happen as she enjoyed it.

"I'm just feeling. . .bleh."* - Thu Dec 10 21:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: We all have those days. - Thu Dec 10 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: I guess. - Thu Dec 10 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: How has your day been so far? - Thu Dec 10 21:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Meh. - Thu Dec 10 21:11:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: We can pretty much do anything as long as we don't cause trouble. - Thu Dec 10 21:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Yea. .  - Thu Dec 10 21:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) thinks: She must really not be feeling good, she's barely talking. - Thu Dec 10 21:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Do you wanna lay down. - Thu Dec 10 21:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . .I dunno.  - Thu Dec 10 21:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Well you're barely even up. - Thu Dec 10 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Tch. . .I'm awake. . .just. . blah. - Thu Dec 10 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Alright. - Thu Dec 10 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Just relax then. - Thu Dec 10 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . .Hey Ziare-kun. . .. - Thu Dec 10 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Hrm? - Thu Dec 10 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Hold me. - Thu Dec 10 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking at him, she'd lean into him and sigh. For some reason she wasn't even trying to act like her normal self, she was too out of it to try and stay away from Ziare. 

"Ziare-kun. . stop. ." saying such she'd close her eyes and breathe softly, if someone were to walk in now, she'd like flip completely.* - Thu Dec 10 21:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Sighing lightly, she'd keep her eyes closed, her breathing soft as she started to drift off to sleep. Cuddling into Ziare, she'd be -very- out of person. Not even a blush or anything. She was really off today.* - Thu Dec 10 21:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) asleep in his arms, she'd contiue to breathe softly, muttering, "Ziare-kun. . " a dream obviously being had about him as she smiled softy. Slumping a bit unless Ziare was holding her upright, she'd be in a deep sleep.* - Thu Dec 10 21:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Being asleep on him, she'd be lost in thoughts about her own future. Of course, for once they all involved Ziare, but she'd never say that allowed. Though, eventually moving past these dreams, she'd wake up slowly looking to Ziare. Realizing what she was doing, she'd pull away, blushing lightly as it still was weird to her.

"Ziare-kun. . . ." mumbling such as she recalled her dream. Shaking her head she'd say, "What should we do?" it being a broad term.* - Thu Dec 10 21:54:08 2015
