<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Hearing what was said, her face would instantly soften, ". . .You were thinking weird things. What did you expect."* - Tue Dec  8 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . .  - Tue Dec  8 04:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Sighs softly, "Whatever. . .go get some food, or sleep, or whatever you were going to do."* - Tue Dec  8 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking at the food, not finding herself hungry at all, she'd move to stand, making her way to the bedroom, she wouldn't say much, be she would lock the door and head to the bed. She was too tired to do this anymore.

Moving to lay atop the bed with her dress on, she'd sigh, "I know I won't sleep long. . .and I'll yell. . .But I need even a few minutes."* - Tue Dec  8 04:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Laying on the bed, she'd eventually pass out, her nightmare almost starting right away. Instantly seeing the image of the one who had put her in the jutsu, her eyes would go wdie in her sleep.

Seeing the large fireball above her and feeling the heat, she'd gasp out perhaps loud enough for Ziare to her, even in her sleep, "R-Run!"* - Tue Dec  8 05:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Still asleep, she'd rull around, sweat gathering over her body as the fireball in her dreams was getting to her, "H-Hot. . .N-No. . H-Help." saying such, as in the dream she'd be running, the fire coming down towards her.

While, in real life, she'd have a look of worry, and being afraid.* - Tue Dec  8 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Her body, burning up as of course the nightmare was that of a fireball raining dwon from the heavens, her breathing would pick up as in the dream she was running her legs off. Sweat covering her body, she'd mumble, "G-Get away. . .D-Don't hurt me. . .h-help." it should have been obvious to Ziare that these were the nightmares that she was talking about needing help with and being unable to sleep.* - Tue Dec  8 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Having her shoulder rubbed would do nothing for her, she'd continue to yell and gasp. "N-No. . " saying such she'd stop shaking, like she was waiting for something, through it'd be obvious that she was afraid, or more likely waiting to die, as in the dream the fireball would b about to hit her.* - Tue Dec  8 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Seeing the fireball approaching, she'd begin to cry in her dream, and thus, would begin to cry in real life, "H-Help. . ."* - Tue Dec  8 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Suddenly being awoken, she'd gasp, looking to Ziare, "W-What are you doing in here!?" but even as she asked it, tears would roll down her face.* - Tue Dec  8 05:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Shaking her head, wiping her face, she'd roll over, "Go away. . .I-I don't want you holding me. . "* - Tue Dec  8 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Shaking her head, unable to bring herself to turn back to look at Ziare. Shaking her head, as she herself was shaking, she'd say, "F-Fine. . .B-But. . Gah." wiping her eyes she'd sigh.

"J-Just. . " shaking her head, she'd cuddle into the pillow, her dress spread around her.

Sighing heavily, she'd pout, "Do whatever."* - Tue Dec  8 06:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Shaking her head, she'd mutter, "You better not do anything wierd. . .Ziare-kun. . " she'd suddenly be a bit nice for once. Being on the verge of falling back asleep, her bit of drama unable to keep her awake as she couldn't force the way she wanted to act anymore.

Of course, falling asleep the dream would just restart all over again.* - Tue Dec  8 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Being pulled in close to him, already lost in the dream, it would all start to rush by. Skipping straight to the fire above her, she'd again start to sweat and shake, she was terrified.

"No-No! H-Help!" muttering such, she'd be terrified in her sleep. . .again.* - Tue Dec  8 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) The humming slightly calming her down, she'd stop shaking, but the sweating would continue. Rolling over in her sleep and wrapping her Arms around Ziare, she'd start to cry. The only reason her body knew to do this, is being that last person who had helped had literally held her close like a child.

Crying into him, in the dream the massive ball of fire would be right above her, about to hit. Letting out one last yip, the ball would hit, causing her to scream out, quite loudly and jerk before suddenly staying still. Alive, and still, though it was unsure what would happen next.* - Tue Dec  8 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Being held tight for just a moment, it would seem for that one moment everything that had been afflicting her would have stopped. Reaching forward, she'd wrap her arms around him in her sleep, tears rolling down her face from closed eyes. Holding him tightly, she'd somewhat snuggle into him, more like she was trying to relive another, happier, past memory.

Tears likely wetting his shirt, if he'd allow her to stay like she was, eventually a different memory would play, a happier one from childhold as what seemed to be her parents held her. "C-Comfy." uttering that one word, while her face remained red from the previous tears, and her body still covered in sweat, she'd suddenly let a small smile form, almost transforming her into another person as her face lightened greatly, "I-I miss. . y-you." obviously now trapped in one of her parents, her voice would be higher, and more girly than it ever had as she eventually drifted off to a peacful sleep while holding onto, who in her mind, were her parents.

Unluckily for Ziare, it was him, not her parents.* - Tue Dec  8 07:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Being asleep on him now, she'd shiver a small bit, seemingly as they had been atop the blankets. Being that it was obvious she talked a bit in her sleep now, she'd mutter, "M-Mom. . .D-Dad. . I'm cold. . ." on the inside, it was clear to anyone who had spent time with her, that she was just a small, loving little girl that wouldn't let herself be used, when she could avoid all her issues by wanting to be alone.* - Tue Dec  8 07:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Being moved closer, her arms would hug him tight, "M-Miss you. . ." though her dreams fading away, happiness would radiate from the girl, she was sleeping properly for the first time in months, and she had a dream about parents she barely remembered. Feeling Ziare's worth, she'd mutter, still confused, 'N-Never leave me." saying such as she thought she was speaking to her parents, she'd drift off into a deep sleep, thhe combination of her dress, Ziare, and a bit of blankets keeping her warm for now, no sign of her awakening.* - Tue Dec  8 07:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Eventually waking up, her eyes and body not registering what was happening, or where she was, she'd glance about, only realizing that she seemed to be cuddled onto Ziare. Shock entering her body, it'd change to anger, and then to embarassment before settling somewhere between a mix of all of them. Though, realizing what had happened, and what she had said to do, unless his arms were wrapped around her, she'd move to slowly get up and walk away, letting him sleep as she went to the bathroom and thought things over seriously.

Getting a shower, her thought would go, <I know I asked. . .and I get feeling anger. . .but embarassment? Why would I?> shaking her head, she'd eventually get cleaned and changed back into her original black dress before coming back out, her face having the everlasing frown and such that it always had, the difference being the bags under her eyes were gone.* - Tue Dec  8 07:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Would quickly wake Ziare up, feeling grump and not wanting to talk about things that had happened, "Let's go Ziare. I'm sick of this place already. . .bad memories." refering to the sleeping, and her rumors.* - Tue Dec  8 07:58:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Being that she had only talked to the Kazekaze and a few others about the story, never gave her name, and her profile matched that of likely hundreds of others, she'd assume she'd be safe to slip out, her doujutsu flaring up just in case.* - Tue Dec  8 08:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Let's go. . .I didn't realize they were friends with Rias. . .I didn't exactly feel welcome after my story anyway. - Tue Dec  8 08:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Watching him stop, she'd keep her doujutsu active, feeling unsafe. "No clue." saying such in her usual voice, any sign of how she was when she slept was gone.* - Tue Dec  8 08:15:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You're going to want to focus chakra to your feet. - Tue Dec  8 17:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: The hell is that? - Tue Dec  8 17:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: And walk along the water's surface - Tue Dec  8 17:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking to Ziare, she'd Huff. She wanted the teaching, but didn't want to actually have to deal with people. Being that she was forced to be here with him though, she figured she'd get over it. Speaking up, "Close your eyes. . ." saying such, she'd struggle to get the zipper on the dress down quickly before changing into thhe other set of clothes she had. Though, realizing it was white, she'd look to Ziare, "If I fall in. . .you better look away. . ." saying such, as she wasn't a stupid girl.

Attempting to do as she be instructed, she hadn't even been told how much chakra, or how exactly she was meant to match it up, and thus, she'd just try to walk out as she put a small bit of chakra to the bottoms of her feet. Though, obviously not being enough, she'd fall right through, soaking her down to the bone. Coming out of the water, her head poking up she'd mutter, "Remember. . don't look." saying such as she pulled herself out of the water. If Ziare were to look, he'd obviously see the outline and color of her undergarments, which the thought of such, pissed Saika off to no end.

Sighing once more as she wrung her clothes out, she'd move to get the wet hair out of her face, her usual look unchanging. Once she felt like she was dry enough to try again without being pissed off, she'd add a bit more chakra to her feet, again trying to step out onto the water. Though, not prepared for the fact that water moved under her, and thus she'd have to regulate the chakra in order to stay above it, she'd again fall through getting soaked. Once more coming out of the water she'd mumble, "I swear you just wanted to me act a fool."

Shrugging a bit as she again waited to dry off, she'd continue to frown as she gathered up all of her wet hair and let it rest on her shoulder, revealing part of her neck. "I hope you don't plan to attempt to continue to embarass me, or our friendship won't last. . ." saying such, she'd eventually stand back up and again run chakra to her feet, this time ready to compensate for the waters movement. Stepping back onto it, she'd be a bit wobbly at first, but would be above it, and ready to walk around. Doing such for a few moments before walking back to Ziare, hoping that her clothes were no longer see through. "Do we have a towel or anything. . .I don't want to get back into my dress like this. . ."* - Tue Dec  8 18:10:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: What ever. - Tue Dec  8 18:46:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Sighing slightly, she'd look Ziare over, feeling a pain in her chest.

"You aren't so bad to be around." the words coming out under her breath, if Ziare was paying attention he'd her her, if not? Oh well.

Regardless, with this being said, she'd turn to walk off, "I'm going to look for apples. Perhaps a tree is growing around here." saying such, trying to walk off before the man could say anything back.* - Tue Dec  8 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) looking around, eventually finding a tree that had a bit od fruit growing on it, she'd reach up, as the branches hung quite low. Picking a few that seemed edible, she'd bring them back, sitting beside the fire and trying not to think about what she had said, or the way her chest felt. She didn't like people, and yet this person was changing her. She wasn't sure if it was a good thing, or he was simply another annoyance trying to make her change who she was.* - Tue Dec  8 18:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Of course sneaking a few glances as Ziare, as she was thinking things over dealing with him, she'd notice the shaking. Sighing softly, she really didn't want to bother with him anymore but yet, "Hey. . the hell is wrong with you, I'm hungry." saying such as to hopefully snap him out of whatever small siezure he was having, she'd chuck an apple at his back as she picked on up herself, ready to eat.* - Tue Dec  8 19:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Tue Dec  8 19:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: He. . .heard me before? A-And got like that? - Tue Dec  8 19:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You can see the small sillouette of the mountain up north. - Tue Dec  8 19:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Huh? - Tue Dec  8 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I heard the story of a bird that would come every year to sharped it's beak on the mountain. - Tue Dec  8 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: My mother told me over the course of a couple centuries, the bird would reduce the mountain to rubble. - Tue Dec  8 19:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: So I never thought what an incredible mountain, but what an incredible bird.. - Tue Dec  8 19:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: That was from a book I was reading...Nature really is incredible. - Tue Dec  8 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Tue Dec  8 19:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking at him with wide eyes, she hadn't expected him to say such words, or have such emotion in them. Something coming over her, she'd stand to her feet. Moving to stand behind him, assuming her was sitting to fish, she'd have her hands around her back, holding each other as she mumbled, "T-That was. . .I-. . " she was at a loss for words.* - Tue Dec  8 19:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking down to him, she'd mumble, "That was. . .nice." saying such, she'd reach down hesitantly, patting Ziare on the head she she'd then move away, away from him, and the fire, aiming to sit under a tree, bringing her legs to her own chest in the dress. She was confused. She didn't know why she was acting this way, she hated people, hated Ziare.

Coming to a conclusion, she'd force these feelings down, and let her hate for people stay on the surface.* - Tue Dec  8 19:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Sitting by the tree, she'd eventually let her face drop to her lap, sighing softly as she was still confused.* - Tue Dec  8 19:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You wanna keep walking? - Tue Dec  8 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: We can. .  - Tue Dec  8 20:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Okay... - Tue Dec  8 20:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Seeing him pack everything up, she'd almost want to help. Though, shaking her head she'd mumble, "Whatever." before standing to walk after him, having little trouble. Though, at the moment there was a tug-of-war going on her head. Her normal side, which was fighting to remain the same as she had for all of these years, and this new side that had popped up along with Ziare, trying to pull back and let him in.

Though, all of this would be hidden as her ever present frown kept strong.* - Tue Dec  8 20:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking to him, she -almost- wish he'd ask something that actually mattered and stopped his small talk for once. She felt that if she got everything answered for him, he'd have to shut up and leave her alone, but, these were only her current thoughts.

Hearing him speak up, she'd sigh, "Somewhere we'd both be safe and welcome."* - Tue Dec  8 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Not hearing him answer, she'd sigh lightly, fiddling with her dress, mumbling, "I need to find something better looking." saying such simply to keep her mind busy as she walked. Her feet and legs killing her at this point. Obviously she still wasn't used to travel.* - Tue Dec  8 20:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Hearing his words, she'd stop dead. "W-What?" confused, and blushing lightly.* - Tue Dec  8 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking to him, her slight blush fading at her words, she'd almost felt something else, disapointment maybe? 

"I see. . .alright then." saying such softly, and letting the topic go she'd continue to walk, over a year, and she was starting to change. She wasn't sure if it was good or bad, or what was up with these new feelings. Couldn't she just go back to how she was?* - Tue Dec  8 20:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking to him, she'd turn her head up, somewhat disapointed by the fact he had acted as if the thought of her being pretty was nothing to him. Looking down to the dress, she'd mutter, "I'm not resting until I get a different one. . "

Sighing lightly she'd say even quieter, "And some Geen tea. . ." it was obvious in their rush to leave Suna, she had forgotten to stock up on it.* - Tue Dec  8 20:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Hearing him, she'd mutter, "Well. . .if there wasn't any fe-. . .Nevermind." thinking that if Ziare only did it to do it, without really caring, then how would the dress look good on her? Stupid female thoughts running through her head, she'd continue to walk forward, aggravted with him now.* - Tue Dec  8 22:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) keeping her eyes down as they walked, she'd slow even more to stay behind him, looking him over as she tried to gather herself. "Why do you like traveling with me?" her usual downcast, soft voice would let out. Her pale eyes looking to the ground confused as she for once was asking a question out of general curiousity. This man was changing her personality by the week, and she didn't want to let it happen if it was for negative purposes, or to let her get hurt again.* - Tue Dec  8 22:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) hearing him speak, she'd nod slightly, looking him over slightly. "Friend . . .huh. . ." letting it hang slightly she'd shrug, not wanting to push him into an uncomfortable position. Moving to continue walking, her mind running over a million thoughts.* - Tue Dec  8 23:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Tue Dec  8 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Speaking even softer than usual, like, mice quiet, she'd mutter, "That's it?" before stopping, simply sitting down as if to protest going any further.* - Tue Dec  8 23:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: What do you mean? - Tue Dec  8 23:07:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Watching all of his actions, she'd be ever more confused, unsure where he was going with all of this. Seeing his red face, and his constant moving of his hand through his hair, she'd be nervous. Hearing him speak, she'd yip a bit, "W-What?" only hearing the part of passion thus far.

Though, being drowned out by his continuing talk, she'd hear him say he was falling for her. Her face going red, and her eyes wide, her usual frown would turn into a look of confusion as she covered her face.

She hated people, she literally went out of her way to avoid people, their conversations, and romance. Yet, this person here. . .he had been getting to her already, and she was confused about it before. Looking between her fingers, she'd only be able to get out in her embarassment, her hard outter shell having fallen, "A-A bit?"* - Wed Dec  9 00:38:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Breaking down, she'd tear up a bit, not saying anything yet as she balled up. In truth, she was happy, and she didn't know why. She was completely comfused over why she felt happy. Looking to him behind tears, if he was paying attention, her frown was gone, replaced with a more, somewhat happy look. "Z-Ziare-Kun. . . ." her voice being very low, and happy sounding.* - Wed Dec  9 00:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Watching him lay back, and start to laugh she'd thought he was laughing at her. Though, catching the tears, she was even more confused. Crying herself she'd turn to look away and would just say it again, "Z-Ziare-Kun. . ." still hoping the boy would come over to her.* - Wed Dec  9 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking to him, and then looking away, tears still coming, she'd move one hand to gesture him over.* - Wed Dec  9 01:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Huffing a bit, she'd look to the side, before suddenly jumpping forward, quickly wrapping her arms around him, ". . .You. . .a bit. . .too. . ." the words coming out as she couldn't completely surpress her hate of people, and this was hard enough. Once she had done such, she'd try to move back, and away, trying to hide behind the three as she needed to calm down before her heart exploded. This man had single handedly changed her. At least. Towards him. Other people? Probably still fucked.* - Wed Dec  9 01:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Blushing heavily, she'd hold her hands over her heart, looking away.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Right. - Wed Dec  9 08:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Nodding slightly, she'd take his arm, getting to her feel as she brushed herself off and followed after him, yawning slightly, "I need to sleep. . ." saying such, she'd look to him, following him.* - Wed Dec  9 08:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking to him as she made her way into the tent, she'd lay down next to him, embarrassed, she'd cuddle up next to him and pull whatever blankets were there up over her body. "Y-You better hold me. . .I-I don't need that nightmare." still not telling him what the actual nightmare was.* - Wed Dec  9 08:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Being turned towards him, she'd rest her arms on his chest, leaning into him for warmth and comfort. Hearing what he had said, she'd blush heavily, "S-Shut up and sleep." saying such, she'd burry her face into his chest, closing her eyes.* - Wed Dec  9 09:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) nodding, she'd eventually fall off to sleep, having only good dreams while cuddles agaisr him.* - Wed Dec  9 09:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Morning... - Wed Dec  9 18:40:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: How did you sleep? - Wed Dec  9 18:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Wed Dec  9 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Better. - Wed Dec  9 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Good. - Wed Dec  9 18:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Shall we get going to. . where ever we're going? - Wed Dec  9 18:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Yeah. - Wed Dec  9 18:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Sighing lightly, remembering the previous days events, she'd shake it all off, she didn't plan to continue to act like an embarrassed girl while they traveled, and hated that she had. Moving after Ziare she'd mumble, "I need to get stronger eventually. All these wars and such, and I'd be helpless without yo-" almost giving Ziare a -bunch- of credit, she'd shut up and continue to walk.* - Wed Dec  9 18:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Shaking her head lightly, she'd look to him, "No point in learning what won't help me then, Yea?" asking such she'd try her best to keep pace beside him, "What is the long term goal of this lil trip anyway?" asking such she'd look at him, her usual frown back on her face.* - Wed Dec  9 19:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Hearing what he had said, she'd look away remembering that she was told to never go back to Konoh, "Oh. I see. Let's get going then." saying such, she'd pat her dress as she walked, sighing lightly. Thinking somewhat to herself about the whole situation, being that she still didn't know what she planned to do in the future, she'd look to Ziare, curious what he thought.

"What should I do?" leaving the sentence somewhat vague, she'd keep walking with him, wondering how he would take what she had asked.* - Wed Dec  9 19:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Hearing what he said, she'd flash a -very- rare slight smile, not having meant to. Quickly forcing it  back down, she'd look away. "I'll be happy when I'm stronger, strong enough to protect myself, and make those who annoy me go away." Half joking, half serious she'd move on, "And, when I can go back into Konoha, without your 'best friend' trying to force me to do things I don't want to do." sighing as she spoke, what the Hokage had done would flood back.

"Tch. I dislike her so much."* - Wed Dec  9 19:24:22 2015
