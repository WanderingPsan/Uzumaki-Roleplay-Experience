<br><font color=yellow>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Noticing that someone had come in, she'd keep a slight from on her soft face. Her pale eyes following the scene, she'd see a drink slide in front of her. Her eyes closing slightly as if to glare at the drink, she'd push it back to the chef, her somewhat soft, yet strong voice would respond, so that only the Chef could hear, "Kindly inform the man, I don't drink. Furthermore, I don't like others. Make him give up." saying such as she sat back sadly.

Moving to drink her glass of tea, which she'd have the entire time, her face staring blankly forward, an almost sad expression on it.* - Fri Dec  4 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Should I..Buy somewhere else? - Fri Dec  4 22:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: Oh. . .great. . .another person. .  - Fri Dec  4 22:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) would sigh lightly, trying to focus on her tea, and less on the people.* - Fri Dec  4 22:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Tense air. - Fri Dec  4 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Anything on the list please. - Fri Dec  4 22:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Or paper guard - Fri Dec  4 22:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: -Omit- - Fri Dec  4 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: Why do people always seem to show up when I don't want them around. - Fri Dec  4 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Cute. - Fri Dec  4 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: But I'll pay for mines. - Fri Dec  4 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryuusei(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Sometimes it's best to just accept a strangers kindness. - Fri Dec  4 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I've accepted enough. - Fri Dec  4 22:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Sighing slightly, she'd slide a bit of money forward for her own tea, ignoring Ryu's offer as she finished her tea. Her black dress flowing as she stood, she'd move to turn, the dress rotating in a way that made it all look like the flow was natural. 

Moving to the exit, her eyes would never even find the two strangers as she went to leave.* - Fri Dec  4 22:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryuusei(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Tch, are all women so passive aggresive? - Fri Dec  4 22:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Shaking her head a small bit, turning, her dress again following her movement, she'd still have the soft from on her face, her pale eyes seemingly holding no particular emotion as of now. Brushing her dress a bit to make sure it was all in place she'd close her eyes for a long moment.

"This is a normal expression. I don't like people. I'll be going." her voice being rather soft and feminine as she spoke, with a serious undertone, she'd hope what she had said would cause the others to leave her alone.* - Fri Dec  4 23:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Letting another small sigh out, she'd turn her pale eyes to look to Ai, "I simply don't? I find myself not needing them around. Much less wanting them around." saying such she'd let her hands rest by her dress, her mind wandering around, stopping on the thought, <Why does this person even care?>* - Fri Dec  4 23:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Shaking her head, ignoring a good portion of the person's words, she'd continue to stare blankly at her. "I don't care." her voice level and soft, it would be as if she had considered every single word the girl had said, and simply just didn't care. "I don't like to be around people. I never said I hated them. Though if it comes down to talking to you, and being alone, I'd take being alone any time of day." sighing a bit more, she'd brush her dress a small bit, making sure it stayed where it was.

Clenching her small hands slightly, they'd pop. Moving away, she'd nod, "I assume we're done then?"* - Fri Dec  4 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Sighing softly, she'd shake her head, moving to leave unless stopped again.* - Fri Dec  4 23:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: More people. . . - Fri Dec  4 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: Tch. - Fri Dec  4 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Hey hun. - Sat Dec  5 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Hi. - Sat Dec  5 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Found someone that reminds me of myself when I was dark. - Sat Dec  5 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Hm? Who..? - Sat Dec  5 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Don't know her name. - Sat Dec  5 00:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: She's apart of ya bloodline though. - Sat Dec  5 00:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Sat Dec  5 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: And now they're speaking of me? Great. - Sat Dec  5 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Shaking her head lightly, she'd back step away, and towards the wall once more, her blac dress flowing with her, fitting her form rather well, her soft, somewhat serious voice coming up again, "Please leave me alone. I've said enough for today."* - Sat Dec  5 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: You found her. Good luck hun. - Sat Dec  5 00:15:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: That aside, what's wrong? - Sat Dec  5 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Her pale eyes looking to Mizora, she'd look down, mumbling, "No one was here when I showed u-" though realizing she had been somewhat tricked into talking, she'd shake her head, "I don't like people. Leave me alone."* - Sat Dec  5 00:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: See? - Sat Dec  5 00:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: And that's my que. - Sat Dec  5 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) thinks: It's like talking to a mirror that reflects upon your past self. - Sat Dec  5 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Anyway. Time to go. - Sat Dec  5 00:23:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Good luck, I'll be here a little longer. - Sat Dec  5 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Uh? Are you sure? - Sat Dec  5 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Shaking her head, she'd turn to leave, "Whatever." saying such, patting her dress as she walked, she'd move to find a different part of the village that perhaps she'd be able to enjoy herself. (Sorry was cooking.)* - Sat Dec  5 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: The solution to your negative emotions is love. Find it, and you'll be fine. - Sat Dec  5 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: --Now she sounds like me. - Sat Dec  5 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Evening. - Sat Dec  5 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: One hot bowl of ramen. - Sat Dec  5 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Simply ignored both of them, she had no reason to want to talk to anyone.* - Sat Dec  5 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) thinks: Not even a hello.. Prehaps I'll torture them both. - Sat Dec  5 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) thinks: Wonder i fI can sew two human being together..Claud probably ocul ddo that. - Sat Dec  5 02:06:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) thinks: I'll force male to rape girl. - Sat Dec  5 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) thinks: Then make them switch. - Sat Dec  5 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) thinks: Nah thats to odd for this. - Sat Dec  5 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) thinks: They'll be dolls for torture. I'll allow thme to date each other so they dont go crazy. - Sat Dec  5 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Quiet types hmm? - Sat Dec  5 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: The ramen rather tasty right? - Sat Dec  5 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: I'm leaving. - Sat Dec  5 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: I can't allow that. - Sat Dec  5 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Saying such, already sick of more people walking into the room, she'd move, her dress flowing as she did so. A somewhat sad look on her face that she normally have, she'd move towards the exit, the clothes she wore moving naturally around her.* - Sat Dec  5 02:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Having her arm grabbed, her eyes would go wide. She hadn't been touched by another human being since she was a kid, and it pissed her off quite much. Chakra rushing to her eyes, she'd look to Hanae.

Shaking her head lightly she'd mutter in a soft, but mad voice, "Let go. . ."* - Sat Dec  5 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Glaring at her some more, she'd simply mutter, "both of you better never come near me again." saying such, she'd let her eyes relax, moving to walk to the exit.* - Sat Dec  5 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Oh? and If I do what are you going to do? - Sat Dec  5 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Sat Dec  5 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Don't come near me. - Sat Dec  5 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: Bitch. - Sat Dec  5 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Miss. - Sat Dec  5 02:33:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: You so much promise. - Sat Dec  5 02:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) A shuriken suddenly being thrown, and cutting a few strands on hair, and her ear, she'd go wide eyed, anger coursing though her again. Chakra flooding to her eyes, she'd activate her doujutsu, turning to look to Hanae as she got into a stance, "Leave. Me. Alone."* - Sat Dec  5 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Getting caught in the genjutsu, she'd stare to the sky, her personality not allowing her to act afraid. No, instead, she'd stand there, ready to take the hit from the fireball.* - Sat Dec  5 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Get hit, fell and all that.* - Sat Dec  5 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: There. - Sat Dec  5 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: She'll wake up in a few. - Sat Dec  5 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Lets see how this seed grows. - Sat Dec  5 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Phew.. - Sat Dec  5 06:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Man..I haven't had ramen in a while.. - Sat Dec  5 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: Another person. . . - Sat Dec  5 06:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: This place does attract too many people. . . - Sat Dec  5 06:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Hearing the man slurp up his noodles, she'd sigh a bit, already aggravted. Turning to look at him when he spoke up, she'd simply respond, "Please leave me alone." saying such in a soft, almost sad voice as she had the face to match, soft, yet almost sad like something was wrong even if it wasnt.

Turning back forward, her dress flowing naturally around her, she'd slowly pick up the tea she had, sipping on it.* - Sat Dec  5 07:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Sat Dec  5 07:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Well.. - Sat Dec  5 07:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If you're so depressed, you should smile. - Sat Dec  5 07:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You should really try eating some ramen. - Sat Dec  5 07:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Sat Dec  5 07:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It is pretty great.~ - Sat Dec  5 07:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Please don't bother me. - Sat Dec  5 07:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: How boring. - Sat Dec  5 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Eh.. - Sat Dec  5 07:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: What's special about this time? - Sat Dec  5 07:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Thankful for once to actually have someone else enter into the shop, she'd sigh a small bit, sending a silent thankyou to the girl for gathering the red head's attention. Moving back to her tea, her stare a bit blank as she looked down to it, she'd do her best to finish the warm liquid off, now wanting to leave as fast as she possibly could. 

From the days experiance, more people, meant more trouble.* - Sat Dec  5 07:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: ... - Sat Dec  5 07:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You two are pretty quiet. - Sat Dec  5 07:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Oh, sake isn't tea. - Sat Dec  5 07:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: .....I got it. - Sat Dec  5 07:27:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Sat Dec  5 07:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: Hmph. . .I need to go find a home. . .and a -very- sturdy lock. .  - Sat Dec  5 07:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: I really do need to figure out how they made this broth... - Sat Dec  5 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Being too self absorbed in her disliking of other people, she'd basically have ignored what was said, not noticing Yuriko's look as she continued to try and finish her tea.* - Sat Dec  5 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Hearing what was said, she'd basically let it go right by her as her subtle soft frown remained, her eyes a bit blank as she finally finished her tea. Setting the empty cup down, she'd slowly set some money on the counter as she went to stand, her black dress flowing naturally around her.* - Sat Dec  5 07:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .. - Sat Dec  5 07:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Well..you could try being nicer.~ - Sat Dec  5 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Try walking them home, or something. - Sat Dec  5 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Putting in effort is the best way to make a friend. - Sat Dec  5 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Oooooooh. - Sat Dec  5 07:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: If she comes near me. . . - Sat Dec  5 07:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: The last one to touch me kidnapped me. . . - Sat Dec  5 07:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: What's...with this broth?! - Sat Dec  5 07:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .... - Sat Dec  5 07:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I can't understand how you've done this.. - Sat Dec  5 07:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Hearing the clicking approach, she already know that she was in for an unpleasent time. Sighing slightly as she heard the girl sit, she'd continue to stand, yet feeing the hand on her back, she'd flinch -heavily- as if it scared her to be touched. Moving quickly to the side of the stool, between it and the wall as she would have continued to for herself to her feet she'd look to the girl, her pale eyes meeting the different colored ones.

Her face having only showed shock for a moment, it'd already be back to it's small soft frown and black look, "I don't have friends. Nor do I want them." upon saying such, she'd smooth her dress lightly and attempt to scoot by the stool without catching her dress, and make her way to the exit, of course unless she was stopped.* - Sat Dec  5 07:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Sat Dec  5 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You know.. - Sat Dec  5 07:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I think they used sea salt.. - Sat Dec  5 07:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I should really get this recipe. - Sat Dec  5 07:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: Ah, what a refreshing person. - Sat Dec  5 07:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: I don't know if I've met them. Must be my imagination.. - Sat Dec  5 07:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Watching as the girl walked away, (Obviously staring at dat ass) she'd shake her head slightly. She was the third person to tell her that today, along with a suggestion to find love, and the such. Though, also remembering what had happened the second she had tried to make a friend, her face would tighten even more into her usual look. Shaking it all off, she'd move around the stool.

Mumbling to herself, "People mean trouble." before trying to leave.* - Sat Dec  5 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Who said anything about people, silly girl.~ - Sat Dec  5 07:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I bet she tastes... divine. - Sat Dec  5 07:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Pausing on her exit to listen Nigen's words, she'd slightly glance back over her shoulder, "I'll hope for the reverse if you don't mind." sighing, realizing she had responded again when she hadn't wanted to, she'd look back forward, and to the floor.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Huffing a bit, a small, soft frown on her face, she'd move forward, her black dress flowing naturally with her as she walked. Her pale eyes not moving to any particular person, she'd try to make her way by everyone without being stopped.* - Sat Dec  5 19:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryuusei(TenaciousDeeznuts) thinks: Crowded today. - Sat Dec  5 19:12:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Having someone approach, she'd find herself to be somewhat aggravated. "Move."* - Sat Dec  5 19:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Sighing sightly, her face holding straight, she'd look to the boy, "Leave me alone."* - Sat Dec  5 19:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Ouch . . . - Sat Dec  5 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryuusei(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Nothings going on. - Sat Dec  5 19:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking in Ryuusei's direction, her face would be quite cold, "Even when I was kidnapped, and needing help, someone thought better of it to sit and drink." shaking her head at her own small outburst, she'd sigh, "People are trouble." ending it with this small statement, containing his annoyance, she'd glare to Gan, though wouldn't acknowledge anything that he would say.

Clenching her fist lightly as her dress clung to her form, she'd mutter, "I need some tea." though, not meaning to say it outloud, she'd hope no one would hear as she made her way to the ramen shop, her nerves being tested.* - Sat Dec  5 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: Tch. . . - Sat Dec  5 19:50:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: Remember that. - Sat Dec  5 19:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Having not made it to Gan as she was walking past Ryu, she'd take notice of him staring at her chest, which would put her over the limit with what she could take today. Chakra flooding to her eyes, her soft frown never leaving her face, she'd move forward towards her, her stance taking the form of her bloodline as she decided to teach the man a lesson.

Now having view of his chakra flow, she'd aim to go for both of his arms, attempting to cause some sort of damage.* - Sat Dec  5 20:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Her soft, yet cold face turning towards Gan, her now more prominant eyes looking to him with her frown, she'd simply shake her head, "No chance." her voice being rather soft and smooth as she spoke.

"I thought I made it clear I don't like others. . .or pervert." turning back to Ryuusei she'd say, her face rather serious, "Apologize."* - Sat Dec  5 20:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Reaching forward after a sigh, feeling that she was now drawing unwanted attention, and wanted to be alond, she'd stop. Hearing Ryuusei's words, calling her a bitch, she'd freeze, being that she was about to fix him, she'd quickly do so, unblocking what she had done, though she'd stop and lean back up. Looking to him, fer face wavering for a second, she'd slowly let the chakra to her eyes fade, returning to normal.

Her stance now non-exsistant, she'd look down to him, her usual frown shaking as it hinted at even more sadness. Backstepping, she'd accidently bump into Hikaru. Shaking her head, still saying nothing, a tear could be seen at the edge of her left eye, though it'd be unlikely Gan could see it from where he stood.

"I-. . .I just don't like people. . I-I'm not a b-b. . ." not being able to say it, her eyes would be threatening to flood. Apparently she couldn't take being called said word in -THESE- circumstances. She hadn't done anything wrong in her mind. If she had started all of this, or done something worthy of being called said word, she'd probably would have been fine, or angered. But now? She was simply upset.* - Sat Dec  5 20:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Basically ignoring any intereaction from anyone, not hearing what was said, she'd continue to try and walk away. Thought after a few steps, tears slowly starting to stream down her face, she'd catch sight of Gan next to her. Stopping dead, wiping her face, she'd look to him, not having caught anything that he had said, which was probably a good thing.

"Go away." saying such she'd take a few more steps experimentally to see what he'd do.* - Sat Dec  5 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Again moving to halt her advance once more, she'd again find herself angered, though her tears would stop at the redheads words. Shaking her head, she'd again pulse chakra to her eyes, looking to the boy in the green jacket, her face moving back to what it once was, a soft, sad frown and blank, serious eyes, "I'll say it one more time. . .go away." it was clear she didn't want anyone near her, and if she had to suffer it, she wasn't allowing them to speak, or be this close to her.

She was unsure what the big deal was with everyone trying to convince her to open up, it was clear what she wanted, and that was to be alone. It'd take a lot of work, or someone special to convince her otherwise.* - Sat Dec  5 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Huh? - Sat Dec  5 21:34:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Seeing Nigen enter the area long before he could even see what was happening with the use of her eyes, she'd be even more annoyed by his entrance. She had been bugged, and jerked around too much today. Sighing softly as she reached down, patting out her dress she'd mumble, "I can't handle this right now." saying such, she'd turn, attempting to walk away about past Nigen.

Aiming to go to the Ramen shop and get some Tea, her hips swaying in her dress as she walked. Though, it should be noted she'd keep her doujutsu activated. (AKA If you pull a dragon, she'll know.)* - Sat Dec  5 21:53:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Walking in, her doujutsu still activated, she'd catch sight of a white haired female. Sighing slightly as she had no resolve to be aggravated by it, she'd sit, her black dress under her, fitting her body quite well. "Green tea please." asking such, she'd sigh softly once more.

Looking to the counter her face would have a soft, small frown as if she was always that way.* - Sat Dec  5 22:28:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Catching sight of what the girl mouthed, she wouldn't exactly be happy, nor upset. She was comflicted. She hated other people, but if the room was free? Perhaps she could lock herself in the room with a book and avoid everyone? 

These thoughts running through her head, she'd sigh slightly Simply nodding to acknowledge that she had understood the women. Turning back to her tea, she'd sip on it, trying to empty her mind, and block the thoughts of people trying to talk to her, or even be near her.* - Sat Dec  5 22:44:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: We could play, if you're bored. - Sun Dec  6 02:24:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Yes. - Sun Dec  6 02:32:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: It's... a board game. - Sun Dec  6 02:34:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Mm.. I don't think I have any other games. - Sun Dec  6 02:55:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) having her head touched, and hair messed with, she'd blush for -once- in her life, shocked, "W-What? D-Don't touch me."

Watchin as Amaya walked away, she'd be rather confused. Someone was willingly walking away and giving her space and she was confused over it.* - Sun Dec  6 03:02:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking to the floor, her stomach would growl slightly. Though, she'd try to play it off.* - Sun Dec  6 03:24:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Sitting there, lacking her usual enjoyment of tea, her stomach would growl once more. Again trying to hide it, she'd keep her head down, and away, her soft face having its usual frown as she slowly patted her black dress out of wrinkles.* - Sun Dec  6 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) thinks: Coincidentially I had green tea here.. - Sun Dec  6 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) catching sight os Amaya moving around, she'd see her move through a few shelves. Shaking her head and sighing, she'd shrug a bit. Though, finally realizing what she was doing, she'd let her eyes go wide.* - Sun Dec  6 04:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: Tea? - Sun Dec  6 04:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Shaking her head, she'd mutter, "N-No. . .b-but you didn't need to make me tea." saying such, she'd look away, obviously feeling like this girl was causing her to get used to people. . .or at least her. And she wasn't sure if she liked it or not. 

Shaking her head, she'd brush some of her long hair behind one of her ears.* - Sun Dec  6 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking to her, the soft frown on her face ever so present, she'd sigh and just take the tea, being careful not to burn herself on it yet. Blowing on it a bit, she'd eventually wait for it to cool before taking a sip to see how it tasted.

Not being able to bring herself to thank someone, she'd just nod.* - Sun Dec  6 04:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: I'll be back shortly. - Sun Dec  6 04:21:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: Is she working with that kidnapper to get to me easier? - Sun Dec  6 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: To the ramen shop. - Sun Dec  6 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Why. . .? - Sun Dec  6 04:24:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: No. - Sun Dec  6 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Not at all. - Sun Dec  6 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) would look away.* - Sun Dec  6 04:24:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Sun Dec  6 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Alright. - Sun Dec  6 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Don't answer the door for anyone, no one should be coming here. - Sun Dec  6 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Alright. . . - Sun Dec  6 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Sun Dec  6 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Watching her walk by with all of the food, and start to store it, she'd be very confused. Why was this person being so nice?

Moving to grab one, she'd mutter, "I'm not eatting this because you got it or anything, or because I'm hungry, just pointless to waste it. . ." mumbling this, her face retaining her cold look, she'd move back to eat the ramen, cleaning the bowl rather fast to be such a pretty girl.

Looking to Amaya, she'd sigh lightly, "I still don't like people. . ." thinking to herself then, <Though, this one isn't as bad as most.>* - Sun Dec  6 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking to the women across the room, she'd bite her lip, feeling that she owed the women. Moving to stand, she'd attempt to grab her and lift her into the bed. "I'm not doing this because I like you. . .I-I just can't owe you." saying such, she'd try to lay her on it.* - Sun Dec  6 04:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Nodding slightly, she'd move back where she had been sitting before, closing her eyes herself, still having not slept in a good few days. Though, she refused to use someone else's bed, or to be so close to someone else who's be asleep.* - Sun Dec  6 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) would be passed out on the pillow, her head hanging forward with her eyes closed and her usual look somehow still on her face, just, even more soft and girly than usual.* - Sun Dec  6 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Being put into the bed, something in her sleep would make get cling to Amaya's clothes, like she was afraid of something. While in this case, she was seeing the fireball like image that was used in her kidnapping to knock her out.

Mumbling a bit, "H-help." even if she was put into the bed and tucked in.* - Sun Dec  6 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Being cradled, she'd noticably calm down, though she'd start to sweat a small bit as the image in her head got closer, seemingly real to her. Her head shaking back and forth lightly, she'd seem on the verge of waking up already.* - Sun Dec  6 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Being awoken from her nightmare, only to be tossed into another one, she'd struggle, flailing to get loose, "W-Why are you touching me? W-Why am I over here?" panicing a small bit, she'd try to roll off the bed and Amaya and into the floor, or to her feet to move away.* - Sun Dec  6 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking to Amaya, she'd have her eyes go wide, she'd huff a bit, looking away, "Why?" it being a general question, trying to get loose, but deep inside wishing she'd continue to be held she'd ask, "Why are you acting like this. . .why try and help me?"* - Sun Dec  6 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Shaking her head, closing her eyes as she forced herself out of Amaya's grip, and got to her feet, she'd try to move away, "W-Why. . .you barely know me. . ."* - Sun Dec  6 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Shaking her head, she'd try to calm herself down, backing away as she forced herself back to her normal personality. "Whatever. . ."

Moving back to the pillow she had been sitting on before, yawning once again. In truth, she'd been continuously waking up from the nightmare she had, but she didn't want to fall back asleep only to wake up how she just had.* - Sun Dec  6 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Were you having a nightmare? - Sun Dec  6 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Not to pry, or anything... - Sun Dec  6 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . .  - Sun Dec  6 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: I. . .may have. . .but, who knows. . . - Sun Dec  6 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: I'll take that as a yes, was it about your kidnap? You said "help" in your dream. - Sun Dec  6 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Sun Dec  6 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Huffs a bit, refusing to give up the frown on her face. "W-Who knows. . ."* - Sun Dec  6 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Mmk.. - Sun Dec  6 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Huffs a bit more, looking away.* - Sun Dec  6 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: S-She is messing with me. . .she doesn't care. .  - Sun Dec  6 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Are you okay..? - Sun Dec  6 05:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . .Y-Yea. . fine. Stop worrying about me. - Sun Dec  6 05:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: I can't help it, sorry. - Sun Dec  6 05:46:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Ah huh. . . - Sun Dec  6 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: I want to sleep. . .I'm so tired. . . - Sun Dec  6 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Are you sure you don't at least want a blanket over there? This place isn't very insulated. - Sun Dec  6 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: I won't move you this itme. - Sun Dec  6 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: I-I Said I'm fine! - Sun Dec  6 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Tch. . . - Sun Dec  6 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: If that was the truth you wouldn't have been begging for help in your sleep. - Sun Dec  6 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Sun Dec  6 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: I-I'm fine. . . - Sun Dec  6 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Literally unable to stay awake anymore, she'd start to doze off, "I-I'm c-completely f-fine. . ." saying such as she literally passed out, leaning forward as her dress fell around her. Passing out she'd already start to have her now re-occuring nightmare. 

The mumbling starting, "N-No. . ." though the difference? It was unlikely she'd wake up this time, her body wouldn't allow it.* - Sun Dec  6 05:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) thinks: If she wakes up on her own she'll get suspicious. - Sun Dec  6 05:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Shaking some as the blacket was put around her, she'd continue to mumble, now sweating again as the nightmare took hold again, "N-No. . .H-Hot. . .R-Run." the nightmare being that of a giant fireball coming from the heavens to kill her.* - Sun Dec  6 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: ... - Sun Dec  6 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) getting embraces, it would seem to Amaya that Saika was shaking, and burning up. Also, she'd probably realize Saika was no where near waking up. Though, feeling Amaya's body, in her dream she'd find herself getting colder, cooling her. Her words, doing something to calm her as she slept, the dream would eventually come to a conclusion where the fireball hit her, roasting her. Which, transfering to real life, would cause her to shake and stiffen, crying out in pain a bit as she completely stopped moving. The dream was done, and her breathing ragid.

Apparently the genjutsu that had actually happened to her was still haunting her nightmares.* - Sun Dec  6 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) still being alive obviously, she'd be pulled into her lap, and be held close. Usually if she was awake, she'd object and argue about this, though, as she was asleep, she'd suddenly be -very- calm in her hold, her face softening more than it ever had, a look of pure peace on her face while being held.* - Sun Dec  6 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Being held close to Amaya, her warmth, along with the blanket helping, she'd be getting the best sleep she had in months. Thinking Amaya was a pillow or something in her sleep, she'd reach out, trying to wrap her arms around her and snuggle her head into her, "Comfy. . .sleepy. . ." all signs of the previous nightmare gone.* - Sun Dec  6 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Being that nothing had happened to make her wake, she'd continue to snuggle into Amaya, mistaking her for something other than a person. Squeezing rather tightly, she'd mumble, "Mmmm, pillow~ So comfy. . " her voice being -very- sweet compared to normal, her soft feminine side showing.* - Sun Dec  6 06:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Eventually stopping her squeezing, hitting the point of deep sleep, she'd just have her arms strewed out, not really wrapped, or placed anywhere now. Being under the blanket, her legs would curl up under her, she'd look just like a normal happy girl now, no signs of sadness or hostility that would normally show. If anything, she was even happier for some reason, the warmth and holding somehow transitioning into a happy dream from her past as her face blushed red with joy in her sleep.* - Sun Dec  6 06:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) eventually starting to wake up, her eyes would somewhat open, though, having slept the best she had in months, she wouldn't register where she was, or who she was on. Simply stretching her arms a bit, she'd yawn, her face going back to the usual soft frown as she closed her eyes and continued to lay there, unknowing in her still half-asleep state that she was resting on Amaya.* - Sun Dec  6 17:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) eventually coming to her senses, she'd open her eyes again, her face as cold as it usually was. Noticing the blanket first, she'd find herself a bit upset. Though, then noticing who was under it with her, and holding her, she'd go wide eyed, backing away somewhat aggravate, and embarassed as her face flashed red.

"W-What the hell!? I-I knew I shouldn't have slept. . .get away from me!" refusing to look the girl in the eyes, she'd turn her head away.* - Sun Dec  6 17:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Her face showing confusion, she'd look away.
