<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Aggravation showing in the girls face, she'd turn to the hokage, her black dress fitting her form well as it flowed with her. A soft frown that looked like it never left her face, and milky white pale eyes would look to Rias.

"I'm sorry to say, I was simply looking around. No rude intentions were meant. I dislike people. Even if they are thre leader of a village. People mean trouble." saying such in a soft sad voice as she just wanted to leave at this point.* - Mon Dec  7 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Moving only two steps further, she'd look to the hokage, they look on her face unchanging as she didn't speak. She figured if she had to suffer talking to someone, she'd listen and that would be it. She'd refuse to do much more, and it was likely she'd refuse to move any farther forward, even if threatened.* - Mon Dec  7 05:45:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Getting aggravated even more unhappy that she was being forced to move forward. She'd stay where she was. "I'm fine to speak from where I stand." saying such softly, her face unchanging. 

Her eyes suddenly flooding with chakra, she'd scan the room for any traps, or dangers.* - Mon Dec  7 05:56:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Watching the Hokage stand to her feet, and start to approach, she'd back step, not allowing her to get close enough to touch her, "I told you, I don't like being near people. Leave me alone." saying such in a soft way, her slight frown ever present, she'd attempt to move as far away as she could, avoiding her touch.* - Mon Dec  7 06:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Seeing the clones summoned, she'd already feel unsafe. Letting tha chakra stop flowing to her eyes, she'd back step towards the door, being faster than the clones. "I-I told you. J-Just leave me alone." saying such, she wouldn't be out of the mansion yet, though she'd make sure she was faster than the clones, and could make an exit if need be. 

It was clear the girl was frightened.* - Mon Dec  7 06:31:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) being released, her first thought would to be to run. Looking to her, she'd say, "Back away. . ." obviously being uncomfortable with the situation. Trying to move out of the chair, she'd stand and back towards the wall.

Thinking to herself, <This hokage. . .I can't stand her. She has no respect for other's feelings.>* - Mon Dec  7 06:50:52 2015

A single tear finding its way down her face, she'd sigh softly once more, her actual look of her face unchanging, she always looked sad anyway. 

Slowly walking forward, it'd be like she was dragging feet, but she had no choice.* - Mon Dec  7 07:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Hmm to bad... I liked her too... she could have lived how she wanted... Oh well - Mon Dec  7 07:25:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Arriving at the gate, she'd look around, her face still saddened. Looking to a nearby caravan that seemed to be leaving, she'd think about hitching a ride somewhere, though she was unsure on where she'd even want to go. Walking over, she'd find herself forced to talk with someone, asking where the best place to go would be.* - Mon Dec  7 07:34:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Sighing slightly, her thoughts running between wanting to stay, but not wanting to be forced to talk to anyone, and where she could go to be happy, she'd suddenly reach to the side of her dress, reaching into what would seem to be a secret pocket. Pulling out a bit of money, her frown being the same as ever, she'd look through it.

Pulling out a bit of money, she'd hold back tears. While she hated the people, she loved the actual feel, being the nature and such around it. Shaking this off, she'd hand over a bit of money, moving to step onto a caravan.* - Mon Dec  7 07:42:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking back to Rias, she was unsure if she even wanted to go back in at this point. She was sick of getting toyed with. That, and she had enough of the Kage. Waiting for her to say something else, looking to the Caravan, she'd be split in three ways.* - Mon Dec  7 07:48:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Shaking her head lightly, she'd mutter, "Close your eyes and look away. I'll know if you look." as if to prove it, she'd suddenly let chakra rush to her eyes, her Doujusti activated to watch him at the same time.

Once she was sure he wasn't doing anything, she'd suddenly come to a realization, ". . .I need you to untie the back. . ."* - Mon Dec  7 10:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Sighing slightly, she'd remove the dress, leaving her standing in her black underwear as she carefully folded the dress. Sighing slightly, she'd try to wipe at her skin, still feeling nasty. Shaking it off, she'd move to put on the other clothes, though, hacing to tie the pants on, and knot the shirt so that it'd stay on her she'd mumble, "Did I really look that fat?" asking such being that in reality she had a body most would be jealous of, and she didn't know it.

Sighing slightly, she'd shake it off, "Sleep in the tent. I'll see you when you wake up." putting the dress to the side with some things, she'd move to stand against a tree, yawning, though forcing herself to stay awake.* - Mon Dec  7 10:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Biting her lip a bit, she'd shake her head, "I can't sleep well without being held, and I don't want you to hold me. . ." shaking her head, having spilt the beans straight up, she'd say, "Just sleep. I'll be fine. Go." saying such as she stared into the darkness, no plans of sleeping tonight.* - Mon Dec  7 10:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking to him, she'd sigh slightly, "You better help me out in the morning. I'll be sleepy."* - Mon Dec  7 10:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You're going in the tent? - Mon Dec  7 10:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Yep. . .right after you. - Mon Dec  7 10:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Go on. - Mon Dec  7 10:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Walks over, tying the tent closed from the outside, "Night." walking back to the tree, she'd lean against it, staring to the sky.* - Mon Dec  7 10:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Standing against the same tree she had been the all through the night, she'd have bags under her eyes, obviously having not slept a wink. Watching him pack up, she'd simply grab her dress. "River. . .right?" being that she looked rather dirty still from the previous days travels. 

Though, in her current mood, she wasn't going to speak much. She had let too much speak the day before.* - Mon Dec  7 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Sighing softly, her face ever forwning, she'd move to follow him, having no choice again in the matter as she knew that she couldn't survive out here alone.* - Mon Dec  7 18:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Mon Dec  7 18:51:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: A-And I expect you to make sure no one walks by that can see. - Mon Dec  7 18:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Shaking her head, she'd look down to her clothes, being too big. Shaking her head, she'd slowly strip, leaving her standing in a black lace underwear set at first as she leaned over to basically wash her dress. Once she had done so, she'd lay it out in the grass to dry from the sun as she removed the rest of her clothes and stepped into the like cold water?

Shivering a bit, she'd suck it up and quickly wash and the such, removing the previous days filth. "This is a new one. . .washing in a river." shaking her head, she'd eventually get out. ". . .W-What am I meant to do for a towel. . ."* - Mon Dec  7 18:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Nodding lightly, she'd do such, finding one eventually, using it to dry off before putting the way too big clothes that had been bought for her on. Grabbing her dress that was likely still drying she'd mumble, "Alright." being that thankyou was yet a word in her vocabulary.* - Mon Dec  7 18:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Yea. . . - Mon Dec  7 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Cool. - Mon Dec  7 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Are you ready to travel? - Mon Dec  7 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . .I guess. - Mon Dec  7 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: We're going west. - Mon Dec  7 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Mhm. - Mon Dec  7 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Frowning even more than usual, she'd sigh, "Whatever." before walking behind him, already hating the idea.* - Mon Dec  7 19:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking to him, she'd simply stare back with her milky-white eyes as she stated in her soft, stern voice, "Smiling is pointless." though in reality, it usually slipped when she slept, and got out of he nightmares.* - Mon Dec  7 19:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Fine fine, i'll get you to do it some day. - Mon Dec  7 19:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Shaking her head, following behind him, she'd tone his humming out, only liking music that came from nature, or in manmade form, the piano. Looking down at her clothes she'd frown, mumbling, "He couldn't have gotten smaller ones. . .? I know I'm not fat. . .am I? And white. . .I hate white. . .why couldn't it have been black?" mumbling these annoyances under her breath, she hoped Ziare didn't hear them, as she had no reason to want to talk to him.* - Mon Dec  7 19:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Continuing to walk after him, her dress eventually drying, she really wanted to put it back on now, though felt it was too hot to change, and too open. Having ignored Zaire the entire walk, she'd take in their new surrondings.* - Mon Dec  7 19:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Noticing the heat, though not sweating near as bad as Ziare, she'd shrug, not exactly caring about him. He was the fool to want to travel to begin with. Sighing lightly she'd look around.

Even though she had stayed cool because of the clothes Ziare had bought her, she hated them. She'd take a black dress over any other syle of clothing. That is, unless she knew she had to fight, and even then she'd still wear a dress if she could.

Hearing him speak, her usual frown would find him. "That's fine. I don't plan to wear them long anyway. They aren't a dress."* - Mon Dec  7 19:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Biting her botton lip, not wanting to be forced to take from him, she'd eventually reach out and grab the food, waiting for him to eat first before she did, ever so untrusting of others. Again looking to him sweating, feeling that she owed him something, again.

Muttering out she'd say, "Switch with me." leaving that hanging, she wouldn't explain what as she was embarassed, and mad for even speaking to him.* - Mon Dec  7 19:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Glancing away, she'd keep her usual facial expression, "I want to wear my dress. . .you're sweating too much. . .this shirt is nice and big." saying such as she knew she'd take the hit from the heat if she wore a black dress, she didn't care. She wanted to get this feeling of owing Ziare out of hey system.* - Mon Dec  7 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Are you sure? - Mon Dec  7 19:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I got it for you to wear. - Mon Dec  7 19:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Since we were haded to the desert. - Mon Dec  7 19:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . .I'm only making the offer once. - Mon Dec  7 19:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Alright. - Mon Dec  7 19:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Yes or no? - Mon Dec  7 19:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Yes. - Mon Dec  7 19:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Mumbling now she'd say, "Turn away. . ." once she was sure that he had, she'd strip the white shirt off of her back and throw it at him while moving to put her black dress back on. The size of it hugging her body rather well as she'd then pull off he pants from underneath it, allowing more air to her legs while restricting her upper half.

Grumppy that she had to ask this, being as at home she'd be forced to attempt it herself and look like a fool she'd mutter, "The back please. . ."* - Mon Dec  7 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Shaking her head, as in fact, she did sweat. More than he'd realize. Though, it wouldn't have shown with the fact she'd be wearing a rather large shirt.

"I wish. . ." being that even as she said such, and they started to walk, the black dress would begin to absorb heat, causing her to sweat many times more than she had before. Though, she refused to complain, and refused to take anything else from Ziare. She had made the choice to come here, and she was going to follow it.* - Mon Dec  7 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Shaking her head lightly, unwilling to reply, she'd be a bit drenched by now, and hope that Ziare didn't see as she wasn't in the mood for his pity, or even his words really. "They better have green tea. . " really wishing she had her normal daily amount of it.* - Mon Dec  7 19:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Tch. . .a shower would be better. - Mon Dec  7 19:55:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: I can't even go back. . . - Mon Dec  7 20:01:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: -omit- - Mon Dec  7 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Would simply follow Ziare, not knowing what was going on. She didn't like the fact she had to be near people, but she'd deal with it for now, speaking quietly to the girl as she kept a soft frown, "If you try anything. . ." trailing off, obviously having had troubles in the past that made her afraid.

Though, her mind would drift, wondering who she'd try and tell first about the bitch-kage back in Konoha.* - Mon Dec  7 20:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Wouldn't dream of it. - Mon Dec  7 20:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Unhenges into edge -omit-* - Mon Dec  7 20:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Ignoring the girls words, being as she truely hated all people, and wanted nothing to do with them, she'd feel the cut into her hand as she bit her lip. Not one used to pain, she'd huff a bit.

Finally bringing herself to speak she'd say, "I'd also like to talk to someone about the Hokage. . .not that my words matter." glancing to Ziare, keeping her same sad look, she was hoping he wouldn't be mad about her words dealing with the kage. Even if they were true.* - Mon Dec  7 20:13:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Erh, the Kazekage isn't around right at the moment. - Mon Dec  7 20:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: I see. - Mon Dec  7 20:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) thinks: She must really not like Rias, i've never seen her willingly not want to talk to anyone. - Mon Dec  7 20:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Then. . .if you don't mind. I'll pass the information to you for now? - Mon Dec  7 20:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) was really forcing herself to talk, and was hating it.* - Mon Dec  7 20:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Sure. - Mon Dec  7 20:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: It's. . .somewhat stupid but. . . - Mon Dec  7 20:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hm? - Mon Dec  7 20:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Sighing softly, grabbing her black dress that fit her rather well in her hands, she'd force herself to speak and recall the story. Ziare hadn't even heard it yet.

"I walked into her office. Wanted to leave. She wanted me to stay. I don't like people you see?" pausing, going about this in a rambling way as it was upsetting to her, "She used clones to block the exit. . .threatened to break my legs. . .even used a jutsu to force me to freeze and walk and forcefully sit my next to her. . ."

Sighing some, she'd speak again, "When I didn't want to talk to her, she threatened me again, and then kicked me out of Konoha. Told me if I returned I'd live to regrete it forever." shaking her head she'd move to sum it up.

"She even stated she kicked me out just on a whim. She kicked a shinobi out of her village because I didn't adore her like everyone else, and didn't want to talk to her. She bends the laws to get what she wants." 

Unsure if this was even a bad thing, or if it even mattered, she'd stop. Talking to someone this long was making her sick. "I guess it doesn't matter. . .but it seemed like the guards disliked her for it. . ." sighing, she'd move away, really needing quiet, and to be alone now.* - Mon Dec  7 20:23:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Shaking her head slowly as if to say she wouldn't go back at any point now, she'd frown, looking to Ziare to make sure he wasn't upset.* - Mon Dec  7 20:30:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: What do you need? - Mon Dec  7 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looks down at her sweat covered dress. Pulling out a good amount of money, she'd eyes Ziare briefly. "Could you go buy me the best black dress you can find? Whatever you'd think would look good. . ." then going on, mentioning her sizes to him, not caring if he knew, she'd wait for a response.* - Mon Dec  7 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Nodding slightly, she'd move to the back room, struggling to pull the zipper on the back down. Eventually getting it, she'd undress and shower, really wishing she'd have grabbed more of her things before she had left. Eventually finishing, she'd wrap herself, and her hair in a towel, her frown ever the same as she waited.* - Mon Dec  7 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Drying off, she'd move to put her under garmets back on, and would simply keep the towel over her body, waiting for Ziare to get back with the dress.* - Mon Dec  7 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Gritting her teeth annoyed, she'd move to the bed, grabbing the blanket to wrap around her body. She didn't plan to show off. Moving to the door, she'd slowly open it, seeing it was Ziare. Sighing, she'd say, "Close your eyes, walk in." she didn't want to take chances.* - Mon Dec  7 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking it over, she didn't exactly believe him, but she didn't have much of a choice at thr moment. Grabbing it and moving to the back room, she'd quickly change into it and walk out. Not saying anything, she wanted to know how she looked, though, she didn't like Ziare particularly, or anyone for that matter, thus, she was unsure on what to do.* - Mon Dec  7 21:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Hearing the compliment, she'd turn away, hiding a faint blush. Looking back to him after it faded, her frown ever present, she'd sigh, "So what now?" obviously she had no clue what to do, or the such, being she had been in Konoha her entire life.

Though, seeing him sit and fall back, she assumed they were taking a break?* - Mon Dec  7 21:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You wanna get the tea? - Mon Dec  7 21:22:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Feeling bad at his words, she'd huff, moving forward to hold her small, quite soft hand out, "Fine. . ."* - Mon Dec  7 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Simply helping him to his feet, she'd wipe her hand a bit on her dress. She didn't think he was dirty or nasty, it was just she had an issue with touching others. Though, mumbling as she walked, her words not matching her frowning face, "Tea~"* - Mon Dec  7 21:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Simply sitting in the seat, waiting for her tea, she'd have the same frown, yet seem, calm and fine. "I'm so looking forward to this."* - Mon Dec  7 21:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'm pretty sure it'll be nice. - Mon Dec  7 21:32:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Ignoring Ziare, as she cared nothing for him, she'd grab the hot water, pouring it into her cup to let it transfer over to green tea. Her soft frown ever the same, and her black dress fitting her well, she'd sip at it, nto caring if it was hot. 

To anyone watching, it would seem more like Ziare was intruding on a special moment between her and her tea.* - Mon Dec  7 21:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Ignoring Ziare completely, she'd continue to drink her own tea, the most relaxed she had been in days.

"Mmmmm." a light noise of satisfaction coming from her lips.* - Mon Dec  7 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Hearing his laugh, she'd glare up, as if to silence him. Though, looking back down to her tea, the frown still having not left her face, she'd continue to drink the tea, letting it warm her.* - Mon Dec  7 21:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Hmph. - Mon Dec  7 21:53:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) (*Yamato, Saika Sighing softly, grabbing her black dress that fit her rather well in her hands, she'd force herself to speak and recall the stor she had told Izanami at the gate. Saying it exactly the same a she had told her.

"I walked into the Hokage office. Wanted to leave. She wanted me to stay. I don't like people . . ." pausing, rambling a way as it was upsetting to her, "She used clones to block the exit. . .threatened to break my legs. . .even used a jutsu to force me to freeze and walk and forcefully sit my next to her. . ."

Sighing some, she'd speak again, "When I didn't want to talk to her, she threatened me again, and then kicked me out of Konoha. Told me if I returned I'd live to regret it forever." shaking her head she'd move to sum it up.

"She even stated she kicked me out just on a whim. She kicked a shinobi out of her village because I didn't adore her like everyone else, and didn't want to talk to her. She bends the laws to get what she wants." 

Unsure if this was even a bad thing, or if it even mattered, she'd stop. Talking to someone this long was making her sick. "I guess it doesn't matter. . .but it seemed like the guards disliked her for it. . ." sighing, she'd have enough, hoping her point got across.* - Mon Dec  7 22:38:04 2015
