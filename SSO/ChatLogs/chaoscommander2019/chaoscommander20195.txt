<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking to Ziare, hearing what was said, and how he reacted, she'd frown, not liking this look. Gulping a bit, she'd move to wrap her arms around him from behind. Her chest likely pushing into him as her hands would be around her stomach, "Ziare-kun. . .everything will be alright. They'll come back. . ." she was having a hard time thinking of how to cheer him up.

Frowning a bit more, she'd bury her head into his back, "Things will get better. . ."* - Fri Dec 11 05:01:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) hearing Ziare break down crying, her heart would be tugged at greatly. While Saika wasn't one to be able to handle this type of thing, it was different when it came to Ziare. Looking to his back, she'd slowly try to escape his grasp. 

"Silly Ziare-kun. . ." saying such softly, in a loving mannor, she'd walk around to be in front of him. Looking at him, she'd move forward, grabbing his face lightly, she'd suck up how much she'd hate what she was about to do. Pulling his head down, she'd hold it to her chest, letting him cry into her, "You're the only person I care about in this messed up world. Why would I leave you?" saying such as if it were common sense, she'd hold him to her fondly.* - Fri Dec 11 06:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking to the smile, she'd shake her head lightly, "What is it Ziare-kun?" asking such, she'd move to brush some hair behind her ear, looking to him with a soft face, though no smile yet, she was still worried about the man in front of her. Shaking her head, she'd glance away, waiting for him to speak up.* - Fri Dec 11 06:21:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking to him, and being unable to contain a giggle, she'd suddenly smile, a good few seconds of giggle like laughing being heard, "There is my Ziare-kun. . .I knew you'd get that way~" saying such, her face eventually falling to her usual frown, she'd say, "Ziare-kun is the only one who cares for me. . .and is the only one I care for." saying such, she'd kneel in front of him. Trying to get to his level.

"As a side note. . you aren't allowed to be with the hokage alone anymore." having remembered back to what had been said.* - Fri Dec 11 06:35:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: I-I feel so weird. - Fri Dec 11 06:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Catching sight of his hand going through his hair, she had a bit of an idea that he was nervous, and in turn, this would make her nervous, which would cause her to smooth her dress out a bit. Hearing what he had asked, she'd blush -deep- red and tear up some, unable to contain her happiness. Looking to him with her pale milkly eyes, she'd shake her head.

"You're stupid Ziare-kun. . .I-I wanted to beat you to this too. . .but. . .i-if you want to be with me forever. . ." she'd blush even harder. Mumbling something, and Ziare would have to be paying -very- good attention to hear it, "You might need to go buy a ring for me. . .silly." letting her true feelings for the man in front of her show, she'd turn away, trying to walk away before she fully turned into what she hated, an emotional nomal girl.

Trying to lock all of her feelings back up and clear her face off, she'd attempt to force the frown back, but seemed to be having an issue as of now.* - Fri Dec 11 06:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking as he ran through the house multiple times like a mad man, she'd be very confused. She could somewhat put two and two together, but she didn't think he'd react the way he did. Thus, left standing there, embarrassment plastered on her face, she'd wait for him to return. 

Watching as he eventually returned, she'd notice how much he was wheezing, and that he was kneeled. Likely noticing the ring if it was out, she'd be shocked. While she had mentioned it and put the information together in her head from him running, she never thought he'd do it -right- now. Looking down to him, she'd instantly cry. "Silly Ziare-kun. . .do you even have to ask at this point?" saying such as she kneeled down as well, she'd hold her hand out for him, expecting he'd want to put the ring on her finger.

"Ziare-kun. . .I hope you're truely okay with me. . I'm not that special and a bunch of people dislike me." saying such through tears as a joke, she'd look to him, wanting hold him tight, though she didn't want to ruin his moment. She'd taken the lead on so many things, she didn't want to take the moment of their engagement from him as well.* - Fri Dec 11 07:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Hearing his words, she'd accidently break into a small smile, being pulled to him. Smelling the outside are on him as he wiped her tears away she'd mutter, "S-Stupid Ziare-kun. . .made me wait. . ." saying such trying to keep her hard exterior she'd then hear what he said about smiling, this only causing her smile to grow, "N-No one else deserves to see it, silly." saying such as even more tears would start to flow.

Wrapping her arms around his back, she'd let him kiss her, and would in turn kiss back, pure happiness and love radiating from her. Once the kiss was likely broken, she'd stay huddled against him, "Stupid Ziare-kun. . ." the tears unable to be stopped as she was likely the happiest she'd been ever.* - Fri Dec 11 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Being how happy she was, and knowing how Ziare acted she'd say into his form, "Don't do something stupid either. . don't change. . .stay how you are. We've made it through five years of traveling. . .you don't need to change. . .just. . help me get stronger so I can help both of us." meaning such in terms of power, but also support and mental wise.

Squeezing Ziare tightly she'd say, "We can live the same as we have these few years. . .just. . .as long as I'm with you." saying such as all of her pent up emotions were finally running out, she'd burry her head into his shoulder even more. "I'm so happy Ziare-kun. . .I-I. . .I haven't said it enough, but I love you. . .everytime I look at you. . ." rambling on she'd just stay in his grasp.

Her usual personality burried by this rush of happiness, it'd likely show back up afterwards, meaning, this would be a rare lived spectical.* - Fri Dec 11 07:36:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) gets through that whole process, yippie.* - Fri Dec 11 08:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Sighing lightly as she had made her way away from the rest of the village, finding herself firmly planted in the middle of it off away from where people could see her, she'd start to stretch. She felt like her time goofing off with Ziare had left her weak and unprepared for any sort of combat, while she liked to rely on him, she didn't plan to be a hassle forever. She had come to the conclusion that with her fighting style, she'd never be able to hit hard exactly, and thus, she felt like if she could make up for it with being faster, and attacking faster, she'd be alright. Thus, moving to make a line in the sand, she'd use it as her starting line. Looking around the area, she had marked it out as a sort of race with surprises. Starting, she'd bring herself to run at top speed from the start, not wanting to simply waste her effort by trying half assed attempts. <1>

The first part of the small course she had set up being just an open running area, she'd focus on how she moved, wanting to be faster speed, attack, and reflex wise. Feeling her feet dig into the ground, she found it somewhat easier if she made subtle movements with her toes, using them to propel herself forward a bit faster of the dismount of her foot. Thus, she'd use this in this particular stretch, focusing more on that than anything. Doing such as she ran, she'd find herself getting more tired that she thought this maneuver would cause, her toes getting a bit sore. Ignoring the feeling, she'd continue to dig her toes in, or more so the front of her shoes, letting the front portion do all of the work. <2>

Finding herself sweating already, and not even being a fifth of the way done with the course, she'd start to breathe heavy. Apparently even running for such a short amount of time was a bit much for her as she covered a few hundred feet. Her legs and feet burning now, she'd want to slow down but would refuse, she knew if she gave in now and stopped, she'd be left weak forever. Ignoring the strain she was putting on her feet with her new way of running, and the strain on her legs from the constant movement, she'd keep moving forward, her hair swaying, blocking her vision as she suddenly stumbled, her legs falling from under her as she had only made it about halfway through the running section she had made. Falling to the ground, she'd grunt in anger. <3>

Moving to tie her hair back out of her face, she'd huff a bit, wiping away the sweat that had gathered on her. Standing back to her feet and ignoring the zapping pain in her legs, she'd sigh, moving back to the starting point of the course she had set up. Still huffing a bit, she'd reach down and wipe herself off. Looking back down the course, she'd start to run once again. Once more focusing on her running style, she'd make her way back down the previous section of course. Digging into the dirt with the front half of her feet, she'd push forward, trying to propel herself as fast as she could, aiming to make it down the path now without messing up, or allowing the gathering pain in her feet to stop her. <4>

Again already back to the point that she was sweating and her body was causing her to breath heavily being that she wasn't used to having to use this much energy for anything really, she'd feel her legs want to lock up. Not letting them, she'd make them move forward, her feet as well. Forcing them to move, she'd see the end of the running section she had set up approaching. Gritting her teeth and grunting, she'd push herself the best she could, again propelling herself forward with the front of her feet, trying to make it so she could launch forward faster, much like a professional runner coming off the starting line, she would try to reach the end of the section. Her eyes locked forward, she'd catch sight of a rather large rock she had forgotten about. Using the new style of running she had thought up, she'd quickly push the weight on her toes, and shift it to allow her to make a somewhat quick diagonal shift, avoiding the rock, letting her reach the end. <5>

The last stretch that she had gone through, having avoided the rock, she'd come to another conclusion in her training. If she wanted her speed to increase, it would be pointless if all she could do was run straight, and be unable to avoid anything. She also came to the conclusion that her style of moving now, would allow her to adjust, and practice that avoidance. Thinking this, she'd move onto another 'section' which in reality was just a large, long cluster of trees that she had added onto her training just now. Looking at all the low laying branches, she'd shift a bit nervously and nod, knowing she had to train, even if it hurt her. Moving forward, running, though not at her top speed yet, she'd attempt to run -through- the trees, trying to weave and dodge her body through it without getting hit only using her toes to go forward. Though, only making it about one tree in, she'd run smack into a large branch, falling back and wincing in pain, "F-Fuck! This is going to suck!" saying such, she'd again move back to the start of this section. <6>

Looking at the trees angrily, she'd stretch a bit more, her legs still feeling wobbly from all the running she had done before. Looking forward, she'd decide it'd be better to cheat a bit more. Flooding chakra to her eyes, she'd activate her byakugan, letting her get a better view of the trees, and what was to come. This, giving her a bit more confidence, she'd rush forward, again trying to weave through the trees without hitting any of the limbs that hung from the sides, and down. Making it a bit father than before, she'd be about four trees in before it'd suddenly get thicker, and this mixed with the fact she was running and weaving, would make things more complicated as she couldn't keep up with all of the actions, again running straight into another tree limb, knocking her back onto the ground in a bit of pain. <7>

Sighing, eventually getting to her feet after sitting a bit to let the pain subside, she'd again make her way back to the start. Obviously if she wanted to get faster, along with better reflexes, it would require her entire attention until it became a second nature to her. Sighing lightly, getting her breathing straight, she'd look around, making sure that no one was around to laugh at her failures. Nodding lightly, she'd again look back to the trees, using her eyes to get a gold hold of what was to come. Rushing forward once more, staying on her toes the entire time, she'd utilize them to weak and dodge the best she could, jumping from side to side, and diagonally. Moving to make it through the trees, she'd find herself enjoying it, even with the pain now in her legs. Though this happiness distracting her, she'd make it about halfway through the large grouping of trees before she'd again run smack into another branch, causing her to fall back in pain onto the ground. This was begging to get old to her, and it'd show on her face. Though, she'd force herself onward the best she could. <8>

Of course, doing the obvious thing at this point, she'd move back to the start of the tree'd section. Gritting her teeth, she was sure she'd be able to do it this time, she just wouldn't let her focus slip again. Having gotten a good hold on how to slip through the first half of the threes, she'd rush forward on her toes, using them to propel herself forward, while also cutting back on her reaction time, as she could shift her weight, and push off in a direction to dodge. Easily making it through the first quarter of the tree'd in area, it would again thicken as she started to make it into the second quarter. Though, her eyes assisting her, and the use of her feet and legs, which were burning from constant use, she'd weave and avoid through most of the limbs, making sure that she wasn't hit. Deciding to push it a bit more, she'd try to go full out speed wise, being she was confident once she had made it through the first half. This confidence being her downfall, she'd make it about three-fourths of the way now, trying to force herself to go even faster, before she'd run into what seemed to be an animal jumping by. Perhaps a squirrel, she couldn't see it as she was busy messing up from it. This, throwing her off, she'd again stumble and fall. <9>

Sighing lightly, she'd look back to the trees, obviously having made her way back to the start once again. Still on the toes and front of her feet, like she had been through all of this day in her training, though, she'd be having a hard time staying balanced when not moving, noting this for afterwards, she'd again start to run, being that when she ran her feet weren't on the ground long enough to have to worry about perfect balance. Again aiming to get through these, trees, she'd start to weave through them, using the weight on her toes, and the mobility it gave her to jump side to side, and dodge hitting a branch or trunk. Doing this while keeping up speed, she'd find herself completely focused on the task at hand for once, wanting to be done with it. Eventually finding herself in an open area at the end, she'd fall, her feet, or more specifically, the front part, and toes would be aching, blisters likely forming. "It helps so much. . .but it hurts. . .need to train more." <10>* - Fri Dec 11 19:47:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Having taken quite a long enough break, she'd eventually walk back to the area she had decided was her training ground. Having soaked her feet, and wrapped them, more specifically the front portion, and toes, she'd be somewhat better off than she was the last time. Remembering how hard it was to balance on her toes, and front of her feet when she wasn't moving before she'd decide that she'd start to work on that now. Moving to the sandy area of the grounds, she'd stand regularly at first, taking a few deep breathes thinking that she'd be at it for some time. While, it was going to seem like an easy task, she was sure that like most things in her life, it was going to be harder than appeared. Nodding, she'd stand her feet up onto her toes, and the front portion of her feet, trying to get used to the feeling. Being -very- wobbly since she wasn't moving, she'd feel more strain than she thought she would, eventually having to fall back to be flat footed from it. <11>

Sighing lightly, moving to get some water that she had brought with her being that it was rather hot outside, she'd quickly drink it down and move back to her original standing position. Nodding lightly to herself, she'd try and force herself to hold it longer this time. Quickly forcing herself up onto the front portion of her toes and feet, she'd attempt to hold herself there, balanced. The strain on her muscles again more than she thought it would be, she'd fight through it. Though, after a few moments she'd feel her balance and weight start to shift. Unable to keep her body on her toes, and the shifting throwing her off, she'd be forced to step over a bit to counter-act her falling, her balance still not good enough to hold steady without thinking about it, or apparently even when she was focused on it. <12>

Sighing slightly, moving back to her original position, she'd shake her head, trying to get past the frustration she was having. Again raising herself to fronts and toes on her feet, she'd focus more on staying balanced than actually maintaining it for the time being, figuring that if she could stay still, and balanced at the same time, she'd eventually get used to it enough to actually maintain for a long period. Keeping her focus on this, she'd eventually start to wobble a bit again, finding it harder to keep her balance for as long as she'd like. Forcing it to stop, she'd eventually have the balance portion of it under control, having no issue with it. <13>* - Fri Dec 11 22:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Again standing back to her normal position, she'd stand to her toes, and the front of her feet. Already used to standing still, and using the fronts of them to run and weave a small bit, she'd now want to get used to stopping and going, making it so that she'd be somewhat used to it. Thinking this, she'd hop a bit, getting ready. Taking off, she'd run forward much like she had at the start of her training. Though, seeing a mark she had made to tell her when to stop, she'd realize it was going to be harder than she thought. Quickly trying to stop her momentum and stay on her toys, she'd basically face plant, falling forward into the dirt, as being she was only using a small portion of her foot to stay connected to the ground, she hadn't been prepared for the shift in weight. <14>

Shaking her head and getting back to her feet, she'd simply turn to go back towards the original place she had started, running on her toes once more. Doing such, she'd again attempt to stop herself. This time ready to stop and compensate for her shift of weight, she'd come to a complete halt, staying on her toes the entire time. Happy with herself, she'd sigh, her feet and ankles still burning from all of the work she'd be forcing herself through. Moving to sit and rest she'd mutter, "This is all to help Ziare-kun if he ever needs it." Saying such she'd eventually get to her feet and head home for the day, having practiced enough, though still planning to come back the next day to continue to work, figuring it'd help. <15>* - Fri Dec 11 23:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Noticing Ziare, she'd shake her head, she'd be covered in sweat, and her feet would look a bit swollen if he looked, "Hey. . .Just. . .training. Trying to get faster."* - Sat Dec 12 00:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking to him, she'd nod a small bit, "It'd be nice if you would. I need to get better at. . .how I'm fighting?"* - Sat Dec 12 00:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking to him, confused at first, it would seem that Ziare would help her train with what she wanted, though hearing what he had said she'd be confused. Getting herself ready, she'd move to position herself on the front half of her foot, or more specifically her toes. Hearing a mention of a shadow, she'd look down, noticing that his was rapidly moving in her direction. Panicing, she'd attempt to turn and run to the side, trying to avoid it, "I-I would have been happy with a normal spar! I-I need to get faster attack wise as well!" saying such as she had been training her feet all day, she wasn't sure if she'd be able to avoid this weird attack, though she'd try.* - Sat Dec 12 00:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking to him, she'd get a bit upset, "No hurting me. . .I'm not that good." saying such, she'd stay on her toes, trying to get used to it. Nodding a small bit, she'd attempt to close the gap between them, refused to activate her eyes, or fighting style as she didn't want to hurt Ziare, even though she thought she couldn't. Staying on the front of her feet, unless stopped, she'd attempt to get in as many strikes on Ziare that she could, though they'd lack real power, she was more focused on attacking fast than she was doing any real damage being that her normal style of fighting didn't need any real power normally anyway. <17>* - Sat Dec 12 00:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) catching sight of the hand seals being formed, she'd quickly try to stop, skirting up on her toes even more she attempted to stop. Though, being that she had practiced that at least, she'd find herself able to stay standing, and not face plant. Though, she'd likely still be too unexperianced with the menthod of running and fighting she was developing and would get too close, being caught in Ziare's shadows. Being unable to move, she'd simply sigh and look to him, "That's unfair, ya know? I can only fight had to hand. . " speaking such she'd wait for him to release her, still wanting to train. <18>* - Sat Dec 12 01:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Hearing what he had said about outrunning it, she'd be released from the shadow. Looking down to her feet, they'd feel terrible inside of her shoes. They probably didn't look all too good right now, but she wasn't going to tell him that. Shaking the thought off, she'd move back now, never leaving her stance of being on her toes, she was trying her best to make this style of fighting work, as she found it easier to react and move faster. Following the shadows with her eyes slightly, she'd decide to cheat a bit, "Sorry Ziare-kun, I'm going to make this easier for me." <19>

Having stated such to him, she'd flood her eyes with chakra, letting them work their magic to see around her better. Thus, being able to see the shadow, and able to look at Ziare, she'd make her way forward again, using the front portion of her foot, and her toes to drive herself forward as fast as she could, and to make changes to her running if she thought the shadow would get too close. Trying to cut the difference between them, if she managed to make her way past the shadows she'd again try to land as many light strikes as she could on Ziare before propeling herself back with her toes. <20>* - Sat Dec 12 01:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Hearing what he had said, not needing to be told being that she caught sight of his seals, and the shadow while looking at him with her doujutsu activated, she'd quickly try and shift the weight on her toes, pushing to the side with a good amount of force, aiming to avoid the shadows and be away from their range. If sucessful she'd be a good ways back again, her feet screaming at her from their adjustment to her knew style. Sighing lightly as she was beggining to get tired she'd look to Ziare, "You're no fun. . .I can't even practice attacking with you~" <21>

Once she had said such she'd again move to run at him. Keeping a look out for more seals, and his jutsu. She was ready to dodge if need be, but she planned to catch him off guard, "Ziare, Someone hit on me today~" saying such with a snicker, trying to distract him with it, she'd proceed forward on her toes, using them to launch herself forward, trying to move faster than she had before. If she somehow closed the distance like she hoped, she'd once again try to land as many quick hits as she could, again though if she did, they'd lack as much force as a normal person would throw. <22>* - Sat Dec 12 01:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Seeing that his defense was done, she'd rush forward on her toes like she had planned, staying on them to help her avoid and move around him if need be, she'd focus on attacking faster than she normally would now, giving up power for speed. Looking to him as she was right on him, she'd say, "Just kidding~" before suddenly attempting to hit him multiple times, all over the front of his body, though again, they lacked any physical force as she was practicing for her own fighting style later, and didn't want to hurt the man in front of her. If suceeding with this, she'd make another move. <23>

Shifting her weight to the side, again pushing from the ground with her toes, she'd try to circle around him, still continuing her fast weak attack on his body. Speaking as she did such, "How're you going to live if you get distracted by that~?" asking such she'd attempt to shift around to his back, her feet killing her from her constant training to fight on her toes now. If allowed, she'd again aim to hit him multiple times on his back. If she did this, she'd then propel herself backwards away from him. Hopefully if everything had gone through in the right way that she wanted, she'd then speak to him, "If I was trying, you'd be on the ground in pain now~" <24>* - Sat Dec 12 01:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Hearing him speak, she'd already see the shadows coming from him, "You should already know Ziare-kun, why would I even let someone hit on me?" asking such as she made her move to avoid the shadows, propelling her self back away from Ziare with the front of her food, and hopefully the shadows as she'd jump straight back, and attempt to land on her toes again, she hadn't trained yet on how to handle it while jumping, only running, dodging, and normal movement. Thus, she'd land quite weird and almost fall, having to adjust her weight to counter act the movement. "Sneaky~ Too bad I can see it~" <25>* - Sat Dec 12 02:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Seeing the shadows actually start to move up off the ground, her eyes would go wide, she hadn't been expecting such to happen, and her legs and feet were at the limit for the day, she had actually been up since dawn doing such, and it would finally show as she attempted to continue her movement on her toes, running to the side to hopefully outrun them. Getting a good distance away, she'd suddenly have her legs come from under her. Her toes couldn't handle anymore, and her legs and the rest of her body as well. Falling to the ground, getting grabbed by the shadows, she'd grit her teeth, "Good spar. . ." she didn't want to say anything about her feet, she was afraid of the scolding she'd get. <26>* - Sat Dec 12 02:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Are you okay? - Sat Dec 12 03:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Being caught by the shadows, holding her up, she'd look to him as he approached, a slight blush as she was forced to rely on him again, "I-I'm fine. . .stupid." saying such with a small, almost serious, yet playful voice, she'd look to her feet.

"Can you help me back to the house? I-I mean, not like I want your help or anything. . .I-It would just be. . .appreciated. . ." her words contradicting themselves, she'd just look away, her shoes likely ruined, and her feet likely a bit damaged, and would need a few days break, minimum.* - Sat Dec 12 03:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking to him, she'd blush, "Y-You're so stupid. . .if you keep doing things like this. . .I-. . ." leaning forward to get into his back, she'd lean forward more, kissing his cheek, "You're too sweet sometimes Ziare-kun. . .drawing out this side of me. . "* - Sat Dec 12 03:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking to him through squinted eyes as he sat, "I'm. . .heavy aren't I? I. . .should lose some weight. . .Or how else will Ziare-kun carry me bride st-" stopping herself with a blush she'd look away. Moving to tie her hair back out of her face, it easily reach down her back, she'd look back to him.

"I don't want you to see. . .I. . .trained all day. . .and ignored how much it hurt."* - Sat Dec 12 03:25:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Shaking her head, she'd blush leaning into him, "I only did it so you didn't have to look out for me as much. . .I don't want to be a burdon." saying such, reaching down, she'd move to untie her worn shoes, "I. . .don't want you to look. . .but I probably need help anyway. . ."* - Sat Dec 12 03:34:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Wincing a bit as it still hurt, Ziare would see her feet, which she had wrapped in bandages before already to help with the blisters and pain she had about mid-way into the day, and being she had been working even harder since then, they'd likely be bleeding through the bandages, the blistering long gone and simple ripped and worn skin in its place, along with the stress she'd put on them. "I might want to rest for a bit huh?" asking such playfully.

It would also be noticed she was wearing pants, T-shirt, and Vest for once since she was training. Pulling the vest and T-shirt up to show her tummy she'd say, "I also trained to weave and dodge through a dense forest at top speed. . .I took a few branches." saying such, if he looked, she'd be bruised and cut." basically, she'd likely pushed herself too far.* - Sat Dec 12 03:43:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking to him when he whispered what he had, she'd gulp, whispering back before watching him walk off. Watching as he came back, she'd wince at the feel of the bandages being removed, dried blood, along with new blood coming away with it causing her pain. Though, feeling the ointment, she'd lose it even more. Feeling the sting and burn she'd tear up a bit, not very good at taking pain, "Z-Ziare.  .t-that hurts!" saying such she'd watch him wrap her feet back up for her.

"I-I'm sorry you have to touch my feet. . .they had to be nasty after training all day. . ." saying such she'd look to her bruised tummy, "A-And you don't need to make my stomach feel better. . .or anything. . .unless you want to.."* - Sat Dec 12 03:55:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Sighing lightly, looking at the machine that he had put on her arm. Raising an eyebrow as she wasn't sure she wanted to mess with this sort of thing or not. Though looking at it, she'd hold her arm up and point it across the room, curious to how it all worked anyway. Attempting to do as she was told, she'd try to send her chakra out, though only to have it fall to the floor right in front of her, apparently she hadn't focused well enough.

Shaking her head and looking to it she'd mumble, "This sucks." stating such, she'd again move to get the wire and try again. Sending her chakra out again, it'd suddenly shoot out to about double the distance, but not much farther as she still wasn't completely motivated to do such. Shaking her head, she'd again retrieve it.

Once she had it, she'd shake her head and decide that she needed to actually pay attention and get his done so that she could train for the things that actually mattered to her. Thinking such, she'd shrug lightly, focusing her sight at the corner of the room. Squinting a bit, she'd let her chakra run to the device, and out of it, again shooting it but not quite making it there.

Aggravated by this point she'd look to Ziare, "Why do I need to learn this again?" but even as she asked such she'd again be preparing to go at it again. Sighing lightly as she closed her eyes, she'd focus more on her chakra, preparing to send it out. Doing such, she'd let it follow her chakra out once more, hitting the wall this time.

Wanting to make sure it wasn't a fluke, she'd again retreive the wire and go about the whole process once more, letting it shoot out and hit the wall. Once she was sure she was fine with it, she'd look to Ziare, "Happy now? Can I get back to my usual training. I want to condition my body for it."

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Alright. - Sat Dec 12 15:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Are you ready? - Sat Dec 12 15:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Let's go. - Sat Dec 12 15:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Having gotten onto the fronts and toes of her feet, she'd be ready to start whenever Ziare was, though not having expecting him to start to soon, she'd quickly let chakra flood to her eyes as they began. Desperately trying to make this style of fighting work for her, she'd attempt to react to the hand seals and incoming shadows, taking off at faster speeds than Ziare had likely seen her go before, quickly circling around him to avoid the shadows that had been coming towards her. Seeing as they weren't being but so serious though, as Ziare was speaking, she wouldn't try to attack just yet, "Why shouldn't I?"* - Sat Dec 12 15:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Catching sight of another shadow shooting off from Ziare, she'd grit her teeth, doing her best to stop her fast pace motion without coming off of her toes, she was doing her best to master this type of fighting style, and haivng Ziare continually stop, and make her avoid was helping, even if it was putting strain on her. "If you say so." stating such, she'd attempt to reverse direction, and head off back to the side, hopefully avoiding the shadows while she waited for Ziare to slow, and begin to tired from his attempts at trying to catch her. To her, this was now a game of stamina until she could get in close. <28>

If she had out ran the shadows for a long enough time, she'd then attempt to close the gap on her toes, using them to propel herself forward. Once she was hopefully close enough to hit Ziare, she'd again go to attack him, focusing on lighter hits as she was preparing to go faster, and hit more considering her usual fighting style didn't require strength. Trying to get in as many hits as she could, she'd hop a bit to the side, using the fact she was on her toes to move more easily around him before jumpping back and away from him, though it likely wouldn't cause any damage without her trying, if she even got close enough to do so. <29>* - Sat Dec 12 15:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Having apparently gotten in her attack, and gotten away with it, she'd come to a halt, balancing on her toes as she looked to Ziare, "I understand wanting to help me, but if you aren't serious, I'll be more mad than if I couldn't hit you." saying such as she had been around him long enough to know that he was letting her go about this. Though, moving into a different stand. combining it with the fact she was on her toes, and moving faster than ever she'd state, "Or perhaps I'll actually have to make you want to defend against me~" stating such, showing she was serious, she'd launch off with her toes to be infront of him, looking him down for a signal that he'd pick it up a bit, her feet already sore from trying to get used to the new speed, and style. <30>* - Sat Dec 12 16:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Seeing the sudden speed of the shadow, she'd be forced to dig her toes in and jump back and away from him. Looking up, having barely caught his hand seals, she'd be wide eyed even more so, "I forgot. . .sorry. You don't have to." though somewhere in her mind she wanted him to, she knew he was vastly stronger than herself, and she wanted to experiance that without being in any real danger of death. "We can continue like this. . .I-I'm sorry for asking Bab- Ziare-kun." almost calling him a cute-like name, she'd shake her head and again speed off on her toes, trying to round him and outrun his shadows if they were to come at her again. <31>* - Sat Dec 12 16:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I can go all out. - Sat Dec 12 16:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I...Just don't want to... - Sat Dec 12 16:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: But i'll do it if you want. - Sat Dec 12 16:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: It's fine. . .do what ever is comfortable. - Sat Dec 12 16:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I told you, you deserve to be greedy, now's the perfect time. - Sat Dec 12 16:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . . - Sat Dec 12 16:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Do you really wanna see m get serious? - Sat Dec 12 16:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: F-Fine. . .only this one time. . . - Sat Dec 12 16:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: I don't want to force you. - Sat Dec 12 16:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Seein the nod of his head, she'd be somewhat excited, knowing that she'd probably never get this chance again in her life. Seeing the hand seals, her eyes would catch sight of the new incredible speed at which the shadows were moving. Worried by this, she'd continue to use her toes to dig in and jump back away from them, "W-Wow." saying such as she hadn't expected the speed, she'd feel as if she tried to get close, she wouldn't have a snowballs chance in hell. Looking to him with a bit on confusion, she didn't know how to combat this. Thus, running to the side, and even farther away from him, making sure to stay on her toes as she did such she'd call out, "T-That's kinda crazy. . .Y-You never told me you were that good." <32>* - Sat Dec 12 16:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) staying on her toes, being chased by the shadows, she'd be forced to continue to run, the constant movement getting to her. Being that she caught sight of the kunai and fake tag, she'd be thrown off to why there would be chakra flowing to it. Though, not thinking about it too much, she'd continue to run, shifting the weight of her body to her right foot and toes to somewhat push off diagonally to avoid it instead of being forced to jump straight back. This was starting to be a strain for her and her feet, but she wasn't going to complain about the free training she was getting. <33>* - Sat Dec 12 16:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Catching sight of everything that was happening, she'd realize her mistake in thinking that the Kunai was nothing. Biting into her lip a bit, she'd look to the house she had been staying in, and the tree beside her. Then, looking to Ziare, she'd know that she didn't have much of a chance here. Digging her toes in again, she'd attempt to launch towards him, and jump, thinking that the shadows that seemed to restrain could only be used if she were to be on the ground. Moving her arm up, using the device Ziare had literally just gave her, she'd attempt to aim it at him and push her chakra out to launch the wire around him and to wrap him up. Though being she had just learned this, it was doubtful it'd get there fast, and also that it'd even him him. Doing this, she'd attempt to land back on her toes, still trying to get used to that as well, having not worked on what to do while jumpping yet.

To her it seemed likely she'd be trapped when she landed. <34>* - Sat Dec 12 16:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Seeing her wire suddenly being blocked, and the shadows suddenly coming up and restraining her, she'd sigh a small bit. "Well. . .there goes that." saying such as she was likely stuck there, she wanted to get more training in, but she was sure she had made Ziare do too much already in one day.* - Sat Dec 12 17:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: From here I would use the Fire Dragon Bullet technique. - Sat Dec 12 17:06:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: I would have been melted? - Sat Dec 12 17:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) She'd suddenly get -very- serious, "Ziare-kun. Let me go." saying such in a strict, serious way, likely the most so Ziare had ever heard, she'd wait to be let go of.* - Sat Dec 12 17:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking to him with a serious, almost deadly face she'd mutter, "I'm going to go train more. . .I'm worthless as I am." saying such, she'd attempt to turn and head off to the small patch of earth she had been training at before, if Ziare followed, she wouldn't stop him.* - Sat Dec 12 17:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Sighing lightly as she still had her byakugan activated, she'd glance back to Ziare, "Do you want to keep helping then I assume?"* - Sat Dec 12 17:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: If you want.. - Sat Dec 12 17:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I told you i'll be here for you. - Sat Dec 12 17:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Let's go then. - Sat Dec 12 17:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Your start. - Sat Dec 12 17:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Looking to him, taking note of the seals once again, she'd be on her toes as usual in this sanded area. Watching as the shadows chased out after her, she'd feel that they weren't as fast as before, which was understandable. Though, some part of her was disapointed in herself. Deciding not to toy around, she'd dig her toes her, letting the muscles in her feet and legs go the hardest they could. Untilizing every bit of speed she had to run around, and past the shadows, she'd likely close the gap between Ziare and herself if he was underestimating how badly she wanted to get better. Though, she'd also be prepared to dig her toes in and stop if need be.<35>

As usual if she managed to close the gap without getting caught, she'd go about hit and run tactics, trying to hit him as many times as she could, without much force, before digging and and hopping back and away from him only to be prepared to go back in if need be. Being that she was on her toes, it made it seem like jumping to and frow, and gaining a bit more speed was easy, only it cost her the stead-fastness she might have had if she went another direction with her training, thus, if Ziare caught her and went to go make a counter attack, it'd be likely she'd be knocked back, and down.<36>* - Sat Dec 12 17:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Seeing as she had hit him, she'd shake her head, she wanted someone serious, yet low enough where it would be even. Though she wouldn't complain openly being that Ziare was such a help to her. Sighing lightly, still on her toes, her feet aching, she'd see the two shadowing coming for her, deciding to try something different, she'd stay where she was for the moment, waiting for them to close in before attempting to dodge, and jump, and the such on her toes from side to side, and whatever directions she had to in order to avoid being trapped. Unsure if this would actually work, she'd struggle at it, hoping for just a moment that Ziare would go easy while she tried. <37>

If he had gone easy enough for her to avoid them all, she'd then move onto her usual tactics, staying on her toes and running, digging them into the ground and pushing off to attempt and outrun the shadows now, sweat rolling down her head. If she could continue to outrun them, she'd attempt to be a good distance away from Ziare where she'd be able to rest for a moment, her breathing being a bit heavy compaired to how it usually was, "Heh. . .Eventually, I'll be able to just run at you before you get the chance." saying such she'd wipe her head a bit before nodding at him that she planned to start back up once again. <38>

"Perhaps I can convince you to try hand to hand with me since I'm not aiming to hurt you? I need to avoid strike as well." asking such simply to distract herself from the burning in her legs and feet, she'd suddenly take off at Ziare again, trying to avoid whatever shadows he might have coming for her by shifting the weight onto whichever foot required it, pushing of with her toes and moving to side step, or go diagonally away from it while approaching. Once she was there, she'd again move to hit him with with fast strikes that lacked real power. Doing such, if she even made it that far, she'd huff a bit before jumping back once more, tired. <39>* - Sat Dec 12 17:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) Of course, seeing the shadows coming, she'd do the best she could to continue to made it through them, moving on her toes to the best of her ability to avoid them and get closer. Doing such as she find herself up next to Ziare finally, she'd be confused, thinking that she would have been hit by at least one of the shadows, she'd remember that he was holding back again for her sake. Shaking her head as she thought this, she'd suddenly see him start to throw a few punches. Excited that he listened to what she had asked, she'd do her best to continue to dodge the attacks, hopping side to side on her toes, and dodging, ducking and the such when needed. <40>

Gritting her teeth a bit as sweat continued to roll down her head, and her feet felt numb, she'd eventually come to a halt, and would again jump back and away, one of Ziare hands almost getting close enough to hit her. "Heh. . .seems I'm getting more of a workout than I though. . .I might be light enough for you to carry after this." saying such as a joke, she'd again try to use her speed to dig her toes in and once more close the distance, having caught her breath. Though, not only trying to close the gap, she'd try to get behind him again, hoping that she'd be fast enough to surprise him. <41>

Pretending to be serious with this now she'd say, "Got you!" upon saying such, trying to act excited and happy for him, she'd lightly hit him as many times as she could in the back, hoping to at least make him acknowledge she had gotten close. Though, as she danced around on the front of her feet, she'd suddenly get an evil idea, being that her feet were strained again, and she needed a break, she'd dig her toes in and hop back a bit before saying, "Now to get serious!" before propelling her self forward at max speed like she was really trying to hurt him. That is, until she again shoved the front of her feet in, stopping herself. Then, following this, she'd jump onto Ziare's back, "Got you! Now. . .carry me home~" forcing herself to act playful and happy, being that she knew Ziare enjoyed that side of her. <42>* - Sat Dec 12 17:55:34 2015
