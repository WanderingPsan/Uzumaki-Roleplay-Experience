<br><font color=yellow>*Suzaku(Jell0) Now this is the story, all about how my life got flipped, turned upside down.And I'd like to take a minute  just sit right there. I'll tell you how I became the Jounin of Sunagakure.
Outskirts of Suna born and raised. In the academy was where I spent most of my days. Chillin out maxin relaxing all cool. Beating up kids outside of the school. When an academy teacher decided to announce that a genin exam was coming up.Started making kids cry in the academy. I did one little jutsu and they were scared. aJust made me a genin right then and there.
I wooped and yelped day after day. Until I got my headband and got sent on my way. Soon came the chunin exams. I put on my headband and said' I might as well beat it.'
First test, yo this is bad. Asking me a bunch of questions. Is this what Chunin be living like? Hmm this might be bad.
BUt wait I hear there is more to this shit. Passsed the first and now I gotta do this again.
Pass t rest with flying colors. I see me friends when I get there. 
I hope they're prepared for the new Chunin of Suna.
Well the exam ended and when I came out, there was another one starting.
I aint tryna get no special jounin. I just got chunin. So I sprang with the quickness like lightning
disappeared.

I holla'd a year later and they had the jounin exams. Name said fresh and it had babes on the sign.
If anything I could say this exam was rare.But I thought'Nah, forget it.'-'Yo holmes to the Jounins.'
I pulled up to the exams about 7 or 8. And I yelled to the proctor'Yo holmes lets make this shit ' I kicked some ass and I was finally there.
To sit on my throne as the Jounin of Suna.*)

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suzaku(Jell0) walks out of the mansion and yawns. He seemed rather tired and wasn't thinking straight.

"I never realized how fucking hot Noriko was." he muttered.* - Tue Sep 01 20:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suzaku(Jell0) scratches the back of his head as he walk towards Tethys.

"Huh?I didn't say anything to you."* - Tue Sep 01 20:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suzaku(Jell0) noted that this is literalyl the third time he has gotten his head slammed into a freaking road. Though he had gotten quite used to this, it was gonna be a hell of an attack.Being the idiot he was, he attempted to get a word out before he got slammed into the ground.

"Ten out of ten." * - Tue Sep 01 20:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suzaku(Jell0) got his head slammed into the road again.ODds are he is done for. Considering teh fact that everything other then his genjutsu shit, was three. This was probably gonna make his skull mush. Either way, he was fucked up.* - Tue Sep 01 20:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) does a few quick stretches before glancing at the little medical training.

"What is going on?"* - Thu Sep 03 20:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) does a few more stretches before jogging off.* - Thu Sep 03 20:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) took a deep breath as he stared at the tree in front of him.He dropped down into his special stance while staring at the tree. With a smile, he sent a weak punch towards the tree. It seemed to shake rapidly before halting. Shortly afterwards, he would then seem to lift his leg towards the tree and hit it with a quick kick.

The male soon followed this action with another punch towards the trees base. Once again, the tree shook slightly. Afterwards, he would send a kick towards the side of the tree. While his foot was connected, he seemed to hop off of his one foot and launch it towards the tree. 

Shook with excitement as he motioned backwards.Shortly afterwards, he raced forward and performed a jump kick at the tree. With that, the tree seemed to shake rapidly. He released a heavy sigh upon landing.* - Thu Sep 03 21:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) begins to jog around the square for no particular reason. He was having a good time at the moment. What is the worse that can happen.* - Fri Sep 04 18:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) toook a deeo breath as he stared at the large tree. His body seemed to motion downwards as he then launched forward. His fist collided with the tree and soon enough latched onto the tree. Without a bit of hesitation, he would attempt to force the back of his foot into the tree.<br><br>

With a heavy sigh, he backed up and dropped down to the ground. His movements weren't as fluid as he thought they would be. Maybe he needed to stretch a little with some sort of pushup exercise.<Br><br>

Knowing this would be good for himself, he forced himself down and then up. Needing a slight bit of a way to push himself, he found a way to make it that he was doing one handed push ups. HIs body motioned down and then up rapidly. <br><br>

Needing a bit more of a challenge, the young male forced his body upwards. NOw his hair was hanging downwards, and his weight was completely on that hand. Without a moments hesitation, he forced himself down and then back up. For an added difficulty, he seemed to hop off the ground and land on his other one.<br><br>

Having done this a few times, he rose from the ground and did a few more stretches. Now he was loose and happy. To make sure of this, he launched a few practice punches into the air. This wasn't so hard. It also did seem like he was doing pretty well. HIs motions were alot more fluid then before. That meant, he could efffectively train himself. <br><br>

Kubo moved forward towards the tree and launched his left fist forward. It slammed into the tree and seemed to land a nice blow. Soon enough, the tree seemed to form a crater in the middle of the area he hit. He forced himself bac before moving forward again. He hopped into the air and launched his foot at the tree. This was a simple attack and seemed to hit it rather well. Was he getting stronger perhaps? It seemed he was.<br><br>

The young male took a deep breath as he seeemed to begin a light jog around the shoreline. By this time, he was sweating heavily. It seemed that the little bit of exercise had caused him to sweat alot more then he thought was possible.He needed to train his stamina quickly. If he didn't he was gonna be a failure when it came to taijutsu.* - Fri Sep 04 18:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) sighed lightly as he stopped his jog. This would be a good spot for some resitane training. It should be simple enough for him. All he had to do was dive into the water.Once in said water, he began to weakly launch a few punches. The stream of water, refusing to let his punches glide through them easily. This was a sad development for him, but he didn't need to worry. <br><Br>

With a firm nods he stared at a tree that seemed to be next to him. He smiled as he then seemed to launch a quick barrage of punches towards the tree. He imagined that it was baisically a person that was just standing there. The quick punches died down. That seemed to work well enough for him.* - Fri Sep 04 18:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) yawns before heading over towards Violet.

"Miss, you you mind sparring with me?"* - Fri Sep 04 21:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) does a few stretches before dropping down into his stance. His arm hung limply to his side as he stared at Violet.Slowly, he moved forward. Once near, he launched his fist towards the woman's chin.* - Fri Sep 04 23:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) had his attack blocked by the blade. Usually his hand would hurt, but he was more durable then the average person. As for the blade that was coming for his side, he ignored it. His right foot attempted to slip behind Violet's left. Should this work, he would try to give her a light shove as the blade connected with his  side. A joly of pain shooting up through him.

"Urgh."* - Sat Sep 05 00:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) assumed that he had enough time to gain his bearings. Meaning that as the attack came, he might have been able to hold his right arm up to block. This wouldn't do much as he was knocked backwards and soon fell. Struggling, he would soon get up.

"Urgh."* - Sat Sep 05 00:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) got up and dusted himself off.

"I suppose we could stop. Thank you for the short spar."* - Sat Sep 05 00:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) shouts out towards the Mizukage.

"Mizukage-sama wait." he states. Hopefully this would distract Tethys even for a little. Maybe let them leave.* - Sat Sep 05 21:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) sighs before going to take a seat.* - Sat Sep 05 23:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) was carrying a large rock towards Jin when he accidentaly tripped and launched said rock at Otome and Violet. He quickly got up and bowed.

"Sorry."* - Sun Sep 06 21:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) did not really rush to the male's aid. The medic was there.* - Sun Sep 06 23:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) scratched his head. He was broke so he couldn't really get any water. So he did what any normal person would do, he went to vending machine and kicked it. Soon 30 bottles of water fell out.* - Mon Sep 07 00:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) nods his head and stretches.* - Mon Sep 07 01:14:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) whispers: Yup... - Mon Sep 07 22:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) whispers: We're going to get those back....a lowlife named Akask ran off with them after killing my best friend.  - Mon Sep 07 22:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) whispers: Those need to be back in the hands of Kirigakure....not some random.. - Mon Sep 07 22:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: They look amazing... I wonder is he versed in them? - Mon Sep 07 22:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: This is a bad situation if he is. For Tethys-sama at least. He turns into water-like sludge when he's near death. We can restore him from that state with water. But water conducts electricity. Logically speaking, Tethys-sama is a human conductor of lightning. He'll easily get screwed over by it, if I'm right. - Mon Sep 07 22:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: He is right here... - Mon Sep 07 22:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) honestly felt that this was gonna turn bad for him really quick. He was just a simple genin and probably the weakest person in the area. All he could do was back away from everyone else. He can't do anything for the moment.* - Mon Sep 07 22:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) was feeling slightly left out, and he wanted to do somethng. So without hesitation, he began to force himself  forward. What would he do? Who fucking knew.* - Tue Sep 08 01:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) aimed to intercept the moving Zhen. He was probably about to get his ass wooped, but who cared. He was gonna beat that ass like there was no tommorow. As the male came, he slipped into a sort of stance, that seemed to focus alot on his legs.Either way, his leg moved upwards and attempted to kick the male in the check. Considering his movements forward, this might be a bit harder to dodge.

Then again... he was a black. SO He was probably about to get his shit rekt.* - Tue Sep 08 02:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) motions over to a more secluded area. One there he dropped down into a stance. Couldn't really be described, but it seemed to focus on his legs. How would this male fight?* - Tue Sep 08 19:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) wasn't just gonna stand there and let someone try grabbing him. As the male sank into the ground, his body motioned itself backwards.  The male was gonna have to either pop out of the ground, or keep trying to catch up to him. He refused to be caught so easily.

"Ugh, ninjiutsu." he muttered.  He had to be on his guard for the moment. Just waiting for the right time. Though for the moment, he just let his body keep moving away.* - Tue Sep 08 19:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) well the good news was that he could dodge this a bit easier then normal. Since the male had jumped into the air and released it, he took the time to motion his body downwards a bit. It seems he was getting closering to the landing Kerasen.

As the male attempted to unsheate his tanto, his foot was already in motion. An obvious application of his fighting style was employed, as he attempted to plant his foot into the male's cheek.* - Tue Sep 08 19:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) wasn't gonna let up on the male. His body forced itself forward at an average level of speed, but even this speed was enough to potentially end the spar. His Once near the male who should be getting up, he jumped into the air and held both feet down. He attempted to drop kick the fuck out of Kerasen's head and hopefully knock him out.* - Tue Sep 08 19:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) landed on the ground rather skillfully. He performed a sort of bow towards Kerasen. The male had been a decent opponenet, but he was expecting a bit more of a challenge. Still, everything was fine for him.* - Tue Sep 08 19:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) ambles over towards Tethys and smiled.

"Anyone else you want me to spar?"* - Tue Sep 08 20:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) points at Setsuna's shoes.

"WHAT ARE THOSE!!!"* - Tue Sep 08 20:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kubo(Jell0) waits for Tethys to move away so he can kick... WELL SHIT!. He oes up towards Setsuna who was not facing him and attempts to kick her in the face. Full force, full use of his taijutsu style. SHE ON CATCH THESE FEET!* - Tue Sep 08 20:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) says: Ahuh. - Fri Sep 11 17:13:10 2015
