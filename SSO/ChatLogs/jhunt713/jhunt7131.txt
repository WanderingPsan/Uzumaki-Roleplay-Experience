There was movement under his cloak... one of the rotating sand eyes would fly in the air and multiply to 3 times the size of the man. The scanned the area as he moved.

"..." the man's body was slowly dripping sand on the ground. He moved again, this was not what he was looking for...* - Mon Nov 16 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Jhunt713) //
Kronos floats 50 feet in the air, his face was not covered.

If anyone could see his face his face would have several cracks in it like he was attacked or it was permanent damage done to him. His clothing was old and dusty, some holes were in the garments; tears and such to signify the age of the attire.* - Mon Nov 16 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Jhunt713) //
His eyes were blackened all around but the red pupils and his slivery white hair was sandy* - Mon Nov 16 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Jhunt713) would slowly float to the gate."..." he would shake his head as his giant sand eye above him still rotated above him and his second sand eye would be absorbed into his body.

He floated over the gate, the guards look on as to question what to do. This man showed no signs of hostility nor did he show signs of friendliness. He finally threw open his cloak and his past injuries were present. 

The caved in chest, a hole in his right thigh, cracks in his face and skull. "..." his hands were raised as the sand from the ground slowly started to rise.* - Mon Nov 16 05:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Jhunt713) As the iron sand bird came flying in toward the man his sand eye saw all... where the bird was aiming a hole was opened allow the bird to fly through the man. The rising sand in the area all collided in at his body at once. The sands of the past flew into his body reconstructing him fully. He finally began to speak, "W-Where..." he said in a corse audible. He was much more aninated then before.

He looked up and frantically about like he was searching for something. "Where?" he said as he placed one hand on his head and the flows of sand dropped to the ground. He flew back in the village like he was a mad man. No attacks were made an he jetted to the plaza.* - Mon Nov 16 05:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Jhunt713) //
Looked at the man, he knew him from past sands but that was not his target. Sand would begin to rotate around him in a raging sand storm around his immediate area. attempting to blind the pursuer. ."... Not..." he said in a corse audible.

He flys past in with blazing speed to the previous area* - Mon Nov 16 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Jhunt713) "...Improvement.." was bearly heard in a corse audible. His sand storm diversion was averted as his sand was subdued by the iron sand. He made no actions against his pursuer. He would suddendly morph his -entire- body into sand and the sand platform, would shoot forward and catch his reforming sand made body.

"Where..." he said racing off to the next location. He snapped his fingers and three figures would appear from his prevous location. each of them would rush the pursuer on a group where he would blaze forward. "Not enough time..." was heard in a corse audible.* - Mon Nov 16 05:56:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Jhunt713) "...Persistent..." was uttered in a corse audible. Wind would be thrown at him and the sand clones. The properties of the sand clones were mallable as the flew back from the attack. The sand clones would begin to rotate around the sand man. He didnt want attack nor did he want to engage but he might be left no choice. 

Turning to face the pursuer he would motion his hands forward, two torrents of sand that were previously the clones would shoot forward. They were two torrents of sand sprialing together to form a drill of sorts to bash and separate the incoming torrent of sand. As the drill collided witht he iron sand; a hand seal was made. 

Multiple explosions were heard from the sand that was moving and it aimed to scatter and dismantle the coffin even more.* - Mon Nov 16 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Jhunt713) "...Growing..." he said as his eye captured the little fireball. He had a stotic look on his face. Sand of the past remembered her as she would instantly appear in front of him in fiery glory. His head turned to face the purser, surely this method was though out before attacking right?

Regular sand nulled fire... it was a fact of life. As soon as her blade of flames impacted it was put out! But that didnt stop the blade from severing him in half. But did it stop him? 

Black sand rained from his position but the sand from the remaining clone formed a umbrella of sorts. Hoping the sand would slide off; however it was probly not the case. 

Odds are he wasnts going to find want he was looking for as he was being stopped by past sands. He proposed the a new plan... one on the darker side of things... As she was within close range of him something odd would occur.

His body seemingly made of sand of sand would reattach itself and capture the little girl. "...Resemblence..." he said in a corse audible. Sand stared to flow around her arms and legs constricting her and evetually a sand coffin would be her new place on the platform. Her head was free of sand as he looked at the pursuer. His head was grapped by both of his hands and he looked down at the platform... "...died..."* - Mon Nov 16 06:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Jhunt713) "...good but fuile..." he said in a corse audible. As he was startting to be wrapped by the cloth...

"...times up..."  another corse audible was heard as the body of sand would drop down to the earth. Tetsumi would not get the answers he was looking for. But he would do one thing before dissolving back to the ground. "...continue good..." he said clearly for the first time he was there. His body gave out on him and he fell back to the sand. His soul would return to the sands of Sunagakure.* - Mon Nov 16 07:07:31 2015
