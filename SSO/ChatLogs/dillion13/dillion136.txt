<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: I need to test you. - Thu Nov 19 21:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) stared directly toward Liu, the new Mizukage. Kyubishu had been quite rusy because he wasn't keeping up with his actual training routine but that didn't mean he was absolutely useless in a fight and after acquring some new abilitites if he mixed and matched them together the right way it could've meant that he was able to become quite deadly even for someone of his rank, as a Rookie Genin. His left hand would've simply slipped down into his holster as it tapped against the latch in order to open it.

He released it and took out two shuriken, their was something different about them that couldn't be noticed unless they were either really close or his opponent had high observation skills. Kyubishu had tossed them directly toward Liu's direction, as they swirled and swivled through the air. 

At the same time he started to unleash some handseals.* - Thu Nov 19 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) obviously knew that he couldn't take up a mid to long-range strategy after his shuriken were knocked away and he was sent backward, Kyubishu had regained his compusure and stood up. A glance was taken toward Liu's Gunbai and he took a sprint directly toward his opponent, unleashing the handseals that were previously interrupted and shot out some thin wires toward his enemey, they were actually pretty durbale.* - Thu Nov 19 21:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) hopefully could've countered this with a technique that had eventually came up within his mind as he saw these Iron chains as they came up from the ground. His muscles had buldged and he tensed up in order to release the chakra that was needed for his Dance Of The Willow, bones had protruded from his two palms, shoulders and knees, hopefully restricting the chains so that they wouldn't pin him down.* - Thu Nov 19 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) was quite durable, so it wouldn't hurt that much. After being kicked in the face, manipulating his bones to try and manuever them as a defensive mechanism toward Liu's kick.* - Thu Nov 19 22:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) simply retrieved his bones back within his body.* - Thu Nov 19 22:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Huh? - Fri Nov 20 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Mmmm.... - Fri Nov 20 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Hey. - Fri Nov 20 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Hey you! - Fri Nov 20 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) thinks: Maybe he's dozing off. - Fri Nov 20 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: .... - Fri Nov 20 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So.... - Fri Nov 20 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Huh? - Fri Nov 20 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Are you available for a spar?~ - Fri Nov 20 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: You can spar Kida. - Fri Nov 20 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: He's really bored. - Fri Nov 20 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: And he needs to work on his Taijutsu. - Fri Nov 20 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: He's a new ninja here. - Fri Nov 20 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: ... - Fri Nov 20 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Sure. - Fri Nov 20 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) stared directly toward Kida. "Sup'."* - Fri Nov 20 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Let's do this, you can start off.  - Fri Nov 20 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) thinks: Some more Rookie Genin like myself? - Fri Nov 20 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Let's do this by the waterfall.  I don't want to hinder anyone around here. - Fri Nov 20 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Alright, lead the way. - Fri Nov 20 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Ok. - Fri Nov 20 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) stared toward Kida. He would've bowed in a respectful manner before the sparring session had actually begun and then Kyubishu's left hand would've trickled down and flipped open the flap toward his holster. He eagerly reached inside and received two shuriken and threw them directly toward his opponent, anyone could've told that they were regular shuriken from the look of it unless they had a high skill for observation, they rippled and swivled through the air as their target was essientally Kida.

Kyubishu took a burst foward at about average speed and perfomed a few handseals, shooting out a Wire in order to attempt to bind his opponent before they could move and end this battle quickly.* - Fri Nov 20 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Interesting. - Fri Nov 20 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had effectively taken a strike toward his ribcage, it didn't have enough effect to stun him or anything. So after the strike had collided with him a sound was made that almost sounded like a 'thump', Kida might've actually hurt his foot at this point but that didn't mean Kyubishu wasn't hurt either. His bones were natrually harder than any other Genin with Kirigakure and after the attack was headed toward his ribs and it actually landed, he reached toward the boy's leg at exactly the same speed. Attempting to grasp onto it with his left hand and lock it within that postion and move foward in order to try and grasp onto Kida's throat so that he couldn't move.

Kyubishu had a large pain tolerance and it meant that it didn't really bother him.* - Fri Nov 20 02:05:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: What to do... - Fri Nov 20 02:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: We could...just say we've done them... - Fri Nov 20 02:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) needed a new defensive mechanism in order to save himself from that attack. Kida's legs had simply been on their way toward him and that might've been a bad choice for his opponent to do. Because right before they were on their course it would've been stopped choice because alot of bones had shot out from his body, his knees which would've most likely stopped the kick before it actually reached his arms and most likely impaled them through if he didn't somehow dodge it, or. His palms, which would've been raised in defensive and his shoulders, two on each.* - Fri Nov 20 02:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: ....Okay. - Fri Nov 20 02:20:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Sure, that'd be good. - Fri Nov 20 18:53:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Anyone of you want to spar? I've gotta get some training done. - Sat Nov 21 00:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: A spar? - Sat Nov 21 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Hm. - Sat Nov 21 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I accept. - Sat Nov 21 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Good. - Sat Nov 21 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Let's do this down there. - Sat Nov 21 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: You can start off. - Sat Nov 21 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had simply avoided Ichiro's spiked rod that came directly toward him. It was obvious that it was the start-off for a good spar but that didn't mean he should have done such an obvious technique at the start of a battle, he obviously knew that Kyubishu could've simply dodged it without any type of effort or hesitation. After his opponent had begun to dash toward him, he took off in his own dash in order to weave a few handseals to iniate a jutsu. But what jutsu? That'd be for his opponent to tell.

He was faster than your average Genin, obviously.* - Sat Nov 21 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) didn't have a choice but to activate his technique, or else it would've been an absolute waste for the strike that came toward him. And besides if he activated it now it would've meant that he didn't need to waste anymore effort or stamina upon the attack that was coming toward him, a simple strike had came directly toward him and he couldn't afford to take it. But his opponent was quite fast with their abilities and striking speed, so a simple strike had came toward his gut and Kyubishu had taken it.

Or atleast Ichiro would've thought. His opponent's hand might've felt quite bruised up with their striking power so high and a direct punch landed, against a log that would've been. Kyubishu was actually behind his opponent after performing The Kawarimi Technique which had teleported him behind him as he attempted to come forth with a kick upward at Ichiro's back in order to throw him up into the sky.

Leaping after him in order to deliver a few series of lowkicks.* - Sat Nov 21 01:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) carefully had witnessed how Ichiro didn't show any actual signs of being legitly hurt after his Taijutsu technique had been succesfully landed, it was obvious that he might've had to hit his opponent harder for them to actually be damaged by his attack. A single adjustment was made toward his fighting style after Ichiro had once again turned around and headed toward him in an attempt to strike at his face, this tactic of fighting against someone was awfully new toward him also.

He didn't natrually fight like this, it was something that he just now tried. And so something else had occured to him once his attack had been landed, thus staring toward the unharmed Ichiro. Kyubishu had quickly evaded his opponent and attempted to leap backward in order to make some distance from his opponent, sliding across the grass and stopping himself atleast two feet from his enemy.

A index finger was moved toward the flap of his holster, opening it up before dipping his hand and thrusting it inside in order to take out some ninja tools. A handful of shuriken were taken out, atleast five on each hand, inbetween each finger. Kyubishu had thrown them directly toward Ichiro, as they cut through the air with little to no effort.

Whilst this distraction was going on, a few handseals were weaved together and he shot out some thin, but durable wire binding in order to try and hold down Ichiro.* - Sat Nov 21 01:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) smirked after Ichiro had stood there. After he figured out that his previous attack hadn't actually done shit, it was obvious that a defensive tactic had been taken before his attack was made. And then it all added up once Kyubishu's kick had simply kicked Ichiro foward instead of launching him upward and making him ascend further into the sky, so a small little thin wire had been wrapped around his finger, automatically connected to absolutely all of his shuriken once they were taken out of the holster.

The shuriken had zoomed foward as Ichiro had stood idle, Kyubishu had allowed them to head directly toward his opponent. A simple tug had been taken toward them as they instantly flew off course and headed in a different direction, soaring from behind his opponent.

A offensive tactic was about to be taken, his wire bindings still came directly at his adversay as he attempted to make sure that he couldn't move and so Kyubishu could've effectively taken the advantage of the battle. He needed to examine Ichiro first before he could actually begin his offensive fight with this foe.

Small amounts of frustration had been building up within him, gritting his teeth at the fact that he was so weak compared to everyone else. But that would've eventually changed.* - Sat Nov 21 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had grinned after Ichiro had jumped into the air to avoid his Wire Bindings, Kyubishu could've obviously caught his opponent whilst they were in the air. After he had witnessed his adversay leaping into the sky a small little adjustment were made toward these shuriken and they had instantly came flying back around, he had hoped to catch his opponent off-guard and manage to strike him directly in the back for a lethal enough attack to end the battle, before he could've revealed his bones. 

Too many people had witnessed it already and he didn't want people to realize his only special abilities were using The Dance Of Willow. A small little sigh had came from Kyubishu's mouth out of distress for his techniques, he needed to learn more techniques and actually have them at a decent mastery so they wouldn't fuck him when they're used.

After the shuriken had came directly toward Ichiro back, Kyubishu had made a dash for him. Before he even landed upon the ground.* - Sat Nov 21 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had perfectly planned this. After Ichiro had simply entered his Unorthodox Boxing Stance, Kyubishu decided to use a new tactic of his own which would've meant his full base of offensive techniques which would hopefully over-power his opponent to the point of ending this battle. He wasn't a little bitch and he absolutely loved hand-to-hand combat and shedding blood when it came to fighting, this fight could've gotten out of hand.

A sudden flow of chakra was built up inside of him, before his bones had instantly came out of his shoulders. Two bones coming out from his palms, and both of his knees. Kyubishu had adjusted himself so that his palm could've been raised as the attack had came directly toward his chin.

Kyubishu attacked faster than his opponent to a degree, and had the reflexs to react accordingly. Hopefully he had attempted to drive the bone directly through Ichiro's knuckles and end the fight right there, a small little grin had appeared across his face.

Licking his lips.* - Sat Nov 21 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: Isn't that the kid who ran before? - Sat Nov 21 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had obviously gotten carried away, Kyubishu didn't care if his bone had been broken. That was quite obvious at this point and he needed to take a few hits in order to dish some out on Ichiro and the strike that was coming toward his gut was currently unable to be dodged from this range and in this situation. A small 'grunting' sound was made after the collsion of the punch had been made toward him.

His body simply flopped over as he attempted to use his shoulder's bones in order to ram them directly into Ichiro's chest and thrust his hand that wasn't being used against Ichiro to grab his throat.* - Sat Nov 21 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: I don't like him. - Sat Nov 21 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had simply snapped back into reality after the next Right Cross had landed, Kyubishu had leaped backward and attempted to stop the fight. "Alright, enough. That was a good match."* - Sat Nov 21 02:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) was basically ganged up on.* - Sat Nov 21 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) but wait, bones.* - Sat Nov 21 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) at both of them.* - Sat Nov 21 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) couldn't really react if he was getting double-teamed.* - Sat Nov 21 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: L-Little brat pisses you off? You're such a pussy that you couldn't do it all by yourself. - Sat Nov 21 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Once I recover, you better watch your back Kida. - Sat Nov 21 04:28:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It will be very eventful. - Sat Nov 21 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Oh, I can take you on by myself.  To be frank, you wouldn't be in this situation if you didn't run away in the first place. - Sat Nov 21 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: You're acting like I 'ran' away from a real fight. I was also called away, asshole. - Sat Nov 21 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Say Ichiro, you think Shiro might need some new props? - Sat Nov 21 04:35:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) didn't really phase him, pain wasn't something that literally bother him.* - Sat Nov 21 04:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: You join us, and we'll let by-gones be by-gones? - Sat Nov 21 04:36:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Hm. - Sat Nov 21 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Keep our little lady Shiro company. She's the apple of our eyes. In fact, she's pretty timid and sick.  You seem like the right person to cheer her up. - Sat Nov 21 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Right Ichiro? - Sat Nov 21 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: This was all a test to see if you're good enough. You barely passed, but you passed. - Sat Nov 21 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I hope... - Sat Nov 21 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: You can deal with this feeling every day. - Sat Nov 21 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: It'll also serve to be great training for you.  After a day with her, Ichiro here became a tank.  She has some magical powers I tell you.  - Sat Nov 21 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: If she's sick. How is she busy causing people pain? - Sat Nov 21 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: It's because she's sick.  It hurts our hearts to see her in such a state.  I cry every night seeing her. - Sat Nov 21 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: She's really a sweet girl. - Sat Nov 21 04:40:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) suddenly looked toward his leg. "Not bad guys, seriously? Fine. We've got a deal." Kyubishu was actually angry at first, but it subsided. He extended his own hand and shook it with Kida's.* - Sat Nov 21 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Interesting. - Sat Nov 21 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had taken the strike toward the eye. Kida obviously couldn't be trusted after that, Kyubishu was now pissed. They were going to get their's.* - Sat Nov 21 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Incredible. - Sat Nov 21 04:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I'd have thought...You percieved the malice... - Sat Nov 21 04:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) simply activated The Dance Of The Willow, assuming that Kida was above Kyubishu that didn't mean he was absolutely defenseless. And there might've been absolutely -no- way that his opponent could've seen this coming unless their ability to sense chakra was quite high. Kyubishu's bones would've came through and impaled Kida for an extreme amount of lethal damage, fuck this bastard.* - Sat Nov 21 04:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had a blank expression, he just layed there, breathing out of exhaustion.* - Sat Nov 21 05:12:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had effectively performed The Suimen Technique in order to follow through with Kana's instructions. If the gate was opened then they would've simply rode through the village gates, Kyubishu didn't understand the mission at all and why she simply wanted for them to look for one person but he needed to go through with everything he was told, simply because of the fact that Kana was their new Mizukage and he was loyal enough to the village that he would've followed her orders without question. He kept a close eye out and kept an open eye out for the group.* - Sun Nov 29 20:30:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had followed behind Anguo's lead. Kyubishu tried to keep himself concealed amoung the shadows of Konohagakure after he utilized the Suimen Technique in order to leap onto of the wall. After this act had been done he would've simply headed off and hid within a tree in order to be the back-up for the moment, he wasn't that strong at the moment when it came to fighting against people in the offensive tactic so in order to use his head like a true Shinobi actually would've, Kyubishu had hid within the tree.

A handful of shuriken had been spreaded between his fingers, five on each finger for each hand, which would've meant a total of ten shuriken. And they were all not normal indeed, he needed to make sure that he was useful enough in order to make a difference. And after he witnessed how Baylea had taken a fucking Suiton Dragon toward her legs and wasn't bleeding, it sort've terrified him.

How could somebody be alive after that? And be fucking fighting naked. It gave him abit of chills.* - Sun Nov 29 21:05:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) stared directly toward Baylea as she laughed. Kyubishu once again decided to follow in Anguo's lead after he tried to attack her and simply end her life but he needed to do it himself, Kyubishu had leaped from the tree and threw his shuriken toward the woman in order to bind her up and even cut her in the process, hopefully one of those shuriken would've entered her brain and ended her life, swiftly and painlessly.* - Sun Nov 29 21:26:24 2015
