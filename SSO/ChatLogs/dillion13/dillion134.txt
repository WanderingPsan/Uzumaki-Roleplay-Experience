<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) stared directly toward Toudou, he knew absolutely nothing about people from Sunagakure so he made sure to be cautious of everything around him. His environment was the key to fighting against people he didn't know, taking a deep breath in order to take in the oxygen from the atmosphere and get a small feel for fighting a new opponent. It was obvious that his opponent might've been stronger than him because he was simply a Rookie Genin but he was quite strong for somebody of his type, stepping foward before the fight had offically started.

A small little smirk had appeared across his face, he was going to enjoy fighting against somebody new for once. He had forgot about the thrill of battle previously before, but suddenly his hands would've been raised and manuevered in different ways. They were going at about average speed so that it gave his opponent time to react.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) seemingly gazed toward the Fireball that headed for his general direction, it would've been easy enough to avoid from this distance. He finally executed his handseals in order to process the jutsu fully and unleash his strands of wire through the flames, after they disconnected from him he would've simply manuevered himself out of the way from the technique that was shot at him from Toudou, stepping foward and advancing foward at about average speed, maybe slightly above.

He reached into his backpouch in order to recieve some shuriken, a stack of them which were evenly divided between his left and right hands.* - Sun Nov 15 04:32:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) simply ignored people and continued to move foward in toward the battle, he needed to have better mastery over that technique if he hoped to even do anything. Kyubishu had continued to advance into the battle and with each step that was being made a loud sound could've been heard, at this point he was basically right infront of his opponent. A sudden strike was going for Toudou's face with a smirk that had been displayed across his face, his expression was obvious that he was going to enjoy the fight.

A knee was raised in order to try and strike him in the stomach, Kyubishu still had a free hand. He attempted to zoom foward even closer with his quick strikes, they were hard to see unless his opponent was quite adept with their sight or able to dodge because of intense reflexs, attempting to grasp onto Toudou's throat and squeeze to allow a free shot.* - Sun Nov 15 04:41:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Alright, we shall head down, a little. - Sun Nov 15 16:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: So we don't hurt anyone. - Sun Nov 15 16:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Over here is cool. - Sun Nov 15 16:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: R-Right here? - Sun Nov 15 16:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Yeah, start off. - Sun Nov 15 16:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: O-Oh uhm..a-alright.. - Sun Nov 15 16:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) simply took out a kunai from his holster, he would've easily deflected the two shuriken that came for him. A spark had errupted from the metal after they clashed and then, Kyubishu had threw his own weapon toward Momura's direction and went into his backpouch in order to retrieve atleast five-shuriken upon each of his left and right hands, preparing himself for something right before he did it. But after he finally managed to use his translucent string, which was highly elastic for mobility and highly durable, he would've attached it to both of these shuriken.

A smirk had appeared across his face before he threw them at Momura, ten shuriken had came for her, they all weren't normal at all. So if she wasn't catious about her next move it could've been the end of this spar directly from the start, Kyubishu didn't have any fancy techniques at the moment but that didn't mean anything at this point. * - Sun Nov 15 16:43:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: What's up. . .? - Sun Nov 15 16:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) wasn't an novice when it came to fighting against an opponent who was quite skilled and flashy with their techniques, all of this would've been absolutely useless because directly after everything had came back for him it was obviously time that he activated his superior defesive, and even offensive mechanism that was apart of him. Kyubishu might've been the only person who was left of his kind and that was extremely sad considering that he had seen one of his relatives die right infront of him.

But at some point he was sort've cold-hearted so it really didn't affect him. A smirk had appeared across his face, Momura had came zooming toward him and he attempted to try and give her a warning to back off before she simply got herself hurt, but he wasn't going to stop doing his technique because she was naive enough to come in-close quater with him.

Several bones had came out of his body, two from his palms, his kness, and shoulders, they even deflected the shuriken that came toward him at some point, being completely devoided because of his hard bone-structure. So if she continued to Dynamic Entry him, her foot would've been hurt quite bad.* - Sun Nov 15 16:54:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Sure, sure! -- But I should stick around first to see if these two don't get overzealous. - Sun Nov 15 17:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Bone-related techniques can be dangerous. - Sun Nov 15 17:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) would've awaited until Momura had grasped onto his bones, Kyubishu had simply attempted to zoom foward with intense speed. It wasn't the fact that he moved generally fast but it seemed like he was a fast fighter when it came to attack people and it might've meant that he could've attacked Momura before she had actually completed her action, Kyubishu's hand had thrusted outward as he attempted to try and grasp onto her throat. If he was successful in this technique then it would've allowed him a free strike against Momura. * - Sun Nov 15 17:04:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) stared directly toward Momura after she had launched off his face, Kyubishu would've rubbed his face in a small annoyed moment. He simply allowed his bones to go back into his skin and he'd take a small inhale, "Enough. I don't like where this is going."* - Sun Nov 15 17:14:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Indeed. - Sun Nov 15 17:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) waved toward everyone. "We'll be back people." He would've headed off with Hanae.* - Sun Nov 15 17:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: Ello. - Sun Nov 15 17:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Um. - Sun Nov 15 17:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Their isn't much to tell, I was born in Kirigakure, found out about my two relatives. - Sun Nov 15 17:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Both of them are dead. - Sun Nov 15 17:43:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Let's get started. - Sun Nov 15 17:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Discipline is the frist one. - Sun Nov 15 17:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: I have plenty of Discipline. - Sun Nov 15 17:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: You do? - Sun Nov 15 17:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: That good. - Sun Nov 15 17:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: *chuckles* - Sun Nov 15 17:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Go ahead and take a stance.. We are to giing to have a little spar. - Sun Nov 15 17:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: I gotta get a feelf or how you fight and how you want to fight. Before I ome up with a lesson plan. - Sun Nov 15 17:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: *snaps fingers* Make is snapping I don't have all day. - Sun Nov 15 17:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) stared directly toward Hanae, he would've zipped himself onto the opposite end of the arena. Kyubishu almost fought against someone previously, but they had fallen asleep right before the battle had actually commenced. That didn't bother him at all because a first exprience might've been his best one if he had done it at the right moment and with the right person, after sliding his shoes against the sand a small inhale of oxygen would've breezed through his noise and mouth.

Getting a good feel for the environment, he would've just stood there without a stance. His left arm was tickling his holster's latch in order to open it for the start of the sparring battle, whilst his right hand was idle against his leg.* - Sun Nov 15 17:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Hmmm. - Sun Nov 15 17:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had taken out a shuriken, it was a plain old shuriken. In apperance, he threw it directly toward Hanae and watched as it whizzled through the air. Kyubishu's finger was still by the holster.* - Sun Nov 15 17:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: Oh. They are fighting. Guess he's dying. - Sun Nov 15 18:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) thinks: Why would I be dying? - Sun Nov 15 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) smirked. It was bait, either way she had fallen for it and after she closed the distance between him and her a small little decision was made between him, which was a mental thing. If she was perceptive enough to find the translucent string that was on the shuriken it was obvious that she was able to know if he was going to use his technique or not, but after she had attempted to scratch the metal upon his headband it was the right opportunity for him to make his move and make sure that she didn't damage it. Kyubishu might've not been proud to be a Kirigakure Shinobi at the moment but that didn't mean it wasn't his home-village.

A bone had suddenly appeared through his left and right palms, he decided to control it and manipulate his bones to the point of where they would've only been used half-way so that he didn't drain his stamina. Kyubishu's arm would've attempted to deflect Hanae's arm so that the attack had been null-voided and he moved foward in order to try and allow himself a free shot.

His knee would've been raised as he attempted to strike her in the stomach.* - Sun Nov 15 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) whispers: ((mat.jri2 is my skype if u want to add me.) - Sun Nov 15 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) whispers: ((u dillion brown? - Sun Nov 15 18:12:41 2015
