<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) stared directly toward Ryo, he walked off toward the side. Kyubishu had rushed foward at above average speed in order to head directly toward his opponent's direction, a small little knuckle had been formed in order to signal that he was about to strike at The Shinobi. He zig-zagged in order to get closer toward his opponent, advancing at a decent enough speed to make there within absolutely no time.* - Sun Nov 29 23:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) knew he couldn't dodge. Kyubishu was obviously going to take this strike in the face due to the fact that his opponent was quite fast with their striking speed to the point of where he couldn't even dodge, so he reeled his own arm back and threw it foward in order to attempt to have it collide with Ryo's face, whilst he was going to go straight in to the attack, but hopefully the outcome would've been that his opponent had received damage also.* - Sun Nov 29 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) was successfully thrown back after Ryo had taken his punch. He was indeed disorientated, but not so much knocked off his balance.* - Sun Nov 29 23:57:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) raised his knee directly up toward Ryo's arm in order to literally have something go through the wrist-part of his arm. Kyubishu had utilized his clan's technique, The Dance Of The Willow. Two bones had popped out from his knees, palms, and shoulders.* - Mon Nov 30 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) thrusted his right hand foward in order to try and have Ryo's haymaker directly connected with his bone and hopefully have Kyubishu impale his knuckle in order to stop him from dealing so much damage and leaving him with simply one hand.* - Mon Nov 30 00:17:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: He didn't say his name, I don't care either. - Tue Dec  1 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: He's just annoying. - Tue Dec  1 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: He's over there. - Tue Dec  1 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Who are they talking about? - Tue Dec  1 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: !!! - Tue Dec  1 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Me? I'm annoying? - Tue Dec  1 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Deal with him, he's in your squad. - Tue Dec  1 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Fine, I'll fine him when my hands are better. - Tue Dec  1 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Don't blame me if I hurt him bad. - Tue Dec  1 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Kana, if I would? - Tue Dec  1 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'd like to talk about these squads. - Tue Dec  1 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Just tell him not to stare at me and then question me as I train. - Tue Dec  1 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: It's weird. - Tue Dec  1 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Go ahead Heiwa. - Tue Dec  1 00:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Say what you wish. - Tue Dec  1 00:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Thank you. My squad is overlooking 'Sekitsui, Nori, and Geo Dude' right? - Tue Dec  1 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Why are children my age overseeing squads? Illogical. - Tue Dec  1 01:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I don't know the profession of Miss Sekitsui, but I do know Geo Dude's. A taijutsu - and from the look of his stature a taijutsu specialist focused on hard hitting. - Tue Dec  1 01:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Taijutsu.~ - Tue Dec  1 01:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Blunt impact damage - a different style than my own. Which, in itself, is also weak. - Tue Dec  1 01:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: He called taijutsu weak! - Tue Dec  1 01:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: .....Damn it. - Tue Dec  1 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Thank you - what type of taijutsu fighter are you, Miss Sekitsui? - Tue Dec  1 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: I'm a grappler.~ - Tue Dec  1 01:04:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Ah.. - Tue Dec  1 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: More usage than I was thinking. - Tue Dec  1 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Heiwa. - Tue Dec  1 01:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yes? - Tue Dec  1 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Squads are suppose to have different skills, which would help in completing missions. - Tue Dec  1 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I realize, but they're also meant to synergize. - Tue Dec  1 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: I see no missions being given out... - Tue Dec  1 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And not be too cumbersome. - Tue Dec  1 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's also intended to be a learning experience. I'm already overseeing some of the training of Nori and Yumiko. They will likely be coming to me for aid more than to their squad leader. - Tue Dec  1 01:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And I presume Geo Dude will be going to members of Anguo's squad more for aid than to me. - Tue Dec  1 01:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: I've been a Genin for awhile. - Tue Dec  1 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: And I have never gotten a squad. - Tue Dec  1 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: We'll see how it goes for the first month and then if any changes should be applied, I'll do so. - Tue Dec  1 01:08:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: I'm sorry, did you say something Ryo? - Tue Dec  1 01:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Oh I thought he was trying to kick me out, but it was the Geo guy. - Tue Dec  1 01:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ... - Tue Dec  1 01:10:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: I suggest you set off to get to know them better. - Tue Dec  1 01:12:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I don't see why we can't just fight alone. - Tue Dec  1 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It'll take at least a month for any sort of 'grouping' to happen.  - Tue Dec  1 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Squads reduce your own efficiency. - Tue Dec  1 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: In which case the switch may already come interrupting that. - Tue Dec  1 01:14:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: I see, so she gets to choose what squad she's in but I cannot. - Tue Dec  1 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Lady Mizukage. - Tue Dec  1 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Well we've been in a squad and done missions together for a quite a while. It's been effective. - Tue Dec  1 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: If he -points to Ryo- seems to have a problem with me in your squad, then perhaps you could kove me to yours? - Tue Dec  1 01:24:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Nah, how come? - Tue Dec  1 01:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'm thinking of bringing my squad together for some training. - Tue Dec  1 01:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You'd be a help in this training. - Tue Dec  1 01:41:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I guess I can help. - Tue Dec  1 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: --Right. Nori, Yumiko, our radios are on the same frequency. - Tue Dec  1 01:48:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Sekitsui, I'll have a radio for you in a little bit. - Tue Dec  1 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Oh, okay. - Tue Dec  1 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: In the mean time, Tengoku, lets go get ready. - Tue Dec  1 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Are we going to go train? - Tue Dec  1 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Alrighty. - Tue Dec  1 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. We are if you three are ready. - Tue Dec  1 01:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Sure. - Tue Dec  1 21:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had wrote this with a Kunai, upon the concrete.* - Tue Dec  1 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: You can begin. - Tue Dec  1 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) stared directly toward Geo-Dude. Did he seriously think that using a Taijutsu technique from so far away would've helped his situation? That might've been the worse idea for anything like that to actually happen, Kyubishu had a smirk across his face after he opponent had recklessly threw themselves foward, he side-stepped and turned toward the way that he was going, timing it correctly. His right had was grasped as he attempted to ankle-lock him and stop him from going any further.

Suddenly a punch would've been thrown toward his face as he was most likely immoblizied.* - Tue Dec  1 21:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had released Geo, that tactic was quite good. His opponent obviously knew exactly what they were doing and after he managed to flip away, his right hand slipped down into his holster and simply retreived a handful of shuriken that consisted of ten. He threw them directly toward Geo and awaited for the shinobi's reaction before he did anything more, keeping his distance for now.* - Tue Dec  1 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) gazed directly toward Geo-Dude, he moved quite fast. "A spar is meant to make a shinobi much better, it shouldn't be too lethal." After his opponent had managed to dodge the shuriken it was all a ruse that was apart of Kyubishu's plan. He ducked down after the kick had came toward his head, moving foward in order to activate his 'Dance Of The Willow' Technique. Also manipulating a certain technique in order to have them weave back and secrectly strike his opponent in the backside.* - Tue Dec  1 21:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) raised his left and right arm in order to have his bone-palms that were hopefully defending up against Geo's attack toward his midsection and just incase in order to protect himself for the attack, he raised his knees in order to try and add even more protection toward the attack that came toward him. He was actually quite protected at this point unless his opponent was strong enough to break his bones, which everyone else was pretty much able to do. This didn't seem to be a big-deal.* - Tue Dec  1 22:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) would've simply dropped back down onto the ground, Kyubishu gritted his teeth after being defeated and having his opponent simply end the match from there. He was sick and tired of being weak and picked on, this pissed him the fuck off than he already was from having his tongue taken out and his eye poked into the back of his skull and then ripped out from the socket, Kyubishu was absolutely garbage compared to majority of the shinobi in Kirigakure. He disappointed himself, along with Baen his previous father. Who had supposedly died but he was never quite sure of that.* - Tue Dec  1 22:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: ...W-What?! - Tue Dec  1 22:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: You have the nerve to come back here, Ichiro?! - Tue Dec  1 22:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Get it all sorted? - Tue Dec  1 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah...it's all fine. - Tue Dec  1 22:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Makkuro. - Tue Dec  1 22:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Charcoal. - Tue Dec  1 22:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: He's a nice dog, you'd trained him well. - Tue Dec  1 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Thanks. - Tue Dec  1 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: He's a puppy still so he misbehaves sometimes but not often. - Tue Dec  1 22:58:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: I'm so weak. - Thu Dec  3 21:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Get good then. - Thu Dec  3 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: You want to train with me? - Thu Dec  3 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Sure. - Thu Dec  3 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: What sort of training do you typically do? - Thu Dec  3 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: I usually work on my Taijutsu, and somewhat on my Ninjutsu. - Thu Dec  3 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: I'm mostly good at a combination move. - Thu Dec  3 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: A combination move? What's sort? - Thu Dec  3 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Hmm..Wait do you know of two techniques called Misdirect and Throat Strike? - Thu Dec  3 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Mhm. - Thu Dec  3 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: I can perform them. - Thu Dec  3 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Do you have scrolls for the techniques? I was told just about everyone in the village was given a cop- Or was supposed to be given a copy. But I don't have either. - Thu Dec  3 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) went into his backpouch and tossed Geo-Dude a copy of Misdrect and Throat Strike.* - Thu Dec  3 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Sure. - Thu Dec  3 21:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Go ahead and start. - Thu Dec  3 21:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) instantly activated his 'Dance Of The Willow' technique in order to hopefully become stronger, faster and more durable against an opponent like Geo-Dude. He was absolutely the empitome of a Taijutsu Specialist in Kirigakire which was very hard to find around the nation, but after he finally used his clan technique in order to harden his bones and attempting to take the blunt of the attack but wrap his left arm around his opponent's leg. After this action most likely would've been successfully done.

Kyubishu had attempted to extend his right arm and grasp onto Geo's throat and immboilize him in that position and then strike with his forehead, against his adversary's nose.* - Thu Dec  3 21:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: They're sparring again, pointless. - Thu Dec  3 22:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) would've simply threw a large fuma shuriken toward Geo, or atleast it seemed like it, it was aiming toward his legs.* - Thu Dec  3 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) obviously couldn't be caught so easily, he wasn't moving at an amazing speed of which he wasn't able to be stopped. So you know what Kyubishu had did? He just allowed his opponent to move closer toward him, and after the sliding technique had came directly toward him, both of his arms had slided across his frame in order to block against the attack and shift all of his weight downward in order to make sure that he wasn't caught and sent up into the air. 

If he didn't get sent into the air, after he blocked the attack. Kyubishu would've swiftly attempted to use his knee bones and throw them into Geo's leg, most likely hitting the weight and going through depending on how far his leg had been stretched.* - Thu Dec  3 22:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) might've been thrown toward the ground, most of Geo-Dude's attacks were successfully done until he was legimately thrown onto the ground and attempted to have a flying dropkick happen to him. Kyubishu might've been weak when it came to physical strength amoung other things, but he had skill and the heart of a fighter, but when it came to being a shinobi that is all one could actually ask for. After this happened and he was flying down toward the ground, gravity had indeed taken over and flipped things into his advantage.

He begun to manuever himself and twirl in order to create a chain-effect, at the speed that Geo was dropping in order to try and flying dropkick him, he would've severely fucked up his legs due to the fact that Kyubishu had bones popping out of his body.* - Thu Dec  3 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had crashed into the ground as Geo-Dude had intended, Kyubishu was durable himself. Pain was something that he could withstand without complaining and it was absolutely hard for even the toughest person to get him to stop fighting against his opponent, after picking himself up and off the ground he would've simply withdrew some shuriken. It was apparent that his opponent didn't like sharp objects, that could've been infered from their previous encounter, and thus he threw all of those shuriken toward him, adjusting their position and launching them into the air.

Meanwhile. He sprinted directly toward him, while still controlling them within the air.* - Thu Dec  3 22:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had literally been impacted against Geo Dude's technique, and he died.* - Thu Dec  3 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: ....What the fuck? - Thu Dec  3 23:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: What is his problem? - Thu Dec  3 23:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) thinks: Don't acknowledge it. - Thu Dec  3 23:03:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: I'll be going, now. To Sunagakure I go. - Fri Dec  4 02:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: For a little trip, because nobody is here. - Fri Dec  4 02:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Also, was gud Wyn. - Fri Dec  4 21:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: 'Sup, Geo. - Fri Dec  4 21:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Hey there. - Fri Dec  4 21:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kagayaki, Hyoryu(SS2015) says: Geo fag. - Fri Dec  4 21:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kagayaki, Hyoryu(SS2015) says: -omit0 - Fri Dec  4 21:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Feel like' training? Except without the part of where you try to kill me. - Fri Dec  4 21:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Only if -you- stop trying to kill me. Sure. - Fri Dec  4 21:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Okay, sorry. Let's begin. - Fri Dec  4 21:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Well. I suppose you can. - Fri Dec  4 21:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had indeed been caught by Geo Dude's attack and after that he simply recovered when the assault of his opponent had landed. Kyubishu glanced toward him and sprinted directly at the shinobi before digging directly into his backpouch in order to fool his opponent, he zoomed in with decent enough speed to come closer toward him. When he finally reached Geo-Dude a balled up fist had came directly toward his face, and then his stomach.* - Fri Dec  4 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: How're you doing today? - Fri Dec  4 23:06:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) stared directly toward Yori. Is this person really that stupid in order to let their backside be effectively open? Kyubishu had simply headed into his holster and flipped it open and thus retreiving himself a handful of shuriken that consisted of ten. They were all alined with his fingers and he leaped backward in order to give himself a decent amount of space before attacking, taking notice of his surroundings. He might've been physically weaker than everyone else of Kirigakure but he was very effective and tactical when it came to fighting everybody who might've been considered legitly stronger than him, he tensed up.

A sudden whip of these shurikens had sliced through the air as they headed toward Yori. Something was extremely off about them, but it would've been extremely hard to notice unless somebody had payed close attention toward them and had very effective eye-sight, which was most likely not common in this group of invaders. A smirk had appeared on Kyubishu's face after he released his huddle of shuriken toward his opponent.

He awaited for his opponent to turn around before he watched them most likely catch his attention and hopefully save Kana. It wasn't the fact that she couldn't protect herself, but if he could deal with him right now then it would've helped everyone out in the long run.* - Sat Dec  5 01:54:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Start off. - Sat Dec  5 18:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) gazed directly toward Geo-Dude, this had basically became his essiental sparring partner for the day. Kyubishu was becoming closer and getting much greater in Taijutusu to a dramatic degree, he wanted to make Baen proud after most likely disappointing his anscestor so much. For quite a long time he had only knew the first dance of his clan and he was looking to achieve an even greater length of that which would've eventually made him a better fighter overall.

Kyubishu was hoping to make his strike fearsomes, with each punch that came toward his opponent it would've been dealt as a great one indeed. Ducking himself down underneath after the spinning heel kick came toward him, it would've left his opponent wide-open for a direct attack. He leaped up in order to upper-cut Geo right in the jaw and atleast sent him spiraling and make him dizzy.

Even for someone with great durability, for such a strong open wide attack, it should've atleast done some damage.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) took the first strike toward his midsection without any complaint, it was the fact that he didn't care if he was struck at all. If he took the attack without complaining then it would've simply gave him a better chance in order to land a strike against Geo, a small hand would've went in order to grasp onto Geo Dude's knee that came toward his front and stop his action. "You might want to move, hehe." Kyubishu had literally gave his opponent a warning due to the fact that he knew his partner didn't like sharp objects and this was going to end very bad for him if he choose not to move.

A small tunnel of chakra had begun to gather within his system before he finally activated his 'Dance Of Willow' technique in order to have bones, shoot themselves out from his body. They consisted of his knees, palms, and shoulders. It enhanced his reflexs, strength, durability, mostly everything that applied to things physically.

After the knee had been caught, Kyubishu attempted to swat it aside and move in closer in order to strike him in the face with a quick jab and then move back in order to avoid any counter-attacks.* - Sat Dec  5 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) once again allowed him to be struck in his midsection by Geo-Dude's uppercut after he decided to activate the First Gate, the pain wasn't something that really bothered him at all. But he simply decided to kick his opponent up into the sky and after having him ascended into the air he would've brought him down with an ankle drop.* - Sat Dec  5 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had taken notice of Geo's attack, and he was sent flying backward after the pressurized burst of energy had been sent into him and threw him a various amount of yards away from his opponent, Kyubishu had simply threw down his weight in order to stop himself from going any further.

A bruise had been left on his clothing after the strike collided with his sweat.
A few holes had been left amoung this ever since he started using his 'Dance Of The Willow' technique in order to protect himself with a good offensive and an even greater defensive. 

Geo was a great Taijutsu fighter and it worked for him fighting against Kyubishu in order to help improve his own fighting abilities.
He was now at long range, which meant for him it would've been a good advantage. Kyubishu had proceeded foward and prepared a few handseals, which wasn't a very common thing for such a close-range fighter like himself.
* - Sat Dec  5 20:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) continued to sprint directly toward Geo, Kyubishu didn't really state why he was so far away. He would've waited until they were directly close to each other.* - Sat Dec  5 20:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had been preparing himself for this, it took him and Geo awhile to close the distance. Due to the simple fact that his pressurizied burst of air had sent him back quite a few yards away and it took them personal time in order to utilize their speed and get a running start in order to hit the full length of their actual speed, after the strike had came from Geo-Dude and was aimed directly toward Kyubishu's face, he simply attempted to duck down in order to avoid his opponent's strike.

It was unusual for him to allow himself to get hit, but he found it simply that he couldn't get hit and actually find a way to strike his opponent. And the fact that it was a spar had made it even better upon him, after ducking his head in order to dodge Geo's strike, he released his handseals and activated his jutsu. Wire-bind had came from his mouth or atleast his hands, as they were aimed to snagle and ensnare his opponent.

That would've most likely been the best decision for him.* - Sat Dec  5 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) literally gazed toward Geo after he caught his opponent in a very strategic technique, Kyubishu had literally laughed after this technique had worked. He would've simply allowed his bones to move themselves back into the original position before he fought against his sparring partner. "I think I've finally won this battle for once, after losing to you for so many times. Maybe I'm not as weak as I actually think." He was bruised up more than he should've been but the wounds would've eventually healed.

Pain was something that was a problem for someone like him. "It's a wire bind, really simple technique. I can tighten the wire whenever I want, I can inflict injury upon you, or even maim you if I want."* - Sat Dec  5 21:05:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: I'll be back. - Sun Dec  6 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had absolutely been doing every wrong at this point, Kyubishu had literally thought that fighting with Geo-Dude everyday might've seriously made him a better fighter in every aspect but after witnessing how his daily sparrning partner was ensnared and then literally broke out of his wire bindings like they were absolutely nothing to him? It pissed him off to the max. He was supposed to be a legendary shinobi that was heard all about throughout the nation but it seemed like he was lied to, still having a spear within his body and the fact that he wasn't dead.

It was absolutely amazing for the most part, Kyubishu had stopped infront of a mountain before gazing upward and glancing up toward the sky as his headband covered over his missing eye. It wasn't a secret that he was jumped by Ichiro and Kida and after that he had never seen them after, they had given him the motivation in order to become stronger and thrive for the next day. At this point Kyubishu didn't even want to become a legendary shinobi that's name was feared.

The simple fact was that he wanted to become stronger than everybody in Kirigakure or atleast become useful. In a lethal situation he was just caught in a Genjutsu and was simply disabled from the battle, he never wanted something like to happened again. A small sign was made and he sent chakra toward his feet in order to give him an advantage, extending his leg in order to have it clamp against the wall of the mountain before began to walk up it.

A small duration of time had passed after this happened before he finally made it up the mountain, a small gasp of breath had escaped his lungs before he grasped onto the midsection of his tattered and raggy sweater, taking it off his torso and throwing it amoung the ground. A twisted memory had came back within his mind, each strike that was thrown at him was remembered as a heavy one, it was almost like his opponent was a bulldozer and he was just simple garbage that needed to be picked up off the ground.

He gritted his teeth and vizualized his opponent infront of him, fingers curling up into a knuckle as he adjusted his left foot and placed it infront of him. His muscles had buldged and the energy around him became fierce, Kyubishu's body tempature had increased greatly from the anger that was coursing through his veins, striking foward with each punch in order to try and increase his physical striking power.

Hopefully working on this in order to become stronger.* - Sun Dec  6 02:08:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Of course, I only mean one on ones though. - Sun Dec  6 02:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had just awoken after resting from his day of previous training in order to become stronger and more advanced in his Taijutsu. Kyubishu needed to be useful like Baen thought he could've been as a tear would've dripped down onto his pale cheek and splashed against the dirt that was infront of him, quickly wiping it away so nobody would've seen him cry he headed over toward the clear-ocean water, dipping his head into the waterfall and starting to wake himself up and making sure that was absolutely alive because soon after Ichiro and Kida had beaten him up, he wasn't actually sure that he was alive in reality.

Thrusting his head from out the water and drying his long hair in order to make sure that he didn't receive any cold of some type, Kyubishu had simply extended his left arm and begun to spin it to the point of where his muscles would've loosened themselves so that he soon could've begun to train soon and hopefully become strong enough in order to make a difference in Kirigakure. People that were new shinobi had even surprassed him and he's been a Genin far too long in his own book, at this point he should've already been quite close to being known around the village.

But at this point, not even Kana didn't like him it seemed. She most likely only saved him because of the actual previous Mizukage that cared about her people, Kyubishu had gritted his teeth in her memory because of the fact that she was going to train and the day right before she had actually stated that he received news that she was killed, he cringled up his fingers into a knuckle and tried to release all of the anger that was within him.

After grasping onto the midsection of his sweater, he would've simply thrown it off his torso and tossed it onto the dirt. Kyubishu had actually remembered when he first acquired that sweater and how clean and new it was looking, picking it up from off the ground and dangling it infront of him he would've gazed toward it and stared at the condition of the sweater, he was literally sad at the fact that such clothing could've actually became useless just like him.

He related to this as something more than it actually was. But then he was snapped back into reality and realized that he needed to actually get into training, marching himself over toward the tree that was the closest in the area, he balled up his fingers into a knuckle and thrusted it foward. A small dent had been formed within the barck of the tree, his muscles had tightened up after a various amount of strikes, at the end of this his hands would've been bruised up and bleeding slightly.

"Just one step closer." He told himself in a quiet whisper.* - Sun Dec  6 15:44:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I'm ready whenever. - Sun Dec  6 18:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Go ahead and start. - Sun Dec  6 19:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Maybe we should move away from this area first. - Sun Dec  6 19:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: It's fine, we spar over here all the time. It's an open area. - Sun Dec  6 19:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Alright, then. - Sun Dec  6 19:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) took a sudden yawn. "I suppose." He advanced toward his opponent, his eyes had shifted directly toward Ryo and Yumiko. This woman wanted to see his abilities and if he was correct then Tengoku wasn't as weak as he actually thought that he really was, which meant that Kyubishu might've needed to use everything in his arsenal in order to actually beat his opponent. His speed was obviously above average and he slowly came in closer upon his advesary before he curled up his fingers into a knuckle as a smirk had appeared across his face.

Kyubishu's left arm had reeled in directly toward Tengoku's face as he attempted to strike him directly in the nose to most likely make him leek blood. His training was obviously slowly paying off for him, he was generally stronger than your average shinobi Genin, he was able to deal a large amount of damage more than anybody else would.* - Sun Dec  6 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had indeed been burnt by Tengoku's attack. But it really didn't affect him like his opponent want it too, and after that thing had slightly scorched his black shirt it had made Kyubishu quite mad, this was his favorite shirt. He advanced foward and simply zig-zagged his formation before retriving shuriken from his holster and dividing them within his hands to make a total count of ten shuriken, he was still quite a distance away from his opponent which meant he would've threw all of them toward Tengoku.

Kyubishu awaited until they had made their way toward his opponent and was almost on their course to collide with him, before adjusting his fingers and making sure that they would've went above his face and ascended into the sky. All the while he was still advancing foward, attempting to duck himself and grasp onto Tengoku's throat in order to hold him still.

It would've meant that he couldn't move for atleast one turn and allowed Kyubishu a free shot.* - Sun Dec  6 19:30:46 2015
