<br><font color=teal>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) says: Alright. What're we doing for today? - Sun Dec 13 12:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Working on your reflexes. - Sun Dec 13 12:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) says: M'kay, easy enough. - Sun Dec 13 12:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: I'm not pulling my punches, they'll be coming at full speed. - Sun Dec 13 12:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) says: No problem. - Sun Dec 13 12:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: .... - Sun Dec 13 12:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) thinks: He really doesn't know what that means, alright then. - Sun Dec 13 12:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Come at me. - Sun Dec 13 12:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) thinks: She's durable, I should be able to inflict an attack. - Sun Dec 13 12:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) removed his headband from his waist and tightened it across his forehead in order to use the protector as a source of symbol for when he fought against an opponent, his muscles had suddenly tightened up and he became quite nervous about fighting against Hassan. But then a smirk would've formed across his face at the point of excitement due to the simple fact that she was awfully strong and how much of an intense battle this would've been for Kasier, but also.<18>

He gritted his teeth and dashed foward, his arms flowed behind him as his speed generally increased and he covered the distance inbetween them quite fast, a small strike would've been heading toward her stomach, Kaiser had attempted to use the momentum from the attack in order to spin off and end up behind the woman, trying to keep his distance and back away after the first initial attack.<19>* - Sun Dec 13 12:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) was indeed knocked off balance, Kaiser's first attack had essientally failed which messed up everything else that was planned to follow after. But he wasn't just some amatuer that could've been easily defeated and his opponent was actually quite strong compared to most people in Sunagakure and due to the fact that he wasn't beaten in the first strike was absolutely amazing. But after the sweeping kick had came and he was knocked off his balance, his left arm would've extended down.<20>

In order to catch himself and keep him elevated, his right leg would've shot out toward her right cheek in order to hopefully catch her offguard and strike the woman directly in the face and most likely send her flying if the attack had actually connected, Kaiser's attacks were more fierce than anybody could've ever gave credit for but he was truely stronger than any average Genin.<21>

But thus, his left foot would've went to come from above and drop his heel toward the top of her head for a massive combo attack, all the while keeping himself in that elevated position.<22>* - Sun Dec 13 12:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) attempted to counter against the majority of the attacks in the air, whilst they were suspended through the sky. Kaiser's arm would've went toward his side in order to block against the attack that was aimed at his left-side but a right attack had made him wince before they had generally descended down onto the ground, she was right. Fighting up against an opponent who was much stronger than you did require having a good defensive strategy and consisting of counter-attacks that could've possibly put you in the league.

Kaiser had managed to recover before they had actually landed upon the ground, he shifted his weight and threw himself backward in order to start a spinning motion. When they actually made contact with the floor, Kaiser had slided against the sand and stopped there with his heavy breathing, gazing directly toward Kinami.

She was strong indeed and if he wanted to beat her, then a new tactic would've been advised for him. A handful of shuriken had been put into the finger-slots of his left hand and the same exact thing would've been done on his right, except for the fact that the weapons were not shuriken.

They were kunai, if it wasn't for Kaiser's extreme durable body then he would've been toast most likely. Even though she hadn't been attacking him with her real strength, he rippled all of his weapons which consisted of five shuriken, and five kunai. Ten in total, as they headed toward her, he would've began to dash around his opponent and leap through the air.

Awaiting for the weapons to pass, he came down with a fierce kick.* - Sun Dec 13 13:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) didn't even turn around, he begun to focus on Kinami's speed and the sound of her voice. She must've had something that was left behind when moving about the training field, his left foot would've twirled in order for him to spin kick at her and attempting to strike her directly in the chest area and send her flying directly toward the wall that was behind them, effectively and hopefully causing atleast a small amount of damage. 

The fact that Kinami could've actually taken a strike from Kaiser was absolutely amazing.* - Sun Dec 13 13:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) grunted after his attack landed, he could feel how durable Kinami was against his attack. "I don't think that I'm weak. I just think you're too freakin' durable!" He said before gritting his teeth at her. <28>* - Sun Dec 13 13:21:13 2015
