<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) slowly travaled from the academy to the waterfall in order to think about his recent thoughts, who was the person that weared a mask? It was obvious that certain 'vibe' had been coming from him and the fact that he just mysteriously showed up without actually showing him face didn't make him feel right, as he walked out of the area of the academy and went toward the beaten path that was upward. A small release of oxygen had flown out of his system and into the air, he was now awfully close to his destination before his training for the day could actually begin.

He stopped after finally reaching the waterfall, simply stopping infront of the tree and reaching out his fingers toward the dent that he had put into a specific tree, the bandages that were thouroughly wrapped around his hands after bruising it against the trunk of that specific trunk, Kyubishu had thought extremely hard about the self-training that he needed to do in order to become stronger and after finally coming to a decision.

It was obvious that he -needed- to go through with this, he couldn't effectively deal out a large amount of damage at once. Dealing with getting hit and dodging might've been a problem at one point but after he finally started to react occordingly it obviously wasn't a big deal anymore, he unwrapped the headband that was slanted across his missing eye and took it off. The weight that had been pressured against the missing eye was now lifted and Kyubishu's expression had changed.

He went from curious to sad, about the fact that he was unable to do anything against Kida and Ichiro. The fact that they still hadn't been caught and brought to justice, the people of Kirigakure had kilt an innocent man in his eyes due to the simple fact that he didn't know this man's crimes, but they couldn't find two people who actually did assault him. So he'd just have to them on his own and deal with them his own way, which meant he needed to become generally stronger on his own.

After Roman had accepted to teach him how to use a spear another thing had came into play. The fact that he still didn't have the spear on him, which meant going through extreme pain in order to take it out of his body, the lifeless eye that had been taken, a sudden empty feeling was within the same empty eye socket, Kyubishu wrapped his headband back around the missing eye socket and begun to smash against the tree.

Gritting his teeth due to simple train.* - Mon Dec  7 21:20:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: I see. - Tue Dec  8 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had eventually became one step closer toward his actual end-goal.  Kyubishu had eventually pounded on the trunk of a tree so much that the durability of his fist had generally became more resistant to the type of material that he was pounding upon, each time that he repeatedly pounded on a tree he would've wrapped his knuckles in bandages to make sure he could've properly recovered.
Time seemed to be passing him by quicker and in order to leave the person that he used to be BEHIND, he needed to make a change and fast. Something that would've been easy to do and didn't end up being too difficult and complicated for him to do, also taking up a short duration of time to do. A lightbulb had flashed inside his head and he took a small trip to Konohagakure.
It might've taken him a day or two to make it from Kirigakure to his actual destination but he needed to do this in order to let go of The Weaker Kyubishu that had been beaten up by Ichiro and Kida, leaving immediately after the idea had came up into his head and he packed himself up, he would've begun walking. He left the village often without Kana's permission so doing it now obviously wouldn't have made a difference. After taking a day or two, Kyubishu had finally made it.
Walking into the barber and cutting his more long-style hair into something short and spikey like his previous relative that was killed by the also ironic, PREVIOUS Mizukage, he stopped just outside if Konohagakure and found himself a quick spot to rest. It's been a day or two since he trained and his knuckles also might've paired themselves all the same, but Kyubishu had stopped infront of a tree. This task had became easier each time he done this, pounding on a tree in order to increase his striking power.

A encurled finger which was formed into a knuckle had been thrusted out toward the tree as it clashed against the brown bark, instantly smashing the wood and leaving splinters in the tree. He wasn't playing around anymore, his striking prowess had generally became stronger since previously before and he was able to dish out damage way easier than before. A left hook had came for the side of the tree branch, snapping it once again, leaving an echoing sound that ringged out across the outside of Konohagakure. Kyubishu's face had lit up before he constantly struck at the tree once again.

Rapidly as it had gone on, eventually all around the tree it was almost toward the middle, constant dents through punches.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Roman(DagonWarhead) says: Carry on. - Tue Dec  8 04:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) returned from Konohagakure after his little trip in order to get himself a new apperance and rock some new attire, he also got a hair-cut that would've most likely fit his headband style and his new outlook upon life, short and spikey. It was actually a weird thing to say but that's how he actually looked at most things to a certain degree, Kyubishu's actual thoughts about everything had seriously changed ever since he had been attacked by Kida and Ichiro.
The small looming quote had drifted within his mind, to an extreme degree. "Kill me with that spear, and maybe you'll make it somewhere in this world. Don't and you'll stay as weak as you alredy are." He trained harder every day since that fated day of when he had his tongue and eyeball taken out from his body, but at the same moment. It's been about two years since around the time of when that happened.
Kyubishu had became even closer to where he actually wanted to as a Shinobi. He had found himself training everyday and keeping up a daily routine and at this point his simple training regimine had became extremely easy for him so he would've worked on his physical build in order to increase his strength, but he realized that strength wasn't the only thing that was required of a shinobi.
They had to be smart enough to know how to beat an opponent that might've overcame them in a certain area, so after he was finished training his body for the day. He would've stopped by the library in the academy and read up on some books that would've helped his overall knowledge of the body of the most common shinobi, knowing when you are in a Genjutsu, etc. Things that would've included stuff like that.
He stood in the area of the waterfall, listening as the fall of water had splashed to a certain point. A giant boulder had stood in his way, and Kyubishu thrusted his hand foward in order to collide with it, a small little impact had been made, and then a sound had drifted through the area. Before a 'crackling' sound had travalled through the boulder and slowly cut off the first top of it. Kyubishu's hand was slightly bruised but that just meant he was getting closer to becoming stronger.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) Had progressed much further than even himself had anticipated, Kyubishu had went further than most shinobi of a certain era could've even done due to the simple fact that he had motivation and the determination to become stronger than his opponent. But the biggest factor out of all was revenge, the dream of making his attacks pay the price for putting him in a state of craziness, he would've never been like this if it wasn't for them. But all he could've really done was thank Kida and Ichiro for attacking him that day.
They helped him become the person that he is today, his strikers were feared and he had taken a few years to abandon everything else that he thought about and go down the actual path of becoming a boxer. This was just one more important step in order becoming a stronger shinobi so that he could've taken his revenge and then after setting that aside he would've finally went down his original path and become a legendary shinobi like Baen had most likely wanted him to do.
Kyubishu had took a walk back toward the waterfall of where his first session had taken place, he ruffled his spikey hair and glanced toward the water, and then toward the broken and battered tree, which had taken the role of a dummy before he progressed even further in his training, a smirk had came across his face as he felt extremely older than before. He was thirteen when he first started he training offically and now that several years had passed passed, and he was now seventeen. It didn't help that he was still the rank of a Genin but the actual 'ranking' itself didn't make a difference toward him.
He must've been around a higher experienced Chuunin at this point, Kyubishu had also been working on his jutsu in order to master them, that would've helped increase his abilities and combo attacks, because if his jutsu weren't mastered then the trick that he had done with them would've been simply invalid, Kyubishu left the waterfall and proceeded to walk back to his most recent training area, facing himself infront of a boulder and sizing it up and down. He had bandages wrapped around his hands on every occusion in order to make sure that they would've healed properly.
His left foot had dug themselves into the dirt and he untangled the bandages from his hands, and letting them drop on the floor a brief explosion of oxygen had been released from his mouth. A left strike had proceeded to go directly toward the boulder and create a crack that would've eventually spread across the area and had it crumble up, Kyubishu wasn't finished there. This was honestly light-enough work for him, his strength had increased dramatically due to his physical training which gradually improved his body's strength.
Another right hook was sent into the core of the crack, eventually having the boulder eventually rip itself apart and crumble.

"Shut up, you bastard. You're a murderer and a villian, you're the type of person that pushes me to become stronger so we can stop more people like you from living in this world.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) stared directly toward Anguo with a extremely bored expression, Kyubishu was obviously quite more exprienced than that. He was able to quickly shift himself toward the side and move left, whilst deflecting the weapons that quickly came and advanced toward his previous position and now that the coast was clear for him to attack against his opponent an offesive tactic should've been quickly made against Anguo.

Kyubishu had only been slightly nicked upon the shoulder, he simply performed a few simple handseals and launched forth a few strands of wire that would've hopefully ensnared his opponent and have them unable to move. He proceeded foward in a quick fashion, keeping weary of Anguo.* - Fri Dec 11 20:36:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chen(ZenoKuthric) says: Name? - Sat Dec 12 16:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) generally thought about how strong he had become considered to previously, he was now offically a boxer and thought about his career even more now. Things were starting to actually look up for Kyubishu, The Gezo Private Exams were right around the corner and he needed to find himself with a few more tricks in order to be completely sure of his success. A new sporting outfit had been bought at Konoha's store, which consisted of a black shirt, black pants, black shoes, and a red belt.
He still needed to become stronger and the complete combination of being able to strike at his opponent with a right hook and then a left hook, finishing it off with a mighty roundhouse would've been absolutely beast! It would've made Kyubishu the perfect hand-to-hand fighter. He needed to pursue this dream in order to become a better shinobi and eventually go after his actual goal, which was revenge. After he thought about feeling ready he would've headed toward Kida and Ichio in order to find them.
But that wasn't anywhere close now, Ichiro himself was an absolute tank when it came to fighting against people and in order to actually win that battle he would've needed to generally deal out a efficent enough damage to actually end up as the winner. A flash of memories had came into Kyubishu's mind as the scene had taken place, about six years ago after he had been successfully taken down with his tongue taken out and his eyeball poked right out from the socket.
That's exactly why he wore a headband over his eye. But he simply journied toward the old spot of where he practiced upon taking the road of a boxer, and now he faced a decision in order to become a double-threat. Being able to knock down his opponent with a few well placed kicks and punches, if he did his training correctly. He positioned himself toward the left of a tree like he had done with his other training and raised his right foot in order to strike at the tree, but it was futile. Kyubishu was barely able to lift his foot high enough off the ground to connect with the tree and actually inflict a sufficient enough damage.
A smirk had came toward his face as that was his first task, Kyubishu had organized himself with a few-well placed blocks of wood and then slided them infront, as they were obviously stacked pretty high. He glanced up toward the high-stacked logs that were infront of him and lifted his foot up in order to have it land directly onto the top and kept it there for a few minutes, the pain had shot through his body and went -directly- into his desired spot. He would've endured the pain and continued to keep his leg right in that same place.
This was obviously a very clever training routinue for him, due to the fact that he couldn't raise his foot high enough to collide with anything and connect with force to deal damage. So the first task would've simply have his foot being raised onto the leg, after about seven minutes of having his left foot in the same place and just being there, it had became numb and feel asleep. Kyubishu had begun to lose his balance before he fell down and landed upon the ground, sweat had dripped down from his face.
It was the determination to proceed and become stronger that had him training so hard. Even when some people had retired for the day and went to relax, he was still training and trying to proceed and work harder than everyone in order to become stronger. He picked himself up off the ground and dusted off his clothing and removed the sweater from his torso before tossing it onto the ground and gazing up into the sky, things needed to change for him or else he would've been stuck a weakling like Kida and Ichiro had stated directly after they beaten him down to a pulp and dealt out a worthy enough punshiment for losing.
Kyubishu had constantly slammed his foot into the ground in order to wake up his left leg completely, but after a minute or two of stomping on the ground. The feeling of his leg had finally re-awoken within his foot, a sudden jumping motion would've been made before he simply stepped foward up toward the stacked logs, another idea had popped up into his mind. That current training that he had just done was obviously good, but not good ENOUGH to make a huge difference. A simple swipe of his forehead was made in order to remove the sweat that was dripping upon his forehead and into his right eye, he placed himself toward the side of the high-stacked logs.
And lifted up his right leg and constantly struck toward it. A massive amount of volecity and forced had been concentrated into one strike, to the point of where his foot had impacted with the logs and made him groain with extreme pain, falling down onto the ground and curling up into a small ball from the pain. He raised his left hand and smashed it against the ground out of rage of not being able to take a little bit of pain, it was Kyubishu's job as a shinobi to be able to deal with that sort of thing. But he obviously wasn't ready at this point.
Kyubishu's eye had drifted up into the sky to see as the sun had fallen and nightfall had taken place amoung the training area of Kirigakure. That didn't matter to him, the energy that was flowing through him and the determination to become stronger had simply been obviously to strong to be overwhelmed by something so petty as darkness. After taking a three minute break he picked himself up off the ground and approached a tree, the stack of logs were steadily being broken down so that would've been useless to him at this point.
Kyubishu's left leg had struck toward a tree and then he attempted to switch it up, sweeping his right foot against the grass and picking up his left leg in order to utilize The 'Leaf Whirlwind' technique and smash it up against the tree. A shocking pain had surged through both of his feet but that once again still didn't matter to him, Kyubishu had proceeded with his training until he was actually tired and then he would've headed home for the day in order to simply rest up and continue two days from now.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: How'd you get here? - Sat Dec 12 18:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) quickly swam through the water, Kyubishu had approached out of the water and retrieved a handful of shuriken. A total count of ten as he glanced toward Kami and spoke out toward him, "I assume you're here for the same reason that we are. Right?"* - Sat Dec 12 18:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had indeed been shocked by the motion sensors that were deep in the water, Kyubishu had effectively backed up in order to try and manuever his way around it to make sure that he didn't actually come within range of the electricity that had previously shocked him. But he wasn't a little bitch that couldn't take pain, it was something that came apart of being a Shinobi and he endured it as best as possible.

He prepared himself with a jutsu as he seen Kami in the distance after manuevering himself so that he wouldn't be in the water, no more shock for him.* - Sat Dec 12 19:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) thinks: That's bad. I can't get around the water or even touch it. - Sat Dec 12 19:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) thinks: Who the fuck?! - Sat Dec 12 19:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had effectively fought against Kami due to the fact that he had calculated his opponent's movements extremely easy. To the point of where Kyubishu had activated his Kawarimi Technique and hopefully tried to get himself out of the range from the attack and be on the end of the lake, he had retreived shuriken like previously before and threw them directly toward Kami as they headed for him and then, headed upward like it was magic.* - Sat Dec 12 19:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had underestimated his opponent, Kyubishu hadn't been careful at all. Why did he choose to take this fucking exam? Something inside of him had instinctively told him to absolutely not take this, but he was being an idiot and decided to go through with this and now his chance at revenge had been foiled and absolutely wasted. Kyubishu stuck his head out from the water and glanced toward the gunpower cloud that had loomed above him, he swiftly attempted to bring himself up from out of the water as quickly as possible.

A intense amount of flames had literally engulfed him and he quickly tried to activate his 'Dance Of The Willow' technique in order to hopefully create some sort of defensive mechanism for himself but that obviously had been futile. The flames had instantly scorched him and the rest of his skin, along with his clothing, headband, hair and anything else that belonged toward his person, he was outclassed.

Something inside of him was actually happy that his life could've ended. He might've been a shinobi but this world obviously hadn't been for him, he wasn't fit for a world that was so cold like this one and after Kida and Ichiro had actually made him realize this he couldn't come to terms with it until somebody had blantly showed him it.

And that 'person' was death. Something nobody had exprienced and actually lived to tell anyone about, but he closed his eye and allowed himself to drift away, it's not like anybody had actually cared about him.* - Sat Dec 12 19:51:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Look, I have to explain myself.  If you want to uppercut me afterwards fine. - Sun Dec 13 00:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Do we have a deal? - Sun Dec 13 00:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: No. Let me go. Now. - Sun Dec 13 00:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Baby you have to listen to me. - Sun Dec 13 00:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) approached Kasanari, as he attempted to tug upon her sleeve at a very short height. He might've been a Genin but something was extremely strange about him considering that his jumpsuit hadn't been seen often on a little boy like this one, "Hey M'am. You wanna spar with me?"* - Sun Dec 13 00:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) thinks: Well can't say he's not trying... - Sun Dec 13 00:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: . . . .  - Sun Dec 13 00:17:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: explain* - Sun Dec 13 00:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) says: Sure. Let's go! - Sun Dec 13 00:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: What the hell?. . . .  - Sun Dec 13 00:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) thinks: That's probably not a smart idea guy..... Nami shouldn't spar while mad. - Sun Dec 13 00:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: . . .  - Sun Dec 13 00:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) headed over toward The Training Field himself, he quickly followed behind Hassan.* - Sun Dec 13 00:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Come at me if you'd like. - Sun Dec 13 00:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) withdrew a handful of shuriken after he finally anaylzed his opponent and assesed their physical apperance. That was taken into deep consideration before he actually assasulted his advesary, Kaiser would've simply unleashed the handful of shuriken directly toward Hassan as they rippled through the air and quickly headed in her general direction, a small smirk had came upon his face, thus adjusting himself and quickly removing the headband from his waist and applying it across his forehead.

The Sunagakure's symbol was blandly plastered across the metal as he advanced with progressive speed.* - Sun Dec 13 00:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) quickly awaited for the shuriken to come toward Hassan's general direction and generally wished that she would dodge the incoming projectiles that were heading her way, if she didn't or did it wouldn't matter at all. Either way it still played into his advantage before he decided to suddenly stop his running pace and literally fall down into a slide in order to thrust his foot directly up into the sky and attempting to strike her within the chin, and launch Hassan up into the air, without remorse.* - Sun Dec 13 00:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) proceeded to rail himself back after Hassan had ascended into the air. He didn't want to combat against somebody he didn't know in the sky, people of Sunagakure had made him feel off edge and fighting against a woman of such degree certainly didn't make sense but everybody seemed to be a shinobi and she wanted to take him up on his offer of sparring against her, so who was he to complain? Kaiser's eyes would've simply followed the woman after his attack had swiftly connected and pushed her up into the sky.<3>

A kunai would've been retreived from his backpouch and thrown toward her out of a simple reaction. A small tip-toe jumping style would've been made from the boy after he had stopped in a position for a moment.<4>* - Sun Dec 13 00:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: .... - Sun Dec 13 00:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) had noticed how Hassan was obviously more durable than he had actually thought, something was wrong about this. It bugged Kaiser to the point of anger and he literally sprinted into the battle after the woman had begun to descend downward and head back onto the ground, a small little kick would've been headed toward her mid-section before another high kick had been focused upon the more general region of her face, Kaiser would've been hopefully able to land a few successful kicks that hopefully should've ended the spar.<5>

The fact that this woman was able to even withstand a kick toward her chin from this boy was absolutely amazing, due to the fact that he's worked so hard to become an expert in Taijutsu and was feared for his punch and kick combinations, attempting to strike her and end all of this.<6>* - Sun Dec 13 00:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Hiroshi you want to spar? - Sun Dec 13 00:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Can't right now. . .  - Sun Dec 13 01:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Why? - Sun Dec 13 01:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: I don't want to talk about it right now Geo. - Sun Dec 13 01:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: You know why. - Sun Dec 13 01:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) had been thrown after Hassan had gripped onto his leg, a surprised facial expression had been made ever since his technique had been caught onto. It was extremely weird for him to be made a fool like this, back in the academy Kaiser had been the star-pupil to everyone who was considered a teacher and now after graduating and becoming a Genin things had obviously changed to an extreme degree, he was chucked and caught himself after making contact with the floor.

A small bounce would've been made before he flipped in the air and slided his feet across the floor. As she could've anticipated, absolutely no damage had been taken from the toss that was inflicted toward him, picking himself up off the ground and sprinting foward. His speed had been reduced to a degree but that was all apart of the plan.

She was taking all of his attacks and dishing out more.* - Sun Dec 13 01:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Why can't you spar again Hiro? - Sun Dec 13 01:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: I told you already. - Sun Dec 13 01:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: I'm not repeating myself. - Sun Dec 13 01:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (speed 13.9, attack speed 22.4, strength 20 still holding back) - Sun Dec 13 01:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) had been absolutely destroyed even after a strike or two had landed upon Kaiser's person. She was much faster than he had actually expected and it was a good thing that he grew up in Sunagakure because everyone here seemed to be immensely stronger than he actually thought, things were going to be tough for him but he needed to prevail and become even stronger than he already was due to the fact that Hassan was a beast compared to somebody like him. How long has she been pursuing Taijutsu? A year or two?<10>

It was good that Kaiser had been as good as the woman when he was her age, because if he continued to progress at a rapid rate then he would've possibly been as strong as her. The kick had connected with his chest and even with his iron-like skin the attack that collided against him had sent him flying backward in the opposite direction.<11>

His arms and legs were thrown into the air, before his vision had been shifted behind him and he once again had felt another strike connecting from behind in order to knock him down onto the ground, he was bruised up and most likely unable to fit.<12>

Due to the simple fac that Hassan had broken through his defense.<13>* - Sun Dec 13 01:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Get up. We're not done yet. - Sun Dec 13 01:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: This is taking forever. . . . .  - Sun Dec 13 01:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) picked himself up from off the ground and tightened his headband, their was a looking within his eyes that concealed themselves until this very moment. He was motivated to become stronger now that he faced an opponent that had teached him the way of losing and Kaiser had finally learned what it meant to be weaker than somebody, to a true extent. A indomitable will, an unbreakable spirit was within his body and he wouldn't be knocked down so easily unless somebody had forcefully gave him a good reason to stay down.<13>

A small little hissing sound would've came from his mouth as he continued to breathe harder, his clothing had been slightly bruised up from the attack that flew toward him and managed to legitamately connected against him, generally banging him up and cracking through his defensive mechanism. A few shuriken had been thrown toward Hassan before he adjusted his left foot against the ground and proceeded foward.<14>

The speed that he had used before was completely gone and he was now moving faster, attempting to raise his left knee and strike into her stomach, whilst twisting himself and attempting to elbow her directly in the nose. Anyone could've told that he was fighting much more serious now.<15

Kaiser's expression had seriously changed and he deciced to stop taking everything as joke after he was taken as a fool.<16>* - Sun Dec 13 01:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Kids got spunk. . .  - Sun Dec 13 01:20:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) thinks: Wait what the fuck!? She uses a sword?! - Sun Dec 13 01:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) had forfeited the match, that was his only choice after having a tanto placed against his shoulders. "H-How're you using a weapon but you're a Taijutsu Specialist?"<17>* - Sun Dec 13 01:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Hmm? I'm special.~ - Sun Dec 13 01:30:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) fixed his headband back around his waist, once more. He gazed over toward Geo-Dude as he witnessed how he was fighting against someone in this very area, not too long ago. Maybe he could've found himself a teacher around here.* - Sun Dec 13 01:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) says: Nice match, I suppose. - Sun Dec 13 01:31:15 2015
