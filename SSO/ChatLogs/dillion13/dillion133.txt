<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Anywho. - Tue Nov  3 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) stepped toward the side. He awaited for Nina to make the first action, it was just a simple act of being himself. Kyubishu dind't like people who tried to self-proclaim something that wasn't true, he wasn't somebody that doubted people and maybe some people seen it at a different perspective, but it was just simple. It's not like she didn't have the talent to become "The Best Genin in Kirigakure", but at the moment that wasn't sufficent enough for him to believe.

Even if he lost this battle, he wouldn't sweat it. Because she wasn't shit compared to anyone else. At this very moment he was in his weakest condition because he wasn't able to uitlize his clan abilities to their fullest potential, but once he learned everything and got a good amount of mastery over them, he might've been unstopabble and reached Baen's level and possibly higher.

A small drift of his left hand was made before it headed toward his right leg, and then back toward his side.* - Tue Nov  3 03:28:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Oh, I buried it where we normally do. - Tue Nov  3 03:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) just stood there. He witnessed her handseals and everything, he wasn't worried. Everyone had learned about the basics of releasing and stopping your chakra flow in order to stop yourself from being actually caught in a Genjutsu. It was a basic thing that you're taught at the academy and other chose to excell in it so that they would've never been caught in a trick like that, Kyubishu had only learned the basics of it but that didn't mean that wasn't useful enough for anything that wasn't extremely high level'd.

Kyubishu took a step foward and he was already infront of her, if she wasn't fast enough then a punch would've been headed her way. And then a sudden smirk had been apparent across his face, shifting the momentum and accuracy of his attack in order to have it come toward her left cheek instead of just going straight for her face.* - Tue Nov  3 03:40:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) just stood there. He really couldn't do much, after this was all over he really needed to learn Kai, it would've made this match so much easier for him.* - Tue Nov  3 04:07:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: I d-don't know. - Tue Nov  3 18:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm... - Tue Nov  3 18:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well...I suppose we'll start with Kai. - Tue Nov  3 18:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: ... - Tue Nov  3 18:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) took it.* - Tue Nov  3 18:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had been put in a Genjutsu previously before, it pissed him off that he needed to learn how to do this. They were taught at the academy and he practiced it before but Kyubishu had never thought he would've really needed to use it. So it was actually time to properly learn this jutsu so that he wasn't taken out by another simple trick like that again, a simple inhale was taken so that he could've filled up his lungs with somef resh air. That was just the first step, he raised his hands.

A handseal was made as it had been raised directly infront of him, he must've slightly misunderstood the woman. He tried his absolute hardest in order to stop his chakra and that meant he was going to eventually fail and not actually escape from this Genjutsu until he properly learned what she meant by 'stopping your flow of chakra.'

Small sweat drops had hit the grass and he looked around, the multitude of clones were still there. And that meant he couldn't successfully disarm the Genjutsu, if he actually failed like that in a real battle it could've meant his life, Kyubishu was sick and tired of failing.

The same handseal was taken again, like previously before. His chakra had been flowing greatly and then he forcefully stopped it to the point of releasing The Genjutsu, "Kai!" He screamed out like most people usually would've done when they either did a new technique or just decided to egt flashy. His vision would've cleared up and the clones disappeared.* - Tue Nov  3 18:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm...I can't go much further without knowing your elements... - Tue Nov  3 18:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: O-Oh.. - Tue Nov  3 18:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: Uhm.. - Tue Nov  3 18:30:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its good to learn a few though, just to back yourself u- - Tue Nov  3 18:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: A farmer? - Tue Nov  3 18:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: I'm a fighter, I just don't use Ninjutsu. Elemental wise. - Tue Nov  3 18:31:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: B-Because it's f-fun to farm..and uhm..I-I like being a shinobi.. - Tue Nov  3 18:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ...Its not an easy life - Tue Nov  3 18:32:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well....Either way, I can teach a few taijutsu to you both. - Tue Nov  3 18:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Taijutsu? Good. - Tue Nov  3 18:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right...then - Tue Nov  3 18:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Attack me please. - Tue Nov  3 18:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: T-Taijutsu? - Tue Nov  3 18:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yes Taijutsu. - Tue Nov  3 18:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: O-Oh uhm... - Tue Nov  3 18:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-Alright.. - Tue Nov  3 18:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: I'll g-go first..! - Tue Nov  3 18:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Momura, coordinate attacks! - Tue Nov  3 18:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well you can attack together if you want, but I just want to show you a few techniques. - Tue Nov  3 18:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-Alright uhm... - Tue Nov  3 18:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: Y-You go after me. - Tue Nov  3 18:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: One technique I don't need to teach I guess...She's quite a speedy one too. - Tue Nov  3 18:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) would've manuevered himself around Momura after she launched her Dynamic Entry attack. Kyubishu wasn't aware of Lera's abilities but if she was the daughter of Violet that obviously meant something. Not to him, but maybe to other people considering that he didn't have much knowledge of people around the village, except for a few other people that he considered 'comrades' for the most part. But after he went toward the right side of Momura and attempted to strike her in the left cheek, his fist move at a rapid speed.* - Tue Nov  3 18:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) would've simply ducked down after Momura's kick was diverted toward his direction. After that he sprung up into the air and suddenly smirked as bones had manifested themselves out from his skin and into every possibly part of his body, consisting of his elbows, palms, knees, and shoulders. He came down toward Lera without any care in the world, this was the battle that he was looking for, a warm smile upon his face. He spun in mid-air, attempting to slash at Lera.* - Tue Nov  3 18:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) would've mostly likely been thrown out of the sky and toward the water, Kyubishu had been dazed for only a moment after the weapon had slammed into him. He recovered in the middle of the sky and begun to do a various amount of spins and flips before landing on the ground, next toward the water. "I love it! Yes!" He was an absolute monster when it came to fighting people and even though he might've phsically been hurt it was like he ignored it completely, shutting out the pain.

A small sprint was made toward her, cautious of the sword.* - Tue Nov  3 18:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: A battle maniac huh...well, I should probably tell you I'm actually an elementalist. Close combat is not my Forte....but...if you really want to play... - Tue Nov  3 18:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: I-I'll s-spar you...K-Kyubi. - Tue Nov  3 18:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Momura, attack her. Be aware of that sword! - Tue Nov  3 18:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-Attack.? - Tue Nov  3 18:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: D-Don't hold back..? - Tue Nov  3 18:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Don't. Hold. Back. - Tue Nov  3 18:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-Alright.. - Tue Nov  3 18:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) would've suddenly smirked after she had put him withim a dome, he knew Momura could've held out on her own. So he deactivated his Dance Of The Willow technique and rested, it took up some stamina if used for long.* - Tue Nov  3 18:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Lera let be handle it if me is close combat... - Tue Nov  3 18:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You can play with the other guy. - Tue Nov  3 19:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) thinks: C'mon, I need more. - Tue Nov  3 19:00:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) would've suddenly busted out the Earth Dome with his bones once again, present and displayed to everyone in the area. He finally recovered his stamina within a minute or two and whilst he was doing that it gave him enough time to examine and figure out that this supposed 'dome' had a weak spot that was placed within it, was it on purpose? Did she try to get him out of there knowing that he wasn't capable of actually breaking it with his current strength? It didn't matter to him.

Kyubishu's clothes were tattered up and ripped from all of his bones popping out from his body. He didn't waste any time at all, he sprinted directly toward Lera while he guard was down, attempting to strike at her with his palm, which meant the bone would've cut her quite deep if she didn't move.* - Tue Nov  3 19:09:00 2015

Not by one bit, he just simply raised another one of his bones up to the task in order to either block against Violet's attack or be cut off. And Kyubishu highly doubted that anyone abilities were good enough or having their sword strong enough to cut off his bones, because they were certainly strong as fuck. After he tried to block against the attack that came toward him, a counter-attack would've been due.

He attempted to throw a knee toward her and throw his left palm toward her, which both consisted of bones.* - Tue Nov  3 19:17:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) would've suddenly grabbed every scroll that was thrown toward him. Kyubishu had simply placed a few onto the ground and headed over toward a tree. He simply opened it and simply put his hed against a tree and begun to read a scroll, the title's name was 'Wire Bind' and it might've seemed quite easy from the name. But once he opened it, his mind became slightly fogged up and his mouth had dropped down.

It was an easy just but just required alot of effort, nothing he couldn't deal with.* - Tue Nov  3 19:44:51 2015
