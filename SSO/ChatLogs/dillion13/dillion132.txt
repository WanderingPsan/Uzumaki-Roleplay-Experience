<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) simply opened up the next scroll and looked for all the details, Kyubishu was sort've getting sick of all this easy work now. It was acceptable because of the fact that he was a beginner Genin but that still didn't change the fact that his techinques and skills were higher than your average for someone of this caliber, he was of Baen's clan and that person was supposedly legendary when it came to the battle-field. He was told not to care too much about your actual shinobi ranking because if you managed to win the battle it honestly didn't matter.

His eyes scanned the scroll once it was open and then he took a small gulp of his saliva, as it slowly ran down his throat like a smooth riverfall. A sweat drop had managed to smash into the concrete underneath his feet, managing all of those trashbags and carrying them back inbetween Kirigakure might've actually made him break a sweat.

But he wasn't worried about it at all. It seemed that he didn't need to venture out far from his village, all he had to do was look around the area and throughouly investigate the place so that he could've found this missing cat, a frown had appeared across his face as he actually realized that this was child's play compared to his actual fighting abilities.

A sudden bush had moved before Kyubishu's neck had snapped in that direction and his attention had been on full tunnel vision mode, he moved swiftly and acrobaticly toward the bush that had moved and leaped onto it, all he felt was the cold-hard ground as it turned out to actually be nothing but a regular old bush, smashing the ground with his fist out of frustration. Kirigakure didn't consist of much trees, but that didn't mean they didn't have any.

The Genin stood up and looked around, staring so that he could've focused his vision on everything and try to squint as hard as possible to make sure that he wouldn't miss anything. It wasn't hard to miss something that you're actually looking for. A sudden 'meowing' sound had came from a tree, and he approached it with caution. If he was too loud and made himself seem dangerous, then the cat would've most likely rank off. So using his special abilities, or Kekkei Genkai a bone had magically popped out of his palm.

Thrusting it foward and climbing himself up the tree, retriving the cat without an actual struggle. He headed back and return the pussy to it's rightful owner.* - Sat Oct 31 17:21:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Alright, start off. - Sat Oct 31 18:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had taken notice of The Mizukage suddenly appearing into the scene, Kyubishu wasn't a push-over at all. Arata's fighting style had been quite new to him but that didn't mean he couldn't defend himself against it, once the strike at came toward his sternum, a sudden push was made as he moved himself backward in order to move out of his opponent's reach. He didn't want to take the fight extremely serious at the start, because that might've made it dull and boring later on.

"Darn it." He said to himself before. But before he evaded the attack toward his chest, Kyubishu had attempted to quickly deflect Arata's attack toward his shoulders. A quick counter would've been made after he hopefully, defended against all of Arata's attacks. He moved foward and attempted to duck his head down and strike against his enemy's stomach.* - Sat Oct 31 19:06:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: I'm not worried, I just don't want to get wet again. - Sat Oct 31 19:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Like I said dont worry. - Sat Oct 31 19:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: I do not know why these two arent using the underground facility that we have available to us. - Sat Oct 31 19:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Because, one of them is an aggressive fool and the other doesn't seem to care. - Sat Oct 31 19:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Yeah. - Sat Oct 31 19:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Excuse me Jirun. - Sat Oct 31 19:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Creepy. - Sat Oct 31 19:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Indeed. - Sat Oct 31 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: Did someone just whisper to me? - Sat Oct 31 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) might've seemed like he was stuck in a corner when fighting against someone who could take people chakra point's and essentially make them completely useless, but that didn't make a difference to him. After he strike toward Arata's gut had been missed things had became more complicated for him because he was left in a wide open range for his opponent to strike at him and turn the table of the fight over toward his advantage, but it was Kyubishu's choice to test out this person's fighting prowess and abilities, so he wouldn't be complaining about getting attacked.

A smirk had appeared across the region of his face before a bone had intensely popped out of his shoulder. So it might've been quite impossible for Arata to avoid this, because the usage of his Kekkei Genkai didn't consist of using any chakra, it was specially Taijutsu in a way. So a thick and sharp bone had popped out of his shoulder.

Kyubishu had attempted to have the bone go through Arata's fingers and trap him in that position.* - Sat Oct 31 20:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Hey you idiots, don't try and kill each other. - Sat Oct 31 21:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) stared directly toward Arata after he jumped backward, it was time for him to take the offensive in this fight. His opponent was dripping with blood and that meant he couldn't use those fingers for his little attack once again, Kyubishu had dipped down and sprinted foward, he was moving at a little above average speed. His muscles would've tensed up and he gritted his teeth, his pupils had dialated and intensifyied before he became even more blood thirsty, he was a brute and loved to fight.

It was a thing of his, zipping through the ground in a zig-zag motion before allowing bones to come out of both his left and right palm, knees, and shoulders. Spinning in a rapid motion, after leaping into the air in order to try and slash up Arata's body, somebody needed to calm him down or he might've went out of control.* - Sat Oct 31 21:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) would've gritted his teeth after Arata had suddenly begun to spin in a circle and a large chakra sphere had formed around his opponent, Kyubishu's bones had suddenly grinded against the dome of chakra that was being forced out of Arata and into the atmosphere, seemingly he had actually lost this fight for once. It was just the mere fact that he couldn't withstand the amount of pressure that was coming down and then without a moment's notice he was tossed across the battlefield, spinning in a fluid flip before landing against the ground.

He managed to recover in the middle of the sky with excellent hang-time before coming down upon his feet, a small bruise was upon his shoulder but for the most part. All that really seemed to appear hurt, was his clothing, once again his hoodie was torn up amoung everything else, but he wasn't really physically hurt. That's why he might've been such a legendary fighter in the future.

Kyubishu had thrived off battle and loved to be hurt, he looked at pain like it was nothing, literally blocking it out from his system. A small theory some people actually thought about. If you tell yourself it doesn't hurt, does it actually NOT hurt?* - Sat Oct 31 21:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had eventually been protected by his bones that were around him, so the pile of rocks would've never physically touched him, but they did press up against his bones. Which were quite hard, more than anyone actually imagined. That didn't matter though, it was the fact that Jirun had attempted to interfere in his battle and it pissed him off because Kyubishu wanted to initate a sparing session with this person.

"What're you doing?"* - Sat Oct 31 21:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) couldn't do much about this. It would've taken atleast some effort in order to escape the rocks that were piled up against him, not much. But still that meant it gave his new opponent some time to perform another jutsu in order to try and restrain him, Kyubishu could've felt as his feet were suddenly descending down and becoming stiff in the mud river.* - Sat Oct 31 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Now stop this fucking stupid sparring nonsense... Can't even call it a spar. Stop your dumb fighting now. - Sat Oct 31 21:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Hehe. It's funny, because I asked you to do something about it. And you did. While my guard was down, real nice. - Sat Oct 31 21:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Now, mind your own buisness and get this shit off me. - Sat Oct 31 21:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) took his feet out the mud, as quick as possible. It took some effort, but after a minute or two he would've gotten himself out. His bones went back into their original position, which consisted of being inside of his body.* - Sat Oct 31 21:44:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) stepped foward and headed inside, he witnessed how Arata's body just layed there.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) simply manuevered against Momura's attack. He deflected the attack that was so obviously came for the side of his cheek, meanwhile his knee would've been raised and he attempted to strike it toward Momura's stomach in order to attempt to have them stunned for atleast a few seconds, hopefully it would've been effective.* - Sun Nov  1 16:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) stared directly toward Momura, Kyubishu had his advesary get back up. He would've awaited until his opponent had fully recovered and then he wasted absolutely no time, before zooming into battle with a smirk upon his face. Anyone that looked into his eyes could've told that he might've seemed like he was having fun, but it was actually quite boring to fight someone that couldn't even lay a scratch upon him. He was about average speed which meant his opponent needed to step in and run at him before he could fully reach.* - Sun Nov  1 16:56:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Huh? - Sun Nov  1 17:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) literally stopped when he was dashing directly toward Momura, a punch would've been landed upon his chest. The atmosphere around the area had changed once the first strike upon Kyubishu had landed and his head would've dropped down in order to cover his face. He was literally unaffected by the strike that his opponent had gave to him, gritting his teeth in anger and frustration that somebody couldn't actually give him the sastisfaction of knowing pain.

Kyubishu had attempted to grab onto Momura's wrist and squeeze it until his opponent couldn't move anymore. A rapid amount of punches were sent toward various places upon the boy's body, heading directly toward his face, stomach, face again, repeating this process.* - Sun Nov  1 17:06:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) would've released Momura and grasped onto Inouba, heading back.* - Sun Nov  1 17:19:47 2015
