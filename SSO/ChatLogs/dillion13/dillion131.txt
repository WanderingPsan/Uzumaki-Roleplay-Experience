<br><font color=green>*Natsu(Guest-1084507334) says: When can we begin?
<br><font color=yellow>*Herakuru(Dillion13) was one of this best Hyyuga in his clan, he was alway's training on his most famous Jyuuken Gentle fist stlye, one day he was hitting a log "Huff, Huff" Herakuru would say as he would begin to get dazed from all the training that he does, but he does not give it he keep's hitting it more and more until, 'SNAP!" The log had broken in half this had shown how strong Herakuru had become in the day's back then he could not even leave a mark on a log. Falling down he had begin to close his eye's falling off into the sleep. Thinking about the Main branch and the side branch of the Hyuuga clan.

He opened his eye's to find out that it was night, he was worried tha the missed his meeting. He had heard some rumbuling in the bushes he had looked around and claped his hand's together. 'Byukugan!" Herakuru had said. He looked around and had seen somoenes Charka. He then got into his Juuyken Gentle fist style.

The stance he had been training on all his life, well not all but most of the time. He used this stance in all of his fight's it would be able to take away you're use of Charka if it hit you. Herakuru threw a Paper bomb into the bushes where he had seen the man's Charka.

It had exlpoded and Herakuru watched as the man jumped up into the air. He was very weird looking, the man landed on the ground right infront of Herakuru, he did not waste any time the man tryed to hit him right in the face, but with his Gentle fist style it was a easy thing to dodge it.

He moved right under the attack hitting the man in the stomach trying to stop his Charka flow, hitting he Herakuru kept on going he would not stop he would hit him on the arm and the shoulder, then doing a 360 spin he come's back around and hit's the man with his palm.

Making him go flying. This was so eas for Herakuru but then he was caught off guard getting hit in the face he flew back, Herakuru was very injured and he was not able to move as fast as he could before, he knew now that this guy was a heavy hitter. Herakuru waited until the man had come closer.

Then putting one of his hand's down close to hit shoe's and the other one high up he then would get into his new found move stance, a Green circle would apprear right around him and Herakuru would begin to hit the man "2 hand's 4 hand's, 6 hand's, 8, hand's 16 hand's, 24 hand's, 32 hand's, Ahh!! 64 hand's!" Herakuru would say as he would hit the man with his palm making him go flying. The man was out cold or maybe even dead. Herakuru had realized tha this was just a test. To test his Gentle fist style.*

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) was surrounded once again, Kyubishu was getting tired and bored of these little bastards. They weren't even strong enough to be considered Shinobi within his eyes, because he had considered himself the highest of calibers when it came down to fighting against anybody. But even in a tight situation like this it wasn't that hard for him to get out of it alive, but he would have to use an effective jutsu that could have him move quickly enough to get out of his opponent's reach and try not to be attacked. The Dance of the Camellia would've done nicely in a time like this and a smirk had appeared across his face, quite big indeed.

It was the second of the five dances, the rest of them most likely weren't needed. But just to make sure he was gonna be prepared to use them if forced too, which was highly doubted. The thick black, untidy hair that rested upon his head would've been ruffled from the constant wind as the habitat was quite windy and the environment was open enough for an ambush like this once, Kyubishu was rusty and hadn't fought this many opponents at once within a long duration of time. But that wouldn't stop him from slaughtering them without remorse.

He was quite scrawny, but wasn't everyone who could manipulate their bone structure? Maybe. He hadn't found many people like him and that might've been a good thing. Because he liked to be unique, it made him feel like nobody else could manage up to him and even come close to his level. Kyubishu would've pushed up his left shoulder and modified his bone to have it come out of it's current position.

A tight grip was taken as he tugged at it and had it come out of his shoulder, and into his hand. It was a bone-shapped sword, his head would've dipped down as he zoomed foward, he then stabs chaotically and continuously which had his enemies confused and unable to do anything. Within a blinding moment, they were all upon the ground.* - Tue Oct 27 23:22:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) stared directly toward Zaen. His opponent was fast and agile, much faster than him if he could admit it to himself but before he was able to be struck by the enemies' intense fighting style a sudden outburst of bones would've shot out of his body, a grin had appeared across his face and even though he came directly at him with some serious striking prowress and speed it didn't matter to him, with the advantage of not having his opponent know his abilities, it was possible that he could've won with ease. He was going to perform The Dance Of The Willow, the first of his clan's techniques, even though they consisted of five and he didn't even know the rest.

Kyubishu had grown several long bone blades from his body, which were used as weapons against his opponent. So when Asso had recklessly charged into strike him a big surprise would've been found out as he most likely would've threw a punch directly into a bone, because Kyubishu had instantly pointed his elbow toward the strike that his enemy had made.

There isn't any set form for the Dance of the Willow.  Just like a willow that is shaken by the wind, the opponents attacks are simply parried and countered.  This dance form is incredibly acrobatic, using spins, charges, and long sweeping slashes to make the strikes more effective and to evade opponents' counter strikes. A small little grin had been plastered across his face, giving Asso a warning by only making sure that his knuckles had been hurt.

"You might want to watch out there, fella."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) wasn't actually shocked, Kyubishu didn't fear anything at this point. He hadn't been introduced to anything to actually -be- afraid. So when his new family member, Baen had struck and headed toward him in order to use him as a target for a demonstration with The Dance Of Camelia, his hoodie had been torn up with the strikes that came toward him. Even though he liked his appereance it would've only been a matter of time before the hoodie was torn up, because of their techniques that ran through their family.

But he didn't really didn't care at his point, a grin had came across his face. "I'm gonna make it, my title will be legendary and heard all across the nation. And I don't care who I have to go through to make it be actually a thing, but for now. I'm gonna go get a hair-cut. Where's the baber again?"* - Fri Oct 30 19:56:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Heh. - Fri Oct 30 20:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: You can have the first move. - Fri Oct 30 20:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) threw off his hoodie, he didn't want it getting anymore damaged than it already was, Kyubishu had hoped that he could've someday amounted to Baen and become a powerful shinobi like his family member had wanted him too. They were all related in a way and nobody even knew the origin of how this came to be, but it really didn't matter. He gritted his teeth after his hoodie had been tossed into the air and then a sudden grin had been rearranged across his face to the point of where his blood might've been boiling to fight an opponent who was much stronger than him.

Kyubishu couldn't remember the last time that he was truely outclassed by anyone. This might've actually occured for once, but he didn't mind. Losing a battle gave him more exprience and a better drive in order to become a better fight overall, he stepped foward and unleashed a sudden burst of speed. He wasn't honestly that fast because he focused more on his other abilities than actual speed.

But that didn't make him any weaker of a fighter, suddenly his skin had became open and a bone had popped out from almost every limb upon his body, which activated The Dance Of The Willow, which was very effective for just the first dance of their clan.

He leaped through the air, spinning in a thirty sixty motion in order to try and come down and slash at Baen's openings.* - Fri Oct 30 20:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had been rapidly spinning after making contact with Baen, a smile was written all across his face after he had thought that victory was afoot. But he was obviously mistaken after Baen was speaking with such confidence, to the point of where Kyubishu had knew things weren't going to go his way, a sudden immense amount of pain would've snuck up upon him after he was engulfed in a torrent amount of flames. Not only did his spinning technique work, it was to the point of where it had left him open and given his opponent enough time to strike at him.

His attack would've been stopped before he withdrew himself in the opposite direction, bruises were all across his body but it seemed like he obviously ignored the pain. That was the one thing that nobody could've dominated him in was taking all the brute of pain, he was going become legendary if it was the last thing he could've done. A small smirk had appeared across his face after he was burnt and taken back toward his previous position.

"So, you must've done something to stop my attack, eh? Try this on for size." He wasn't going to stop anymore. After he rushed in his knee would've been raised and sent foward so that the length of the bone would've eventually reached Baen as he attempted to give a rapid swipe with all his bones, not stopping.* - Fri Oct 30 20:30:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) threw himself out of the way, he wasn't the one who fought against anybody just because. But when he was attacked? It gave him an excuse to fight and that meant he could've enjoyed it. Kyubishu was somebody who didn't go down until somebody had forced him too and with a little trick like that it wasn't going to be so easy, after evading the technique of Kana he would've simply threw off his hoodie and awaited for her next technique. It was just a simple method of waiting out his opponent and having her waste  up chakra.

Kyubishu didn't really use any chakra when he used his techniques because they simply relied on his techniques, which consisted of his Kekkei Genkai which most people called it. Stepping foward after he evaded the attack, considering that she was quite far from him and he was quite flexable and acrobatic.* - Sat Oct 31 02:32:44 2015

"I'm sorry if I was rude or offended you in any way." A small warm smile was given toward him, this can be seen on his profile picture.* - Sat Oct 31 04:44:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) had become faster and stronger since their previous fight, Kyubishu was becoming more adapted to his opponent's fighting style. It was obvious that Zaen wasn't going to start out this spar with anything big like their dances which were very adept compared to most other things out in the world of shinobi, but after the sweep had came toward his lower portion and sudden uptick of pressure was taken directly at his feet. He pushed up off the ground and glided into the air, having quite the hang-time, staying the air for about a few seconds.

Kyubishu would've suddenly threw his right foot foward at Zaen's face with some impact behind it in order to try and strike and send him further away from him, so he could land on the ground and deal some damage.* - Sat Oct 31 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) might've been dropping down at an ascended rate, but that doesn't mean he was just defenseless when coming out of the sky. In order to surprise his opponent he would've used the advantage and the usage of the upper-hand in order to catch Zaen by his neck and most likely end this battle without it even starting. The attack had came toward him and he could've easily taken it without any type of actual damage coming through his body, considering that Kyubishu was an extremely bad brute and could take most of the damage unless it caused him to bleed without remorse.

But his knees would've been raised as he dropped down out of the sky, crouching in mid-air and having all of his bones coming from his body. They shot out from his palms, knees, and elbows, also his shoulders. If Zaen continued to try and strike him then his foot would've been bleeding at the end of everything.* - Sat Oct 31 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) was getting more into the battle after he managed to land an attack against Zaen, which gave him the upper-hand. Even if he was gonna get attacked in the long run it wouldn't mean much, because Kyubishu could've taken a good amount of attacks. The only way that he was actually going down is he didn't treat an injury that was bad and allowed himself ot bleed out, which would've eventually ended up in his own death. After his opponent had tried to strike him in the shoulder and mid-section of his body, Kyubishu had raised his knee in order to block against the first order of strikes that came at his mid-section and raised his right palm in order to block against the shoulder attack.

A sudden thrust was made directly toward Zaen's chest in order to try and strike him and impale him directly through the chest, he would've been fine. Hopefully if the attack landed, but his head had leaped foward in order to try and have it smash against Zaen's nose and make him bleed, eventually. So a multiple amount of attacks were heading out against his sibiling.* - Sat Oct 31 05:45:36 2015
