<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiji(Prehensile Tendrils) slides into a basic stance for close rang attacks. His bow is held out vertically of course as his right rises up to his quiver to grab an arrow. He pulls the long arrow from the quiver, it was your basic wooden arrow. He would bring it to his bow adjusting it so the back end is against the string of the bow and his thumb, pointer and middle finger are used to hold the arrow in place. He puls back on string as well gliding the arrow back with it creating the needed power to send such a object or well weapon.

He takes aim of his traget or tries to take the best aim he could. (lacks focus or sight perk.) Once he found his mark he inhales and holds his breath waiting slightly before he would make his fingers loosen there grip on the arrow/string. Now a arrow is cutting threw the air aiming to hit Bernadotte in the shoulder or knee. 

Keiji readies another arrow as soon as the firs tone is sent out.

He nothing at all not one person was standing and watching. so he steps back and would bring his right hand up to his mouth biting his thumb. He winces a little from the pain before he brings his hands together forming a chain of hand seals. He crouches down press his hand on the ground. 

"Summoning jutsu"He thought. A small cloud of smoke appears then vades out allowing for Keiji to set his eyes on a small brown beaver. "The beaver looks up at Keiji wondering what it needed to do.

"Listen up I want you to go to far left corner and dig a whole into flooring. Then work your way threw the wall make a whole the size of me that I could crawl threw. Be careful and listen closely. I don't want to get caught."He whispers to his pet. The beaver rushes off to left corner and begant o use it powerful teeth and claws to dig a whole into te wall. The size of a large rat hole, once tis was done he works carefuly and swiftly to make that hole his master needs. Making sure not to make the hole behind then weak part of the wall so his master could  break threw when it ws done as well keep any one ells from knowing.

"This is plan A"He thought. As he walks over to left corner of roomr emoving his jacket tossing it over hole the summoning made before taking a seat on the ground leaning his back against the wall. This to hids the whole near the base of the wall.* - Wed Oct 14 04:41:10 2015

It seems there still was no one there but just to make sure he stands up and walks over to it making sure to see what was going on downt he halls. It seems like nothing was going on so the young male quickly walks back over tot he corner he was at and taps the back of his hand on the wall. It sounded hollowe. This made him smile a little. He then moves his jacket and would tap his hand on the ground a little. A little furry head pops out of the hole the animal seems tired and needs rest but also seems happy.

"Good job, go home get some rest."He said to the summoning allowing it to return home. Keiji pants a little his chakra really took abeating there. Though now it was time for him to scram. He places his jacket on and quickly goes threw a chain of hand seals. Creating a basic clone of him elf that he would have stand near the cell door.

Once that was done hewould puntch the wall ripping the soft wall off. Behind all that was just a hole. He smiles a little seeing that the hole wasjust as big as him so he could crawl threw it. He waisting no time he quickly moves to crawl threw the wall and makes his ecape out of the prison. Blinking a little as he reaches the outside world with a smile. 

Once he was out he quickly forms some more hand seals masking him self as your normal village citizen. Hopefully making a clean ecape out of the area that he may be able to hide and lay low for a few.* - Wed Oct 14 19:20:06 2015

He taks a moment to stop inhaling and exhaling into a huff before he brought his hand up to his mouth biting his thumb. Some of flesh on his humb is split causing blood to ooze on out of the cut. As the blood is oozing out, Keji forms a few hand seals before pressing his hand on the ground. A small smoke cloud appears then vades away allowing for him to see a small little brown beaver.

"I'll leave it to you to make me a bow. I'll gather the string for just prep the bow make sure the wood is strong. As well make some arrows for me."He said to the beaver. The animal would then walk off to chew down a few smallt rees of strong wood and such. It wouldn't be all that unnormal to see a animal at work this is why he chose to use it. 

"Now to get my wire."He thought before walking off.

"Where is it."He thought.

Though on other side of the village his summoning was working hard to make the bow and a few sticks for the arrows. Of course the animle doesn't just make them out in open no it works fast but would hide each object it makes under leaves. Leaving small markers for his master to find so he knew where to look.* - Wed Oct 14 20:16:25 2015

In few mintuse of walking he would have met up with his beaver. The animal shows him the little stock pile of stuf fit made. It had made a quivers woth of arrows and a bow. All Keiji had to do was finish the bow up a little and store his arrows away. Wich he quickly moves to do. Placing the needed string for the bow on it as well stuffing the arrows into his quiver then removing his robe. So he could place his gear on such as, his quiver onhi sback and the bow.He hten puts the robe back on it hides the object a tad but not as great as he would want.

holts his actions to leave, turning his head so he could look at the female that greated him. If she even cared about the traveler that much she could tell he was very tired looking in face. He had black circles around his eyes almost and his eye lids are heavey. His hair is casted over with dirt and dust, so are his cheeks and chin. His robe shows signs of being dirty, the colar has a line around it that is brown from sweat.

"This village.. My mind must still be feeling te effects of that genjutsu."He thought. He would then slight shake his head side to side. Remaining quiet but letting the mizukage know he needs nothing.* - Thu Oct 15 21:51:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiji(Prehensile Tendrils) pins a target to a random tree then steps back. He quickly removes his robe tossing it to side for it was junk. Once that was done he grabs his bow holding it tihgtly with his left hand as his right motions to grab to a arrow from his quiver. He preps the arrow so he was ready to fire. He then takes aim looking at the target which wasn't hard sense he was close to it. About ten to twelve feet away form the tree with the target. Once he had set his mark on the balls eye of the target he draws back the arrow some more before releasing it letting it go flying threw the air. Quickly the arrow finds its mark hitting the balls eye. With that Keiji takes a few stesp backwards now fifteen feet from the target. 

"Let's try to hit the same spot."He thought again preping the arrow as he sets his sights on the target. Making his mark which was the bulls eye of the target he would then fully draw bakc the arrow and release letting it fly threw the air. But it hits just outside of the bulls eye. Just on the edge of the bulls eye. 

"Oh this getting tricky"He thought before taking a few more fee tback. Making it twenty feet back from the target.* - Thu Oct 15 23:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiji(Prehensile Tendrils) Narrows his eyes down on the target. Even being twenty feet away form it it wans't hard to see from that distance. So his right arm mvoes up to grab a arrow. He calmly takes the time to prep and set the bow with the arrow. He inhales and then exhales as he slide sinto a simple stance for mid range attacks. "One, two, three.."he counts in his head, each number that he thought he would pullt he arrow back. As he reached three he would release allowing for it to go flying threw the air. It quickly cuts threw the air with ease before it stabs into the target. But its just outside the rim of the bulls eye it seems the more he went back the harder it got. 

"If I can't do it at this distance then I'll try it faarther back."He thought taking a few good steps back to make it a good thirty five feet away from the target. He again  preps hs bow making sure to have his arrow ready as he slide sinto a stnace for long distances attacks. He waits calmly breathing, calmly making sure he has a feel for the shot. "Let it rip!"He thought releasing the arrow letting it fly threw the air quickly.

The wind pushes against the wooden made arrrow a lot as well his rookie levle in using a bow the arrow finds a mark. One inch below the bulls eye, it seems doing a staight on aim for the target was a bad idea. "Might need to giv eit a ark so it goes farther."He thought.* - Fri Oct 16 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiji(Prehensile Tendrils) Inhales then exhales into a huff. He had stared at his target for some time now trying to hone his eye sight a little. His focus was on nothing but that target, and he was ready to try and aim for the bulls eye again. So much that his hands were getting a tad sweaty and his mouth was building up saliva as if he could just taste it. His right hand moves up to withdraw a arrow from his quiver. He then preps his bow holding the arrow in place with just three fingers and his strenght in his hands. He pulls the arrow back a little and holds up his bow in a slight arch. "If the arrow arches I'm sure ot'll hit the bulls eye."He thought before he let his grip on the arrow loosen letting it fly out threw the air. The arrow cuts trhew the wind quickly at first it heads up in a ankle as it heads out farther it arches down a bit still on target with the mark. Soon that arrow hits the target but is a inch above the bulls eye.

"It seems It didn't hit. Then I'll just try sometihng ells."He thought as he quiicly moves to fire off several arrows as fast as he good. Back to back he fires off arrrows each on flying threw the arrow. All of them aim at the target in different ways. Six arros in total this was when he stsops and huffs a little starting ot break a sweat. "Lets see if they hit."He thought. He wtches closely then shakes his head a little. All of the arros end up a inch or a half inch away form the bulls eye. 

"This is tricky. But can be done. Another round of six."He thought. Once again his right hand mvoes quick to grab arrow form his quive so he could fire it off. An arrow after another untill he counted six that he had fired out. He pants a little feeling the burn in his right arm. As well his wrists becoming a tad tired. He also could use some sleep but he could hold off a little longer. "Come on hit the bulls eye!"He thought watching as each arrow quickly hits th e mark. The fire five miss the bulls eye target but th elast on hits right on the line of th ebulls eye.

"Hmm, did it hit."He thought as he lets his arms come to his side. His bow is next to his side as he walks forward. Making his way to the tree, so he could get a better look. He kind of sighs seeing that the arrow didn't make it dead center of the bulls eye. He just shrugs his shoulders before cleaning up his training area packing up all his stuff and then placing his robe back on.

"Need to find a place to rest."He thought.* - Fri Oct 16 03:11:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiji(Prehensile Tendrils) thinks: I could pick up a side job here. - Fri Oct 16 21:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiji(Prehensile Tendrils) Quickly takes his robes off tossing those dirty rags to the ground so he could graps his bow in his left hand. His right hand reaches up to take a arrow from his quiver. He stares at the target taking a mental picture of it before he turns and walks a few feet away. Getting a good thirty five feet away from the target so he had a challenge in hitting the bulls eye. Once that was all set he turns around facing the target and slides int a basic stance for long distnace shots. He readies the bow with the arrow and starts to take aim. He is careful to take his time making sure to read the wind directtion. "Once again six arrows as fast as I can.. All must hit the bulls eye."He thought.

He would then release his first arrow letting it quickly fly threw the air. Once that arrow was released his right hand reaches back to grab the another arrow prepping it then luanching it. He repeats that step four more times sending a total of six arros out torwards the target. Each on cutting wind currents in half quickly so they could reach the target faster. "come on.."He thought watching closely and carefully. 

Soont eh sound of the target being pelted with arrows could hard and the sound of splitting could be heard as well. He smirks a little shaking his head. "Only four arrows hit the Bulls eye."He thought. The rest hit inches from it this means he was not ready to stop training today no he must get all six. So once again he readies his bow and arrow taking aim. He inhales then exhales softly taking his aim before releasing the arrow letting it swore threw the air. He repeats the prosses of shooting the arrows over about five times making it a total fo six. He watches carefully but would again shake his head. As the sound of arrows pelting the target could be heard. 

"Only three hit the bulls eye."He thought, He blinks his eyes as well inhaling and exhaling to help him stay calm and collect. He agian moves to ready his bow and arrow his right hand reaching to grab the arrow form his quiver. "I'll run out of arrows soon"He thought before he luanche dout six arrows trying to shoot them out as fast as he could. One after another over and over untill he counted six arrows going out torwards the target.

He watchs them swore threw the air kind of grindind his teeth sid eto side as he really wants to see them all hit. Again the sound of arrows pelting the target was heard but only two hit it. He sighs now feeling a tad but upset but he channels that emotion to his osul to win. His pashiton to complete his training was strong. "Again!"He thought quuickly trying to shoot out six arrows as fast as he could panting afterwards dot o him using a lot of stamina as he really was trying to mvoe supper fast. "Come on...Yes, yes, yes, nd no!"He thought as he saw only three arrows hit the target. Bits of the target and others he had shot into break and fall down from the other arrows hitting them and it hard. 

Agian he inhales then exhales getting his bowa nd arrow ready taking aim carefuly. "Here they come"He thought again releasing the arrow then five after that one as quickly as he could. He feels a bit of sweat drip downt he sid eof his face this was really some hard work. He trys to keep his focus as well try to keep a good eye on the targets and arrow. "Come on."He thought watching closely before closing his eyes as the sound of arrows hit the target. When he opens his eyes he can see only two arrows he shot hit the buls eye. "Wow, I know I can do better"He thought.

"Again I shall do it again!"He thought. once more focusing on the target making his mark. He wants all six to hit that durn bulls eye. If he can't get it now then he would rather drop dead before stopping untill he does it. He quickly readies his first arrow shootin git out then another, and four more after that. Again a total of six all heading out quickly to pelt into the target. "Come on hit it."He thought. But only three hit it this time, but Keiji wasn't going to loose it no he just readies another round.

"I am going to complete this I swear."He thought before agin send out six arrows he felt his quiver becoming very light at this point as he was using a good amount of arrows for this training. "I don't care I can make more."He thought watching closely as the arrows got closer to the target. But it seems a larget gust of wind come accrost he path of his arrows throwing most off. so only one hits the target. He shakes his hea dbefore he readies another arrow.

"I have a few more left before I have to get more."He thought as he would send out the next six shots. Making sure to count for the wind this time hopefully he could complete his goal this time. "NO!"He thinks before walking around incircle pacing back and forth. Only two arrows hit this time he couldn't belive his eyes. Herubs his right hand threw his hair a little before getting bakc into his stnace taking aim and sending out another six." GO! Make it !"He thought watching the arrows closely he wants it so much that her grinds his teeth so hard his gums start to bleed a little. His eyes bcome blood shot as he really wants it to hit the target all six.

"DO it!"he thinks, He then just roars out loudly as only one arrow hit the target this time. He quickly reaches to lod up a bit more but he felt nothing. "What!"He said tunring to look over his shoulder the quiver was empty."Damn it."He thought he then heard the sound of crumbling and falling and looks at the target. It was so beat up that it cracks up and fail off the tree landing on the ground destoryed. "DAMN IT!"He thought before sighing ruffly. He places his bow on his shoulder and walks to clean up his mess before heading out of the training area he was in. Or wellt he area he was training in.* - Fri Oct 16 23:22:27 2015

"I must have took a long nap."He thought as he sat up then carefuly stood up dusting off his dirty robes. He would opens his mouth just a little inhaling a she yawns then exhalings soflty finishing the yawn. "Got more work I need to do. "He thought before turning and walking off. "But I need my space."He thought.* - Sat Oct 17 00:42:40 2015
