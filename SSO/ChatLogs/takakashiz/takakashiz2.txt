<br><font color=yellow>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) Hi
*
<br><font color=yellow>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) stands there facing her two genin. She lowers her body just a bit. Cheren breathes in and out deeply, "First of all..You want to breathe...Quite deeply...It is to center yourself...And get in the mindset of the wind.." She says as she focuses her chakra through her body, causing it to flow with perfect balance.

"Then...You want to lower your body..Ever so slightly...Stop your heartbeat from escalating...Then..This is the most important part, keep your hand on your sword theeen." She says, with a lightning quick movement that was entirely too fast to be seen, she draws her blade, cuts a Z in the air, and returns it.*
<br><font color=teal>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) whispers: [why is usui here if he cant rp ._.]
<br><font color=yellow>*Sozen(Radori3) lol*
<br><font color=yellow>*Kurina(Punkamainia) would watch as Usui charged at her with his tanto drawn. For now, she didn't need her tanto nor shuriken. But all she needed was a kunai. As Usui attempted to strike her at her chest, Kurina simply ducked, and sent a low sweep with her foot at Usui legs in an attempt to trip him, and send him to the floor.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) nodded as he uncrossed his arms at last, his wrist hovering over the hilt of his blade as he first carefully observed the teachings of the positioning. His eyes slowly and deliberately took in her form, and perhaps stared a bit too hard though it shouldn't have been blatantly obvious. He blinked and shook his head slightly, narrowing his eyes slightly as he cursed quietly...

"Focus....There is a task at hand." Sanada murmured, closing his eyes briefly as he pictured the form and positioning.

(2)

Sanada reopened his eyes as he spread his feet out slightly, one foot slightly forward as his hand rested lightly on his sheathe. His violet eyes seemingly glowed in the sunlight as a slight breeze echoed across the training area, his feet sliding silently across the tiles. His eyebrows were furrowed in concentration, exhaling quietly as he wondered if his form was correct.. His hand flew towards his blade after crouching slightly managing to unsheathe the blade but getting it stuck near the top, sighing dishearteningly as he resheathed it... 

"Maybe this kind of sword is a no-go for me...But I cant give up yet.." Sanada murmured, reassuming the position and trying repeatedly, no where near the Raikages speed.*
<br><font color=green>*Akasen, Nero(OmniKage) says: (Ah so tedious lol)
<br><font color=teal>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) whispers: And hes here becuase...ugh idk hes a br that I picked up by accident....I -really- dont like Brs....Idk why ...They ruined PWO for me )
<br><font color=green>*Akasen, Nero(OmniKage) says: (so we gotta do 2 rps)
<br><font color=teal>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) whispers: [u should srsly get rid of him o.o]
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( yeah Nero )
<br><font color=yellow>*Usui(Esteban16) goes flying  back so he make a strategic mve and stop the attack, usui step n the floor*i need a plan*usui runs again but this time he make another move, after reach kurina he make  little jump usui fall at the floor and then use hes tanto gain in kurin back*
<br><font color=teal>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) whispers: ( Im thinking about just getting him killed)
<br><font color=teal>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) whispers: [just tell him that one of us has to leave]
<br><font color=green>*Usui(Esteban16) says: (you return?)
<br><font color=green>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) says: [lemem relog to save
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Alrighty...
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: All of you..Gather.
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: I have a very important mission...
<br><font color=green>*Usui(Esteban16) says: O.O
<br><font color=green>*Usui(Esteban16) says: (AND THE JUTSUS?)
<br><font color=yellow>*Kurina(Punkamainia) would watch as Usui fell back to dodge her move. Kurina sighed, and watched as Usui charged again, jumping over her and attempting to slash her at her back. Kurina would turn around, carefully watching Usui, and using her kunai to block Usui's tanto attack. A metal clashing sound would emit from the kunai and the tanto once they connected. She would then take her right hand and attempt to grab Usui's arm and pull him in. If he was pulled in, she would deliver a kick to his gut, to send him back. She then heard Cheren-Sensei. Forgetting about the spar, she gathered 'round, and listened.*
<br><font color=green>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) says: [i wonder what gins doing >.>
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( youll get them later )
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Alright....
<br><font color=green>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) says: [think hes iconnin
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: I want to pick one of you...To go capture someone for me...
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Hmm...I want it to be a male..This person has a -huge- charm over females...
<br><font color=green>*Usui(Esteban16) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Usui(Esteban16) says: (loll)
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: And he has to be a ninjutsu user...If you get close to him..He might pull you in...Hmm...
<br><font color=green>*Usui(Esteban16) says: hmm..
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: There's only one of you like that here...
<br><font color=green>*Usui(Esteban16) says: o.o
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: So...Usui..It's up to you....
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: I need you to go to Kirigakure no Sato...And capture the Mizukage...
<br><font color=green>*Usui(Esteban16) says: o.o!
<br><font color=green>*Usui(Esteban16) says: (wtf?)
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: The mizukage...Is a baby...
<br><font color=green>*Usui(Esteban16) says: o-o-ok my lord!
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Well...He's the size of a baby.
<br><font color=green>*Usui(Esteban16) says: (realy or you are oking??)
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( srs. Hes a chibi )
<br><font color=yellow>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) put his hands in his pockets, an eyebrow slightly raised though he didn't question her decision to implement Usui. However, Sanada doubted that he would be successful, but then again he had been proven wrong before...*
<br><font color=green>*Usui(Esteban16) says: (oh..)
<br><font color=yellow>*Akasen, Nero(OmniKage) yawns as he watched Cheren stand before Sanada and himself. His eyes wandering Lazily around the arena as the Raikage began to perform the demonstration. This was a technique that Nero had read about during his younger years during his time in the land of iron, something he would be required to learn should he wish to call himself a samurai. Once Cheren completed her demonstration, Nero would lower his body slightly while inhaling sharply. "Center myself" he would think aloud. His breathing continued at a light pace, the young samurai's concentration deepening.

(2)

Spreading his legs slightly, Nero would stand upon the tips of his toes; his hand hovering slightly over the hilt of his katana. Yawning slightly, Nero would retain his calm demeanor as he gripped his blade's hilt, releasing it from its sheathe at a slow pace. His blade purposely lacked speed however, so that he may gain a mental grip on the motions this technique required, something he would need if he wished to use it instantaneously as Cheren had done previously.*
<br><font color=green>*Akasen, Nero(OmniKage) says: (Lazy rps are lazy)
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: So....Would you be willing to do it?
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Go and capture this baby kage?
<br><font color=green>*Usui(Esteban16) says: Yeah!
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Good!
<br><font color=green>*Usui(Esteban16) says: (i ahve to grab him or is onlyrp?)
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: When you return...I will reward you...With a new rank...
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( Go rp with .... )
<br><font color=green>*Usui(Esteban16) says: (who is that  baby i have to make that npc i my rp?)
<br><font color=green>*Usui(Esteban16) says: (in*

<br><font color=green>*Usui(Esteban16) says: good luck uys with the training...
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( Actually walk to Kirigakure )
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( You have to go there. )
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( Get alister )
<br><font color=green>*Usui(Esteban16) says: (where is that?)
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( bring him here. RPly )
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( just go right )
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( wait.. tf )

<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( LOL go find him )
<br><font color=teal>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) whispers: [and so we began a three man genin squad.]
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( cut him head off :D )
<br><font color=green>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) says: [Suicide misson ftw.]
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Alrighty...Since we'll never be seeing him again...I can train the three of you that I like....
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Hmm...What shall I teach you first....
<br><font color=green>*Kurina(Punkamainia) says: ((ROFLMAO!!))
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Hmmm.....
<br><font color=green>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) says: I was wondering why you sent him of all people..*sigh* That's somewhat cruel.
<br><font color=green>*Akasen, Nero(OmniKage) says: Why lie to him?
<br><font color=green>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) says: [we were plottin while u fought him and we saw his rps
<br><font color=green>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) says: [XDD]
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Eh, cruel is the world Sanada...You'll learn that.
<br><font color=green>*Kurina(Punkamainia) says: ((Oh Wyn, you bastard, lulz))
<br><font color=green>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) says: Hopefully not in the same manner.
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Oh no...No need for that.
<br><font color=green>*Kurina(Punkamainia) says: ((I know you guys did.))
<br><font color=green>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) says: [xD]
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: *Usui dashes forward.Attempting to stab him.*)
(*Usui truns and kick him*

(*Usui dodges and Impales him through the heart.*)

<br><font color=green>*Kurina(Punkamainia) says: ((That's why I stood close to Wyn, so his Rps could be seen.))
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( LMAO OMG XDDDD )

<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( learn* )

<br><font color=green>*Kurina(Punkamainia) says: ((I'M A PSYCHIC BITCH. HELL YEAH!! xD.))
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( x3 )
<br><font color=green>*Kurina(Punkamainia) says: Anything.
<br><font color=green>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) says: I don't really care to be honest.
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Hmm...
<br><font color=green>*Kurina(Punkamainia) says: Y u no don'ts ask questions??
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Alrighty...Keep training with your sword..
<br><font color=green>*Kurina(Punkamainia) says: ((MISCHAN, LOL))
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Do the technique I showed you...Come with me Kurina..
<br><font color=green>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) says: B-
<br><font color=green>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) says: . . . .*sigh*
<br><font color=green>*Kurina(Punkamainia) says: No, I don't know, M'Lady.
<br><font color=yellow>*Kurina(Punkamainia) would take the Chakra Paper. She focused on it, rushing chakra to her hands, as the chakra transferred to the paper from there. Kurina then watched as the paper split into two pieces of paper. She showed it to Cheren-Sensei, "What's that supposed to be?"*
<br><font color=yellow>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) sighed as he went into a crouched position once more, his eyes narrowing as he closed them shut. He exhaled silently as the wind blew across the field, his legs sliding against the smooth tiled surface as his feet glided. He reopened his eyes, quickly drawing the blade from its sheathe and making a vertical then horizontal sweep before just as quickly sheathing the blade in a fluid motion as he stared at his sword...

"I..I think i know what to do now.." Sanada whispered, gripping his katana. 

2)

Sanada repeated this motion multiple times as his wrists and arms began to follow the motions much more quickly, his eyes not even having to hover over the sheathe as he withdrew and resheathed his blade. He felt like he could do this thing all day and the fact that he was becoming successful at the task at hand caused him to feel an intense initiative. 
"I have to continually push myself to the limits.." Sanada thought as he began moving around as he attempted to commence the motions, spinning quickly and then proceeding to undergo the Iai technique, finding it much harder to do though it gave him another challenge to overcome. He glanced over towards Nero and frowned slightly, refusing to be outdone by someone such as him. His claims of his 'ancestors' had irked Sanada and he would prove to him that true swordsmen didn't have to be born into a certain bloodline to become proficient in their profession...

<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: (*Uchiah, Kagami IV sits on the ground, legs crossed, not entirely sure how this meditation thing worked. "Full state of understanding... I understand how boring this is going to be." Katsu whispered to himself, putting his hands together to form the tiger seal. That was common for most shinobi, some even used it to regain lost chakra at a subtle rate. In addition Katsu closed his eyes, trying to wander off to a mental state of solitude. "Full state of understanding.. Do I have to understand myself?..Or the element...Possibly both?"

Katsu fought the urge to scratch the back of his head. This meditating stuff was quite the difficult task. Especially for someone as impatient as he was. "Well I understand myself... As confusing as I am.. But what is Katon?.. What is Fire?" he wondered. "Fire can't truely be controlled can it?.. Even when we manipulate it into jutsus..It can still hurt us cause it isn't truely, 'Ours'... Hmmm.. Katon is the element of not being controlled. The chaotic portion of mother nature... The power to destroy"

Katsu created a mobile image of himself. Walking around the dark abyss he considered to be his mind. It was empty, quiet. Within the next few steps, he noticed a change. There was something on the ground. He looked under himself, there was ripples, indicating the substance to be that of a liquid. "Water?.." he questioned. But there was a flash of light, which temporarily blinded him. "W-..What is this?" Katsu asked, instinctively covering his face, yet it had no meaning, for he was still blind. The light faded however, allowing Katsu to regain his vision, yet the sight he saw made him wish he had lost it permanetly. Around him was a field of flames, towering higher then that of the hokage mansion.

//The flames quickly spread. Closing into Katsu's location.

"T-..This isn't water...It's oil!" he realized, moments before being engulfed by flames. It was in his head, yet the pain felt real. His skin was scorching hot, and his hair lit like that of a match, reaching down to cover his face. "Ahhgg!.. This pain... Why does it feel real when this is just my imagination!?.." he screamed.
Katsu closed his fist, bending his knees with a forward lean. "Control the flame that controls me... Control the flames that control me... Control the flames that control me!" he kept repeating. With each repition the flames receeded into his body, until it was just a small manifestation of Katsu's inner flame. The pain vanished, almost as if it was never there.

Upon exiting his meditative state, he exhaled heavily. Beads of sweat ran down his face, his shirt and jacket already soaked. "Man.. This isn't going to be very easy..."*)

<br><font color=yellow>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) sighed as he continued his practicing, though he ended up panting as he had both his hands resting on his knees. "Tch...I'm making progress but...this just feels...odd.." Sanada murmured, wiping his forehead as he laid on his back and stared upwards. His violet eyes travelled across the crystalline blue sky as he closed his eyes, sitting up after lying down for 10 minutes. He had been contemplating on what motivated him to become a shinobi, and what his future held....He kept his eyes closed, obviously concerned that he still hadn't found an answer...

2)

Sanada eventually reopened his eyes, slowly getting up and brushing himself off, stretching his muscles as he looked around and walked off the field...

"Alright..time for some good ol training on my own..I can't depend on people to help me advance if im not willing to do so myself.." Sanada murmured, headed towards the exit point to sneak out before stopping. He sniffed himself and blinked, wrinkling his nose...

"After a shower that is...." Sanada muttered, running forward as he jumped down a rock cliff, sliding on the gravel and motionless rocks as he sought to quickly get to his destination, unaware of the dangereous path he was taking.

3) 

Unknown to Sanada he was going to a cliff known for frequent mudslides and loose boulders flying down, finding out all too late when he flipped in the air and proceeded to land. His eyes shot out wide as he felt his feet sliding quickly forward, the momentum slamming his back against the harsh rocky, causing him to wince considerably as he began falling downhill, being brutally assualted by sharp, flat, dull, and simply blunt rocks and stone.  
He curled into a ball and tucked his hands over his head, bruises and cuts littering his body as he came to a halt at the bottom of the perilous journey, lying motionless as pebbles rained down over him, as if in mockery....Then there was..nothing..

<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( wut? )
<br><font color=yellow>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) stirred slowly as he groaned, cursing quietly as he shakely stood up and looked around, sighing.. He slowly shuffled his way to his home where he ran hot water, examining his body carefully as he inspected himself in the mirror after removing his top attire..
His body was marred by cuts and bruises all over, but nothing serious seemed to have been scarred into him luckily. He stared down at his bruised body and figured himself lucky that he was able to walk at all, making a fist slowly...

"Huh...I guess i got lucky.." Sanada thought, turning the water off as he removed his clothing and took a long, well needed rest in the tub as his body relaxed and healed.

5) The next few days after the incident Sanada was set and ready to proceed with his original plan, walking casually towards the village gate with his hands within his pockets. His eyes glanced around slowly, trying to look inconspicuous as he neared the village exit. He hadn't asked for permisson to leave as of yet, but he had been snooping around village shops and food areas to discover that a band of bandits and thugs were ransacking wayward travellers near his village. His tanto placed on his back as he strode forward with an outward confidence, Sanada exited the area to pursue the hunt although nervousness crept in around his gut with each step..

6) Sanada rested on a tree branch in a crouched position, his black shoes freshly cleaned as were his clothes. He had marked down the areas where the attacks were most frequented and came to the conclusion that the small band of jerks would arrive shortly if a caravan or merchant happened to come by...and sure enough it did. A wagon being dragged by a horse held important resources to the village, travelling steadily down the hidden path leading towards the village. Sanada watched it carefully, his features and body hidden in the trees as his eyes cast the faintest of glimmers. He stalked the caravan for a few miles when the bandits had decided to strike.... They swarmed from the undergrowth around the area, approxmiately 4 of the thugs surrounding the caravan, each brandishing a sword, spear, kunai, and battle axe in the respective order.   

Sanada watched in horror before shaking his head, his eyes narrowing as he produced a two kunai....   
"It's time for me to make a name for myself...and for these bandits to learn their lesson with theft of stolen goods.."

<br><font color=green>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) says: [one more ar pee -nod nod-
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( lol kay )
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( bai )
<br><font color=green>*Kurina(Punkamainia) says: ((Bai.))
<br><font color=green>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) says: ]later
<br><font color=yellow>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) attached exploding tags to the two kunai he held, observing his targets who seemed to be oblivious to his precense. He smirked as he took in the sight of two frail looking bandits, who appeared to have been malnourished. His smirk faltered as he noticed the other two, both of them seemingly well muscled and fit. They would have to be the first to go then.....
 
He exhaled quietly as he held the kunai in different hands, quietly hopping/strafing along the capony of trees as he threw the kunai directly in front of the muscled men, making the tiger handsign as they were both caught in the kunai blast, their shouts of suprise cut short as they fell to the ground harmlessly. 

The other two bandits quickly reacted, quickly running into the forest as Sanada sped after them. He grinned as he had them on the run, easily overtaking the slow targets as he flipped in the air and landed on the soft grass in front of them, crossing his arms as he turned towards them.
"Give it up, you two are going to be taken into prison for your cri-" Sanada trailed off, his eyes widening slightly as the two bandits had suddenly multipled into 10.

Sanada cursed silently as he found himself surrounded, the men no multiplying but having a larger band hiding in the woods. These bandits weren't idiots, but cunning thieves that never strayed far from one another and Sanada felt that he had just learned that the hard way....

His eyes scanned around quickly as he assesed the situation, realizing he had to act fast to push the momentum in his favor...He dashed forward as he produced an exploding tag, jumping slightly over one of the bandits and slapping it on his back. He went into a diving roll, coming back up as he jumped back and making the handsign for it to erupt, taking out three of the bandits.

He smirked at his genius action before suddenly feeling himself flying, but then realized he couldnt do that...He had just been bodily thrown into a tree by a strong opponent, his back slamming into the tree and causing him to wince. But he would not be downed so easily as his feet were already slamming into the tree, kicking off it as he removed his tanto and did a small flip forward, pivoting on his foot as he sliced two more bandits across their chests. 

He was huffing at this point, though he refused to let them see it and the battle raged onwards for what seemed like eternity, until only him and three bandits stood standing, his body a mess as he shakely stood and face them. The three bandits weren't unscathed however, and had nasty scars of their own across their body. Sanada tightened the grip on his blade, moving forward slightly as they took a step back, causing him to grin slightly..

"I won't lose to scum like you three!!!" Sanada exclaimed, dashing forward as he quickly used their fear to his advantage...He extended his hand holding the tanto as he kicked one of the bandits in the stomach, pushing off his body to quickly rotate in the air and kick the other one in the face, causing the second one to spin and fall on the ground unconcious...So now only two stood in his way, but not for long however.

Sanada sheathed his tanto as he made a simple handsign, a genjutsu bunshin appearing next to him and running forward with him behind, switching positions quickly as the bandits were completely lost. Sanada grinned as he ran past them, sliding against the ground as the two bandits launched themselves at the genjutsu clone who feigned to be suprised. Sanada, now behind his opponents made several handsigns, elecitricity sparking around his hands as he dashed forward, slamming his palms into both their backs as electricity coursed through them, paralyzing and incapcitating them for the police to arrest...

Sanada huffed tiredly, once more bruised and a battered but he would only come out of this stronger than before...but he was tired and he didn't feel like doing somethign so reckless again, tying them up and going back to the village to alert the guards, his job finished as of now...

<br><font color=yellow>*Hayate(Deeksixx) l Seeing as how he was paying attention to every single that Haru made, and the fact that he never turned his body around to face him. That would entirely fuck up the whole basis of the attack that he had planned with the smoke bomb and such. And so, he merely made the attempt to leap back yet again the moment the smoke bomb hit the ground to get himself out of the smoke and away from Haru. 

While this occured, his other clone simply took the intiative to move in towards his opponent whilst Haru probably would have aimlessly striked at the clone.

And all while le bullshit happend- Hayate was ttly busy recovering.*
