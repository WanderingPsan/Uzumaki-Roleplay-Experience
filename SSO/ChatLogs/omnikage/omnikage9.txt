<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) glanced towards Trilliam and gave him a "Why the fuck are you even here..." look. It was clear that his opponent had merely baited him into attacking so that he would inevitably gather the chakra into his gauntlets. But apparently he had a three step weight gain program that involved absorbing chakra to enter a rage filled chaos mode. 

"...Dang it!" he said in a somewhat stressed tone, he hadn't had any combat experience against a foe such as this, and given that he was pissed it was clear that he wouldn't be able to do much, especially with the nature of his techniques. Suddenly he was thrown backwards, skidding across the sand before standing upright. He didn't get it as bad as the others but he would be left to face this beast. 

"Bring it! I stake my pride against you, tainted one!"* - Wed Nov  4 02:52:22 2015

He was well aware of the shockwave capacity of Jinpa-..Aklys. As his fist was thrown towards him, he'd leap to the side whilst attempting to get a bit closer, hopefully he could nullify him if he got close enough. "He's singing nursery rhymes and trying to kill us...Not to shabby!" he thought to himself as his hands clenched into a fist. 

"London bridge is falling down...falling down...falling down!" he'd say as he preapred for his ensuing technique.* - Wed Nov  4 03:18:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) noticed that she had entered a taijutsu stance, leading him to believe that she really planned to cash that whole "bone breaking" check. He was sure that she surpassed him in the most basic of ability, so if he was going to have any chance at winning he'd have to, at the very least, put her on the defensive. 

As she approached he'd slip into a basic taijutsu stance, which wasn't really worth much to begin with. With her speed he was able to react, but not as quickly as he would of hoped. Her kick was launched towards his head, to which he would hop backward, the heel of her foot grazing his forehead. 

"Well dang.." He didn't have the speed to create much distance, and so he had to make moves while he had the time and the small distance for what it was. His hands weaving a number of seals before he took a deep breath. Fire would suddenly spew from his mouth in a display of offensive gut! While he couldn't talk due to the flames he'd think "Hahaha!" * - Thu Nov  5 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) had unleashed the ball of flame in her general location, the flames impeding his vision. Once the flames themselves had begun to disperse he'd look around, wondering exactly as to where she had gone. "...I burned her to nothing...Oh no! Father will kill me!" he said in distressed tone, clearly joking, his eyes scanning the field as he looked for her whereabouts.* - Thu Nov  5 04:05:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Oooo wonder if she will teach me that kick? - Thu Nov  5 04:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) had no way to possible see the attack coming and was thus struck by the dynamic kick. He heaved as the attack struck his abdomen, however he took to the offensive, attempting to grab onto her foot and refuse to let go. "An eye for an eye...." he said aloud as his chakra began to flare. 

Within seconds his hands would set ablaze as his manipulative prowess began to shine through. The flames would travel the length of her leg, aiming to give her quite the nasty burn from his katon chakra. If allowed he would continue to pour on the juice, elevating the temperature upon her leg as flames continued to dance upon her apendage.

"A tooth for a tooth!"* - Thu Nov  5 04:13:00 2015

This was his chance! To squander it due to pain would surely be the wrong decision. Despite the fire shroud that his relative employed he would hold steadfast. The secondary strike to his jaw would surely cause his teeth to clatter but it was managable, for the time being at least. At most he was only able to scath her leg only slightly, the force of the strike causing him to stumble backwards. 

Once distance was established he'd look to Marrissa and chuckle. "That didn't hurt!" he was lying through his teeth of course, a small bruise had begun to form upon his lower chin but he had to fight through it, for this was the path of the Ryujin. 

With her fire form enabled he wasn't quite sure that his own flames would do much, there was only one option..but he wasn't quite sure he could do it under durress, but now would be as good as any to start. * - Thu Nov  5 04:24:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) his speed was severely lacking, when she reached for the fan he quickly knew that he was out of his depth. Despite his prodigious skill and nature, she was far more experienced than him, and her repetoire of jutsu far surpassed his own. And thus he could only do what he knew best. 

Taking a deep breath, Ivel would gather Katon chakra within his mouth. He didn't have time for handseals, nor did he have the patience if he did. So he had to make it work. In a mighty bellow he ushered forth a large flame thrower. However, it wasn't aimed towards Marrissa but the ground at his feet. Making use of fires propulsory nature he'd aim to throw himself into the air via his flaming roar, to scale the grand wall of flame. However, no matter how clutch the move, he was still lacking in a few key points and he found his legs burning as a result of his lacking speed.

If successful he'd begin to gather Katon based chakra within his hand, flames springing to life as a ball of Flame was born within his grasp. Time to take the initiative! Immediately unleashing said flames he'd aim to strike her in the face! While it may have been a risky venture if it were to land, he was confident in his cousin/sister/whateverthefuckFujitorabeendoing.. Regardless he'd land on the sand and nearly slip, the uneveness of the ground and recent burns getting to him.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) clenched his teeth rather tightly, so much so that his jaw became apparent. He wasn't like Izanami, he couldnt' just shoot fire in mid air and change position...or could he? Nah, he wasn't that cool. The air bullets approached with much haste, causing him to raise his hands to cover his more sensitve areas as the bullets collided with his body, sending him backwards through the air abit. 

Once he did land he'd look up to Marrissa a confident smirk upon his face, but in his mind he was sweating. "Time to step it up!" rushing towards his cousin he'd proceed to weave a number of seals, they'd look familiar to anyone who had performed fireball jutsu for they were infact the same seals. 

In a swift burst of chakra he'd unleash the rather large ball of flame, intending to send it straight towards Marrissa, but of course he had a contingency, and a damn good one. * - Thu Nov  5 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) and just like that everything was foiled. The fireball sailed overhead as she sank into the ground. "Well damn...Didn't plan for that..I should of." he thought to himself as he raised his hand, a ball of flame manifesting as he prepared himself for her surprise attack. * - Thu Nov  5 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) //

His heart sank. A whopping Twenty Three Marrissa's all of which seemed to be quite sturdy. He didn't have any real long range techniques, nothing that could take out twenty three clones all at once. "I can take out a few...But what good will that do me..It's a pretty sad situation...Think..Oh wait!" he thought to himself. 

"It's a stretch..." With ambition fueling his idiocracy he allowed the clones to approach, once the first was within the appropriate distance he'd leap into the air, attempting to use it's face as a foot stool. With the additional height he'd weave his seals once more. If successful in his endeavors he'd unleash a widespread flame, aiming to set ablaze the earth clones. While he wasn't sure what the effect would be, he could only hope that with his widespread technique he could take out a fair number. 

Regardless, he'd fall to the ground into whatever of the clones were left, he was running short on ideas.* - Thu Nov  5 04:56:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) gave himself a fist pump as his ploy had worked to a certain degree, but he could only assume that Marrisa had something else planned, she seemed to have an answer to each of his techniques and plans. This was truly the difference between a talent and experience! 

As he landed he prepared to gather his chakra for his next technique, only for it to be caught in her web of earthen chakra. He was, for the time being stuck. His chakra however never faltered in fluctuation. 

"Damn it!"* - Thu Nov  5 05:05:04 2015

"He-....Wh-....What the heck! Get me out of here!" he roared as he struggled against his earthly confinements. He then began to chuckle as he continued to struggle, fake anime tears streamed down his face as he began introspection .* - Thu Nov  5 05:11:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) it was then that shit got trippy. Ivel found himself not stuck up to his neck in sand, but in the swampy, murky waters that were the Rice Fields. "Oh god...No!" he roared aloud as he struggled, but it was all for naught. The rice fields had him and they wouldn't let him go. 

"I....I...I yi-..." his confidence would hold strong as he failed to say the words, it wasn't until Fujitora's comment, which Ivel thought was merely apart of the torture. It was then that in the distance he witnessed his father approach with a rice bucket, among others of the waterfall village. 

"Yes Ivel, back to the fields! We have much work waiting for you since your departure!" He turned into the distance, field upon fields of murky rice water. As far as the eye could see.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) found himself out of the sand and out of the genjutsu. He looked around to notice his father talking to his aunt, which was still weird. A few weeks ago he only knew he had a father in sunagakure, now he's got a whole family.

Another day, another spar to prove your worth to family members. So was the life of young Ivel. However, today he would be facing his younger sister Izanami, who he could only hope didn't have such a vast array of techniques in comparison to Marrisa. As she approached and began to weave a set of seals, as did Ivel, he didn't have the time to rely on his physical prowess and leaned on his ninjutsu capacity. 

Taking a deep breath he'd begin the spar by leaping into the air, to avoid her charge, and unleashing a rather large ball of katon based chakra onto her location.* - Thu Nov  5 20:44:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) had successfully landed his technique, or so he thought. Izanami appeared on the other side of the arena, where she had recently discarded her bowsword. To which Ivel quickly scolded himself. "Should of seen that coming, ah well..." She quickly took to the offensive, performing her own fireball, and with one handseal no less. Although, it didn't look as potent as his own, perhaps he could capitalize on it.

"I could probably do that..."

he said aloud as he himself formed a single handseal, ushering forth a rather large ball of flames, allowing the two to collide in a violent manner. If his inklings were correct, his own Jutsu would potentially power through her own, a few flames sputtering towards her location. * - Thu Nov  5 20:53:58 2015

"...Everyone but me..." he said aloud as he began to charge forward, his eyebrows furrowed as he intended to close the distance between himself and Izanami. It was apparent that she had a weapon and could most likely use it, not to mention her seal speed was higher than his own, but that meant little to Ivel. He had to win to learn a new technique. 

Leaping to the side he would raise his right hand, a ball of flame appearing just above his skin. 'Hah!' he roared as he threw the ball of flame towards her chest region, aiming to deal a bit of damage and perhaps burn her clothing. * - Thu Nov  5 21:00:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) smirked confidently as the man took the initiative. it was clear that he had bad intentions in calling for the spar, but he felt that now was as good a time as any to display his unique talent on a community scale. While it may have been at the expense of Zole, Ivel thought it would be for the greater good! 

Both his right and left hands set ablaze as he charged towards Zole, which may not of been expected. "Golden Flame Craft!" he roared as he thrust both his hands together in the face of Zole. The flames would expand far and wide into a rather large and encompassing blaze of pure Golden Fire. Of course, Ivel was no murderer, and he had no intentions of truly hurting the boy. If the attack were to land full on, he would allow it to sit for a few seconds before manipulating the flames in a dismissive manner, to save him some grief later on.
