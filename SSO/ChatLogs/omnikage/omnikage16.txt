He'd lost Marrisa, and Jiki, albeit Jiki was stated to be "alive", he still felt dead in his eyes. Not to mention Izanami, his seven year old sister, had lost an arm to the war against Edge. And now, another group bore the banner of war for the sake of peace.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) noticed that Abraxas had begun to weave a few seals, leading Ivel to raise his eyebrow in curiousity. Suddenly, a giant dragon comprised of some odd material suddenly sprouted from the sand at Abraxa's feet and head towards Kinami. Making use of his speed, he'd leap in front of Kinami, albeit she probably went on the move at this point. 

With his hands aflame, Ivel would slam his hands together in a gripping motion, the flames upon his hands merging and exploding forth in a golden torrent of flame. Should the potency of his flames prove to be greater than that of the crystal it would shatter into a fair amount of pieces, the flames exploding outwards in a concussive wave of heat, potentially sending everyone in the immediate area backwards a few tiles or so. 

If everything were successful, Ivel would stand erect, itching the back of his head. "Well dang, calm down guys."* - Fri Nov 27 05:34:04 2015
