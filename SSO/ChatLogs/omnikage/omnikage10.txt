<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) Karate chopped the back of Mizora's head. 

"Baka~ You can't kill comrades!"* - Mon Nov  9 01:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) hand got coiled and shit. 

"Don't harm comrades! We must all work together."* - Mon Nov  9 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: As you can see, Little-Sensei. She's a convict who constantly attacks, not trying to read the situation. - Mon Nov  9 01:24:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) noticed that this woman clearly wasn't going to take the high road, nor would she attempt to diffuse the situation but merely feed the flames. And as such, judgement would have to be swift! A step behind Mizora, Ivel would raise his right hand as a flame would suddenly usher itself forth, aiming to engulf the woman in a rather fierce blaze. 

While it would surely burn her, that wasn't his true intention. The force of the flame would send her flying, most likely over the coffee table, and her assault on Shira would end in an abrupt manner. 

If successful he'd stand erect, his hand raised to chest level with a small flame hovering within his palm. "We aren't going to do this, guys."* - Mon Nov  9 01:35:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) wags his finger towards Mizora, a childish frown on his face. 

"You can't attack comrades cause they make you mad! I'd be in jail a few times if I did that, hahahha."* - Mon Nov  9 02:28:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) glanced towards Izanami. Her words were articulated incredbily well, something unseen in a seven year old girl.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: How? - Mon Nov  9 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: I can show you. - Mon Nov  9 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Well uh..show me? - Mon Nov  9 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Come along. - Mon Nov  9 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Alright! It's people here but hey, someone will see it eventually. - Mon Nov  9 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) wiggled his fingers somewhat as he raised both his arms to about chest level. He'd look towards Izanami and smirk confidently as his chakra began to pool and quake within his network. Flames began to spark around his person as he activated the Fire Shroud technique. A heated blaze encompassing his frame and coating Ivel in a red/orange chakra. 

"Alright! We've got regular fire shroud..But then, after my training I can alter it.."

he said aloud as the flames began to burn brighter and in a more fierce fashion. Soon the flames began to shift in shape, expanding around him as they gained shape and definition. Within seconds the shroud had taken the shape of a Draconic creature, equipped with small horns and claws. It was clear that Ivel was under a bit of stress, but he could maintain it for a large period of time if needed. 

"Ta-da!"* - Mon Nov  9 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: I was going to eventually do that... - Mon Nov  9 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) dispels the cloak of flames and ruffles his hair, it gets pretty dry after such a display. He'd then shrug his shoulders and chuckle to himself. "Flames are usually very wild and unorganized so...I gave it some structure! After I figured out I could shape 'em, I just started messing around until I got this." his head nodding in agreement with himself.* - Mon Nov  9 06:44:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm... I wouldn't be averse to it- but I'll need to eat after. I've caught a good bit of a breather as is, and the hospital was nice... wait, which girl are you asking if I beat? - Tue Nov 10 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I fought two. - Tue Nov 10 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: The darkskined one. - Tue Nov 10 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I flattened the Waitress totally with no damage, then someone else stepped up and gave me a really good fight. - Tue Nov 10 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Anyway.. - Tue Nov 10 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: H-Hmph.. - Tue Nov 10 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) pursed his lips in a curious manner as Mitsunara exclaimed to someone by the name of "Marco". Apparently he questioned her toughness or something and this would be her means of rectifying the statement, however, Ivel didn't plan on going down without a fight. 

Raising his right hand he'd look towards Mitsunara and flex his fingers towards him, a means to usher her forth. 

"Ladies first~"* - Tue Nov 10 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: S-She said she'd spar me. . .and she is fighting him. . . - Tue Nov 10 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: Damn. - Tue Nov 10 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: Mother fucker what, I thought someone else agreed to fight you. - Tue Nov 10 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) watched with a careful eye as the woman approached. It was clear that she had been training with the sword for a fair amount of time, her movements were smooth and lacked any sort of rigidity. As her arm was raised for the initial stroke, he'd raise his own, unleashing a plume of flame that would fly towards her location, interrupting her strike. The blaze would cut any visuals she had on Ivel, allowing him to leap backwards and establish distance regardles of the outcome of said flame. His hands coming together in a few handseals once he stabilized.

"C'mon, swordswoman!"* - Tue Nov 10 00:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) began to rub his chin as the flames seemingly did nothing but make her look cool. "I'll have to work on that. It's pretty annoying at this point...Ah well." he thought to himself as she continued to approach, however, with his seals completed he'd usher another technique. A giant ball of flame would spew from his lips as he completed his seals, this one far more potent than the basic flame he had unleashed before. It's capacity for damage far more destructive. 

If she were to simply run through such a flame he wasn't sure if she would escape with her life. Although, it was just a spar and Ivel wasn't cold blooded so he scaled it down enough to injure, but not to kill. If it were to hit that is.* - Tue Nov 10 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) Had performed his jutsu without a hitch, even scaled the damage back a bit just in case it hit her, which it did, but Ivel wasn't expecting it. Not really. And yet, she charged blindly into the flames, roaring like a banshee as the technique literally cooked her. It surely was a sight to see, one that Ivel hadn't seen for a few years atleast. 

Despite injury, despite the gap in strength, she continued forth, gunning for the ten year old with renewed vigor. Her blade struck out, aiming to get one good hit in before it was all over, but Ivel had other plans. Plans that involved finishing this fight without taking a hit. 

Raising his left hand he'd aim to catch the blade, but not before initiating his insurance. The Fire Shroud. A technique that wreathes the user in flames for defensive and offensive purposes, a technique unique to Ivel and his clan members. If he were successful he'd grasp the blade and nod his head a few times. 

"Very tenacious, you've got guts swordswoman! Let's be friends~"* - Tue Nov 10 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: *drops perks from pocket* - Tue Nov 10 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) //

His fire shroud wasn't so flimsy that the final stroke from a fallen warrior could pierce it, oh no no no. It would hold to face her punch, her strength falling short in regards to his defense. However, as soon as she agreed to be his friend, he quickly chuckled and released his shroud, holding his hand out for her to shake. He was merely a child, almost ignorant to the damage she may have sustained; but he still wanted his hand shake. 

Afterwards he'd raise his right hand as the flames in the surrounding area, and any flames that may have been smoldering upon Mitsunara's skin would quickly disperse into smoke, rising into the air within Sunagakure.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) blinked three times in quick succession as the man's skin shifted and a secondary more murderous personality took to the forefront of his psyche. "Oh. Is that all.." he thought to himself as the man began to charge towards him, his approach full of openings, some he wouldn't capitalize on for the sake of life. 

Raising his right hand he'd snap his fingers as numerous balls of flame would unleash themselves from his right hand. A total of four crimson orbs would fly towards Aza, aiming to interrupt his charge and potentiall damage him to the point of injury if they were to explode upon contact.  * - Tue Nov 10 03:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) decided that if the man wanted to go for a more Taijutsu orientation then that was fine, but he'd naturally add in his own spark. Summoning his fire shroud, Ivel would be encased in a bright flame. The flame's would augment his physical force as well as provide a hearty defense against both physical and spiritual attacks. 

As the Juugo attempted to strike him in his gut he'd swing his left arm to divert the blow, whilst simulatenously dealing a sharp right hook to the chin, aiming to send him to the ground. Ivel would take a quick step backward and hop on the balls of his feet.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) thinks: Oi. Tickle my Dick, but I'm pretty sure I saw that dude with a gross fist about to kill Ivel. - Tue Nov 10 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) jive rocked that nigga son. 

Ivel had successfully struck the man in his chin, sending him to the ground with a quick right hook. It wasn't anything major, Ivel was merely gifted. As was Aza in his own way, but not comparable to the self proclaimed Dragon! Noticing that Aza's fist had begun to grow and change in shape, the young shinobi would quickly raise his guard. 

As the punch was thrown his way he'd simply allow the fire shroud to do it's job, the flames searing into his opponents flesh if he dared to strike him, however, with Aza's mental the way it was..it was clear he cared not about his own well being. He'd simply have to knock him out.* - Tue Nov 10 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) was thrown backwards from the additional force of the Piston Fist. It wasn't enough to break his defenses but it would surely break the lesser man. Looking to his opponent as he attempted to reach the edge of the flame, Ivel began to chuckle. 

"You don't get it...All of this flame is mine..." he'd say aloud as he raised his right hand. Flames from the surrounding wall would quickly close in towards Aza, aiming to tighten the circle into a rather large wall surrounding him. Ivel would quickly feed the flames, increasing the thickness of the wall. 

"Best thing to do when you meet a wild animal?"

Ivel's hands would fly through the air from numerous angles as he continued to speak, the wall of flame would shorten until it reached about six feet. From there he'd open it up a bit, not large enough to walk through but large enough to see a face. 

"Is put it in a cage~"

Sweat had begun to form upon Ivel's face as he maintained the flame's shape. It was clearly taxing his young body.* - Tue Nov 10 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: That doesn't look normal... - Tue Nov 10 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) Sighed deeply to himself as Aza just couldn't see when he was outclassed. 
"Can't this guy take a hint..." he said aloud as he quickly raised his right arm, his fire shroud defending against the whole chain thing. "Time to end it.." he'd state as he raised his right hand, palm towards the sky whilst looking towards his flame craft. 

With a sudden flexing of his fingers, the flames would suddenly close around Aza, most likely burning him and giving him a hell of a itch. Seeing as his flames were a bit too wild and uncontrolled he'd scale the temperature back significantly, but he'd still be burned a fuckton. 

Seeing as this guy was a wild animal he'd force him to sit in the wall of flames until he either calmed down, or passed out due to injury. * - Tue Nov 10 03:49:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) watched that nigga get wrapped like a christmas present. All the flames in the surrounding area would dim as Ivel took a deep breath, his hands resting on his knees. 

"I said...I had it, hehe."* - Tue Nov 10 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Good fight, though. - Tue Nov 10 04:36:28 2015
