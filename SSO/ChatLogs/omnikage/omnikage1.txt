<br><font color=green>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) says: *Oh?
<br><font color=yellow>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) does a few handseals before placing her hand on the ground. A sword would appear where the formula stretched out. "I'm going to teach you..The rudiments of a form of Kenjutsu..Called Iai." She says with a trollsmirk.*
<br><font color=green>*Akasen, Nero(OmniKage) says: The sword style of my ancestors.
<br><font color=green>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) says: Iai....?
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Ah yes, indeed..
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Iai...It is the ability to draw your sword extremely quickly..Stopping all handseals.
<br><font color=green>*Akasen, Nero(OmniKage) says: If you have the speed.
<br><font color=yellow>*Kurina(Punkamainia) would take a few steps back from Usui. She looked dead at him, her eyes focused. She would take out a kunai ready for any attack. She had a fighting pose, as if waiting for Usui to come attack her. "Ready when you are, Usui," she would say.*
<br><font color=green>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) says: And obiously reflexes in order to react, logically.
<br><font color=green>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) says: *obviously
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Alrighty...
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: I want you both to get in this stance.
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( 2 rps. )
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( one sec )
<br><font color=yellow>*Hozuki, Sirozan(XxkasukuxX) Sirozan begins wondering the outskirts of The Hidden Mist at dusk, Which his superiors tells him that it's dangerous, Blowing them off and begins looking for a massive water source, Since his village is running low on A hydratation liquid. He begins walking and thinking about the lectures he'll hear from his superiors when they hear he returns from outside the village, Before he can remember, he looks up and it;'ss very dark out thinking, "Well, I need to hurry before wild animals start thinking they can attack me..." after this statement he is very cautious walking about. Looking back and uses his peripheral vision to his advantage. After walking several minutes he gettings very bored and even considering returning home. But, this actually made him want to travel faster, he then crouches down and begins to scout a tree branch and locks on and releases his stance and goes soar towards the branch, then begins to get a rhythm taking one foot at a time on branch consecutively. He then hears something like someone following him, lashing out his kunai and attaches a wire on it and fires it's behind him as a trap wire. He then feels this same wire move and stops and gulps thinking, "As my predictions was right." and says in a calm voice, "Come out, I can tell your there...". He then gets into a basic fighting stance cleching his fists and yells, "COME ON NOW, YOU CAN'T HIDE!" then he hears a tree branch breaks close to him and his heart begins to beat very fast. The figure begins to appear from what of the dark with Sirozan's kunai stating, "This trap was successful, Your senses are redefined, But You Should have stayed home, Boy." Sirozan's teeth begins to clamp hearing, "Boy." He begins to walk from the darkness smirking, touching his headband and swinging Sirozan's kunai on a finger. He looks like clan from the Hidden Mist called "Hoshigaki" with a rogue headband and with rags on his back. Sirozan then comments on his headband, "I see your -where- from The Hidden Mist...?" with his guard on even more alert. The Hoshigaki then asks, "That trash of a village? Psshh, Anywhere is better then there..." Sirozan then jumps down from the tree on to the ground with the Hoshigaki following him. Sirozan then thinks, "He's following me so he must be a lethal threat...I have to attack off-guard so i can continue searching." The Hoshigaki then pulls out a jar from his kunai holster and begins to consume the contents of it saying, "Ahh...That's goood water...Now, This is what's going to happen. Your going to give me all your suppiles or Die...or, i can rob you AND kill you." with a maniacally laugh. Sirozan says, "You won't do either you punk!" and picks up a giant stick the size of a 4x4 and perpares to attack the Hoshigaki. The Hoshigaki then throws the jar to the ground and shatters it perpares a defense. Sirozan then begins swinging the stick violently with relatively ease matching the Hoshigaki's stolen kunai. Sirozan then props up the stick on the ground and throws his body weight into a kick towards the Hoshigaki's gut. The Hoshigaki then wipes the blood from his mouth and leans up and perfroms some handseals and shouts, "Water Style : Water Clone Technique!" then punches the clones expelling all of the water onto the ground. Sirozan suprised kneels down and uses his finger to lick up some water and he starts to sulp it up saying, ' AHHHH! Water taste so good...This is going to be clockwork now!" then his muscles begin to pump alittle with every sip. The Hoshigaki then tells Sirozan that he better look up and Sirozan sweepkicks The Hoskigaki, The Hoshigaki is suprise by his speed and elbows his jaw and begins to start flying backwards. Sirozan then grabs his stick and begins to walk and stops to zooms into the place he elbowed The Hoshigaki, barely hereing the Hoshigaki annouce his Water Style : Great Exploding Water Colliding Wave trying to outrun it then getting hit dead on to the back,"W-What..NOOOOooo..."when the blast settled he found him self inside a bubble of water. The Hoshigaki then pops up with a ripped shirt and taking deep breaths looking fatigue saying, "I underestimated you, Now it's time to see the real power of the Hoshigaki Clan!" rushing into the floating injured Sirozan perform and landing harsh connecting chains of combos with very loud grunts then Hoshigaki says, "See you are weak, Hidden Mist trash..Should have stayed home child, Heh.." Sirozan then begins to wake softly saying, "Well....I told you wasn't going to kill me...or rob me......NOW TO KEEP MY PROMISE!" with a electric voice. With Sirozan's rage on a new peak his body begin to liquify and he comments on his teeth saying, "My Teeth...I'll Rip You Apart!!!!" The Hoshigaki then is stunned by his transformation. Sirozan races towards the Hoshigaki and throws everything at him with bashing combos connecting and breaking every move the hit touches. Sirozan then picks up the nearly dead Hoshigaki and states, "You gave me a fight i thought i wasa going to lose...Thank you, For this Great Fight, But you have to die...But, Before that. I'll tell you my name, I am Sirozan from the Hozuki clan, Hozuki, Sirozan!" he then tosses the almost lifeless body of the Hoshigaki then, soaks up the water like a sponge. Then, swims up towards the sky and goes shuffling into his pockets and hosters thinking, "It's -gotta- be in here..." and then opens a pocket wide and finds a underwater lighter saying, "Yes, Now I can finish this." after he flickers the lighter and surrounds it in a small water bubble putting one hand on the bubble performs couple of handseals and shouting, "Water Style : Water Dragon Bullet!!!!!" a large amount of water formed into a giant, powerful dragon with the underwater lighter infused into the water is rushed at the almost-lifeless Hoshigaki the size of a large oak tree is expelled into the  Body of the Hoshigaki causing a large devasting wave of water covering alot of the forest with a small explosion of the underwater lighter inploding. After the water settles, He slowly floats down reverting from his Water Hydration Technique, Looking at the now officially lifeless corpse, with complete white eyes with -no- iris. of The Hoshigaki. Sirozan didn't waste no time giving the Hoshigaki pity and limped and buckled towards the Hidden Mist Village with required water inside his body.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Usui(Esteban16) after esteban makes the attack,putthe tanto ithe floor so he pull with all his strenght the tanto esteban goes up and launch a strenght kick t your head**
<br><font color=yellow>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) Hi
*
<br><font color=yellow>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) stands there facing her two genin. She lowers her body just a bit. Cheren breathes in and out deeply, "First of all..You want to breathe...Quite deeply...It is to center yourself...And get in the mindset of the wind.." She says as she focuses her chakra through her body, causing it to flow with perfect balance.

"Then...You want to lower your body..Ever so slightly...Stop your heartbeat from escalating...Then..This is the most important part, keep your hand on your sword theeen." She says, with a lightning quick movement that was entirely too fast to be seen, she draws her blade, cuts a Z in the air, and returns it.*
<br><font color=teal>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) whispers: [why is usui here if he cant rp ._.]
<br><font color=yellow>*Sozen(Radori3) lol*
<br><font color=yellow>*Kurina(Punkamainia) would watch as Usui charged at her with his tanto drawn. For now, she didn't need her tanto nor shuriken. But all she needed was a kunai. As Usui attempted to strike her at her chest, Kurina simply ducked, and sent a low sweep with her foot at Usui legs in an attempt to trip him, and send him to the floor.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) nodded as he uncrossed his arms at last, his wrist hovering over the hilt of his blade as he first carefully observed the teachings of the positioning. His eyes slowly and deliberately took in her form, and perhaps stared a bit too hard though it shouldn't have been blatantly obvious. He blinked and shook his head slightly, narrowing his eyes slightly as he cursed quietly...

"Focus....There is a task at hand." Sanada murmured, closing his eyes briefly as he pictured the form and positioning.

(2)

Sanada reopened his eyes as he spread his feet out slightly, one foot slightly forward as his hand rested lightly on his sheathe. His violet eyes seemingly glowed in the sunlight as a slight breeze echoed across the training area, his feet sliding silently across the tiles. His eyebrows were furrowed in concentration, exhaling quietly as he wondered if his form was correct.. His hand flew towards his blade after crouching slightly managing to unsheathe the blade but getting it stuck near the top, sighing dishearteningly as he resheathed it... 

"Maybe this kind of sword is a no-go for me...But I cant give up yet.." Sanada murmured, reassuming the position and trying repeatedly, no where near the Raikages speed.*
<br><font color=green>*Akasen, Nero(OmniKage) says: (Ah so tedious lol)
<br><font color=teal>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) whispers: And hes here becuase...ugh idk hes a br that I picked up by accident....I -really- dont like Brs....Idk why ...They ruined PWO for me )

<br><font color=teal>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) whispers: ( Im thinking about just getting him killed)
<br><font color=teal>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) whispers: [just tell him that one of us has to leave]

<br><font color=green>*Usui(Esteban16) says: (AND THE JUTSUS?)
<br><font color=yellow>*Kurina(Punkamainia) would watch as Usui fell back to dodge her move. Kurina sighed, and watched as Usui charged again, jumping over her and attempting to slash her at her back. Kurina would turn around, carefully watching Usui, and using her kunai to block Usui's tanto attack. A metal clashing sound would emit from the kunai and the tanto once they connected. She would then take her right hand and attempt to grab Usui's arm and pull him in. If he was pulled in, she would deliver a kick to his gut, to send him back. She then heard Cheren-Sensei. Forgetting about the spar, she gathered 'round, and listened.*

<br><font color=green>*Usui(Esteban16) says: o.o
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: So...Usui..It's up to you....
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: I need you to go to Kirigakure no Sato...And capture the Mizukage...
<br><font color=green>*Usui(Esteban16) says: o.o!
<br><font color=green>*Usui(Esteban16) says: (wtf?)
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: The mizukage...Is a baby...
<br><font color=green>*Usui(Esteban16) says: o-o-ok my lord!
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Well...He's the size of a baby.
<br><font color=green>*Usui(Esteban16) says: (realy or you are oking??)
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( srs. Hes a chibi )
<br><font color=yellow>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) put his hands in his pockets, an eyebrow slightly raised though he didn't question her decision to implement Usui. However, Sanada doubted that he would be successful, but then again he had been proven wrong before...*
<br><font color=green>*Usui(Esteban16) says: (oh..)
<br><font color=yellow>*Akasen, Nero(OmniKage) yawns as he watched Cheren stand before Sanada and himself. His eyes wandering Lazily around the arena as the Raikage began to perform the demonstration. This was a technique that Nero had read about during his younger years during his time in the land of iron, something he would be required to learn should he wish to call himself a samurai. Once Cheren completed her demonstration, Nero would lower his body slightly while inhaling sharply. "Center myself" he would think aloud. His breathing continued at a light pace, the young samurai's concentration deepening.

(2)

Spreading his legs slightly, Nero would stand upon the tips of his toes; his hand hovering slightly over the hilt of his katana. Yawning slightly, Nero would retain his calm demeanor as he gripped his blade's hilt, releasing it from its sheathe at a slow pace. His blade purposely lacked speed however, so that he may gain a mental grip on the motions this technique required, something he would need if he wished to use it instantaneously as Cheren had done previously.*
<br><font color=green>*Akasen, Nero(OmniKage) says: (Lazy rps are lazy)
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: So....Would you be willing to do it?

<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Do the technique I showed you...Come with me Kurina..
<br><font color=green>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) says: B-
<br><font color=green>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) says: . . . .*sigh*
<br><font color=yellow>*Kurina(Punkamainia) would take the Chakra Paper. She focused on it, rushing chakra to her hands, as the chakra transferred to the paper from there. Kurina then watched as the paper split into two pieces of paper. She showed it to Cheren-Sensei, "What's that supposed to be?"*
<br><font color=yellow>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) sighed as he went into a crouched position once more, his eyes narrowing as he closed them shut. He exhaled silently as the wind blew across the field, his legs sliding against the smooth tiled surface as his feet glided. He reopened his eyes, quickly drawing the blade from its sheathe and making a vertical then horizontal sweep before just as quickly sheathing the blade in a fluid motion as he stared at his sword...

"I..I think i know what to do now.." Sanada whispered, gripping his katana. 

2)

Sanada repeated this motion multiple times as his wrists and arms began to follow the motions much more quickly, his eyes not even having to hover over the sheathe as he withdrew and resheathed his blade. He felt like he could do this thing all day and the fact that he was becoming successful at the task at hand caused him to feel an intense initiative. 
"I have to continually push myself to the limits.." Sanada thought as he began moving around as he attempted to commence the motions, spinning quickly and then proceeding to undergo the Iai technique, finding it much harder to do though it gave him another challenge to overcome. He glanced over towards Nero and frowned slightly, refusing to be outdone by someone such as him. His claims of his 'ancestors' had irked Sanada and he would prove to him that true swordsmen didn't have to be born into a certain bloodline to become proficient in their profession...

<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: (*Uchiah, Kagami IV sits on the ground, legs crossed, not entirely sure how this meditation thing worked. "Full state of understanding... I understand how boring this is going to be." Katsu whispered to himself, putting his hands together to form the tiger seal. That was common for most shinobi, some even used it to regain lost chakra at a subtle rate. In addition Katsu closed his eyes, trying to wander off to a mental state of solitude. "Full state of understanding.. Do I have to understand myself?..Or the element...Possibly both?"

Katsu fought the urge to scratch the back of his head. This meditating stuff was quite the difficult task. Especially for someone as impatient as he was. "Well I understand myself... As confusing as I am.. But what is Katon?.. What is Fire?" he wondered. "Fire can't truely be controlled can it?.. Even when we manipulate it into jutsus..It can still hurt us cause it isn't truely, 'Ours'... Hmmm.. Katon is the element of not being controlled. The chaotic portion of mother nature... The power to destroy"

Katsu created a mobile image of himself. Walking around the dark abyss he considered to be his mind. It was empty, quiet. Within the next few steps, he noticed a change. There was something on the ground. He looked under himself, there was ripples, indicating the substance to be that of a liquid. "Water?.." he questioned. But there was a flash of light, which temporarily blinded him. "W-..What is this?" Katsu asked, instinctively covering his face, yet it had no meaning, for he was still blind. The light faded however, allowing Katsu to regain his vision, yet the sight he saw made him wish he had lost it permanetly. Around him was a field of flames, towering higher then that of the hokage mansion.

//The flames quickly spread. Closing into Katsu's location.

"T-..This isn't water...It's oil!" he realized, moments before being engulfed by flames. It was in his head, yet the pain felt real. His skin was scorching hot, and his hair lit like that of a match, reaching down to cover his face. "Ahhgg!.. This pain... Why does it feel real when this is just my imagination!?.." he screamed.
Katsu closed his fist, bending his knees with a forward lean. "Control the flame that controls me... Control the flames that control me... Control the flames that control me!" he kept repeating. With each repition the flames receeded into his body, until it was just a small manifestation of Katsu's inner flame. The pain vanished, almost as if it was never there.

Upon exiting his meditative state, he exhaled heavily. Beads of sweat ran down his face, his shirt and jacket already soaked. "Man.. This isn't going to be very easy..."*)

<br><font color=yellow>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) sighed as he continued his practicing, though he ended up panting as he had both his hands resting on his knees. "Tch...I'm making progress but...this just feels...odd.." Sanada murmured, wiping his forehead as he laid on his back and stared upwards. His violet eyes travelled across the crystalline blue sky as he closed his eyes, sitting up after lying down for 10 minutes. He had been contemplating on what motivated him to become a shinobi, and what his future held....He kept his eyes closed, obviously concerned that he still hadn't found an answer...

2)

Sanada eventually reopened his eyes, slowly getting up and brushing himself off, stretching his muscles as he looked around and walked off the field...

"Alright..time for some good ol training on my own..I can't depend on people to help me advance if im not willing to do so myself.." Sanada murmured, headed towards the exit point to sneak out before stopping. He sniffed himself and blinked, wrinkling his nose...

"After a shower that is...." Sanada muttered, running forward as he jumped down a rock cliff, sliding on the gravel and motionless rocks as he sought to quickly get to his destination, unaware of the dangereous path he was taking.

3) 

Unknown to Sanada he was going to a cliff known for frequent mudslides and loose boulders flying down, finding out all too late when he flipped in the air and proceeded to land. His eyes shot out wide as he felt his feet sliding quickly forward, the momentum slamming his back against the harsh rocky, causing him to wince considerably as he began falling downhill, being brutally assualted by sharp, flat, dull, and simply blunt rocks and stone.  
He curled into a ball and tucked his hands over his head, bruises and cuts littering his body as he came to a halt at the bottom of the perilous journey, lying motionless as pebbles rained down over him, as if in mockery....Then there was..nothing..

<br><font color=green>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) says: [wait o-o
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( wut? )
<br><font color=yellow>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) stirred slowly as he groaned, cursing quietly as he shakely stood up and looked around, sighing.. He slowly shuffled his way to his home where he ran hot water, examining his body carefully as he inspected himself in the mirror after removing his top attire..
His body was marred by cuts and bruises all over, but nothing serious seemed to have been scarred into him luckily. He stared down at his bruised body and figured himself lucky that he was able to walk at all, making a fist slowly...

"Huh...I guess i got lucky.." Sanada thought, turning the water off as he removed his clothing and took a long, well needed rest in the tub as his body relaxed and healed.

5) The next few days after the incident Sanada was set and ready to proceed with his original plan, walking casually towards the village gate with his hands within his pockets. His eyes glanced around slowly, trying to look inconspicuous as he neared the village exit. He hadn't asked for permisson to leave as of yet, but he had been snooping around village shops and food areas to discover that a band of bandits and thugs were ransacking wayward travellers near his village. His tanto placed on his back as he strode forward with an outward confidence, Sanada exited the area to pursue the hunt although nervousness crept in around his gut with each step..

6) Sanada rested on a tree branch in a crouched position, his black shoes freshly cleaned as were his clothes. He had marked down the areas where the attacks were most frequented and came to the conclusion that the small band of jerks would arrive shortly if a caravan or merchant happened to come by...and sure enough it did. A wagon being dragged by a horse held important resources to the village, travelling steadily down the hidden path leading towards the village. Sanada watched it carefully, his features and body hidden in the trees as his eyes cast the faintest of glimmers. He stalked the caravan for a few miles when the bandits had decided to strike.... They swarmed from the undergrowth around the area, approxmiately 4 of the thugs surrounding the caravan, each brandishing a sword, spear, kunai, and battle axe in the respective order.   

Sanada watched in horror before shaking his head, his eyes narrowing as he produced a two kunai....   
"It's time for me to make a name for myself...and for these bandits to learn their lesson with theft of stolen goods.."

<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( lol kay )
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( bai )
<br><font color=green>*Kurina(Punkamainia) says: ((Bai.))
<br><font color=green>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) says: ]later
<br><font color=yellow>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) attached exploding tags to the two kunai he held, observing his targets who seemed to be oblivious to his precense. He smirked as he took in the sight of two frail looking bandits, who appeared to have been malnourished. His smirk faltered as he noticed the other two, both of them seemingly well muscled and fit. They would have to be the first to go then.....
 
He exhaled quietly as he held the kunai in different hands, quietly hopping/strafing along the capony of trees as he threw the kunai directly in front of the muscled men, making the tiger handsign as they were both caught in the kunai blast, their shouts of suprise cut short as they fell to the ground harmlessly. 

The other two bandits quickly reacted, quickly running into the forest as Sanada sped after them. He grinned as he had them on the run, easily overtaking the slow targets as he flipped in the air and landed on the soft grass in front of them, crossing his arms as he turned towards them.
"Give it up, you two are going to be taken into prison for your cri-" Sanada trailed off, his eyes widening slightly as the two bandits had suddenly multipled into 10.

Sanada cursed silently as he found himself surrounded, the men no multiplying but having a larger band hiding in the woods. These bandits weren't idiots, but cunning thieves that never strayed far from one another and Sanada felt that he had just learned that the hard way....

His eyes scanned around quickly as he assesed the situation, realizing he had to act fast to push the momentum in his favor...He dashed forward as he produced an exploding tag, jumping slightly over one of the bandits and slapping it on his back. He went into a diving roll, coming back up as he jumped back and making the handsign for it to erupt, taking out three of the bandits.

He smirked at his genius action before suddenly feeling himself flying, but then realized he couldnt do that...He had just been bodily thrown into a tree by a strong opponent, his back slamming into the tree and causing him to wince. But he would not be downed so easily as his feet were already slamming into the tree, kicking off it as he removed his tanto and did a small flip forward, pivoting on his foot as he sliced two more bandits across their chests. 

He was huffing at this point, though he refused to let them see it and the battle raged onwards for what seemed like eternity, until only him and three bandits stood standing, his body a mess as he shakely stood and face them. The three bandits weren't unscathed however, and had nasty scars of their own across their body. Sanada tightened the grip on his blade, moving forward slightly as they took a step back, causing him to grin slightly..

"I won't lose to scum like you three!!!" Sanada exclaimed, dashing forward as he quickly used their fear to his advantage...He extended his hand holding the tanto as he kicked one of the bandits in the stomach, pushing off his body to quickly rotate in the air and kick the other one in the face, causing the second one to spin and fall on the ground unconcious...So now only two stood in his way, but not for long however.

Sanada sheathed his tanto as he made a simple handsign, a genjutsu bunshin appearing next to him and running forward with him behind, switching positions quickly as the bandits were completely lost. Sanada grinned as he ran past them, sliding against the ground as the two bandits launched themselves at the genjutsu clone who feigned to be suprised. Sanada, now behind his opponents made several handsigns, elecitricity sparking around his hands as he dashed forward, slamming his palms into both their backs as electricity coursed through them, paralyzing and incapcitating them for the police to arrest...

Sanada huffed tiredly, once more bruised and a battered but he would only come out of this stronger than before...but he was tired and he didn't feel like doing somethign so reckless again, tying them up and going back to the village to alert the guards, his job finished as of now...

"It appears I got some decent training in after all.."*

<br><font color=yellow>*Akasen, Nero(OmniKage) Reaches into his pouch located at the back of his waistline parallel to his spine. He would tighten his grip on the scroll stationed in his barely noticeable pouch. Placing the scroll that detailed the skills of the samurai's various teachings out in front of himself, he would grip the handle of his blade. Nero would take low stance as he stared off into the distance of the spacious area he had previously walked into, the rain obscuring his vision slightly. With a quick sigh he would allow himself to be taken away with the sway of the wind and cool breezes that followed. Closing his eyes briefly, Nero would just listen to his environment, becoming accustomed to the area in which the majority of his trainings would consist. Opening his eyes slightly, a calming glow would be apparent in them as he stared forward. Unsheathing his small blade he would step forward, his foot landing just before the scroll carefully placed out in front of him. A whoosh would follow as the blade sliced forward, yet the sword itself had lost most of its speed and direction as it swung forward due to his lack of experience with the technique. As he attempted to finish the technique by resheathing the blade he would find his blade's tip scratching the back of his palm and ultimately missing the sheathe of the Katana, as he winced lightly. "Well...still got a lot of work to do, if I plan on being the best...." he said in a low tone. "Ignoring his own lack of gusto, Nero would continue with his trainings in the style of Iaido, hoping to gain atleast a small grasp over the technique.
strolls down the path in which everyone was standing. After watching the other group train he needed something to get his mind off of things, and practicing his new sword technique seemed like the best thing to do. Taking a deep cleansing breath, Nero would begin by placing his hand upon the hilt of his sword and unsheathing it rather quickly. Only after the initial swing he would sheathe the sword slowly, attempting to increase the speed of the slash before he actually moved onto the sheathing of it. His hand still placed upon the hilt of his katana,  Nero would grip it tightly but not to a point where the hilts threading would begin to imprint upon his hand causing him slight discomfort should it take place. Taking a calming breath he would once again take his average stance and proceed to unsheathe his blade. Emphasizing on speed, Nero used most of his strength in the pull, this however caused a drag upon the hilt itself creating a tugging action that hindered the speed of the unsheathing. Despite the tugging effect, he continued with the unsheathing of his blade ignorant to the effects a full strength swing brought on.
 The following day Nero would continue to his previous training spot. As he walked he would contemplate the effects of his training, to Nero it seemed as if he needed to use more strength and this itself damaged the sheathe. It wasn't until the blade was fully unsheathed that he noticed the effect a full swing was having upon his overall technique. The tugging pull was relieved when the blade was fully released causing the Katana to fly forward at a high speed, however the speed was unbalanced and out of control causing the slash itself to be fast but lack precision, and control, all the things Nero needed to effectively use his new technique. Sighing he looked toward his Katana and then toward his sheath. "I gotta get this speed thing down if its gonna be used effectively..." He would think aloud. Sheathing his blade Nero would think up various ways to improve on his technique and possibly overcome the drag of the blade yet keep the speed. After sitting for what seemed to the better part of an hour, he would sit upright with a metaphorical light bulb turning on in his head. Standing upright Nero would assume his somewhat low stance as he turned the shoulder, opposite the side of his blade, toward the mountain. Next he would place his left hand upon the meeting point between the katana's guard and the sheathe, while placing his left hand upon the hilt of his blade. Thirdly he would proceed to bend his knees slightly as his scarf began to peek off his back signaling the slight off balance in the stance. Quickly adjusting himself, Nero would move onto the final step in his task. Finally he would unsheathe the blade lightly, for when the first slash is to be released it will be quicker and more organized due to the partial unsheathing. Now with his stance set, Nero would move onto the actual attack, in his technique. Releasing his blade rather quickly, do to the ease of access provided from partial unsheathing, Nero would tone down the strength of his pull, allowing the blade to be released from its sheathe without any tug or pull from the sheathe. The technique itself is prided on its speed not the strength of the slash itself and so Nero focused upon the actual unsheathing of the blade's speed instead of the strength. Reaping the benefits of his adjusting, he was able to achieve a high speed slash, although he can still slash faster with a regular swing, he was making progress. It was just a matter of time before the speed of his slash rivaled that of his regular speedy slashes, and this is what pressed him forward. Acknowledging his progress, Nero would continue to sheathe his blade at a slightly faster pace, just barely sheathing the blade. Laughing at his own failure, he would assume his previous stance and continue on with his training attempting to increase the speed of his technique.
sighed as he walked down the base of the mountain once again, preparing himself for his ensuing training. Yawning lightly, Nero would stretch backward, his spine releasing various cracking noises followed by a low toned grunt from Nero. Taking a deep breath he would place his hand upon the hilt of his blade. Closing his eyes for a brief moment, Nero would review all his previous trainings that took place. Opening his eyes in a slow movement, to anyone watching it would look as if his eyelids were simply sagging over his eyes. But in reality it was just a form of concentration that Nero had achieved. The lack of sight allowed him to just listen to his surroundings instead of looking with his eyes and being influenced by the various distractions. Assuming his stance, he would turn slightly to his left allowing his right shoulder to take the lead along with his right foot, as his left foot fell to the back. Bending his knees lightly Nero would tighten the grip upon the hilt of his blade, as his left hand clasped around the meeting point between the guard of the katana and the sheathe itself. A low toned sigh would be produced as Nero attempted to calm his mind and his body in preparation for his following technique. Unsheathing his blade in a swift motion, Nero would attempt to send it forward initially and follow with an upward arc like motion as quickly as possible. Due to his previous trainings his quick draw slash was now on par with that of one of his medium speed slashes showing he was making much progress in the space of about a week and a half of his training. Now came the more difficult part of the technique itself, the sheathing. With his slash complete Nero would continue to sheathe his blade by retracting his arm at a decent speed. His speed was still quite slow, his opponent would easily recognize that they had been slashed by him, but still it was progress. The blade slid into it's sheathe just barely, and shakily at that. Looking toward his left hand Nero would notice no scratches and smirk lightly, before continuing with his training.
Nero Waited until later that night until he traversed the empty alley ways of the village, cutting through various shortcuts until he found himself out by the gate of the village. He wasn't sure if anyone was following him and at this point he didn't care, his months of training had finally come to an end as he felt he had a grasp on this technique. Walking down his usual path down the length of the mountain, he would settle upon a decent spot where the moonlight danced on the surface of the water. Once he was out of view of anyone who may still be awake in the village and those who may of followed, he would assume his stance. Turning slightly to his left allowing his right shoulder to take the lead along with his right foot, as his left foot fell to the back. Bending his knees lightly Nero would tighten the grip upon the hilt of his blade, as his left hand clasped around the meeting point between the guard of the katana and the sheathe itself. A low toned sigh would be produced as Nero attempted to calm his mind and his body in preparation for his following technique. Unsheathing his blade in a swift motion, Nero would release the blade from its sheathe at an incredible speed, the light from the moon landing on the blade for a brief moment. The slash itself was a simple upward arc, one that was generally practiced at lower levels for most samurai. However with the boost from his previously honed technique the slash became a deadly strike. The Ke'natsu produced from the blade created various ripples in the water below. Following up in his Iaido technique, Nero would spin his blade lightly once he reached the peak of his initial slash. Having previously spun his blade, he would follow with a descending motion,  resheathing his blade with much skill and finesse . Smiling lightly, Nero would turn to face the village content with the fruits of his training.*

<br><font color=yellow>*Akasen, Nero(OmniKage) closed his eyes as he inhaled sharply, his chest rising as a result. Opening his eye slightly, they would reflect a calm glow as his right hand assumed his well practiced position above the hilt of his blade. Bending his kness slightly, the young samurai would attain a lowered stance, his gaze shifting to the Raikage's figure. "..." he would say while applying pressure to the tips of his feet entering a sprint of sorts. Once he closed the distance between himself and the Kage, he would grip his katana's hilt and promptly unsheathe it in a swift and practiced movement, attempting to strike her chest.
