<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) nodded solemnly before rolling up the scroll as quickly as he had displayed it and in turn, placing it upon the lower reaches of his back once again.
   "Alright, good. I suppose this could be a ritual of some sort for the clan. Upon reaching an applicable age or range of power, you sign the contract and join the inner circle. Hrm? How does that sound? Or should we strictly keep this for the main branch?"* - Sun Aug 30 19:17:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) whispers: (Gucci!) - Sun Aug 30 19:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched his brows briefly; his deep, rouge eyes now resting upon the behemoth that had sprouted fourth from the confinements of Tethys' arm. Veins pulsed and shifted as the male utilised the Hydrification technique to his advantage in the most unique manner possible. In all honesty, it had never struck him that Hydrification in itself could be utilised in such a sporadic fashion; however, his mind had been opened up to a whole range of altered possibilities now.

   "Damn . . . That looks so disgusting, yet so cool all in the same. My goodness. . . " Ikaro muttered as he slowl pivoted around his sibling - analysing his transformation and taking in the adept level of control required to pull of the technique accordingly.
   "Alright." Ikaro muttered before allowing his body to run through the according processes as Tethys had described. 
    "I'll get it in no time." Ikaro muttered before allowing his adept control over the hydrification technique to fuel his arm's alteration. Despite his vigorous attempts, it was obvious something didn't look quite right. . . The arm continued to inflate, but no real muscle tension seemed to be apparent.* - Sun Aug 30 19:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) tilted his head as he watched the cascading arm descend upon his current position.
   "What the?!" Ikaro questioned, his feet prepared to avoid the incoming strike, albeit, it halted just before impact could be established.
   "Damn, I see. . ." Ikaro chimed before allowing his dampened optics to rest upon his arm once again.

   With that, his chakra began to fuel it's static motions, allowing it's perplexed stature to expand in accordance to the proportion of flesh currently being transfused into water on a particulate stage. His veins pulsed as his arm continued to expand.
   "It's harder than I originally expected." He muttered in a solemn tone; albeit, his body remained focused upon the action at hand. 

   His hair flickered within the wind as a brisk breeze washed in.
   "Don't worry. I've got this."* - Sun Aug 30 20:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched his brows once more, his eyes now plastered upon the ever prominent growth his arm was displaying. 
   "I think I'm almost there." He announced as he quickly configured his posture and in turn, alligned himself with his chakra's designated motion. His arms pulsed fourth as a behemoth shaped monstrosity sprouted fourth from his bicep as his mucles began to configure accordingly.

   "I'm getting closer man." Ikaro muttered before completing the final proportions of the technique, albeit, now he needed to focus on actually maintaining his control over the technique in order to allow it to last a prolonged period of time, because at this current rate, it certainly wouldn't be lasting too long.* - Sun Aug 30 20:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) Hogo, Ikaro OOCS: (LOL)
Hogo, Ikaro OOCS: (Aiight, lemme count these RPs real quick)

* - Sun Aug 30 20:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched his brows briefly.
   "Hey."* - Mon Aug 31 11:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) // "You can wait, Tethys." Ikaro muttered before withdrawing his katana from the confinements of his holster. The slick, black blade flickered within the cascading mist that engulfed the village in it's usual hushed tone. 

   "Nice. . ." The young male muttered as he shuffled backwards in an effort to avoid the blade's evident trajectory.
   "You're quick, I can't deny that. . ."

   With that in mind, Ikaro advanced fourth, feinting towards the left before moving off towards the right before sending a slick vertical slash towards his opponent's shoulder. His main intetnions resting along the lines of delivering a simple shallow - nothing more. The spar was only just beginning.* - Mon Aug 31 12:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) allowed his left hand to rise upwards in response to Orakuru's attack, albeit, the guard he had established wasn't capable of negating the full effects of his opponent's kick. A spar without the use of chakra cancelled out his main form of evasion - which in truth, made the entire scenario a lot harder for himself as an individual. Regardless, it barely mattered. At the end of the day, he would be pulling out something positive from this entire ordeal.

   "Nice. . ." he uttered - his left hand currently resting upon his opponent's initial point of impact. "I have to say, you're pretty strong too."

   With that, Ikaro advanced fourth once more, allowing his Katana to descend upon his opponent in a vertical state before swiftly transitioning into a horizontal slash which was set to strike his opponent across the forefront of his abdomen.* - Mon Aug 31 12:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) shuffled backwards in response to the primary slash, albeit, it missed his being completely. The assault didn't end there though. Within moments, Ikaro found his eyes resting upon Orakuru who had taken up a comfortable stance upon the pinnacle of his blade - a moment later, he had pounced fourth with ease, before sending a manic kick his way.

   Naturally, Ikaro hadn't been expecting such a sporadic movement, and as a result, his response had to be perfect. Sadly, it wasn't perfect.

   His katana rose upwards, allowing the blunt edge of the blade to meet the male's kick in a defensive manner, albeit, once again, his defensive response was simply not good enough. It was obvious the style of fighting he had adopted for this spar had not clearly sunk in yet. With that being said, pain slowly seeped into the forefront of his abdomen; his body shuffling backwards in response to the attack.

   "Nice. . ." He muttered before immediately returning his own attack; a diagonal strike towards his opponent's thigh. He didn't want to give Orakuru any time to fully recover from the jutsu he had just executed. He needed to take every opportunity that was presented to him.* - Mon Aug 31 12:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) chuckled briefly, his eyes still plastered upon his opponent as usual. His stance adjusted briefly as he entered a far more loose setting. With that, he advanced fourth once again. Fully aware that his opponent would more than likely counter a recycled tactic, Ikaro decided to mix it up. He approached via the left, feinting a vertical strike as he had done previously, however, rather than attack via the right, Ikaro allowed the feint to transition into a simple horizontal strike that was set to hit his opponent's respective arm if nothing was done to stop the approach.

   "You're pretty good, y'know?"* - Mon Aug 31 12:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) // "I just hope those cuts don't start slowing you down. . . Making you sluggish, or even just making normal movement inconvenient. That would honestly be such a shame, wouldn't it?" Ikaro stated, a light chuckle quickly escaping his lips.

   With that, Ikaro adjusted accordingly, advancing fourth once more, his movements followed be a slick diagonal strike towards his opponent's sword wielding arm.
   "Heh, I wish there were more sword users like you, man."* - Mon Aug 31 13:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) allowed a dull smile to grace his lips. "I guess you could say that. Whatever it strikes gets paralysed. I call it Kokuto - Black Blade. Fitting, right?" Ikaro muttered; his eyes closer to Orakuru's own than ever before simply due to the tense clash that was currently underway - however, holding this postion forever wasn't likely. Orakuru was strong - very strong.

   With that being said, he quickly shuffled backwards, breaking the clash apart and taking up a respectable stance away from his opponent.
   "That was good. Very good. I enjoyed it, but for now, I'm done."* - Mon Aug 31 13:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) simply ignored Muhhamed.* - Mon Aug 31 16:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) slowly pinches the bridge of his nose.* - Mon Aug 31 17:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched his brows briefly as his opponent seemingly vanished from his immediate line of sight.
   "Well, that's interesting. . ." Ikaro uttered; however, as soon as his hushed tone made contact with the air around him, something sinister made contact with his leg.

   "Woah. . ." Ikaro exclaimed as he felt the tugging motion, albeit, a petty technique such as that wasn't going to get the best of him. As soon as initial contact was form, Ikaro's leg displaced itself and within moments, the appendage had become an absent limb in a aqueous state.

   "Nice try." Ikaro muttered before backing up swiftly - at this point, both of his legs had taken up the illusive state he was capable of manifesting.
   "But you'll need to try a bit harder." He stated before unsheathing his sword and awaiting his opponent's next movement.* - Mon Aug 31 18:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) remained within his static state - His hydrification technique now taking over the entirety of his body and in turn, negating the attacks the clones were capable of dishing out.
   "Seriously, didn't you just learn anything?" Ikaro questioned; his body as still as ever - His aquatic state constantly shifting as his opponent's attacks shifted through his body.

   "You can't just keep using basic tactics and expect a different result. That's insanity." Ikaro chimed before taking a step back out of the triple-way formation. He paused once again. It was about time he made his own move.* - Mon Aug 31 18:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) literally facepalmed as he watched the scorching hot ball of fire approach his position.
   "This guy seriously hasn't learned anything." Ikaro announced - his body seemingly taking the majority of the heat in itself due to the current state he was positioned within.

   With a small sigh, Ikaro returned to his base form, allowing the technique to fade away and his body to enter a state of solidity.
   "Looks like you need a doctor. . . And I guess I win?"* - Mon Aug 31 18:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) slowly backed away. . .* - Mon Aug 31 18:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) slowly pushed fourth, hurling the male up and slotting him over his shoulder.* - Mon Aug 31 18:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) whispers: (Wyn coded himself to have 3x the exp boost from everyone else) - Mon Aug 31 19:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) approached in his, as usual, nonchalant manner; however, everythign changed when Koeki attacked.

   Within moments, he had been tossed aside like an idle piece of meat - his body making instant impact with the wall on the opposite side of the wall. 
   "Urgh. . ." he groaned, albeit, he was slowly slipping in and out of consciousness. In all honesty, he was absolutely certain he had broken a lot of bones. One too many.* - Mon Aug 31 21:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) simply remained static. He was definitely knocked out.* - Mon Aug 31 21:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) is still knocked out. He probably requires medical attention.* - Mon Aug 31 21:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched his brows briefly as the serene ulse of chakra circulated through his static body, however, he remained as still as possible - not a single muscle within his body making a move.* - Mon Aug 31 21:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) slowly arose from his crude slumber.
   "What the hell?" He uttered, his body still recovering from the chaotic sucker-flick.* - Mon Aug 31 21:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched his brows briefly before slowly rising to his feet.
   "Man. . . Sensei, next time you plan on hitting me across the world, please notify me. . ." Ikaro muttered as he slowly adjusted his current stature.* - Mon Aug 31 21:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched his brows momentarily befre forming a brisk array of seals. His eyes rested upon the benevolent flow of water than slowly washed over the banks of Kirigakure, and in all honesty, it appeared as if the source in itself was set to be the source of Ikaro's training. Within his arsenal, the young male had a wide array of techniques he was still eager to master; however, it seemed as if the process in itself was set to take a long time.

   Regardless, the first technique on the list was Mizu Bunshin no Jutsu - A technique he had nearly fully mastered.* - Tue Sep 01 08:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) swiftly formulate a single seal, allowing a multitude of water to rise fourth from the depths of the river. within moments, his chakra became the soul substance holding the vast quantity of water Ikaro had aquired and within moments, it had been altered in such a fashion that it could almost be considered a clone. Once again, Ikaro had activated the Mizu Bunshin Technique and he had done so with sucess and adequate control. A small smirk engulfed the forefront of his visage as he slowly looked over the replica he had manifested.

   "Good. . . It's getting better and better." Ikaro muttered before allowing his chakra to descend into a lax state - his bunshin fading from view once more. His eyes flickered from left to right as another, brisk array of seals were formulated. Another technique was in the making.* - Wed Sep 02 08:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) allowed his lips to form a perplexed motion as his chakra rose upwards in a defined fashion. Within moments,  a chaotic stream of water cascaded from the tips of his defined muzzled before making contact with the surrounding air. A small smirk remained plastered upon the young male's lips; however, the power behind the technique in itself was fairly lacking. This was honestly the first time in a long time that he had devoted a decent training session to himself, however, it was fairly obvious that it was heavily required.

   "Water Style: Raging Waves!" Ikaro announced in a triumphant manner!* - Wed Sep 02 08:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched his lips once again upon the completion of his primary useage of the jutsu. His eyes flickered over the cascading visage of Kirigakure itself - He had this in the bag.
   Within moments, another set of defined seals were formed in a slick fashion as a defined pulse of chakra washed ver the forefront of his idle body. With that, he allowed a dim pulse of chakra to rush fourth from his body and up his throat and within moments, the same jutsu had been performed in rapid sucession. Without a doubt, this time around, the jutsu in itself looked a lot stronger than its previous alteration, however, work still needed to be applied to the core foundation of its being.

   "Again!" Ikaro muttered before running through the required seals once again. His lips parted as another jet stream of aqeous substance expanded from the core of his body.
   "Yes. . . Better." Ikaro announced as the fortified jutsu flickered throgh the air before making contact with the water before his being. A small smile escaped his visage, however, his nonchalant attitude remained somehow fixated upon his being.* - Wed Sep 02 08:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) formed the same seals again. "I need to keep this up." Ikaro announced before running through the same seals again. Once again, a defined bursted pulse of chakra was expelled from the tips of his lips and in as slick a manner as possible, Ikaro released all bearings from the jutsu's confinements, allowing a defined, yet chaotic sense of energy to rupture fourth along with the aid of it's devastation. 
   "Sweet."* - Wed Sep 02 08:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) // With that, Ikaro slowly ambled fourth, leaving the area and duely going about his normal business.* - Thu Sep 03 11:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) Arched his brows briefly before allowing his eyes to rest upon the horizon which stood in the background of Kirigakure. His feet shuffled from left to right as he swiftfully examined the full capabilities the mountainous range held; however, in the end it was completely irrelevant. This was partly due to the fact all the mountain actually offered was an insight over the land of Kirigakure, however, its positioning certainly didn't offer any permanent benefits to the infamous village. Despite that petty fact, Ikaro had a certain task he had to fulfil in order to continue with his training; as such, he needed to pay homage to both Hogetsu and Norrigana, along with their unborn child. The trio had suffered a fate that simply wasn't fair and as a result, Ikaro was the one suffering. His life had entered an inevitable stage of undesirability. He needed to alter the path he was slowly diving into, however, it seemed as if the only plausible way to achieve such a feat was to train to his heart's content. With that being said, Ikaro allowed his hands to rise upwards in a slick fashion as he processed the following events.* - Thu Sep 03 12:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) First of all, he needed to work on his manipulative capabilities, and it seemed like the only plausible way in which he could do that was through the use of multiple water release based techniques. His body flickered upon the spot as his hands rose upwards in an equally slick fashion. His eyes darted from left to right as a translucent glare of energy flickered through his condescending body. The process required to learn the technique he was attempting to muster seemed more than impossible. In all his efforts, he actually hadn't been capable of fully altering the perception of the water he was in control over, which in turn, led to his untimely incapability of actually completing the jutsu at hand. Regardless of that simple fact, Ikaro was aware that he simply couldn't give up on the task at hand. 

   With that in mind, Ikaro allowed the seal he had formulated a comfortable grasp over to seemingly pulse outwards in a crazed fashion as he allowed a small rupture of energy to flow through his gaping maw. Within moments, a blue toned aqueous current came gushing fourth from the confinements of his belly, sending a chaotic sense of lust through his being. Within moments, his water based capabilities were unleashed upon the resting vicinity in a swift fashion. His chakra pulsed once more as the water descended upon the grassy plains of Kirigakure no Sato; albeit, they resided within the mountain alone. Ikaro allowed a small grin to escape his perplexed lips; his hands tightening as he focused upon the seal. As the gushing stream of water flickered through the air; a sense of humility struck the male's core as he watched the aquatic substance flicker within the air. His body focused upon the very fundamentals of the technique in itself; his body barely capable of mustering the chakra control required to alter its direction appropriately. Regardless of that bewildering fact; Ikaro continued onwards. His body shifted once more as he allowed the gushing stream of water to flicker within the air. With each second that passed, his control over the stream weakened, however, his manipulative capabilities increased.* - Thu Sep 03 12:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) "Alright. . . Nearly there. . . Ninja Art: Watergun!" Ikaro announced, allowing the gushing stream of water to become seemingly revitalised via the use of his chakra alone. His body shifted upon the spot as he allowed a surge of energy to break through the main structure of his being. Within moments, his hands rejoined together as the single seal of confrontation was formed once more. Within moments, a chaotic array of destructive potential ruptured through Ikaro's body as he watched the wave flicker from left to right in direct response to Ikaro's own motions. A small smile manifested upon the bearings of his lips as he slowly observed the ominous alterations currently underway within the utilisation of the jutsu itself. A small smile escaped his lips as he overlooked the dastardly execution.

   "Good, good." Ikaro muttered in accordance to the entire ordeal. His hands flickered from left to right once more as the jutsu faded away from view upon its evident completion; his eyes still resting upon the overlooking Kirigakure. With a slight nod, Ikaro allowed his body to phase from view before another seal was quickly formatted in rapid succession. Within moments, he allowed a brisk wave of chakra to surge through his body as an alternative jutsu was utilised this time. 

   "Suirou no Jutsu!" Ikaro announced before allowing his right hand to rise upwards in a slick motion. Upon the completion of that simple action, he allowed a brief undertone of energy to sweep through his body as the water that had been previously utilised as an essence of the watergun technique was pulled upwards into an encapsulating orb of water. With that being said, Ikaro allowed his body to shift from left to right once more as he allowed his mind to rest upon the effects of the orb. The sphere in itself was designed to hold nearly anything and in reality, it should have been perfect for this moment; especially when you take into account the density of its being. More than likely, it wasn't the most practical jutsu to use when attempting to utilise a manipulative skill on your core element; however, it surely would benefit him in some way or another. Regardless of that petty fact; Ikaro shifted upon the spot before advancing fourth once more. His body shifted from left to right as he moved with the orb in itself, something that shouldn't have been possible. His mind ran from left to right as he attempted to manipulate the orb in the appropriate fashion.

   "Crap!" Ikaro muttered, his body faltering under the weight of the jutsu alone. The act he had tried to undergo had resulted in failure; however, he was clearly aware that he needed to keep trying.* - Thu Sep 03 12:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) "Alright. . . Come on. . ." Ikaro muttered. His eyes revived themselves as he allowed his vision to glaze of what was left of the orb. Simply nothing, however, it was better than nothing. His hands rose upwards as he formed the all too familiar seal once more, allowing his body to run through the appropriate control formulas required to execute the jutsu without fail. The manipulative side of the spectrum was beyond impossible at this current moment in time, however, he needed to work on it in order to become what he had always dreamed of becoming. He needed to surpass everyone who stood within his way and at this current moment in time, it seemed as if he was nowhere near doing so. Hogetsu was a lifeline away from Ikaro's current capabilities and it seemed as if the gap between the duos ceased to narrow. Despite Hogetsu's untimely demise, Ikaro was determined to overcome his shortcomings and eventually overcome Hogetsu's might, even though he was now resting in the other lands.

   "Don't worry Hogetsu. I'll surpass you. . ." Ikaro muttered before running through the appropriate seals once more. His chakra exceeded his body as his reserves tumbled briefly. His eyes flickered onwards, his vision placed upon the setting sun. A small smirk ran past his pursed lips as a chuckle followed suit.

   "Then I'll avenge you." With that, Ikaro allowed a captivating array of water to escape his lips and embark upon the terrain below. His eyes flickered fourth as he observed the evident alterations within his technique alone. Without a doubt, he was slowly getting better and at this current moment, manipulating the direction of his Syrup technique seemed like the best way to actually embark upon achieving manipulation capabilities. If he was capable of manipulating water alone, he would, without a doubt, earn a fiery name for himself within Kirigakure. He needed to prove himself accordingly and in turn, take his nation through the primary phase of enlightenment! His goals were above all else and in order to achieve his goals, he needed to give up everything. This was something Ikaro clearly understood and in all honesty, there was no bypassing the fate he had crafted for himself. Regardless of that trivial matter, the syrup technique he had unsheathed upon the wet, mossy plains of the mountain shifted within the air as the same, repeated seal, ran through the appropriate motions  to actually complete the jutsu at hand. His body shifted from left to right in accordance as he watched the orb of water move within the air. A small laugh escaped his tone as the ethereal form the jutsu depicted faded from view upon the alteration of its form and direction!

   "I'm doing it! I'm actually doing it!" Ikaro shouted; however, his concentration was breached. With that, the jutsu descended upon the floor, thus dually ending his attempt!* - Thu Sep 03 14:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) seemingly appears at the top of the gate - don't question it - I need some RP.* - Thu Sep 03 15:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched his brows briefly before allowing his nonchalant visage to seemingly wash away.* - Thu Sep 03 16:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) allowed his hands to slowly sway away from their previously adopted static state.
   "So you're the one who killed Norrigana and her child?" Ikaro questioned - his chest seemingly losing control as his breath escaped him. * - Thu Sep 03 16:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) shook his head briefly; his eyes now resting upon his very own feet.* - Thu Sep 03 16:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) Mariana thinks: This nigga stays lying about his name.
Hogo, Ikaro says: Don't make this difficult. Noriko is going to want to know who you are. Just give me your real name.
Mariana says: Wanna know his name?
Hogo, Ikaro says: That way, you two can settle this without more people bein- Yes. . .* - Thu Sep 03 17:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) simply shrugs in response.* - Thu Sep 03 17:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched a single, pale brow before swiftly withdrawing his midnight black katana from the deep reaches of his holster. Within moments, he had hopefully closed down the distance between both him and his opponent, and in turn, opened up the spar with a generic attack towards the forefront of his opponent's body via the use of a simple horizontal strike.
   "Let's see how good you are first."* - Thu Sep 03 18:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) allowed a smal smirk to manifest upon the forefront of his lips; however, it certainly didn't match his vivid, yet sporadic movements. His eyes flickered from left to right as he traced her attacks with care and finesse. Another kenjutsu user to spar and another one to contend with.

   Upon the first, and primary attack, Ikaro allowed his own sword to rise upwards in an effort to deflect it's potency. As for the secondary strike which had been sent fourth via the use of a rotation, Ikaro shuffled upon the spot briefly, side stepping to the left and allowing the blade to whizz past him. With those actions in mind, if he was indeed applicable to do so, Ikaro was set to counter attack with a ferocious wave of speed. He was certainly moving a lot quicker than previously noted. His first strike was set to hit Violet upon the arm via the flat of his blade. His secondary attack came fourth in a fairly dynamic fashion as Ikaro allowed his blade to slowly drop down and out of his primary strike in an effort to land an intimidating flat-sided attack against her hip.* - Thu Sep 03 18:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched his brows briefly before slowly taking a step back and coming to a complete halt.
   "Sorry, I have something I've remembered I need to do." Ikaro announced as he ambled off.* - Thu Sep 03 18:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) dips.* - Fri Sep 04 14:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched a single, mundane brow as Tethys seemingly sent a single jab towards the insect-loving male's visage, albeit, he could care less. With that, he slowly followed Tethys to wherever they're next destination may lay.* - Fri Sep 04 18:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) allowed a dull, nonchalant gaze to slowly rest upon the arrival of Yan.* - Fri Sep 04 18:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) shook his head before allowing his pursed lips to part and in turn, release a calm string of words.
   "He deserved it."* - Fri Sep 04 18:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) nodded briefly before slowly making his way down the streets of Kirigakure no Sato - It seemed as if his mission involved actually leaving the village - How tedious.* - Fri Sep 04 19:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) whispers: (I managed to buy 300 troops from pocket money for the village. We @ 4.3k now) - Sun Sep 06 06:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) whispers: (Alister solo'd konoha and made Zetsumo lose a heart) - Sun Sep 06 06:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) whispers: (No. Fucking. WAY!) - Sun Sep 06 06:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched a single, mundane brow as his enthusiastic smile slowly flickered from view. . . 
   "Okay. . . Right."* - Sun Sep 06 15:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) slowly pinched the bridge of his nose before quickly altering the conversation.
   "That girl over there..." - he paused before pointing towards Setsuna. "Wants you to train her in medicine and all that - I guess it's up to you at this point now."

   Another paused escaped his idle frame. "Also, I got my own squad. . . So. . ."* - Sun Sep 06 15:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) whispers: What perk did you want with Battlehardened? - Sun Sep 06 17:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) whispers: I don't give those out. Lol. - Sun Sep 06 17:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) whispers: As for the puppet, lemme do it now. - Sun Sep 06 17:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chiyari(Guujin) whispers: Of course not. . . - Sun Sep 06 19:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chiyari(Guujin) whispers: It seems we have to intervene. - Sun Sep 06 19:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched a single, mundane brow as his eyes flickered over the cascading scene. Two clones had been manifested before the female's real body and in turn, formed an effective barrier between both Ikaro and herself. It seemed as if Kenjutsu was out of the question for now; however, Ikaro held a variation of strategies which would help him effectively counter the situation.

   "Well, I suppose I'll show you what I've got." The young male uttered before allowing his digits to rise upwards and in turn, form the appropriate amount of seals required for the inevitable casting of his very own technique. His lips pursed as his chest expanded - within seconds, a chaotic blast of high pressure water escaped the core of Ikaro's body with the intent of slamming into the dual clones and effectively washing them away along with Lera herself, all the while, dealing a fair amount of brunt force.* - Mon Sep 07 13:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched a single brow before slowly advancing fourth. One clone had been taken down; another remained. From what it seemed like, both figures of Lera had dissapeared from view and as a result, it seemed as if the waiting game was to become an evident case.

   With that being said, Ikaro slowly withdrew his Katana from his sheath; his arm quickly expanding in response to his vivid motions. Within seconds, the bandages that had surrounded his right arm faded away, leaving only a steroid induced appendage.

   "I suppose I can wait."* - Mon Sep 07 14:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) shook his head quickly; his eyes now plastered upon the rive of mud that quickly approached his being. With that, a small sigh escaped the male's lips. His arm quickly decreased in size - it was fairly evident his opponent liked to stay out of range and since it wasn't a serious fight but more or less a spar, he didn't see the point in pursuing her to a considerable extent. His katana was quickly sheathed as the river approached his being, and with a swift, singular swoop, Ikaro attempted to hurl himself out of the river's direct path, all the while, keeping his eyes plastered upon what he could only assume was the original Lera.

   The second phase of Lera's assault came into play as a genjutsu quickly flustered through his mind's eyes, albeit, due to his above average knowledge in the art itself, he was quickly able to analyse it's existance and in turn, form a single hand seal and summon the Kai technique to his aid. With that, if he was indeed capable of pulling off the technique, he paused, his eyes resting upon Lera once again - he awaited her own move.
   * - Mon Sep 07 14:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) allowed a single seal to escape his being. Within moments, via the use of the excess water which was a direct result of his previous water release techniques, a clone manifested itself with ease before taking up a position before Ikaro himself. Ikaro pursed his lips before allowing a dry, stoic voice to escape his body.
   "You're pretty good for a genin." He uttered as his clone formulated a brief array of seals before pausing.

   With that, Ikaro's mundane appearance flickered from view as he quickly advanced fourth, unsheathing his katana and sending fourth a quick horizontal slash, followed by a threatening vertical approach. He was completely aware of Lera's use of Kawarimi and he could only hope to counter such an action.

   If his two primary actions were indeed successful, Ikaro's clone was prepared to fire off a jet of water towards the landing point of Lera's Kawarimi technique.* - Mon Sep 07 14:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched a single brow as he quickly approached Lera's direct position. A small smile enveloped the forefront of his lips. His body shifted briefly as his attack came to a hault due to the sheer force placed behind the wind release technique; however, that all changed upon the distortion of his physical form. His body rippled and shifted as he quickly dropped to the floor, allowing the excess layers of the technique that had not struck him to blow overhead as he became a pseudo puddle. A small chuckle escaped his cascading body as he rose fourth once again, springing to life from the puddle-esque state he had inherited and once again, advancing fourth with his attack as previously stated - granting his clone the opportunity to hopefully strike.* - Mon Sep 07 15:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched a single brow before allowing his hands to rise upwards; a single handseal being formed within the presence of his repetitive traits. With that, his lips pursed as a dull voice escaped him.
   "Well, I think I'm done for now. . . " Ikaro announced, pausing midway through his technique and in turn, allowing his body to enter it's usual nonchalant state. His clone dispersed as he allowed a single index finger to rise upwards; without further due, it was plastered upon Lera.

   "Do you, by any chance, have a squad?" Ikaro enquired; his eyes attempted to keep a decent view of her over the basking flames.* - Mon Sep 07 15:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) flickers off into the distance~.* - Mon Sep 07 15:26:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched a single brow before advancing fourth. His mundane tone seemingly flickered through the air as his eyes remained fixed upon his set destination. He was beyond aware that the overall outcome of the mission was beyond simple - I mean, it was simply delivering a fairly vast influx of materials to a nearby Samurai settlement - Something he should have done a while ago. Regardless, that barely mattered. He was aware of what needed to be done and it would be done without failure.

   With that being said, Ikaro advanced fourth, his eyes flickering from left to right as he co-ordinated through the vast wasteland that rested between Kirigakure and the initial settlement itself. The journey alone was tedious, however, with enough dedication, Ikaro was bound to achieve the required task. Regardless, the male pressed onwards, his eyes moving into the fray of the scene almost immediately. 

   "Nearly there." He muttered; his optics now resting upon the forefront of the area's gates. A small smirk encapsulated the forefront of his mouth as he observed the vast multitude of possibilities available to his being around here. Maybe he could even obtain a new sword for himself? The possibilities were indeed endless; however, his primary objective was set to be put before his own personal gains. With that being said, Ikaro pressed onwards.

   Upon reaching the applicable area of disposal, he simply dropped off the required items, spun upon the bearings of his feet and adjusted his posture accordingly. A small smile escaped his body as he quickly pushed onwards, leaving the area as quickly as he had initially arrived!* - Wed Sep 16 12:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) allowed his arms to rise upwards in a slick manner as his optics scanned over the multitude of students that rested before him. A small smile escaped his lips as he allowed his body to slowly lean over their descended figures. All of them had enrolled into the Water Release class Ikaro was temporarily running and as a result, he was going to train them accordingly,* - Wed Sep 16 13:34:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) allowed his palms to slowly envelope the forefront of his face; hiis features slowly faded from view as he avoided the urge to break down. As a result, the information he had been presented with was quickly replaced with denial. There wasn't a way in which he was going to simply accept it.
   "I'll be back soon. I'm not going to do anything stupid. . . . I just need to see it with my own eyes." Ikaro uttered as his hands quickly returned to their standard, static position.

   "I'll be back. . ."

   With that, Ikaro intended on leaving the area as quickly as possible.

   "Don't talk to me as if you know me. . . None of you do. None of you understand how many family member's I've had to see die. I said I'll be back, and I will be back. . . I just need to see it for myself. He deserves a burial." 

   Ikaro paused as his eyes were set upon the horizon once again.
   "I'll be back." Ikaro uttered before advancing fourth.* - Fri Sep 18 13:23:12 2015
