<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) nodded briefly before allowing his hands to rise upwards in a slick Within moments, his chakra churned within the core of his body as his lips entered a pursed state. With that, his throat allowed a dull aqeous liquid to slowly engulf his internal structure. Within moments, his rouge'd lips parted as a cascading wave of water escaped his being.

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Where did you get it? - Sun Oct 25 20:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Some random trader - I suspect he was from the Gezo, but I barely remember the event in general. I was pretty young. - Sun Oct 25 20:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Is there anything special about that blade? - Sun Oct 25 20:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Yes. - Sun Oct 25 20:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Whenever it cuts something, it's poisoned surface infects the target and the area struck becomes paralyzed. - Sun Oct 25 20:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Sounds like something that can really come in handy during combat. - Sun Oct 25 21:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: It certainly is. - Sun Oct 25 21:00:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well, I think we both would share a goal that he would've liked us to have. - Sun Oct 25 21:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Do you want to talk inside or outside? - Sun Oct 25 21:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Sure. . . - Sun Oct 25 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Your choice. - Sun Oct 25 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Mhm. I'm fine with it. - Sun Oct 25 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Still didn't say if Inside or Outside. - Sun Oct 25 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So, You do know what we both are meant to do, Right? - Sun Oct 25 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: No. . . - Sun Oct 25 21:55:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: This world has suffered from endless wars. - Sun Oct 25 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: All caused by beliefs being forced on one another . . . Conflict being caused by that happening. - Sun Oct 25 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: The need for villages to assimilate the others. - Sun Oct 25 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Endless people have died cause of them. - Sun Oct 25 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And that's why the wars should be stopped from happening in the first place. - Sun Oct 25 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: But for that, There needs to be someone powerful enough to make it happen. - Sun Oct 25 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You and me,We've both been unknown to the world and I'd like to work with you. - Sun Oct 25 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I want to try and save people . . . Prevent tyrants from starting wars and more. - Sun Oct 25 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: As a man whom you know little about, It might be a lot to ask of you. - Sun Oct 25 21:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: But would you want to do the right thing for the world? - Sun Oct 25 21:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: I suppose. . . However, it depends on what you have in mind. - Sun Oct 25 21:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We will gather info on people, See what troubles the world and try to prevent certain things from happening together. - Sun Oct 25 21:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We'll go under one name . . . Blank -omit-. - Sun Oct 25 21:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: I see. . . - Sun Oct 25 22:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: But . . . I know that we both have yet to know each other better and that we might not be strong enough. - Sun Oct 25 22:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Fair enough. However, how do you know I would be of any assistance to you? - Sun Oct 25 22:00:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: That's why I got a plan. - Sun Oct 25 22:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm already learning under the raccoons. - Sun Oct 25 22:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: They have something good they say . . . I need more trust though. - Sun Oct 25 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I would like you to accompany me to their land whenever that happens . . . Though you would have to sign a contract with the raccons to go there. - Sun Oct 25 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We could perhaps gain a lot of training though while isolated. - Sun Oct 25 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Are you willing to become a raccoon summoner to come and train with me in their homeland? - Sun Oct 25 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: . . . - Sun Oct 25 22:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: I'm certainly not against it. - Sun Oct 25 22:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I've already asked a lot from you, You sure you want to do it with me? - Sun Oct 25 22:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We're most likely going to end up as hermits. - Sun Oct 25 22:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Yes - I don't have much else going for me in life at the moment. - Sun Oct 25 22:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It's better than nothing. - Sun Oct 25 22:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) met the fist bump accordingly before duely sending a swift nod in Kilm's direction.
   "Indeed we will."* - Sun Oct 25 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Better turn that frown upside down since you won't have a reason to keep it anymore. - Sun Oct 25 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Heh. - Sun Oct 25 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Maybe. . . Soon enough. - Sun Oct 25 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Now then, We should go to the square . . . Check out what's going on and then we can try and go to the training area to test out each other's abilities to know each other's strengths and weaknesses. - Sun Oct 25 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You up for that? - Sun Oct 25 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Mhm, fair enough. - Sun Oct 25 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Let's go then. - Sun Oct 25 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Still the spider, They'll have it handled. - Sun Oct 25 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Spider problems. - Sun Oct 25 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Spider problems? - Sun Oct 25 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: What do you mean by that? - Sun Oct 25 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: They have it handled though. - Sun Oct 25 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I suggest we keep going. - Sun Oct 25 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: You sure about that - Or should we help? - Sun Oct 25 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: They had it handled for a while. - Sun Oct 25 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: . . . Right. - Sun Oct 25 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: But we can help. - Sun Oct 25 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If you feel like we should. - Sun Oct 25 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: I'll let you decide. They are your people. - Sun Oct 25 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm, We should then. - Sun Oct 25 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) allowed a brief puddle of water to manifest by the base of his feet. His eyes flickered onwards upon the horizon as his target was met with due ease. With a slight flick of his wrist, Ikaro allowed a manifestation of pure brilliance to rise fourth from the confines of his creation. A series of diverse, yet all the same, excellent, bubbles slowly drifted into position - all the while, Ikaro's hands remained fixed within the confinements of his pockets; his actions beyond nonchalant.

   "This certainly is overkill. . ." the young male uttered before giving way to the six orbs of delicate destruction. Their target was the spider and the spider alone.  His intentions were beyond set.* - Sun Oct 25 22:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Let's get going now. - Sun Oct 25 22:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Mhm. - Sun Oct 25 22:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You ready for the spar? - Sun Oct 25 22:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Whenever you're ready, I suppose. - Sun Oct 25 22:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) allowed his eyes to slowly rest upon the duo who so swiftly took their ascent into the great beyond, albeit, in his usual nonchalant manner, Ikaro remained still - his body barely even taking a step.

   "Nice technique. . . " Ikaro uttered as he slowly evaluated both his opponent's positioning along with his clone.
   "Very nice. . ." He uttered before, finally, allowing his hands to escape the confines of his cloak. With that in mind, a single seal was manifested as a large wave of water ran through the resulting air and towards both Kilm and his clone. It was a start, if anything.* - Sun Oct 25 22:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) allowed his eyes to slowly rest upon the descent of a series of manic fireball-esque figures. A small smile escaped his immediate visage as he slowly processed the events that were currently occuring. With that in mind, Ikaro's being swiftly shifted upon it's stature as he allowed his body to seemingly phase out of tone seconds before the fiery technique's evident target point. - - Hydrification had been put into play.

   "Fire and Earth. What else have you got in store?" Ikaro questioned before returning to his standard form once more and duely awaiting his opponent's response.* - Sun Oct 25 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) allowed a smug smile to quickly enevelope the forefront of his being as the ball of electricty came rushing fourth - a technique he had seen countless times. Despite his opponent's valiant attempts to zap him upon the utilisation of Hydrification, Ikaro had already released it from his being. He had been shocked one too many times to understand how to use hydrification as effectively as possible.

   With that, Ikaro swiftly shuffled towards the right in an attempt to avoid the technique in itself; however, an ounce of electrity grazed his left arm during the process of dodging.
   "Ouch. . ." Ikaro uttered - his right arm was now resting upon the dull wound Kilm had created.
   "If I'd been hit by one of those. . . It would not have been pretty." The young male admitted before allowing his right hand to slowly extend fourth from the safety of the wound and duely form a 'gun' signal.

   "But I'm about to show you something I've never let anyone see. . ." Ikaro uttered before allowing his chakra to release the water induced bullet into the immediate surroundings. His target was the clone, and the clone alone. It seemed as if it was serving no other purpose in this spar and as such, Ikaro could only assume it was the main source of his flight. He had to say, he had never seen a clone capable of such an ability.* - Sun Oct 25 23:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Yeah.. - Sun Oct 25 23:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I know.~ - Sun Oct 25 23:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yo everyone. - Mon Oct 26 08:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: You ready to sign that contract? - Mon Oct 26 08:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Yo. - Mon Oct 26 08:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) whispers: Mhm, I am. - Mon Oct 26 09:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Aight, Follow me. - Mon Oct 26 09:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Mhm. - Mon Oct 26 09:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) nodded briefly - he was clearly aware as to how the entire contract process was initiated; he had seen it done a countless number of times.
   With a slight nod, Ikaro bit upon the edge of his thumb in an effort to release an ounce of blood. With that in place, his hand came cascading down upon the contract as his chakra ran through the core structure of the sanguine liquid. Once contact was initiated within the appropriate place, a slight ounce of energy ruptured through the air as the contract was duely sealed.

   "There." Ikaro uttered before allowing his hand to slowly rise fourth from the contract's confines and once again, return to his cloak. 
   "That's all there is to it, right?" Ikaro questioned; his visage now directed towards Kilm.* - Mon Oct 26 09:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Mon Oct 26 09:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Think we should find Katsune, I want you to meet her. - Mon Oct 26 09:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Fair enough. - Mon Oct 26 09:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Lead the way. - Mon Oct 26 09:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hey. - Mon Oct 26 10:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Trying to train? - Mon Oct 26 10:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Mon Oct 26 10:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hating every minute of it too. - Mon Oct 26 10:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Okay, Thought you'd be here. - Mon Oct 26 10:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well, This is Ikaro. - Mon Oct 26 10:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: The one I told you about. - Mon Oct 26 10:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Hey. - Mon Oct 26 10:02:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And for some reason he looks exactly like me when I was 15 -omit- - Mon Oct 26 10:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: I hope you don't mind me asking. . . But what exactly are you training in? - Mon Oct 26 10:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Earth jutsus, and shadow clones. - Mon Oct 26 10:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Both are a pain. - Mon Oct 26 10:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: I see. . . I still haven't gotten around to even learning Shadow Clone yet. - Mon Oct 26 10:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Neither have I. - Mon Oct 26 10:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Gimme time to master the jutsu and maybe I'll show you how it's done, seeing as you're a friend of Kilm's. - Mon Oct 26 10:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You up for another spar Ikaro right now? - Mon Oct 26 10:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Sure. I don't mind. - Mon Oct 26 10:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Your move. - Mon Oct 26 10:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) began the spar as he always would - A dull manifestation of aqueous substance quickly made it's mark upon the field within a slick instance beneath the soles of his feet.
   "Then let us begin." Ikaro uttered as three, dull orbs of water quickly rose fourth from the confinements of the said puddle. With that in mind, they quickly descended upon the battlefield in a radical motion.* - Mon Oct 26 10:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Eh, Do you know your other family members? Like Tethys's son? - Mon Oct 26 10:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: No. I was out of the village a majority of the time. . . Never met them. - Mon Oct 26 10:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Why were you out of the village? - Mon Oct 26 10:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: To find myself. - Mon Oct 26 10:15:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) allowed a smug smile to escape his visage as the trio of bubbles that had been released quickly altered their pathway. As opposed to seemingly dissapearing into the distance as their mark was not met, they quickly ascended into the sky in an effort to strike Kilm and his clone from behind via the utilisation of a blindspot. 

   The manner in which this maneuver was executed was beyond standard, however. This was indeed the first time Ikaro had utilised his manipulative capabilities against a set individual; however, it was enough. He may not have been capable of manipulating large substances, but when it came to objects the size of this - it was beyond child's play.

   With that action set in stone, Ikaro paused - at this point in time, his ears remained alert as he attempted to track down the hidden clone's location. Ikaro himself was beyond knowledgeable in the technique that had just been utilised - after all, he too had the very same technique.* - Mon Oct 26 10:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) allowed the lower portion of his body to remain vigil as the clones came rushing fourth, and in turn, grabbing a hold of Ikaro's ankles. A small sigh escaped the male's being as his right hand finally left the confinements of his concealed cape.
   Within moments of it's escape, it's being became a completely steroid enhanced mass of destruction that was hellbent on ripping the clone free from the confinements of the dirt, and as such it was set to do. With a quick flick, Ikaro allowed his hand to make contact with one of the clone's own as he attempted to rip it free from the dirt and hurl it into the direct path of flight that the Raiton technique was currently travelling within - He intended on having the Earth clone take the hit for him as Doton was naturally weak to the affects of Raiton and would more than likely take a large amount of set damage.

   With that, Ikaro's hand swung to the opposite side as he allowed his sheer strength, to once again, dominate the field - His fist was set to collide with the derelict dirt and displace the field around him in an effort to break the clone's grasp upon his leg and in turn, gain a fair amount of distance between himself and his opponent once more.
   "Not bad. . . But I dominate in close range too."* - Mon Oct 26 10:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) // "How tedious. . ." Ikaro uttered as an onslaught of attacks came rushing into his being. 

   The arm that had been so previously engulfed into a mass of pure destruction faded from view as Ikaro allowed the left side of his body to position itself in the general direction of the raiton attack - With that, he took the brunt force of the Raiton technique to the best of his capabilities; however, the resulting impact did send a severe jolt of energy through Ikaro's core system, along with the result of a large array of annoying burns.
   "Arh. . " Ikaro uttered before allowing his hearing to zone in upon the barrage of spears that currently approached his current position.

   Not a single word was uttered from the male's mouth; however, as his lips parted, a wile wave of water duely departed from his confines. Within meer moments, his body was towering over the field as his chakra swiftly pumped through the evident, wide scale technique. Within moments; Ikaro had created a more than adept source of water and in turn, propelled himself beyond the reach of the Earthen spikes.

   With a simple flick of his wrist, all the while midair, the water he had just conjured up quickly shifted in state as it roared fourth upon the battlefield via the shape of a malevolent vortex.* - Mon Oct 26 10:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) allowed a single seal to escape his being - with that, another mass of water appeared by Ikaro's side - A water clone at that.

   Once that simple action was complete, another seal left Ikaro's body as his being slowly sunk into the confinements of the earth via the use of the same technique Kilm's last clone was using. At this point, the real Kilm would have been left unaware of the real Ikaro's position.

   With that in mind, Ikaro swiftly advanced onwards through the ragged terrain.* - Mon Oct 26 10:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) slowly looked back upon the clone that had swiftly attached itself to Ikaro's being. With that, Ikaro allowed a swift jab to escape his being as he attempted to stab the clone within it's arm, given the confined space. If his action was indeed set to go through, a pause would simply escape his being as the wait began.* - Mon Oct 26 11:06:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched a single brow in response to the clone's avid ascent. It didn't take a genius to realise what was happening. With that, Ikaro quickly descended even further than previously intended; however, the blast from Kilm's technique certainly did have an effect on both him and his current health. Raiton was beyond annoying at this point.

   Regardless, upon reaching a suitable distance; Ikaro allowed his body to resurface shortly thereafter.
   "I'm done for now." He uttered before sheathing his blade.* - Mon Oct 26 11:19:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Fuck me. - Fri Nov  6 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) barely altered in position as the molecules of air around his being seemingly shifted in concentration as a dense sense of dread sunk into the air - He had no idea as to why Ketsu had randomly attacked Lera in such a savage manner, albeit, he had to respond accordingly.
   "Ketsu - What the hell are you doing?" It was beyond evident that Ikaro wasn't clearly aware of the truth behind the situation at hand.* - Fri Nov  6 19:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched a single brow before seemingly pacing fourth.
   "I can't simply stay out of this. . ." Ikaro uttered as droplets of water seemingly manifested around his being. As he continued his advance onwards, the vapour within the air bent to his will until a variety of unique blobs of water flickered between reality and fantasy around his illusive figure.

   "Leave. . . Now." Ikaro uttered before allowing his right hand to rise fourth into the air; a single index finger resting upon the dull heavens.
   "No one has to die today." He stated before allowing the countless blobs of water that rested around his being to seemingly take form - all of them now representing that of bubbles. A pause escaped his being as his finger went limp. With it's command, an army of cascading figures descended upon Ortho's position in an attempt to assault him with a barrage of powerful ammunition.* - Fri Nov  6 19:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ghost Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm rooting for Ikaro and erm . . . Lera. - Fri Nov  6 20:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ghost Kilm(Vysasi) says: I need popcorn. - Fri Nov  6 20:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Ghost kilm is a bitch -omit- - Fri Nov  6 20:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched a single brow as his sentence was cut short. He slowly observed the electrical pulse of energy approach his being. A slight smirk appeared on the forefront of his visage as he applied a pulse of chakra to his feet before vaulting fourth, towards his left and launching his cascading attack as previously stated.

   With that, Ikaro allowed his hands to return into the confines of his lips as he made contact with the floor once more. With that in mind, Ikaro's lips formulated a slightly pursed effect as he allowed a chaotic sum of water to seemingly manifest within the core of his being. His right hand rose upwards as a single gun-esque signal was formed.

   With a slight alteration in it's actual chakra formula, that being there were no seals in it's creational process, Ikaro allowed the chaotic technique to rip through the surrounding area with such force and destruction it was almost impossible to comprehend; however, the jutsu came as nothing more than a bullet sized orb of liquid. If anything, this shot was a warning. If it did infact hit it's mark, it would cleanly pierce through Ortho's leg. He was giving the male a chance to leave.

   All the while, Ikaro continued to create more excess water via the vapour resting within the air. As usual, it slowly drifted around his being in a blob-esque motion. There was no real form to it.* - Fri Nov  6 20:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ghost Kilm(Vysasi) says: Being an eternal spectator is awesome. - Fri Nov  6 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ghost Kilm(Vysasi) says: I should go to the Gezo land and poke the leader. - Fri Nov  6 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched a single brow in response to the formation of a dome which seemingly halted his escape. It seemed as if his opponent was in possession of a whole range of elements; however, so was Ikaro. Within moments of his capture, his body sunk into the ground, evading view and seemingly drifting off into the confines of the earth. Within moments, assuming everything had gone according to plan, Ikaro would meet the air once more - at this point, his eyes simply rested upon Ortho.

   Without a single movement, the hole from which he had appeared from rumbled with ferocity as a wave of water escaped it's being and began floating around Ikaro once more. With a slight flick of his cloak, his lips entered a pursed state of comfort once again. With that, almost instantly, coupled with the pre-existing water Ikaro had been creating while fighting, he allowed the cascading wave of water to join fourth with a jutsu of Ikaro's own creation. It was set to collide with Ortho in a fairly chaotic fashion.* - Fri Nov  6 20:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) paused mid-way through his escape as his hearing kicked in - the floor shifted around him as Ortho's chakra seeped through the surrounding area. The spikes escaped the confinements of the ground in an effort to pierce Ikaro's being, albeit, they were set to meet nothing more than water as Ikaro was set to hydrify the appropriate body parts in accordance to the technique's execution. With that, he allowed the technique to come to a brief halt as he formed the appropriate seal and descended into the confinements of the ground.

   Despite his valiant efforts to escape, he was indeed unfortunately caught by the effects of Ortho's raiton technique; however, it should be noted that he avoided the worst of it thanks to the depth he had travelled. A variety of burn marks were now etched upon the surface of his skin - battle scars, if you must. His first blow of the match had been a fairly impressive one on his opponent's part.

    If all was set to go as expected, Ikaro would arrived on the surface, as previously state. However, this time around, it would be beyond evident that he had taken a hit or two while his figure had been engulfed by Ortho's combination of techniques.* - Fri Nov  6 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ghost Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well ain't this a fun bout. - Fri Nov  6 20:58:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched a single brow in response to the appearance of the air bullets; however, as the bullets quickly approached his current position, Ikaro allowed a wave of water to run fourth from the air before him in an effort to subdue the bullets as they approached his position - with that, Ikaro allowed a slight glance to rest upon Lera as he watched Mizumi seemingly attempt to subdue the feminine figure; however, his line of sight was slowly narrowed was slightly halted by the snake's endeavours.

   "Why do you need to kill her?" Ikaro questioned before allowing the water Mizumi had seemingly created to turn upon him upon an instant - it was as if he was actually manipulating Mizumi's own source of water as opposed to his own.    "Behind you, Lera."
The water Mizumi had just conjured up was set to flow straight back into his face, hopefully giving Lera enough time to form an appropriate counter attack.* - Fri Nov  6 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) allowed his wrist to flick in a slightly angelic fashion - the sphere that had formed around Lera was set to be demolished within an instant the moment Ikaro's chakra was capable of infiltrating the masked figure's very own technique; however, his actions ended there. At this point, doubt sunk into the male's soul as Tethy's name, once again, was brought into question. Was he actually doing the right thing at the moment?

   None the less, as the sphere collapsed, Ikaro allowed the excess water it had created to rise fourth in a wall like fashion as Ikaro attempted to shield Lera from Ortho's assault.* - Fri Nov  6 21:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) // "There has to be another way. This isn't how we can achieve peace."* - Fri Nov  6 21:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) allowed his body to liquefy once again as the gust of wind came rushing fourth, and as such, he duely negated the effects of the masked figure's clone's attack via keeping himself stationary.

   "This is no way to achieve piece. More death will only lead us away from that goal, Ortho." Ikaro uttered. He needed the violence to come to a complete halt.

   With that being said, the wall of water he had so previously manifested collected itself around Ortho's being - He intended on catching him swiftly within the grasps of Suirou no jutsu. Hopefully, such a simple act would bring the violence to a conclusion.* - Fri Nov  6 22:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) // Despite the water missing it's mark the first time, it was set to capture Ketsu upon the creation of the seal that would lead to the detonation of the tags - at this point, the water had gathered up more than enough speed to subdue the male, especially when the distance between itself and it's target was considered. - - Hopefully, he'd be capable of capturing his opponent before they could form the tag's seal due to the fact an alternate jutsu had just been used prior to Ikaro's own actions. 

   If so, Ortho would have been halted from any further movement.* - Fri Nov  6 22:24:51 2015
