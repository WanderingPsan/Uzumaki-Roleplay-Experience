<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Ah - You were at the fight the other day. . . When Ortho attempted to take Lera's life. I thought I recognized you.  - Sat Nov  7 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Regardless, are you a complete rookie when it comes to the element, or do you know a thing or two? - Sat Nov  7 19:03:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) nodded slightly as he evaluated the techniques currently in play. 
   "Alright, fair enough." Ikaro uttered as he allowed his hands to slowly enter the confinements of his pockets. With that being said, his gaze swiftly rested upon Index as he slowly evaluated the male himself.

   "But what do I get in return for teaching you?" He enquired; his visage completely dull at this point.* - Sat Nov  7 19:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'll give you money. - Sat Nov  7 19:18:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Alright. I suppose that will do. - Sat Nov  7 19:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) allowed his hands to finally emerge from the confinements of his cloak as a series of seals were created in a fairly lucid manner. His lax tone seemingly radiated with a slight ferocity, albeit, his actions were as such that Index would more than likely be able to copy them with ease.
   "Make sure you're paying attention." Ikaro uttered as the waves below him shifted, giving way to a makeshift singular pillar upon which, he took a stance via the use of suimen. With that in mind, the young Hogo allowed his seals to come to a conclusion, all the while, via the use of the pillar, he drifted further and further away from the coast.

   "This technique is known as Exploding Water Shockwave. You would normally use it if you're in dire need of a more than ample water source." Ikaro uttered before allowing his lips to part as a volcanic eruption of aqeous liquid flooded fourth from the confinements of his mouth. Gallons upon gallons of water was formed with ease.

   A pause escaped his slight frame as the technique came to a makeshift end.
   "Despite this technique being beyond useful for the higher techniques in Suiton which require loads of water, it can be extremely taxing on your chakra." Ikaro stated before allowing his hands to run through the seals once more.
   "Those are the seals. Give it a go whenever you're prepared."* - Sat Nov  7 19:32:54 2015
