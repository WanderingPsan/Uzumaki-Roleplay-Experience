<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) allowed his hand to flicker from target to target as  pulse of energy overwhelmed the forefront of his natural energies. Within moments, the same digit he had so duely demonstrated earlier arose and in turn, he allowed a sense of conviction to flush over his body - With that, he fired away..

   The attack struck it's target, as expected; however, that was far from the end of the advancement. Ikaro shuffled upon the spot once again, firing off another condensed bullet of water towards his intended target.* - Sun Sep 20 08:13:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched a single brow in response to the formation of Ushinawa's seal. Eye contact was inevitable.

   A slight shrug escaped the male's being as Ushinawa's chakra began to influence the core of his mental tenketsu. Within moments, the information Ushinawa required seemingly flowed out of his pursed lips.
   "Violet. . . De la Cruze. She has the blades."* - Tue Sep 29 20:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) allowed a dull, mundane tone to overlook the forefront of his visage. A single hand rose upwards in response to the male's submissive movement as he quickly formulated a defined grip around his katana's hilt.
   "I don't know what just happened. . . Probably that information extraction genjutsu. . . again. . . But you're going to leave her alone." Ikaro uttered before slowly pacing fourth; his cloak flickering backwards within the wind - his chainmail clearly visible at this point.* - Tue Sep 29 20:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: fuck is this shit. - Tue Sep 29 20:10:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) shook his head briefly before advancing fourth once more, releasing the grip from his katana as his feet aimlessly trailed fourth.
   "Things are different now. The blade is an ancient artifact belonging to Kirigakure. It's not yours to steal." Ikaro uttered; his point of placement growing inevitably smaller, albeit, at a slow pace.

   "I'm not even a member of Kirigakure, but I still love that village. What you're doing is idiotic." Ikaro announced before slowly raising a single index finger and directing it towards Ushinawa.
   "Don't. . . do this." Ikaro uttered once more; his index finger seemingly prodding against the air as his attention remained fixed upon Ushinawa.* - Tue Sep 29 20:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) shook his head briefly as the shuriken approached his person. With a quick shuffle, Ikaro moved out of the shuriken's immediate trajectory.

   A pause escaped his being.

   "Who's this girl who's just been silent?" He questioned; his index finger still resting upon Ushinawa's being.* - Tue Sep 29 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: She doesn't seem phased. - Tue Sep 29 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: ... - Tue Sep 29 20:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) allowed a brief chuckle to escape his lips as the secondary shuriken collided with his being, causing him to wince ever so slightly; however, the chainmail could handle that. His main concern was the ongoing events behind him.
   "You're serious, huh?" Ikaro questioned as his ears reacted to the fizzing of the premature tag. With that, his body seemingly flickered out of solidity and in turn, into a state of complete formlessness. The explosion reigned onwards within the surrounding atmosphere, albeit, neigh to no damage had fallen upon Ikaro's shoulders - hopefully.

   With that in mind, using the smoke that had been a direct resultant factor of the tag; Ikaro allowed his hands to rise upwards - his own body regaining it's solidity. Within moments, a series of adept seals escaped his being and with that, an extremely large funnel of water exceeded the screen and thundered downwards upon the field in Ushinawa's general location.* - Tue Sep 29 20:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: We are a family of incest bastards, remember this, Misa. - Tue Sep 29 20:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched a single brow in response to his opponent's very own movements. His primary attack had been evaded, however, a single counter attack wouldn't stop Ikaro within his tracks.

   As usual, his ears reacted to the electrical impulses that ruptured fourth through the air. His body seemingly launched towards the left in an effort to avoid the wide-spread wave of destruction. Barely, and only barely, was he hopefully set to accomplish the task.
   "You don't want to do this!" Ikaro muttered as a single seal escaped his being. With that, three water-based clones rose upwards from the confinements of the ground via the use of the residual water from his previous technique.

   "I honestly don't want to fight you. . . We've both lost so much, but I can't let you get near her." Ikaro uttered before running through another series of seals and in turn, unleashing a gushing stream of water upon the field.* - Tue Sep 29 20:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) allowed a small smirk to escape his being.

   As expected, some of the clones were snuffed out as they were significantly weaker than the original; however, the single clone that did survive was still standing simply on the basis of it's reflexive capabilities. Ikaro on the other hand had already taken up the screen of the flame as an effective way to utilise Hydrification with ease. 

   "Have you nothing to say?" Ikaro uttered as he advanced fourth, a mundane glow still resting upon his gloomy visage. His right hand quickly lunged backwards before forming a sucessive grip around his katana. With a slight pause, a feint had been executed. He could only assume his opponent was expecting a quick slash from his katana; however, what remained hidden was his right hand, which hung in a slick manner by his hip. His digits were etched in the form of a pistol.

   Meanwhile, the clone that had survived the chaotic ordeal quickly formed a single seal before exclaiming 'Water Release: Water Trumpet!' in time with the feint, albeit, this was also a feint in itself. Bluff after bluff after bluff.

   'Bang'. . . Ikaro murmered as his chakra finally manifested around the edge of his finger - hopefully the various distractions he had set in motion would have been more than enough to displace his opponent's attention; however, nothing could be confirmed. Regardless, his goal was to send a small blast of aqueous substance through the forefront of Ushinawa's flesh and straight through his gut. * - Tue Sep 29 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Think it gives 5+_ - Tue Sep 29 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) shook his head briefly as he marvelled upon the ball of lightning that was formed before his being. Within moments, electrical impulses seeped through his body - if he had been within the stage of hydrification, it surely would have been the end.
   A single wheep of anger seeped through Ikaro's body as his body violently reacted to the onslaught of charge that his body had been submitted to.

   "Arh..." Ikaro murmered as he dropped to a single knee; his cloak seemingly flickering from view as nothing more than charred remains.

   "You're good. . . " Ikaro uttered as his clone quickly advanced fourth, it's right arm exploding into a steroid induced bulk of mass. With that, it's right hand quickly withdrew the slick, black blade that rested within the confinements of its holster. - With that in mind, a simple strike escaped it's being. "Let's see how good you are with a sword. . ." The clone snorted within it's advance.

   As these events proceeded, Ikaro quickly rose upwards, albeit, still under the effects of the technique that had just coursed through his body.* - Tue Sep 29 21:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) allowed his visage to enter a complexed state.
   "Ushinawa, hear me out. . . " Ikaro urged as his body allowed the condescending wave of snakes to flicker through his illusive being.

   "This doesn't have to end with either of us dying. . . I just don't want you to hurt anyone in Kirigakure no Sato. . ."

   A pause escaped his being. . .

   "The blades don't belong to you."* - Tue Sep 29 21:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: -- - Tue Sep 29 21:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched a single brow as the snakes flickered through his aqueos state.
   ". . . Ushinawa intends on attacking Kirigakure in order to obtain a set of blades that aren't his. . ." Ikaro uttered, backing up slightly in response to the divine presence Niza was currently radiating.

   - - - The clone that had accompanied him quickly backed up in response to Ikaro's own movements. Within moments, it's steroid induced appendage had returned to it's standard format.* - Tue Sep 29 21:47:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Alright, I suppose. - Tue Oct 20 19:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) allowed his hands to rise upwards as a barrage of slick hand seals were manifested within the blink of an eye. Considering the fact that the individual before his being was indeed the Mizukage, and the Mizukage alone, approaching the situation in his usual, nonchalant manner simply wasn't acceptable.
   "Let us begin." Ikaro uttered as his lips entered their pursed tone once again. Their rouge flavour flickered from view as Ikaro's throat became an exposed funnel of destruction. Within moments, an aqeous substance enveloped the area as it's explosive nature rushed fourth upon the defined battlefield. It's iconic funnel shape certainly gave it a distinct look; however, despite it's vibrant appearance, the technique in itself was certainly set to pack a punch or two.

   With the completion of the technique at hand, Ikaro allowed his right hand to slowly rest upon the hilt of his iconic katana. A pause escaped his being as he awaited the Mizukage's response.* - Tue Oct 20 19:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minabuchi Yakaze(TenaciousDeeznuts) whispers: Dont give me away) - Tue Oct 20 19:44:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched a single brow in response to the shroud of chakra that had seemingly manifested within the immediate area. With a slight twist of his head, Ikaro allowed his body to slowly alter in construction as the base format of his solidarity was quickly replaced with the formation of an aqueous mound of liquid. His body slowly drifted within the confinements of the mist; his ears constantly zoning in and out of submission in an attempt to locate his target.

   'I'll happily wait. . .' Ikaro thought to himself. He had more than enough chakra to maintain the hydrification technique for a substantial amount of time.* - Tue Oct 20 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched a single brow in response to the ambient noise currently radiating north-bound from his static position. 
   "Oh . . ." Ikaro muttered beneath the hushed tone of his breath.

   With a slight shuffle, Ikaro backed up, his eyes resting upon the point in which the noise had originally originated from. The mist certainly didn't help, but none the less, maintaining distance until he could actually fully evaluate his opponent seemed like a fairly practical maneuver.

   "Interesting." The young male uttered as he quickly ran through the formation of a brief array of seals. With that, the water that rested before his being seemingly rose upwards in a cascading formula of destruction; it's structure quickly morphing into that of a vortex that quickly descended upon the field.

   Despite not being aware of his opponent's location, aiming for the origin of the noise seemed like his best bet. The sheer size of the technique at hand would handle the rest. Hopefully, he could wash up the Mizukage via the use of residual damage and that alone.* - Tue Oct 20 20:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: . . .? - Tue Oct 20 20:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) thinks: White eyes. - Tue Oct 20 20:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) shrugged briefly as he felt the steel make contact with the base of his neck.
   "Well, this is interesting, huh? Unfortunately, simply threatening me with raiton won't result in my submission. Too many people know my weakness. You'll have to prove it." Ikaro uttered before displacing upon the spot in his usual fashion. With that, his being quickly spun upon the spot; his right hand now resting upon the base of his liquefied blade. Within moments, it had been exposed, and in turn, Ikaro's entire body returned to it's standard state of solidarity. With that, his arm became engulfed with chakra - it's exterior quickly shifting into that of a steroid induced arm of doom. 

   He could only hope she had been bluffing.

   Regardless, his arm descended upon his opponent in a diagonal fashion as he made a direct attempt to make contact with the Mizukage's shoulder and in turn, deliver what could be considered a fairly suitable blow.* - Tue Oct 20 20:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yes. I forgot I had prior arrangements. I do hope we can continue this another day. - Tue Oct 20 20:55:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm.. - Tue Oct 20 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) arched a single brow as he slowly watched the formation of two idle bolts of katon. Ikaro allowed the destined attack to run through his aqueous being - combating an individual like himself in close proximity wasn't the best of moves.

   "Huh?" Ikaro enquired as he regained his solid state; however, his execution had been nothing short of sloppy. As a result, the Mizukage's primary taijutsu based response made contact - and damn, did that shit hurt. The armour may have been capable of absorbing a small margin of the damage applied; however, it wasn't nearly enough.

   "Oof" Ikaro exclaimed as his left hand quickly made contact with his chest. 
   "That hurt." Ikaro uttered before allowing his left hand to slowly rise upwards and rest upon the Mizukage's position in the form of an imaginery gun.

   "But this isn't a bluff. My next technique is certain kill. I created it to serve as an assassination technique for the Hogo clan, and believe me, it works. I say we just settle with a 'draw', huh?" Ikaro enquired as his chakra surged briefly. The Mizukage would more than likely be capable of recognising the devastating attack currently being charged up!

   This dude looked smug as hell.* - Tue Oct 20 21:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) thinks: Damn. . . I'm surprised that worked. . . - Tue Oct 20 21:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) allowed his arm to seemingly return to it's standard state. With that, his katana slowly returned to the confinements of his sheath.
