<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: ......You can go and spar him then, I suppose. - Sat Nov 21 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Big pappy) yawns lightly, casting an unraveled hand over parting lips as though to block it. "Nah, I'm good. Spar with her," He said, his head nodding toward Kinami.* - Sat Nov 21 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . Fine, fine. - Sat Nov 21 01:53:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: You may start us off, if you'd like. - Sat Nov 21 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Big pappy) arrived upon the scene with one hand upon the back of his head rubbing through bright blonde follicles slowly. He'd stop nearby the earthern wall, leaning against it as he took sights upon the spar which would soon begin. Otherwise, he saw Paine within his periphial. He wanted to say hi but was unsure if she was busy and so he simply watched the spar.* - Sat Nov 21 01:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I'll allow you to start. - Sat Nov 21 01:59:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: Alright.. - Sat Nov 21 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Big pappy) took back to the spar with an intense gaze, his firey green hues beaming forth as he tried to detect each movement to increase his own abilities in vision prowess. Nevertheless, these two ninja were moving at a speed in which whatever Yan gained from the fight would be insignificant. 

In response to Aza's boasting of his mastery over his ominous transformation, Yan simply nodded. He'd push his back against the wall, bending his knees as his torso would be retracted  to the ground and his knees nearby his chest. He'd rest his arms upon his chest and simply watch the spar. He pondered smoking.* - Sat Nov 21 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Big pappy) thinks: I wouldn't ever let either of them get close to me. I'd put  them to sleep before hand... - Sat Nov 21 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Big pappy) wonders if he should step in and stop the fight before someone got hurt...He instead simply watched as she had stepped up to the plate and she wasn't a little child.* - Sat Nov 21 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-Alright..uhm.. - Sat Nov 21 02:57:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Big pappy) hears Izanami says Koji's name and he'd turn about, settling his eyes upon him. "I'd join you, if it's not that personal," he'd say.* - Sat Nov 21 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Something happen? - Sat Nov 21 03:19:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: No problem, Yan.  - Sat Nov 21 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Let's go. - Sat Nov 21 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Please follow me.~ - Sat Nov 21 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Big pappy) was somehow repositioned nearby Paine. He didn't mind and so he simply came into whatever position Paine was be it sitting down or standing as he watched Mamoru. His interest in the spar which he had previously been watching dissipated over time.* - Sat Nov 21 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: How long you gonna be on? - Sat Nov 21 03:21:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Big pappy) peers towards Aza. Sparring was one thing, if he attempted to hurt her beyond normal sport--there would be a reckoning for it.* - Sat Nov 21 03:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Big pappy) heard Paine's voice directed towards him, or at least, phrased in such a way that it was feasible to believe he was being spoken to at this point. He'd divert his eyes from the spar unfolding and instead would apply them to the visage of Paine. He'd let out a gentle smile and simply lean back--extending arms backwards to palm the blanket underneath them.

 "It's no problem. This is the first time I've had to really relax in a week," he'd note.

If he wasn't doing paperwork, then he was handling border security. If he wasn't doing that, he was stopping a monster from killing innocent people. Yan always had a full plate, but he did what he could to make time for those he wished to be around.

"So..you've become a pretty well respected ninja already in this village." He noted, looking towards the two students of Paine who were adjacent. "You have more students than I do.." He said, although he lacked any at all. He had some in the past, though no one ever showed the drive to become anything. That was Yan's failure just as much as the students..but that's just how it was.* - Sat Nov 21 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Annoyance? It's a spar. - Sat Nov 21 03:43:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Big pappy) says: Oh jeeze. - Sat Nov 21 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: They'll hurt soon enough. - Sat Nov 21 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Big pappy) chuckles lightly.* - Sat Nov 21 03:44:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: We can spar later. - Sat Nov 21 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Big pappy) peered towards Paine. Despite her timid nature, she drove the ninja to excel even past what they expected of themselves and in turn they complied and did so. It was a simple yet remarkable thing... "I'd beg to differ," He replied to Paine as he watched Momura attempt to strike the rock again. The point stood obvious.* - Sat Nov 21 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Hm, I only spar every now and again. - Sat Nov 21 03:50:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yes - Sat Nov 21 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Big pappy) says: Well, if they are using the more popular version of underground techniques, they  are using mole. This allows them to sense your body as long as it's on the ground through magnetic forces... - Sat Nov 21 05:17:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Big pappy) says: They can't do much underground other than surprise you. IF you use the technique yourself, the element of surprise is defeated and therefore the technique isn't all that useful. - Sat Nov 21 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: ... Im a sensor... I can sense them already... isnt there a way to destroy the ground beneath them or something - Sat Nov 21 05:24:41 2015
