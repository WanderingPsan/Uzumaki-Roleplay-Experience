<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a deep breath, as he straightened his bandages across his eyes he wasn't sure how well he'd fair against Muhhamed, seeing as how he couldn't see the attacks, That'd definately be a problem. But he took a deep breath, this would be a learning experience afterall, so he inhaled through his nose and exhaled through his mouth. Lowering himself into a fairly relaxed stance he had an idea, but it'd definately be draniing in the long run. 

"Let's begin then."* - Sun Oct  4 20:32:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a dep breath, and as he heard the Shuriken rub up against eachother the moment, with a swift but gentle motion. His chakra flared out around him, following his hand as he moved it horizontally. The air before him seemed to propagate, before moving in a pre-set pattern. It formed a shield of sorts before the male, which aimed to block the incomming Shuriken. Though he was sure Muhhamed was more adept at the use of the element than he was, so there was little to no chance of them being redirected. 

He took a deep breath, he had to focus, he was beginning to think more and more, that he'd have to use his technique now. That would make this battle a tad bit more even.* - Sun Oct  4 20:39:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a deep breath, this was definately a lot more of a pain than expected, he was at a clear disadvantage, but that made this all the more fun. He took a deep breath, and raised his hands to chest level, making a single seal. In which case, his chakra flared outwards in a Sphere-like manner, surrounding a large portion of the area around them, giving him insight as to all things moving within his barrier. And thanks to this he was alerted to Muhhamed's shuriken.

But due to the time, he took to attempt to set up, his attempt to dodge was less than sub-par, as he moved to grasp Samehade, with a dash to the left, several of the shuriken found their mark, he felt the wind enhanced blades, hit his shoulder, leg, hip, and forearm. And several others, creating minor cuts around his body, causing him to wince, he was definately having a harder time adapting to his blindness.

But he had to focus he wasn't out of the fight, he decided it was time to attack Muhhamed, he tried to ignore the pain, but pain was...Pain, so while holding Samehade. He inhaled followed by a deep exhale, before he charged towards Muhhamed, deciding against utilizing his Summoning just yet. Approaching the male, he swung his blade, horizontally aimed at the man's stomach.* - Sun Oct  4 20:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) thinks: Title, Squads, Creed... None of those things matter the world is too sensitive. - Sun Oct  4 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) noticed Muhhamed's Dodging as he hit air, but channeling chakra to his feet. The boy kicked off of his feet, sending himself spiraling into the air  towards Muhhamed, hopefully catching up with him, as he attempted to bring his blade up vertically, and strike Muhhamed. This technique of his that allowed sensory definately made fighting a tad bit easier, but at the same token, he was going through his reserves fairly quickly, and Muhhamed was the faster of the two.

He had never noticed Muhhamed's speed before, but he couldn't actually deduce that a technique was going on, he'd have to ask about it later.* - Sun Oct  4 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) as predicted couldn't see the technique comming and as such, he was sent flying back towards the ground hitting the ground back first. Which no doubt did a sizable amount of damage to his body. "F-Fuck." He stated,  as the pain moved through his body, he didn't know what happened, but not only had it hurt him, it served to disorientate him greatly. As he stood, slowly and wobbily, had he at least been given the time to stand, he was a bit dazed. But he held onto his conciousness though for a moment it had begun to fade.

"I didn't want to use this."

He admitted, as his hands moved to chest level, beginning to move through a series of five handseals before he bit his thumb, and aimed to slam his hand against the ground, and summon his creature, which happened to take the form of a dragon, slowly he was recovering form hitting the ground but the pain hadn't fully escaped him.

Had the large Majestic dragon been summoned "Aldor, let's do this." He'd state, as the Dragon took flight with Seisuke on it's back, Seisuke helping to identify that their target was Muhhamed, and the Dragon opened it's maw, shooting about Twenty Ice Senbon toward the man. One may even notice the temperature actually dropped a bit around them.* - Sun Oct  4 21:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) watched as Muhhamed pulled out a lighter, and the moment he saw the movement from the flames, he declared "Aldor Dive!" And immediately the dragon nose-dived in an attempt to avoid the flamethrower, but right before it would've hit the ground,  it veered upwards suddenly, before getting before Muhhamed at a further distance, and Seisuke immediately lept to it's head, making a series of handseals, before inhaling followed by a deep exhale. As he blew out a large ball of flames which was shot towards Muhhamed.

His Dragon, flapped it's wings hard, creating a large Gale wind which was aimed at amplifying the fireball as it was sent towards Muhhamed's position.* - Sun Oct  4 21:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: . .  Well damn. - Sun Oct  4 21:39:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) thinks: Wonder if there is like a Lightning Dragon. - Sun Oct  4 21:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) blinked as Muhhamed seemed to vanish from where he was last sensing him. And silently cursed, only to hear Aldor roar as his wing was clipped. And surely enough the dragon fell, but before it made contact with the ground it simply vanished, into a buff of smoke.  Leaving the unspecting Seisuke to go into a free fall, but before he hit the ground the male, channeled a bit of chakra into his left hand, aimed at the ground, in an attempt to slow his fall and allow him to hit the ground safely.

"Definately...A bit problematic..." He stated gritting his teeth, that was had Muhhamed even let him touch the ground.* - Sun Oct  4 21:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) blinked as he felt the wind raining down on him from behind, the wind chakra stabbing at his body like a thousand knives, riddling him with cuts and concussive damage. As he hit the ground,  he felt the pain radiating throughout his bod "S-Shit..." He muttered, as he moved to roll onto his back, breathing heavily he released his jutsu,  his chest heaving, and various small cuts and wounds all over his body. "I give."* - Sun Oct  4 22:00:32 2015

He was bandaged up all over his body, "Muhhamed...Is definately a lot stronger than I anticipated."* - Sun Oct  4 22:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) laughed a bit as he moved to take a seat beside her.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) simply sighed as he placed a hand on her back, it wasn't to make her uncomfortable, it was just a simply gesture as he spoke "The reason I needed you to face me was to re-apply the seal, though If you want, I can put it somewhere else." He offered lightly, looking at her back, as she sat on his leg.* - Mon Oct  5 00:08:32 2015

Extending his thumb he'd state "Lift your tongue please~?"* - Mon Oct  5 00:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) this time places the seal underneath her tongue as he spoke "You may want to sit like this for a while, so it'll be easier for you to hold this next conversation~."

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Scrolls..... - Mon Oct  5 00:23:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I can give you some for free but I hardly understand most of these techniques that aren't earth. Earth is my primary element. - Mon Oct  5 00:23:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm...a bit uncomfortable teaching you things you'll teach to other people. Especially...explosion jutsus. - Mon Oct  5 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hm? - Mon Oct  5 00:24:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It's simply a matter of hiding my own skill set. - Mon Oct  5 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Explosion release? - Mon Oct  5 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I doubt I can. - Mon Oct  5 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What can you do with thos scrolls? - Mon Oct  5 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Nothing. - Mon Oct  5 00:25:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Maybe you should rest for a bit. - Mon Oct  5 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) would attempt to place a hand behind her back, and guide her to his chest, he wouldn't force it if she resisted. He was just trying to give her a place to rest "What did you do today, that's gotten you so tired?"* - Mon Oct  5 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) would relax lightly, as she seemed to go with it. He closed his eyes lightly, as his hand rested on her back, not moving or anything of the works. Not applying any pressure as he spoke "I mean what would you normally do for excitement?"* - Mon Oct  5 00:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I dunno. - Mon Oct  5 00:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Missions maybe. - Mon Oct  5 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not the lame missions they give to fodder. Real missions. War. - Mon Oct  5 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll admit. I miss war. - Mon Oct  5 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Zetsumo put bloodlust in me. It's still there. - Mon Oct  5 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's all I ever think about. - Mon Oct  5 00:33:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not that I judge people. I just want it. - Mon Oct  5 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) would simply smile as he spoke "Soon enough Katsune, I'll show you a world, where you can spill guts to your heart's content. Just hang with me long enough." He stated lightly, as his his hand began rubbing up and down the center of her back, with gentle motions, seemingly meaning nothing more than helping her relax.* - Mon Oct  5 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll be thinking about what jutsus to give you. - Mon Oct  5 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Oh. - Mon Oct  5 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I have another gift for you. - Mon Oct  5 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) reaches into his pocket pulling out a large sum of cash, roughly Seven Hundred Grand he offered it to her. "I'd appreciate a kiss but I know I'm expecting to much~"* - Mon Oct  5 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) felt like she misinterpretted that, But he felt like it could've ended up bad but honestly he didn't know how to clear it up.* - Mon Oct  5 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It's yours whether you do it or not. - Mon Oct  5 00:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Mon Oct  5 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looks into her eyes as he looked at her as he spoke "If it hurts your pride, I won't force you it's no biggie. I'm not paying you to kiss me, I'm giving you money. If you kiss me I'd just consider it thanks, I wouldn't do something like that." He stated lightly, still holding the money out to her as he looked her in the eyes.

"If you don't want to, It's no biggie, But the money's still yours."* - Mon Oct  5 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looks her in the eyes as she spoke as he stated "I'm not." He stated lightly, wanting to see her reaction to what he had just said, this was beginning to seem like like a test than a simply offer to kiss.* - Mon Oct  5 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) didn't break eye contact, but he had been waiting for her to get to this point for a while now as he repeated the question as he spoke "Why -were- you in my lap?" He asked, watching her facial expression carefully, as he crossed his legs lightly, relaxing on the couch as he looks to her wondering if she had figured it out just yet.* - Mon Oct  5 01:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) yawned briefly breaking eye contact as he spoke "I wasn't sure if I could trust you with a secret, so I created a scenario in which a secret would be created to see how you did." He stated with a light yawn.* - Mon Oct  5 01:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked at her as he simply stated "I'm sorry for testing you in such a way." He stated looking up towards the ceiling, he relaxed lightly.

"You hate me don't you?"* - Mon Oct  5 01:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I want you to know one thing, If there was one thing I meant throughout this entire time, It was that I considered you a friend. And as such, I will answer any questions you have truthfully, if you answer one of my own. - Mon Oct  5 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't have any questions. - Mon Oct  5 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You can ask some though. - Mon Oct  5 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Then I have one. - Mon Oct  5 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What is it? - Mon Oct  5 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: If I said 'No', what would you have done? - Mon Oct  5 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looks up at the ceiling some more as he spoke:

"You're right, I didn't. That was a line, I couldn't pass and still call it a lie." He stated.

Before he looked to her "This feeling of betrayal, Remember it well. This is what the world is full of. Pain, Suffering. And Betrayal." He reached for his pocket, and unsealed a knife of all things as he flipped it in his grasp, holding the hilt towards Katsune.

"But what we need in our world is trust."

With the knife extended to Katsune he spoke "If you hate me, Despise me, Desire to kill me? Then do it."* - Mon Oct  5 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) actually went wide-eyed for a moment as she pressed her fist to his head, looking at her. He knew she could kill him in this moment, but he didn't say anything and silently accepted whatever came, He looked at her and focused on her person.* - Mon Oct  5 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) slowly resealed the knife, as he looked at her and spoke "I see. I can never make up for what I did to you." He looked away in this moment:

"For what it's worth, You've confirmed a belief of mine." He stated lightly relaxing on the couch leaving it to an awkward silence unless she pursued it.* - Mon Oct  5 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) thinks: I'm going to kill this bastard... - Mon Oct  5 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) thinks: He's made me so mad. - Mon Oct  5 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) would slowly look towards her as he spoke "I've confirmed, You're an invaluable person, Someone precious to me. But to confirm that belief, I had to glimpse into your darkness, You've already seen mine." He stated lightly, as he stood heading over to the kitchen, he took out a bottle of Sake and filled two glasses offering one to her. 

"You perhaps, know more about me than anyone else."* - Mon Oct  5 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) takes a sip of his glass as he spoke "Then, I suppose, I can tell you my end game." He paused, swirling the liquid around in his glass, he didn't seem hesitant, he seemed to be brooding over what he was thinking.* - Mon Oct  5 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked at his glass as it moved with slight vibrations as he spoke "I wish to destroy the Gezo Empire." He stated lightly, not looking towards her at all, this probably sounded like a fools goal.* - Mon Oct  5 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked up towards the ceiling as he spoke "It's because, I have nothing to lose, Or I had nothing.  It was something, I could say I did. Everyone is terrified of them, Living in fear. I'd like to stand up to them, look them in the eyes, like I'm an equal not a play thing for their amusement. I don't desire to live like a ant for my entire life."* - Mon Oct  5 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll admit. - Mon Oct  5 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I hate being told what to do too. - Mon Oct  5 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . .Or used. - Mon Oct  5 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It doesn't suit you. - Mon Oct  5 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I won't order you around, unless you say you want me to, I won't order around my equal. - Mon Oct  5 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Mon Oct  5 01:47:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I feel like....that's a bad way to go about things. See.... - Mon Oct  5 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Erebus...me. Especially me. If...he hadn't been playing backseat hokage.... - Mon Oct  5 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You know. - Mon Oct  5 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: The first thing I said to you was. - Mon Oct  5 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I want you to get to the point when you say what's on your mind with no reserve. - Mon Oct  5 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Then I'll have to speak hypothetically, to get to the point. - Mon Oct  5 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: That's fine. - Mon Oct  5 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Because it really is a different situation. I was gonna betray him at some point. - Mon Oct  5 01:50:04 2015
