<br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) continued to clear the gap between him and Niza along with his clone, but right before he reached him, Seisuke and his clone zig zagged, with chakra surging through both of their hands, the clone and Seisuke sent their open palms one aimed for each arm of Niza, aiming to overwhealm him from two sides, hopefully allowing one palm to successfully make contact with the male, he was probably already standing but he tried this anyway, it'd be a great form of attacking if mastered in the future.* - Sun Sep 27 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) as his hand connected with Niza, he'd find that a black seal had been etched onto his arm and soon after he'd find himself unable to utilize that arm. The male smiled gently, as his clone's arm was deflected, the clone lept backwards before preparing to take the defensive, it drew a set of three Shuriken and it's chakra was sent into all three before, they ignited with a thin veil of wind chakra, and were thrown towards Niza, as Seisuke pulled back his foot, attempting to send it full force towards Niza's hip.* - Sun Sep 27 01:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) was definately more on the tired side after all of this and his exhaustion was visibly showing. He had decided that pushing it any more could result in injury which he didn't want to risk "I give...Your win." He stated, raising his hands in defeat, he dismissed his clone.* - Sun Sep 27 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) scratched his cheek "I've been working on it." He stated with a ligh laugh, approaching Niza and if permitted, he'd channel a bit of his chakra into the tip of his finger before sending it through the seal, causing the seal to terminate and return use to Niza's arm. "It's...Taxing to say the least."* - Sun Sep 27 02:07:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I presume this is what you wished to add to your taijutsu. - Sun Sep 27 02:08:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: From what I know, his technique disables the opponents fighting capability as well. - Sun Sep 27 02:09:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Also a Fuuinjutsu user.. - Sun Sep 27 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Uh..I don't believe he uses fuuinjutsu for such actually. - Sun Sep 27 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: That was a great spar though. - Sun Sep 27 02:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I agree. - Sun Sep 27 02:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I suppose we should return to the public now. - Sun Sep 27 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Just in case anything else has happened... - Sun Sep 27 02:20:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'll catch you later Niza-san. - Sun Sep 27 02:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) simply smiled and like last time the place was empty save for staff, and he looked at Katsune with a gentle bow of his head "Thanks for comming he stated lightly." Debating of he wanted to drink lightly today,  he looked at her taking a moment to asess her clothes before relaxing.* - Sun Sep 27 02:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) decided to drink a bit heavier and ordered a bottle of sake as he spoke "So how've you been since I've last seen you?"* - Sun Sep 27 02:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: That's good. - Sun Sep 27 02:49:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't think we're ready for truth or dare yet. - Sun Sep 27 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You know I'd rather wait then, I was wondering how Konoha is doing? - Sun Sep 27 02:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It seems like it's reclaiming past glory, But I don't know for sure. - Sun Sep 27 02:57:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's a lot of work honestly. - Sun Sep 27 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It was easy to not think about that when I first decided I wanted Konoha. - Sun Sep 27 02:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No...actually.... - Sun Sep 27 03:00:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So I guess that's a no. - Sun Sep 27 03:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: That's' fair enough. - Sun Sep 27 03:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: As long as you don't regret it. - Sun Sep 27 03:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It's not a bad decision is it? - Sun Sep 27 03:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not sure yet. - Sun Sep 27 03:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I do wonder what other villages are like though. - Sun Sep 27 03:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I've never been to any other than Amegakure and Zetsumo's Konoha. - Sun Sep 27 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- There was Kirigakure during the battle but I was there for about fifteen minutes before I realized it was time to leave. - Sun Sep 27 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Thousands were dying even as I ran. - Sun Sep 27 03:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) laughed subtly at Katsune's words, honestly he found her words o be somewhat entertaining. The truth which riddled her individual words, was definately interesting, as he spoke "So you were at that battle?" He asked, definately interested in her a bit more now as he then followed up with saying "That battle was pretty....Intense, If I was fast enough I probably would've gotten out of there as quickly as possible, I too value my life more than others seem to."* - Sun Sep 27 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It didn't take me long to decide to run. - Sun Sep 27 03:14:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It was a risk after all. - Sun Sep 27 03:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Fair enough. - Sun Sep 27 03:16:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe. - Sun Sep 27 03:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I do wonder how that battle went after I left. - Sun Sep 27 03:17:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Once I saw Zetsumo's monsters die I knew he'd lost. None of the Kenryoku even compared to him. - Sun Sep 27 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: 'Cept for maybe Mukade and we hadn't seen her in......a while.... - Sun Sep 27 03:18:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Zetsumo's monsters were being destroyed one by one, Until he entered this..Thread Cacoon. - Sun Sep 27 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: He couldn't move, But it seemed like his ninjutsu capabilities were amplified...Several times over. - Sun Sep 27 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: His techniques were like natural disasters. - Sun Sep 27 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Then Niza, Muhhamed, and Kenshin teamed up on him---Kenshin litterally kicked his butt. - Sun Sep 27 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: He was moving faster than any Human I've ever seen---One well placed kick to the base of Zetsumo's spine. - Sun Sep 27 03:22:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I figured he'd lose, at first. He was so confident though I started to believe him. - Sun Sep 27 03:23:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And he chose to charge in like that. - Sun Sep 27 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: At some point he must have lost his mind. - Sun Sep 27 03:24:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Maybe he doubted himself? - Sun Sep 27 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Zetsumo's an idiot for not targetting Kenshin first. - Sun Sep 27 03:29:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) would slowly step before her wrapping his arms around her waist as he leaned in to kiss her "What's on the Agenda today~?"* - Sun Sep 27 12:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Do you remember his name? - Sun Sep 27 12:53:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Shall we then? - Sun Sep 27 13:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I believe we shall~ - Sun Sep 27 13:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) takes her hand and off they go.* - Sun Sep 27 13:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well then - Sun Sep 27 13:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Now, I wonder what I should do~ - Sun Sep 27 13:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmm. - Sun Sep 27 13:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh, take this scroll first. Might as well add it to your pile. - Sun Sep 27 13:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) takes the scroll "Oh thanks~" He states sealing it up.* - Sun Sep 27 13:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right...I'll get started then. - Sun Sep 27 13:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hmmm.. - Sun Sep 27 13:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) decided to sit here and take a deep breath, inhaling followed by a deep exhale as he relaxed upon the ground, he had a new scroll as he inhaled and exhaled. Slowly he read the name on the scroll "Bouseki Tate no Kaze." And nodded his head, that name was simply enough. So he inhaled followed by another exhale, as he unraveled the scroll beginning to read what was held within it's confines, as he read:

"By focusing on an area infront of them, the user dispels chakra to cause the wind to spin rapidly in a circular motion, creating something akin to a shield. Instead of deflecting attacks the shield reflects small projectiles such as kunai and shuriken back towards the enemy at the same speed it was fired at."Nodding his head he sighed.

With a gentle sigh, he decided to focus on the technique at hand, every so often he shifted glances towards Lera and he began to have peculiar ideas, this would definately be something of interest, as he laughed a bit to himself, followed by a deep inhale followed by a exhale. He had figured he had learned the basis of the technique and set the scroll down.* - Sun Sep 27 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a deep breath and acknowledged that there was another technique he had possession of perhaps the only technique he had any desire to learn so that was fine, inhaling followed by a deep exhale, his knuckles were cracked as he decided to focus on the scroll before him, inhaling followed by a deep exhale, as his finger slowly traced along the page he was reading until he found the beginning of the text:

"Using a short blast of air from their hand the user is able to propel themselves in any directions with considerable force." After he had read that surprisingly short passage, he cracked his knuckles, with a gentle yawn, he nodded his head beginning to focus on what was going on, he figured this would be an interesting technique to use in the heat of battle--Especially when coupled with Niza's Bunny hop.

Taking a deep breath he yawned to himself, having learned yet another technique, he decided to pay attention to Lera as she probably began to wrap up her training, with a light yawn, he laid upon the ground deciding to take it easy while he waited.* - Sun Sep 27 14:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Congratz~ - Sun Sep 27 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thank you~ - Sun Sep 27 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) would slowly approach her attempting to rest a hand on her shoulder "I figured it'd be an invaluable technique for you in the long run." He stated with a gentle laugh.* - Sun Sep 27 14:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You were right~ This is going to help a lot. - Sun Sep 27 14:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: What should we do- OH, I should introduce you to my new friend. - Sun Sep 27 14:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: A new Friend~? - Sun Sep 27 14:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm~ - Sun Sep 27 14:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked at the wolf and then back to Lera curiously wondering when she learned such a technique. But he smiled gently, crouching before the young wolf, he extended his hand slowly before it  "Hello there." He stated lightly, Wolves were definately a rare summoning in this world. But he knew why Lera was chosen, she did have a likeable personality.* - Sun Sep 27 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: She likes you~ - Sun Sep 27 14:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) smiled a bit as the young wolf licked his fingers, within moments, he aimed to gently rub her between her ears. "I'm glad, I'm pretty fond of her as well~"* - Sun Sep 27 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehe~ - Sun Sep 27 14:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Wonder how big she'll grow up to be. - Sun Sep 27 14:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) laughed a bit in response to Jenna's words, "I'm sure she'll grow up to be a big wolf." He spoke lightly, giving her head a final rub as he stood up.* - Sun Sep 27 14:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) nodded his head as he spoke "She'll be good in the long run, A lot of promise." He stated nodding his head before he spoke "And you'll be great with summonings in no time~"* - Sun Sep 27 15:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thanks. I just have to practice using it. - Sun Sep 27 15:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: When did you learn to summon? - Sun Sep 27 15:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: A little while ago. I found this scroll, recognised it immediately... - Sun Sep 27 15:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I see. - Sun Sep 27 15:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: What now? - Sun Sep 27 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I can sit here and hug you for hours---Or, Hm.. - Sun Sep 27 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hugs sound good. - Sun Sep 27 15:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) smiled a bit, as he turned to face her, opening his arms as he attempted to wrap them around Lera gently, hugging her as he held her against him lightly. "I was thinking we should try to go on a mission together some time."* - Sun Sep 27 15:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: That....sounds good actually. - Sun Sep 27 15:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) relaxed with her as he spoke "I can never get over being this close to you, It feels almost heavenly." He stated lightly, giving her a light kiss on the cheek.* - Sun Sep 27 15:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) heard her words, and thought on them for a moment "Oddly, It feels just like that~" He stated lightly, in all honesty it felt like it has only been a few days he'd known her but by now it's been a few months. And he loved every moment he spent with Lera.* - Sun Sep 27 15:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhmmmm, what should we do now? - Sun Sep 27 15:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hm... - Sun Sep 27 15:18:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) smiled as the game had taken a seemingly long amount of time he laughed a bit as he spoke "That was definately a good game~" He stated relaxing on the ground.* - Sun Sep 27 16:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I will win eventually - Sun Sep 27 16:45:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: That sounds great~ - Sun Sep 27 16:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) stands up and with a single motion he attempted to lift her in his arms, he had decided to buy her a piano for the house and so as they approached it he attempted to gently set her down on the bench.* - Sun Sep 27 16:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) gasped as he heard Lera's voice in unison with the piano.  And his heart skipped a beat, and began thumping harder than he had ever felt it before. A faint blush appeared upon his alabaster cheeks, as he listened to the song she had made for him. It was unbelievable...Stunning, he was at a loss of words, and silently listened to the song, loving every moment of it.* - Sun Sep 27 16:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) was simply stunned, his heart was still beating at an accelerated pace, he couldn't believe the words she had just spoken. And slowly he walked forward, he was definately speechless in this moment, words couldn't comprehend how he felt in this moment.  But as he approached her, he aimed to wrap his arms around her from behind hugging her tightly. 

"That....Was...the most beautiful thing I've ever heard, Lera.."* - Sun Sep 27 17:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) held her tightly "How could...I not like it?" He asked warmly, attempting to give her a kiss atop of the head.

"Thank you...That's the best gift...I could've ever wanted."* - Sun Sep 27 17:05:42 2015
