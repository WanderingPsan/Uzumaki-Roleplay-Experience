<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) felt her head resting on his shoulder, while her hand wrapped around his member, with her other hand resting on his lower stomach. He felt her weight as it rested against him, and his other hand slowly moved behind her to join his first, kneading her butt roughly with both hands. Occasionally smacking one of her cheeks with his palm as he spoke "You know, If I knew we were going to end up naked in the middle of the lake, I would've drank another glass."

He looked back down at her, unable to express his feelings with his words, just enjoying the sensation of her hand sliding down his base as she took more of his cock in, but he knew there was some ulterior motive.* - Sun Oct 11 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) released a subtle moan as a result of her suckling, the feeling of her soft, warm, and wet tongue was almost heavenly as it moved around his shaft. He closed his eyes and leaned against the wall of the room, and as a response to her words, not only did his blush intensify, but his cock began releasing a steady flow of pre-cum as her lips rubbed along his length. His left hand found the top of her head and began gently stroking, running his fingers through her head as he gasped and moaned lightly.* - Sun Oct 11 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) smiled warmly as he spoke "I'll g-give you your present s-soon enough." He stated as his cock was invited into the back of her throat. He began moaning a bit louder, feeling her tongue moving along his cock, the sounds she was making as she gagged and saliva and pre-cum ran from her mouth only served to arouse him further, as his second hand rested upon the back of her head, he decided he couldn't let her do all the work. So he began thrusting his hips forward, while using his hands to pull her head forward onto his cock. 

He was aiming to fuck her mouth, and his thrusts were fast and hard, each motion causing his sack to brush up against her chin.* - Sun Oct 11 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) within moments of this action, he felt his cock beginning to pulse in her mouth, the bucking of his hips, as he violently fucked her throat only speeding up. Before he drove his hips forward, attempting to drive the entirety of his length into her mouth, while pulling her head forward. Holding her head there, with his balls against her chin, as his member began violently throbbing in her throat, he seemed to be intent on choking her with his cock while he held her against him as so.

"S-Shit.." He moaned out.

As his cock erupted, shooting stream after stream of his thick seed into her throat, definately having a lot stored up, as he pulled back about half-way, before thrusting back in, holding her there. "D-Damn that was g-good."* - Sun Oct 11 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) felt the girl bite down on his cock, and honestly, he partially expected this, but immediately he pulled out of her mouth, a slightly irritated look on his face, as he cursed out.

He asked looking down at her, visibly trying to hold back the urge to slap her.* - Sun Oct 11 01:35:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) shot Katsune a glance as he relaxed on the ground, he didn't say anything but carefully listened to the words she's speaking after she said her piece he spoke "It's no biggie, I can understand, I wouldn't want to get in the way of your goals. And in your place I wouldn't want anyone getting in the way of my own." He stopped for a moment as he recalled the last thing she had said and he looked at her and approached her.

As he attempted to stand before her as he spoke "Weak? Weak!? I can't let you call youself weak, Because you're here, You're alive. If you were weak you would've died a long time ago, in a war, in some fight. You would've died. Yet, you survived, and aspire for greatness, if anything.. You're one of the strongest people I know." He stated.

Staring at the woman who stared before him, he didn't care much about her training, but he wanted her to understand his position. "If you think you're weak, then by all means get stronger, But some times, the route to power, lies in relying on someone you trust."* - Sun Oct 11 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) watches her in mock excitement,  he ran a single hand through his hair, as he took a seat. "You said you wanted to get to know me...So if you have any questions, I'm all yours." He stated lightly, changing the subject, although he believed Katsune was more than qualified in several sections, he didn't care to argue his point, she seemed to be having fun attacking the tree, so he didn't neccessarily which to interrupt that process.* - Sun Oct 11 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) scratcbed his chin as he laid on the ground, closing his eyes "Time, Eh?" He asked, trying not to pay to much attention to the...Definately ominious words she had spoken, he yawned subtly as he spoke "What do you know of the new Mizukage?" He was genuinely curious, he was lacking a lot of information.* - Sun Oct 11 04:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) looked at her as he noticed just how bored she was and sighed before he spoke "Why not...I don't know, try to work something out in another Village? You look so bored, it's contaigious." He stated lightly, adding a sneeze for good measure. As he stood attempting to approach her as he spoke "I've decided, to adopt your goal as my own."* - Sun Oct 11 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) watches her lightly as he spoke "I don't think he'll kill you on spot, Maybe a few days later---Just a joke." He stated admitting it was in bad taste, as he spoke "I'm sure he won't be mad, that you're doing what makes you happy. And if he gets mad, I can always, knock em' down a peg." He stated, making a fist, and punching the air for good measure, before he moved to take a seat beside her on the floor.* - Sun Oct 11 04:23:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) heard the loud chirps which resonated throughout the forest. The sound did scare him at first, since it was sudden and high pitched as he listened to Fujitora he simply stated "I don't know, What I'm ready for, All I know is, Some times Strength isn't all that matters, especially in most fights. If you can outsmart your opponent you can wind." He stated lightly, looking towards Fujitora

"It helps that, I'm probably one of the strongest and weakest of my class."* - Sun Oct 11 12:29:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Follow the horizon to glory if y' seek it. - Sun Oct 11 13:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm ready to begin whenever. - Sun Oct 11 13:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Let's all leave then. - Sun Oct 11 13:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) blinked as he looked behind him "Hm...The east is behind us." He turned to the  right and began to get his bearings a tad. He took a deep breath, and inhaled followed by a deep exhale, cracking his knuckles, he ran up the side of the mountain. He felt like he had a good idea of where he was, though that may've simply been false courage, he wondered if he'd find anything fun on this island, But he shrugged, with a light yawn. He began heading to where he thought may've been the center of the place.* - Sun Oct 11 13:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: roll - Sun Oct 11 13:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) found himself running further  into the forest, keeping an eye out for any animals or beasts which may deter his path. He wondered what was going on around him, he could've swore Sanoke was right with him a moment ago, but it seemed like he had vanished, but he shrugged it off it was probably every man for himself, so he ran forward, cracking his knuckles, everything seemed to be going smoothly, so he continued advancing.

He was running at a fairly fast speed in an attempt to cover more ground, and slowly he ran a single hand through his hair, gently moving through his hair as he slicked it back. Keeping it out of his eyes, he seemed to be staying on the move, deciding it could be problematic if he was to get lost out here, so his goal was to stay in a straight line.* - Sun Oct 11 13:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) as he moved further into the island, he was baffled  by how much larger the bugs and animals were, and that definately was shocking, he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, as he continued to move forward, not wasting any time. He definately was wondering if there was anything he should be afraid of, maybe Fujitora was simply messing with them and aimed to freak them out by telling them such a thing, he inhaled followed by a deep exhale.

Moving his bandana over his mouth, he definately didn't desire to have one of those large bugs going in his nose...Or mouth,  and his goggles were lowered over his eyes, had to protect them eyes afterall, but either way he continued to advance further into this mysterious island, taking notice of his surroundings, as much was openly visible to him.* - Sun Oct 11 13:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) was having a surprisingly easy time, running through the place, but it seemed like when stuff went easy...Shit would hit the fan just as easily,  but he noticed the animals that seemed to just watch him not attacking. Ones that would normally tear apart his flesh,  he listened to the randomn melody which played. But he didn't say anything it was relaxing almost, he wondered who was playing it, or what. He had heard that sometimes the placement of trees and rocks can make beautiful sounds.

But he didn't seem to mind, he continued running forward, checking his surroundings, he didn't slow down, having natural stamina on his side, as he continued his crusade through the woods.* - Sun Oct 11 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) took a deep breath as he stopped momentarily, since they were so big. He took this to his advantage, and chakra immediately dlowed to his hands, causing the wind to cibrate around his hands. As he immediately began swinging his hands at the large bugs. His hands aiming to slice them up as he progressed through the woods, the wind around his hands, was incredibly powerful, and designed to kill. He seemed to have an ace up his sleeve, but once he found an opening he began running once again.

Hopefully he had managed to kill a good amount of the Gnats so that an opening would be created. And in which case, he'd aim to exploit that opening to get him out of this situation, he didn't want to get slowed down, he realised the possibility that others were ahead of him, and he didn't want to lose, so he tried to progress though if the situation called for it, he could waste a bit more time, slicing and dicing Gnats. * - Sun Oct 11 14:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) felt the bites, and slowly he cursed himself, as he decided to rest for the duration of this turn, he needed to recover, these bites definately did a number on his body, so he moved to the nearest tree. He took a deep breath and sighed, closing his eyes, he attempted to in fact rest for this our, to sleep off his injuries he'd need it afterall. He closed his eyes, drifting off into a light nat, trying to avoid scratching the gnats' bite wounds.* - Sun Oct 11 14:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) after he waited for a while he slowly got back up, feeling as if he was completely recvovered, he began running some more heading towards the core of the forest.  He wasted no time, getting further into the forest, he was definately aiming to make up for lost time, he had no clue where his allies were, but he figured they had  caught up if not expanded their lead on him.

So he continued running forward, wasting no time, he needed to get back to where he was going "What is my goal anyway?" He wondered.* - Sun Oct 11 15:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: So I'd be. - Sun Oct 11 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: This shit definitely changes a man. - Sun Oct 11 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) silently he cursed realising he made full circle, but he decided to try another path and continue to run forward, this was definately a pain in the rear, but regardless he continued running. He was aiming to make his way to the core, this was a race and he definately have to win he had no choice, so he continued to power forward, hoping he received no more unexpected surprises. Part of him wondered how his competition was doing, he believed they were probably ahead of him.

He probably was the most unexperienced out of all those present.* - Sun Oct 11 15:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) takes his risk with the people, as he approached his hands were raised he stopped a fair distance away and spoke "Hello." He stated lightly, lowering the facemask from his mouth, and raising his goggles as he tried to get their attention. "I mean no harm." He stated lightly, they were the first people he had met here, but he wouldn't attempt to attack them without hesitation. He wanted to see if they could be talked to.* - Sun Oct 11 15:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) nodded his head it seemed as if they'd let him stay and as such he bowed his head respectfully to them. Since he couldn't understand their native tongue, he had decided to rely on symbols alone. So he cracked his knuckles, at least he'd have a safe way to spend the night, he figured he'd use this time to map out the path he had taken, after that was done, he'd prepare to look around the Village something told him to take that tablet he just wondered if he should ask first. But for now he explored.* - Sun Oct 11 16:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) had rested up at the camp, and cracked his knuckles, he now had the tablet and he definately needed to keep moving. So with a nod of his head, he was out the camp. Racing towards his objective, he wasted no time, he needed to regroup for lost time, probably met a nice girl and had a good night which caused him to lose the lead. And as such he continued running, now having the key, he hoped it'd aid his travels.* - Sun Oct 11 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) ended up right back where he started and silently cursed he was definately annoyed by this development and  wanted to progress. So he kicked up his speed. Running forward, as he aimed to make..Some progress forward, he was prepared to give up first place he just didn't want to be last.* - Sun Oct 11 17:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) looked at the giant Ice Snake which had appeared before him, and immediately he dropped into his stance, the chakra gathering along his palms, as he charged forward, he was actually moving at an accerlerated speed, he had lost...Way to much ground he had to get back, as he charged forward. "Fuck, Fuck..Fuck." He cursed, as he approached the snake, his hand held out before him, as he aimed to drive it into the snake's core. But at the same token, he was aiming to get out of this situation.

He had to catch back up.* - Sun Oct 11 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) had run forward a suitable amount of distance, finally...Just maybe his luck was changing?* - Sun Oct 11 17:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) definately wasn't to confident with his own standing and decided to press forward, he had really horrible luck and knew that when his luck could go wrong, it definately would.* - Sun Oct 11 18:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: Kilm?_ - Sun Oct 11 18:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) ran forward, he was making adequate time, and as he made his way forward he hoped he wasn't actually backtracking, he needed to wind this race, he had to. It was his mission, if only he could succeed this would definately be perfect. He needed this training. He needed to advance his knowledge if he was to serve any purpose.* - Sun Oct 11 18:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) took a deep breath and stopped in his tracks, his eyes focused on the Woman ...Male thing which stood before him. And slowly he got into a battle stance, watching the figure's face. He silently cursed his light blue eyes focused upon the being examining it's appearance closely, as he inhaled through his mouth, and exhaled through his nose, he figured this would be a pain. He hoped there was a way to get around this without fighting.

"I don't suppose you'll just let me pass?" He asked.

Preparing for a fight.* - Sun Oct 11 18:25:55 2015
