<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) slowly sighed, as he reached onto his back, unraveling a small white scroll with golden Trimmings he laid it upon the floor. Unraveling it, as he placed his hand on the center of the scroll, carefully he began to gather his own chakra, sending it to the center as he began to unseal what was located within, in a moment, there was a gentle puff of smoke, which permiated through the air, once it cleared laying there was a large bandaged blade as he looked towards the blade and then towards Muhhamed. "Well...Here goes nothing.."

He stated lightly before he stated "Try not to kill me...Alright?" Slowly he bent over, placing his left hand against the hilt, he curled his fingers around it, nervously, he felt it's life force, he felt the gentle movements as it swayed on the ground, he felt it eating his chakra...Mysterious in deed. "I-I'm still alive right?" He asked, still holding onto the hilt.* - Sun Sep 20 18:07:21 2015

"They tell me in the final moments of a man's life, they show their true colors---In other words, the part of the heart which radiates the brightest once a man's life comes to an end...So tell me, Did he beg for his life?" The blue eyes of the prince, seemed, almost a murkey color, someone who's taken an interest in the darker side of humanity.

His attention seemed to zone out the world beside him, he desired his answer, the answer he had been craving for a while name. It caused  his heart to flutter in his chest, he desired to know if a brave man could fall in his final moments.* - Sun Sep 20 20:31:34 2015

But if I die, maybe I can make up some of what I said." He thought to himself, the numerous thoughts fluttered through his head, there was a reason, he was who he was...Why he stood here, Zetsumo's masks seemed to be pre-occupied, and finally it seemed like the duck was left, his hands moved to chest level, and began to move together in a series of handseals.

"So much for secrets." He stated aloud.

As he finished the string of five handseals, his thumb was raised to his mouth. Biting down on the finger, he simply stated "Rise Aldor, I'll need....To call upon your strength this one time." He stated, his blue eyes seemed to focus on his target, as his hand was slammed down upon the ground, creating a sudden cold front to appear from his position.

The air suddenly dropped in temperature, as a large beast appeared beneath Seisuke, blood red eyes were shown from. It's impressive wing-span, flapped, as it took off into the sky, the majestic creature,  flew at astonishing speeds with it's summoner riding upon it's back. Approaching behind Zetsumo's duck, the Dragon would open it's mouth, the air crystalizing in it's maw before being fired forward.

Aimed at clipping the wings of the flying ducks wings, hoping to knock the bird from the sky. The Dragon's form was elegant and smooth, with each mighty flap of it's wings, a gust of wind was blasted behind it.

"It seems the Dragons really do...Fly high this time of year."

He stated,  the dragon opened it's large mouth and the water particles in the air began to condense, and freeze, before remaining down with precision at Zetsumo's position. Flipping it's wings, it aimed to increase lethalicity, and speed as they shot towards the man. The dragon seemed to have an intellegence of it's own.

Not staying in a single spot, and staying constantly on the move. he was doing what he could to play his part, also tossing dwn Shuriken and Explosive tag laced Kunai to hope to chip away at Zetsumo's defenses knowing that his Dragon would be his own major point of Offense.* - Sun Sep 20 23:06:52 2015

As he finally landed the large blue dragon, whose wings gathered at it's sides, as the Prince hopped from the back of the Dragon.  He looked to Muhhamed, and then to Zetsumo who was laying on the ground dead, and finally h
e stepped down and he thought to himself:

"My only regret is having not seen what you would've been like in your final moments...But like a star in space, you were snuffed out so suddenly...Here one moment and gone the next." 

He paused staring down at Zetsumo, he reached for the hilt of his scroll, and ran two fingers over it, unsealing a large bandaged blade as he simply thought to himself "This is only the beginning of a much larger game, isn't it...Erebus?" A gentle grin caressed his cheeks. As he held Samehade towards the frame of Zetsumo.

It was a new blade afterall, he wanted to see how it'd react.* - Sun Sep 20 23:29:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) bought him to some elabroate cave, where he simply laid the body down on the ground. Zetsumo had left the boy something, something that was never intended for him, he left the boy a game, which was called life, he aimed to use it to his advantages, so for now. He had to do some....'Stuff'. Sheathing Samehade, he  reached for a knife, in which case he began slowly cutting off pieces of Zetsumo's threads, he was gone...He wouldn't need that would he? 

Slowly he'd begin to strip Zetsumo's person, of his clothing, weaponry, money, and anything in between.  He had plans for Zetsumo, but first he moved to secure the samples of the threads he had taken, tossing them off to the side into a bin. Before he began to seal them up, eventually after all was said and done, he did go about washing the visible skin of the male's body, and making the body look presentable.

Going as far as to put a tux, and even rent a Casket, and other stuff, and paying for the entire ceremony up front. He was a man of his word afterall, and he did have a deep respect for Zetsumo as a leader.* - Sun Sep 20 23:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) ||Had to visit Ushinawa anyway, so he decided to at least reunite the body with that of his family.* - Mon Sep 21 00:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) flew in on a Dragon and what not.* - Mon Sep 21 00:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a deep breath, he was acting out of selfish intentions, and impure desires but he also needed to limited what came out of this room. Greatly, if he could act as a moderator....Maybe he could lessen the chance for another character like Zetsumo appearing, or maybe it'd simply give him a reason to control...He wasn't sure, But as he walked in the male slowly gathered chakra into the tips of his fingers, before sealing the different objects in the room away, he figured he'd leave the money with a trusted guardian--Zetsumo's kid must've been young..Extremely young. 

At least he assumed so, but he had heard Zetsumo had a sister, he figured if at all possible, he'd give the two of them a way out, maybe a new start with this money, maybe neither of them would have to experience fighting for their lives anymore, he only hoped that'd be their reality, but should Suitengu decide to come down this path, hopefully, he'd have the guidance to lead him into what one would call the right path, or the strength to formulate his own beliefs about this world.

Beyond that, he desired not to do more, he simply waited for the kid to come this way since it was...Inevitable. * - Mon Sep 21 00:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218)  eyes focused on the boy as he screamed out, he felt a menacing aura  comming from the child "This is...Zetsumo's child?" The feeling sent shivers down his spine, but he didn't say anything the boy deserved this much, he deserved this moment to scream, and to let his emotions soar, he could only imagine what kind of pain the boy must've been feeling in this moment, so he waited for a while, not saying anything, not yet at least, this child, he wanted to make this right by him. Somehow.

After a few moments he had decided to approach the child, keeping his distance, as he decided to crouch before the boy as he stated "I'm a...Ally of your father, he wanted me to find you and your Aunt, and make sure you two are safe." He stated, his voice was oddly soothing and comforting, he realised the child must've went through an astonishing amount of trauma in the past moments, but regardless, the male extended his hand to Suitengu.

"I'll get you to safety." He stated lightly.

This boy, who was he? But regardless, he had some stuff to prepare for, he couldn't just up and take a child and move across Nations, he had to make sure he could keep him safe, and that he was prepared, ultimately that'd cost him a day's wait, to ensure their safety was granted.* - Mon Sep 21 00:50:59 2015
