<br><br><font color=yellow>***Masked Man**(Jjking218) takes a gander at the woman, looking at her from head to toe, getting a basic analysis of her appearance and chakra signature. He didn't say anything nor do anything he simply waited, he wasn't being paid for anything currently so there was no need to actually do anything. His scarlet eye, simply focused on her, before his gaze slowly shifted towards the body bag. * - Mon Oct  5 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: . . . . . . - Mon Oct  5 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Masked Man**(Jjking218) as he noticed the body in the bag, his hand unintentionally clenched, and his eye flared, as it focused on the woman. He felt his body begin to heat up and his blood beginning to boil. His heart raced, as his scarlet pupil focused on the face of the deceased Hanabi. "Why...Why does she have that body?!" He thought to himself, as he stared at Asteroth, if it wasn't for his mask, anger would be definately visible.* - Mon Oct  5 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Masked Man**(Jjking218) looked at Hanabi's body as it moved....That...Corpse....That flesh puppet which had taken the form of his friend. Hanabi was dead? She was dead...He had seen her grave...Her Grave...He never......Got to say goodbye...He had such a jumble of emotions flying through his mind, Sorrow, Pain....Anger...His blood boiled. "How....How dare you......?....How dare you touch....Touch her body." His eyes stared at the woman.

He stepped forward, the three tomoe on his eye began to swirl.. "Who....Do you...Think you are....To do such a thing...Who gave you...Permission to take her from her grave?!" He asked, his eyes flared his hands clenched so tightly, the blood felt like it stopped flowing for a moment, the tips of his fingers going pale, and the edges of his nails, dug into his own flesh. His heart raced fulling a violent tune.

He stared directly at Asteroth, ignoring the flesh-puppet for the time being, she was the one that had tampered with the dead body of his friend. Even if it was a somewhat concious form, Could he consider that truly living? Was that really his friend?* - Mon Oct  5 04:14:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Masked Man**(Jjking218) looks a the zombified version of his friend, unable to believe this, not as flustered as he might've normally been. His emotions were crossed between happiness and anger, it was hard not to be happy when you were reunited with an old friend who  was dead...But he couldn't accept this as his actual friend....She was dead, he didn't believe in second chances, he didn't believe in the Human soul, he couldn't physically explain this act that went against the laws of nature.

But one thing was for sure, the unmistakable anger never escaped his body. Harboring it deep within himself, if he was going to play the part...He had to keep his composure. But the sight pained him greatly, but also invoked happiness, so he was perplexed.* - Mon Oct  5 04:36:28 2015

Before he gathered his words and opened his mouth once again:

"I simply want to see what lies on the otherside of the mountain."* - Mon Oct  5 19:47:50 2015

He was using her own body's chakra as a way to conceal himself from Hideki's eyes. Whilst his own eye closed, as he turned to face the male. 

"Bwah? I'm sorry! I was just trying to get to know her, I heard love is in the air!" He was probably a idiot.* - Mon Oct  5 20:27:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Masked Man**(Jjking218) simply sighed, if anything this action would've made kidnapping her several times easier, as she hit the ground. He was quick to regroup, he was a drained Shinobi afteral, so his foot would slam down upon the hilt of the Katana, aiming to knock it into the air with a single motion, before, his hand shot out to catch it, keeping his eye closed for a moment:

"My eye? Couldn't I have been born with it? Have you neglected that possibility?"* - Mon Oct  5 20:36:28 2015

Aiming to create some distance, honestly had he picked up the sword girl, or not, he'd relase her , putting her in the path of Hideki's attack. Having no qualms about sacrificing her.

"If you'd focus more, You'd put together, why there's only a single hole in my mask. It's because I only have one eye, It's my punishment for escaping the hunt of Kirigakure and leaving my friends behind." The male stated followed by a "Whoopsie Daisy." As he landed on the ground.* - Mon Oct  5 20:51:50 2015

In a brief series of handseals, raising two fingers to the side of his mouth, as he inhaled followed by an exhale, upon exhaling, a large ball of flames, would begin to shoot towards the Hideki and Chiharu duo. Seemingly done with this situation as he simply spoke:

"Just becuase the hunt has ended, doesn't change the scars that're left in it's wake."* - Mon Oct  5 21:14:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) nodded as he headed to the bathroom, opening the door he'd allow for her to pass after she had passed he'd close the door behind them, there was an average sized tub, definately not meant for two people but he asked "Do you prefer the water warm or hot?" He asked looking to her.* - Tue Oct  6 02:00:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) smiled a bit at her comment, as he slowly watched as she took her shoes, and pouch off. He released a low laugh as he spoke "I guess I've been caught red-handed." He admitted finally finishing with his shirt, he slowly tossed it off to the side in a basket, not worrying about folding it, before he began to work on his belt buckle as he simply stated: "Though I'm confident in my abilities to win this game." He stated, clearly changing this bath into a game in which he'd try his best to fluster  Kirie without going overboard.* - Tue Oct  6 02:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) blinked as she actually stripped, he was definately taken back as he watched her remove her shirt, followed by her bra, her pants and her panties. A faint blush had appeared on his face, but he did pick up on her sigh. He took a long moment to look at her as she stood there, before watching her untie the band which held her hair together, causing her long silver her to fall low dpwn her back, almost in disbelief her hair was that long. He swallowed hard, he wondered why she had both eyes closed, but didn't say anything as of yet. But slowly he moved to finish unfastening his pants before pulling them down around his ankles and kicking them off before finally he took off his underwear as he spoke "Do...Do you need help getting into the tub?" He asked.* - Tue Oct  6 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) was simply stunned, probably most of which could be seen by Kirie, as he watched her enter the tub. Honestly, for whatever reason due to their first enouncter back a while ago, he hadn't considered the possibility that she looked well...Like a girl. That definately surprised him, not in the sense he didn't believe she was a girl, but in the sense that he never thought deeper about her. But he shook his head, before he moved to grab the towels, bringing them closer, before he stated "M-Make room." As he prepared to enter the tub.* - Tue Oct  6 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) would slowly move to get into the water with his body  facing her as he spoke "You c-can stretch out again." He stated lightly. Looking at her as he spoke "That technique...You'd want to learn it?" He asked looking at her curiously. But he had an idea of how to make this more interesting as he spoke "Why don't you turn your back to me?" He asked playfully.* - Tue Oct  6 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked at her as he spoke "Mm, Definately advantageous." He stated before he spoke "I told you this is a game right~? What good is a game if no one does anything? If you'd like, I'll get out and you scoot up." He offered, watching her face curiously, * - Tue Oct  6 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) would simply smile as she turned exposing her back to him, and slowly he leaned forward, aiming to wrap his arms around her waist and pull her back towards him as he asked "For the sake of the game anything if fair correct?~ In the attempt at making you flustered? You can also attempt me if you'd like, competition makes the game funnier." He stated, keeping her hands around her waist had she permitted him, still admiring the expansive amount of hair she had. Or rather how long it was.* - Tue Oct  6 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) wouldn't have dreamed of aiming to seal her hair and as such the moment he noticed any movement he stopped his own, not resisting the bindings of her hair. "I see, that's comforting to know in a way." He stated lightly, attempting to free his hands should she permit him, before leaning back in the tub as he spoke "I didn't mean to offend you, in any way. I won't lay my hands on you either." He stated lightly, looking at her hair as he spoke "Will you accept my apology?" He asked her lightly, feeling the hair wrap around his waist.* - Tue Oct  6 03:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) watched her as she spoke relaxixng in the tub as he spoke "I suppose your're right, People tell me that often, I'll try to keep myself in check. But I know if I'm not in check, You'll put me in it." He stated lightly, as he relaxed, he was definately a big contridiction and as such he probably confused most people around him, but that was fine for now. "Kirie, I want you to know, I consider you like family, everyone in this group is apart of this family, I'll take your advice and heed your warnings, and ensure I never make you or anyone else uncomfortable, and not to get overconfident."* - Tue Oct  6 03:40:35 2015
