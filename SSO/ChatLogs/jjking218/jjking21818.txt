<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a deep breath as he nodded his head deciding it was time to demonstrate what he had been doing over the past few weeks. He had definately been practicing this style, along with it's technique he had decided to first start off with the technique known as Misdirect. Taking a deep breath he slowly entered a relaxed stance, before raising a single hand, as he aimed to mimic the technique against an invisible opponent, as he slowly attempted to guide away the strike which was guided towards him.

With a gentle motion he would've left his opponent open for a follow up attack, he took a deep breath and inhaled followed by a brief exhale. He got back into his stance, before suddenly shooting his hand forward, aimed at his invisible opponent's adam's apple, before slowly retracting it he took a deep breath and sighed, those were the first two he had learned, and thus were the furthest along he had to practice some more with the final two.* - Wed Sep 16 22:22:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) says: I guess I just want to solely focus on ninjutsu. - Thu Sep 17 15:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) nodded his head lightly, as he listened to Fujitora, he had probably no idea how he'd capture the fish, But he shrugged his shoulders. he figured he'd do his part eventually. He figured afew missions pay would do wonders for his banking and financial situation. He cracked his knuckles, before he moved to the edge of the ship looking out over the water, he wondered what he could find, assuming most of these sharks were already contracted the remaining summonings would probably be basic fish, or maybe squid or shrimp. He cracked his knuckles before looking to Fujitora.

"Any ideas on how to get them?" He asked lightly.

Staring out over the blue sea, he inhaled the musk of the salty water, as he stared into it's deths.* - Thu Sep 17 15:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Guessing is not good enough either. - Thu Sep 17 15:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) says: Hm? - Thu Sep 17 15:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: You need to be sure of what you want. - Thu Sep 17 15:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: No second guessing. - Thu Sep 17 15:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) nodded his head, as he waited patiently, oddly a trait the boy seemed to have a surplus of patience a gift really as he nodded his head, deciding to take a seat upon the edge of the boat, his legs dangled above the water, as he yawned subtly "Not much happens does it?" He asked lightly,  running a single hand through his hair, as his gaze shifted to the sky above him, before his hands rested on his legs.* - Thu Sep 17 15:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a deep breath as he cracked his knuckles, his hands were raised to chest level as he began to inhale followed by a brief exhale. As the chakra gathered at his finger tips,  he lept onto the rock before slamming his hands against the edge of the rock, immediately lightning shot from the tips of his fingers, traveling along the side of the beacon, before touching the water. Threatening to electrocute anyone within the water, honestly, he didn't have much proficiency with Lightning, so at most it'd only temporarily disable or render a monster unconcious.

But that was honestly, all he intended for it to do anyway. Taking a deep breath, he inhaled deeply before exhaling finding this to be an interesting choice of a mission. He wondered who had decided upon it, but he gave it to Fujitora for taking the initiative.* - Thu Sep 17 15:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a deep breath and inhaled followed by a deep exhale, this was definately problematic, and his responses, were definately limited. But if it was a sea monster, despite what most people would think, fish don't actually have a high resistence level when it comes to fire, not innately that's. As long as it wasn't currently submerged, he raised his hands and began weaving a series of handseals, before he began to gather his chakra into his lungs, feeling it ignite before he released it forward it gathered into that of a ball of fire, which was aimed at the bigger one.

Considering it to be a major threat, he aimed to deal with it first, of course this was after the water beam, which  he attempted to avoid in the same manner as Fujitora, he seemed to be very competent at times, but regardless, as he attempted his attack he braced himself for whatever the beast may do in return, knowing Fujitora...Probably had his back. He was content with this knowledge, not to say that he wasn't going to try to have his own back.* - Thu Sep 17 16:15:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: This medium sized is worth a C or B maybe..This huge one more so worth an A.. - Thu Sep 17 16:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: So all we have to do is catch them and bring them back very well. - Thu Sep 17 16:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) wasted no time hesitating as he looked at the medium one which had landed on the ship, and immediately, he extended a hand forward, and immediately his chakra began gathering upon his palm. Wind began to swirl about, before gathering into a miniature vortex, which was shot forward at the medium beast, aiming to cause some concussive damage to the beast and knock it from the ship, at least that was his goal with this attack.

He was aiming to be somewhat helpful with his attacks, and if he was lucky he'd get money for at least participating in the taking down of the large beast.* - Thu Sep 17 16:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: This is Chaos... - Thu Sep 17 16:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a deep breath and sighed, as he noticed the beast was charging at him, he took a deep breath, noticing yet another attack comming towards him, he silently cursed before his hands were raised to chest level, inhaling followed by a deep exhale, as he conjured up a set of handseals, the chakra gathering in his chest, before being expelled outwards,  it gathered into another ball of fire coupled with Fujitora's own, aiming to over power the beast before him, hopefully make it fried fish.

He didn't intend to get hurt, but he felt like it was becomming inevitable, as he dove to the side, the lightning grazed his hit, causing a light cut which immediately numbed up.* - Thu Sep 17 16:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) honestly had no means of attacking besides the incessant spamming of the same technique repeatedly, so as predicted that's exactly what he did, well he began gathering chakra against the center of his palm, which caused the wind to begin to flourish around his palm before being expelled outwards which gathering into a small vortex which was fired at one of the B ranked Monsters, aiming to provide some concussive force, and maybe give power to an allies Fire technique if posisble.* - Thu Sep 17 17:12:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Zetsumo has a senor by his side at all times... - Fri Sep 18 15:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: How do you know about that, Violet? - Fri Sep 18 15:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: She is very powerful and only there to watch his blind sides, Tethys told me - Fri Sep 18 15:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Assasination isn't easy, but I imagine the Hidden Mist ninjas are specialist in silent killings... Then who is under him ...What if we force his hand? - Fri Sep 18 15:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I wish Koeki was around. - Fri Sep 18 15:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: So she could decide what we are going to do. - Fri Sep 18 15:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: We need someone as strong ass him to attack him... - Fri Sep 18 15:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: ... The only thing we could do is decrease his numbers. - Fri Sep 18 15:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Can we do that effeciently enough to keep our numbers steady? - Fri Sep 18 15:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: If we would could avoid amegakure then we would just have to deal with Zetsumo - Fri Sep 18 15:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: A well planned attack, a surprise of some sort that can give us advantage against his split troops. - Fri Sep 18 15:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Yes! - Fri Sep 18 15:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: That would be a tide turner for us - Fri Sep 18 15:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Guerilla Warfare... Do we have enough troops to cause a dense fog when we come? - Fri Sep 18 15:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: If I had an exact locations of their forces, a plan would be much easier to come up with. - Fri Sep 18 15:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Because theres several ways to go about it, mist would be the last thing to do after we done something even bigger on their forces. - Fri Sep 18 15:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: My eyes see a lot of things f we could form scouts, then we might be able to snuff out some. Even if its a little. - Fri Sep 18 15:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: That man with the clones would be better... They seemed completely independent. If we could send them out we risk not losing such valuable things like sensors and other couts. - Fri Sep 18 15:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: He seemed very compassionate about Tethys we need to find him. I know he would help if he's willing to take commands. - Fri Sep 18 15:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Setsuna... come here please... lets go for a walk - Fri Sep 18 15:53:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: But our priority isn't Zetsumo himself, its too get rid of the forces that threaten the village. Zetsumo is a scary threat and needs to be handle. - Fri Sep 18 17:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: You misunderstand. - Fri Sep 18 17:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: But wiping out his underlings will greatly lower his threat to us, and gives us a better chance to take him out. - Fri Sep 18 17:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: I saw Zetsumo only, the army og guards he had there were very hostile, there was one concealed figure,  I couldn't run the risk of traveling under ground with my jutsu knowing that there would be land mines. - Fri Sep 18 17:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: We won't just be taking out Zetsumo. - Fri Sep 18 17:28:06 2015
