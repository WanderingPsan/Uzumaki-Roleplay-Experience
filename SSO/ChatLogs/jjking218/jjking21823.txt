He looked to Ushinawa, and smiled warmly, nodding his head in thanks. Before he debated about Suitengu for a moment before looking to Zenaki "Do you know if Zetsumo's son has begun any formal schooling or training?"* - Mon Sep 21 12:58:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) contemplated what he was asked for before he ran a single hand through his hair, offering a gentle smile as he spoke "Soon, Erebus. I assure you, the fruit is always sweeter the longer you wait." He stated lightly, as he wondered what he could have the male do.. Honestly he hadn't anticipated the events of the war, and it kind of stumpped him when he tried to think of stuff to do now, but he figured that feeling would pass over soon enough. Though he was slowly beginning to think of things he could have him do.* - Mon Sep 21 13:21:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) slowly entered her house, still a bit awe'd by how expansive it is, but slowly he entered taking his time as he trailed behind her. But as she spoke, he stopped cold in his tracks.

"A-A shower?"* - Mon Sep 21 16:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm~ - Mon Sep 21 16:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'll go after. - Mon Sep 21 16:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) blushed a bit subtly, as he looked at her before nodding his head, definately a bit flustered as he headed into the room he was told about. And took a deep breath, he was definately overthinking things, but he could feel his heart racing, threatening to leap from his chest, closing the door behind him, he slowly began to disrobe, doing his best to focus. As he slowly stepped into the shower, feeling the coldness of the tiles beneath his feet.

He turned on the water, and slowly he began to wash himself, using a clothe to rub over his body in unison with the soap, he then proceeded to go through his hair with shampoo, and rinsing it out by allowing his head to rest beneath the flowing water. Once he was cleaned, he moved to grab a towel which he used to dry off his body.

Before grabbing his clothes, he decided to slip back into them unless he was told otherwise, or saw another set of clothes nearby.* - Mon Sep 21 17:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) wasn't quite paying attention, and as such he wasn't aware of her prescence until she spoke. And he almost lept out of his skin, he felt his entire body heat up and his cheeks turned as red as a tomato.. Quickly his hand moved to cover himself, but he was to embarrassed to turn to face her opening his mouth, he spoke:

"L-L-Lera?! W-What are you doing?" He asked, the embarrassment and nervousness very much apparent and crept into his voice.* - Mon Sep 21 17:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) felt the sponge touch his back, and it felt almost like a spark had went off in his mind, Unable to hide or contain how flustered he was he seemed to almost have trouble formulating the words he wished to speak:

"B-But, Y-You're...W-Why?" He decided to give up, but it was obvious he had a gentle nervous shake, mostly out of embarrassment, his eyes found the space between his feet.He felt a certain hotness beginning to form in his cheeks.* - Mon Sep 21 17:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) felt his hair stand on end as he felt the warmth of her body glowing closer to his own from behind, his light blue eyes seemingly shined in his embarrassment, and once she was done, he saw her hand move around in front of him, offering him to take the sponge, he went wide-eyed as he heard her words, but slowly took the sponge.

"I-I c-...I-I.." But then he told himself, thirty seconds of courage, this was Lera afterall...He'd do what he could for her. 


That didn't change the fact he was embarrassed but he slowly spoke "A-Alright..."Waiting for her to turn, or when he assumed she turned to turn to face her back.* - Mon Sep 21 17:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) turned and slowly faced her looking at her back, his blush became more pronounced as he gave the sponge a gentle squeeze, taking a step closer, his hand was extended forward, the sponge behind held gentle in his hand, as he gently placed it against her back, the tips of his fingers subtly brushing against her back due to the manner he was holding the sponge as he looked at her and unconciously he said  her name "L-Lera.."* - Mon Sep 21 17:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmmmm? - Mon Sep 21 17:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: N-Nothing! - Mon Sep 21 17:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) he paused for a moment, as he looked at the ground, ther ewas a slight shaking of his hand, as he struggled to calm his breathing, he didn't seem to be good in most situations but he was trying. And honestly, he wouldn't change this embarrassing moment for the world, as he continued using the sponge he simply stated:

"I-I was just t-thinking...H-How lucky I am is all."* - Mon Sep 21 17:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218)  eyes went wide as she suddenly turned around,  and as such he aimed to turn around only to feel her hands grab his arms stopping him from avoiding her gaze, he honestly didn't know how to react, it was almost like his brain was taking a moment to long to process what he was seeing, but he wanted to not to flee, not in this situation, and all he needed to do was calm down, focus on the woman before him. He heard her words, and immediately,he told himself "Just this once...." He slowly leanred forward, not resisting her hold any longer, as he attempted to give her a kiss upon the lips, he decided it was his turn to surprise her. "I just have to enjoy...The little things." He told himself.* - Mon Sep 21 17:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) felt heimself pushed against the wall, feeling the coldness of it against his back, sent almost beautiful chills through his body. Feeling her arms wrapping around his waist his own hands found hers. Keeping the kiss going he was enjoying it to much to stop as one of his hands found the denter of her back, pulling her a bit closer to his own body as one hand rested upon her waistline from behind. With a single fluid motion,he aimed to shift their positions with her against the wall.* - Mon Sep 21 17:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) felt their bodies hit the shower's floor with Lera atop of him, looking towards her, he couldn't help buy relase a low chuckle, his wet hair plastered against his face,he'd wrap his arms around her once again, admiring her beautiful the moments they shared together all came flooding back to his mind, as they sat there in this moment. He felt a certain clarity in his mind, which he couldn't place, it was almost unnatural, he'd have to patent her catch phrase if she didn't..It held some magical properties.* - Mon Sep 21 18:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Hm. - Mon Sep 21 18:42:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I will give you whatever Aid you need, in exchange for a lock of your hair, If I take your hair, it'll allow me to kill you from wherever I stand on this planet. - Mon Sep 21 22:22:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Or do you Value your Villagers over your own? - Mon Sep 21 22:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not a very good metaphor. Say no to the hair and not only do the villagers die, but you do too. - Mon Sep 21 22:25:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Absolutely. - Mon Sep 21 22:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Does that mean I value my own life over the villagers'? I dunno. Don't care. - Mon Sep 21 22:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd still blow you up. - Mon Sep 21 22:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But -- I'm not the leader either. - Mon Sep 21 22:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Tell me... - Mon Sep 21 22:28:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Not saying I'd actually attack him...but he doesn't need to hear that either. - Mon Sep 21 22:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I never could understand, fearing what you don't know, It just seems...Irrational doesn't it? - Mon Sep 21 22:29:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I could go for some tea, I guess. - Mon Sep 21 22:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) takes a step to the side allowing Katsune to pass, offering a gentle smile "I'm not familiar with this village...I am in your care, Katsune-san."* - Mon Sep 21 22:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) slowly takes a seat at the table, "Anything you'd reccomend? Doesn't have to be tea."* - Mon Sep 21 22:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I do drink a lot of sake. People are starting to get the wrong impression about that though. - Mon Sep 21 22:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Why would they? - Mon Sep 21 22:37:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) placed his elbow upon the table, resting his chin atop of his palm, as his light blue eyes focused on Katsune offering a gentle smile "Then Sake it is, I'd like to formulate my own opinions." He stated gently.* - Mon Sep 21 22:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: I miss when they feared us. . . - Mon Sep 21 22:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) continued to stare for a moment, his gaze was almost preying as if trying to reveal any secrets she had hidden away just below the surface as he spoke "The headband on your left ankle, It's a Konohagakurian one right?" He seemed to not pay much attention to her having averted his eyes, but his gaze didn't waver.* - Mon Sep 21 22:42:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) as she spoke, he didn't seem to miss a beat as he looked her back in the eyes, with a subtle tilt of his head as he spoke:

"I was asking if you regret the choices you made, or could've made." 

His smile was gentle, but at the same time it focused in on her face, he seemed undetterred by such concepts as killing and he wouldn't miss a beat due to them being bought up in a conversation.* - Mon Sep 21 22:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If I regret any choice I've ever made, it was walking through those gates five years ago to find food. - Mon Sep 21 22:56:12 2015
