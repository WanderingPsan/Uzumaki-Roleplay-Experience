<br><font color=yellow>*Sirozan(XxkasukuxX) Sirozan begins wondering the outskirts of The Hidden Mist at dusk, Which his superiors tells him that it's dangerous, Blowing them off and begins looking for a massive water source, Since his village is running low on A hydratation liquid. He begins walking and thinking about the lectures he'll hear from his superiors when they hear he returns from outside the village, Before he can remember, he looks up and it;'ss very dark out thinking, "Well, I need to hurry before wild animals start thinking they can attack me..." after this statement he is very cautious walking about. Looking back and uses his peripheral vision to his advantage. After walking several minutes he gettings very bored and even considering returning home. But, this actually made him want to travel faster, he then crouches down and begins to scout a tree branch and locks on and releases his stance and goes soar towards the branch, then begins to get a rhythm taking one foot at a time on branch consecutively. He then hears something like someone following him, lashing out his kunai and attaches a wire on it and fires it's behind him as a trap wire. He then feels this same wire move and stops and gulps thinking, "As my predictions was right." and says in a calm voice, "Come out, I can tell your there...". He then gets into a basic fighting stance cleching his fists and yells, "COME ON NOW, YOU CAN'T HIDE!" then he hears a tree branch breaks close to him and his heart begins to beat very fast. The figure begins to appear from what of the dark with Sirozan's kunai stating, "This trap was successful, Your senses are redefined, But You Should have stayed home, Boy." Sirozan's teeth begins to clamp hearing, "Boy." He begins to walk from the darkness smirking, touching his headband and swinging Sirozan's kunai on a finger. He looks like clan from the Hidden Mist called "Hoshigaki" with a rogue headband and with rags on his back. Sirozan then comments on his headband, "I see your -where- from The Hidden Mist...?" with his guard on even more alert. The Hoshigaki then asks, "That trash of a village? Psshh, Anywhere is better then there..." Sirozan then jumps down from the tree on to the ground with the Hoshigaki following him. Sirozan then thinks, "He's following me so he must be a lethal threat...I have to attack off-guard so i can continue searching." The Hoshigaki then pulls out a jar from his kunai holster and begins to consume the contents of it saying, "Ahh...That's goood water...Now, This is what's going to happen. Your going to give me all your suppiles or Die...or, i can rob you AND kill you." with a maniacally laugh. Sirozan says, "You won't do either you punk!" and picks up a giant stick the size of a 4x4 and perpares to attack the Hoshigaki. The Hoshigaki then throws the jar to the ground and shatters it perpares a defense. Sirozan then begins swinging the stick violently with relatively ease matching the Hoshigaki's stolen kunai. Sirozan then props up the stick on the ground and throws his body weight into a kick towards the Hoshigaki's gut. The Hoshigaki then wipes the blood from his mouth and leans up and perfroms some handseals and shouts, "Water Style : Water Clone Technique!" then punches the clones expelling all of the water onto the ground. Sirozan suprised kneels down and uses his finger to lick up some water and he starts to sulp it up saying, ' AHHHH! Water taste so good...This is going to be clockwork now!" then his muscles begin to pump alittle with every sip. The Hoshigaki then tells Sirozan that he better look up and Sirozan sweepkicks The Hoskigaki, The Hoshigaki is suprise by his speed and elbows his jaw and begins to start flying backwards. Sirozan then grabs his stick and begins to walk and stops to zooms into the place he elbowed The Hoshigaki, barely hereing the Hoshigaki annouce his Water Style : Great Exploding Water Colliding Wave trying to outrun it then getting hit dead on to the back,"W-What..NOOOOooo..."when the blast settled he found him self inside a bubble of water. The Hoshigaki then pops up with a ripped shirt and taking deep breaths looking fatigue saying, "I underestimated you, Now it's time to see the real power of the Hoshigaki Clan!" rushing into the floating injured Sirozan perform and landing harsh connecting chains of combos with very loud grunts then Hoshigaki says, "See you are weak, Hidden Mist trash..Should have stayed home child, Heh.." Sirozan then begins to wake softly saying, "Well....I told you wasn't going to kill me...or rob me......NOW TO KEEP MY PROMISE!" with a electric voice. With Sirozan's rage on a new peak his body begin to liquify and he comments on his teeth saying, "My Teeth...I'll Rip You Apart!!!!" The Hoshigaki then is stunned by his transformation. Sirozan races towards the Hoshigaki and throws everything at him with bashing combos connecting and breaking every move the hit touches. Sirozan then picks up the nearly dead Hoshigaki and states, "You gave me a fight i thought i wasa going to lose...Thank you, For this Great Fight, But you have to die...But, Before that. I'll tell you my name, I am Sirozan from the Hozuki clan, Hozuki, Sirozan!" he then tosses the almost lifeless body of the Hoshigaki then, soaks up the water like a sponge. Then, swims up towards the sky and goes shuffling into his pockets and hosters thinking, "It's -gotta- be in here..." and then opens a pocket wide and finds a underwater lighter saying, "Yes, Now I can finish this." after he flickers the lighter and surrounds it in a small water bubble putting one hand on the bubble performs couple of handseals and shouting, "Water Style : Water Dragon Bullet!!!!!" a large amount of water formed into a giant, powerful dragon with the underwater lighter infused into the water is rushed at the almost-lifeless Hoshigaki the size of a large oak tree is expelled into the  Body of the Hoshigaki causing a large devasting wave of water covering alot of the forest with a small explosion of the underwater lighter inploding. After the water settles, He slowly floats down reverting from his Water Hydration Technique, Looking at the now officially lifeless corpse, with complete white eyes with -no- iris. of The Hoshigaki. Sirozan didn't waste no time giving the Hoshigaki pity and limped and buckled towards the Hidden Mist Village with required water inside his body.*

<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) yawned as he wiped his eyes and said "Where are we going to do this...It isn't every day you get to kill a Kage..."*
<br><font color=green>*Trace(Jjking218) says: Lets go to the moutain Shall we?
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Right.

<br><font color=yellow>*Trace(Jjking218) takes out a scroll.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Trace(Jjking218) places the scroll onto the ground, Biting his thumb it revealed a look alike of himself. Dressed in the same exact clothing.*
<br><font color=green>*Trace(Jjking218) says: What you two do is up to you.
<br><font color=green>*Trace(Jjking218) says: Make it believeable.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Uh...
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Does it really matter? I mean theres no one else here, and i'd rather not put on an act...
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) closed his eyes as he Byakugan activated, the veins around his eyes and temples buldged out as he said "I have a skill that will slow your heart rate and breathing down to where even a skilled sensor wouldn't be able to see if you are alive." He cracked his knuckles and said "Ready?"*
<br><font color=green>*Trace(Jjking218) says: True.
<br><font color=green>*Trace(Jjking218) says: Go for it.
<br><font color=green>*Trace(Jjking218) says: Just make the swap.

<br><font color=green>*Trace(Jjking218) says: EPIC o-o)
<br><font color=green>*Trace(Jjking218) says: Soul shard)
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) slowly walked toward the Mizukage, crouching down he said "Time to start..." Slamming both palms into the man's chest he pivoted around and slammed another two into the man as he said "Four palm..." Slamming another four palm attacks into the mans spin he yelled out "Eight palm!" his speed began to pick up as he began to twist around the man slamming eight more attacks into the man as he yelled out "Sixteen Palms!" Quickening his pace he began to appear almost like a blurr as he smacked the mans chest sixteen more times and yelled out "Thirty-Two Palms!" Finally he sweep kicked the man so he popped into the air and kneeled him in the stomach then slammed another thirty-two palms into the man's chest as he yelled out "Sixty-Four palms!" Time began to appear slowly for the man, to the others he would be untrackable as he slammed in sixty-three palms and then quickly pivoted and struck his final palm into the man's chest near his heart and yelled out "Eight Trigrams: One Hundred- Twenty Eight Palms!" The impact would throw the Mizukage a good ten feet away from them as he said "He should be out cold now...."*
<br><font color=yellow>*Nakimura, Zen(Jjking218) would feel the first palm hit him, As he was caught completely off guard. Feeling the others come which seemed like a blurr. Moments Passed, As Alister was sent backwards. Hitting the ground with a thud, his breathing was low. His temperature had also lowered. As he fell to the ground unconious laying flat out, As he thought"Not to self don't piss sperm eyes off." As he sat there for ever so long, Waiting to reopen his eyes into his new identity. As he knew he would be awakened by one of the two.*
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Been awhile since I've used that...
<br><font color=yellow>*Karina(Trinity606) walked over to check his pulse and wake him up.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: If I had slipped and hit his heart...He'ld have died.
<br><font color=yellow>*Nakimura, Zen(Jjking218) wakes up slightly.*
<br><font color=green>*Nakimura, Zen(Jjking218) says: You guys done?

<br><font color=green>*Nakimura, Zen(Jjking218) says: Afk)
<br><font color=green>*Nakimura, Zen(Jjking218) says: People live their lives bound by what they accept as correct and true. That's how they define "reality". But what does it mean to be "correct" or "true"? Merely vague concepts their "reality" may all be a mirage. Can we consider them to simply be living in their own world, shaped by their beliefs?

He talked about how his previous master was horribely untrained, and that I better be a better pupil. I told the giant snake to shut up about it as I bit my thumb. The snake raged more saying when I summoned it, it would demand a few sacrifices. He wrote his name on the scroll in blood as it poofed away. Next Tachi was sitting infront of his master, ready to learn how to summon.
 His teacher would demonstrate the many forms of summoning, Tachi and that giant snake known as Manda had a quick glareing contest. Tachi would sigh as he bit his thumb. He would get used to that. He placed his hands on the ground after a quick few handseals. As the smoke traveled through out the area, a little garden snake sized snake would be there. Tachi facepalmed as he had not the right amount of chakra to summon something bigger. His teacher simply pat him on the back, telling him to try again next time.

<br><font color=yellow>*Zaku(Zaku49) was having an everyday day. Nothing special. He had just recenetely graduated from the Academy, and had a fresh new headband on his head. He smiled to himself in the Academy Mirror, and walked off. After a few minutes, he was home. He didn't really know what to do, so, he choose to sit down and chill. Chillin, two weird figures began to slither into his room.

As he heard the slithering noises he looked down at the  Briground, and noticed two slithering snakes. "Oh hell nah'. Ain't no mothafucking Snake gonna come up in MY place, fuck up MY house." As he said that, he grabbed ahold of a kunai in his holister, and instantly, threw one at the snake. It impaled one right in his chest, and he started at the other snake.

"Hsss..."

"Oh hell nah. You dyin' too." Zaku said. The snake then instantly attempted to slither off, but Zaku had ran at it, and grabbed ahold of the motherfucker. Picking him up, he picked the kunai up off the ground and said "Say your prayers." As he said that, he pointed the kunai at the snakes neck and it said "Wait!" As it said that, he looked at that mothafucking son of a bitch and said "Hmm?" He asked with curiousity.

"Please don't kill me! You just killed my wife! We just came here to the village to try and find someone help us!" The snake hissed. "Help you with what?" Zaku asked, with a puzzled look. "Help us leave our world, and find someone else!" The snake hissed on. "We need someone to work with us, so to speak!" As the snake said that, he looked at Zaku and said "I think you're the one we've been looking for." As the snake said that, he bit down on Zaku's lower thumb, and blood began to trinkle.

Looking at the blood, he threw the snake down onto the ground and said "The fuck was that for?!" As he asked that, he felt the blood continue to drop onto the ground. The snake smiled and said "Perrrffeeccctttt." As he said that, a piece of paper appeared from underneath the snake and he slitthered. "Sign your name.". Being cautious, Zaku did as he was told. Looking over at the paper the snake closed the paper, and ate it. "Perfect. Now boy. Do exactly as I say." As he said that, he explained the ability on how to summon snakes, and what not.

"Alright, this shit better work." Zaku said. Looking downwards, he began to execute a various number of handseals, and sent waves of chakra through his body. "Kuhsyise no Jutsu!" He yelled from the top of his lungs. Screaming that, he placed his arm face down, hand on the ground, and chakra emersed from his arm into his hand, onto the floor. A cloud of smoke appeared around Zaku, and as it disperessed, there stood bsedi him, a perfect snake. Smiling, he said "Thanks, Old Snake. What's your name again?" The snake looked at ihm and hissed "MananaManta."*
