<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a deep breath and yawned as he took a deep breath and sat down on the ground, taking notice of Mariana's jiggling breasts but he had a girl he was very much infatuated with but he'd never admit that willingly. But he knew because he cared for the girl, he had to get stronger for her sake, and he wanted to help lead this world in a better direction for her sake. So taking a seat upon the ground he began to gather his chakra.

Before Ultimately using the chakra suppression technique he hid his chakra from being detected. That was fine and all, but he cracked his knuckles as he slowly lowered himself into a meditative position, closing his eyes as he listened to the fighting occuring only Thirty or so feet from his position, he had decided to try mental training rather than physical, it was all good though, he had a wide-variety of techniques.

To many of which would be a hassle and not good if he showed them all in public, so he began focusing mentally, cracking his knuckles, as he concentrated on the task before him slowly his mind went over the numerous techniques he had on his arsenal, his medicinal techniques, his Ninjutsu, his Taijutsu and his fuuinjutsu, surprisingly his fuuinjutsu had been long since mastered which was good for him.

He smiled gently he figured he'd start with his medical jutsu, since that ultimately would interest him in the long run he had to focus, some, so taking a deep breath his light blue eyes began to scan the inside of his eye-lids, thinking about the temperature control technique, and the Novice healing technique he had at his disposal, he decided he'd work through them to the best of his ability. 

He knew this wouldn't be an easy road but it could very well get him further along his path to getting stronger, and ultimately ensuring his ability to protect the one he loved, he didn't think himself better than the rest, he knew he wasn't but he was definately an actor, he could fake a lot of things, including emotions, but he couldn't fake genuine love or interest in another human, it was far byond his capabilities.

He knew he would never be able to blend in One hundred percent, but he knew he could stand out in a good way rather than a bad way he would need to get stronger to remain relevent though so he took a deep breath and focused deciding it would be needed for him to get further in his training so he cracked his knuckles and nodded his head, continuing his mental training.

He found the ground almost unnaturally hard where he sat, he wondered out of all places why he had decided to sit here realising it would probably be more comfortable if he sat closer to the water, but  he shrugged his shoulders it didn't honestly mean much to him, he needed to get stronger naturally anyway,  so he yawned lightly, a single hand being moved through his blonde hair, as he relaxed his body he felt like he was making great progress with his lessons, and that was good.

So with a subtle yawn he continued working on his techniques aiming to make at least some minor progress with his techniques so he tried his best taking his time he focused on what it was he needed to do, so taking a deep breath he inhaled followed by a deep exhale.* - Wed Sep 23 14:54:04 2015
