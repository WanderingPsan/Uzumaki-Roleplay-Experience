<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So you're thinking that we should flee in the end? - Sun Sep 20 15:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: We take what forces we have go to SUna put an end to this edge guy  use it resources to by time and then  when the moment is right we but an end to this big bad zetusmo guy who ever he is. - Sun Sep 20 15:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: That sounds like a bad plan. - Sun Sep 20 15:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: It's a terrible plan. - Sun Sep 20 15:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I'll explain why I believe the plan is bad. First off, we don't know of Edge's location, nor his forces strength or size.  Second, we are currently in war with Zetsumo's forces who is allied with Ame. They are positioned around the village, as far as I recall.  - Sun Sep 20 15:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Well, Edge is more powerful than you think, Flexus. - Sun Sep 20 15:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Doesnt this place have like an ecaoe tunnel or something? - Sun Sep 20 15:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: As of right now, we need a secret place to go to. - Sun Sep 20 15:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Suna is not that place. Our presence and activity there will alert Zetsumo, plus I think the adjustment from a place like Kirigakure to Sunagakure is the worst, especially with resources being sapped constantly. - Sun Sep 20 15:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: ...Is this where I laugh? - Sun Sep 20 15:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: The moment we send a large force out to locate and deal with Edge, they will spot and attack.  Then there's the problem of war fatalities. We are already pressed with our forces. We don't have enough strength to split between Zetsumo and Edge. - Sun Sep 20 15:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'm just curious. - Sun Sep 20 15:38:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Wasn't this the course of action -I- Reccomended, Several weeks ago? - Sun Sep 20 15:38:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Well, if you did recommend this several weeks ago, I don't think Lord Tethy was dead then. - Sun Sep 20 15:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I just know that in our curent situation, it's best to deal with what's before us first.  Also, what advantage would we gain from dealing with Edge? - Sun Sep 20 15:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You gain no advantage, Honestly, Edge is better left alone. - Sun Sep 20 15:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Edge only wished to Unite Sunagakure. - Sun Sep 20 15:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: That rests our case. - Sun Sep 20 15:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: However, if we were to say contact Edge and have him join us, I'm sure that would give us an advantage in some form. - Sun Sep 20 15:41:26 2015
