<br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) blinked as he noticed  her attempt to meet his punch half way, and he attempted to pull his strike, without hesitation, his left foot is sent towards her stomach, about mid-way, it ignites with a similar wind chakra, his transition was smooth and effortless, it moves horizontally, as if aiming to lightly cut her stomach. But like before, he held back to the point no physical harm would befall her, besides maybe blunt force damage, and a mild stringing should the wind connect with her.

His eyes stayed focused on her, she was definately a remarkable fighter, he wondered who had trained her.* - Thu Oct  8 01:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) was swept from his feet by the mud which proceeded to push him towards the east, his hands struggling to grab for some sort of leverage to stop his movement but he had little to no availm the chakra gathering around his hand, he attempted to slam it into the ground, at full strength, aiming to use the wind from the attack to cool the mud-rapidly, and cause it to harden. Potentially limiting how far he was sent.* - Thu Oct  8 01:08:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) blinked as the large earthern dome was materialized around him, he honestly had no clue of how he was to escape this, so he approached one of the walls, and aimed to punch it with his wind jutsu. Probably making a good dent, but it wouldn't free him int he immediate future, he was at a lost, but he was also muddy, taking a seat on the ground, he scratched his head thinking of a way to free himself, seemed like he was virtually trapped at this point.* - Thu Oct  8 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not at this time anyway. - Thu Oct  8 01:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) scratched his chin, a tad embarrassed with how this spar had gone as he sighed a bit "I'm sorry, I couldn't entertain." He stated, his hands on his knees, as he sat, he bowed his head apologetically to Katsune, a faint blush which was due to his embarrassment he had hyped himself up but was probably less than par. 

"I'll try to get better."* - Thu Oct  8 01:21:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Well, it would be pretty sucky to have to head home right after getting here. Kumogakure's -really- far away. - Thu Oct  8 01:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: You can say that again. - Thu Oct  8 01:36:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) blinked as he followed her to where she was leading him,part of him wonder if that body suit was comfortable, he saw a guy with a jumpsuit and he was sure it wasn't for a guy, but he didn't dare ask "S-So you have a roommate?" He asked curiously, wondering why there was a base in such an exotic location.* - Thu Oct  8 01:40:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) enters looking around "It's a nice place...But out of the way, isn't it?" He asked looking around lightly, before he heard her words, and decided to look around briefly, before heading to the fridge, as he spoke "Excuse my intrusion." As he aimed to pull the door open, and look for something to drink, noticing countless bottles of Sake lining the door. As a light joke he asked:

"What do you reccomend?"* - Thu Oct  8 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) nodded his head as he reached for a bottle, followed by searching for glasses he found two before he approached Katsune, wondering if he'd be acting like he was to familiar if he took a seat on the couch beside her and decided to take a seat on the floor in front of her opening the bottle he poured two glasses of sake and offered one to her. "I've never...Drunk Sake before." He stated looking at the liquid.* - Thu Oct  8 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) twirled his glass, watching the liquid move before he smelled it, the scent of alcohol burning his nostrils, before he raised it to his lips, tilting it back he took a sip of the liquid coughing as it rolled down his throat. "T-That's s-strong." He muttered, a bit embarrassed, before he realsied he was in the prescence of a woman he tried to mutter up some courage to seem manly. "W-Wow! That's g-great stuff!" He stated, looking more like a fool than manly.* - Thu Oct  8 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anyway. - Thu Oct  8 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) looks up at her as he spoke" I was looking for a place to meet new people...Maybe even become a shinobi." He stated lightly, looking down at the liquid once again, before deciding to try another sip, being gifted the same reaction, as he looked up to her from his position on the floor.* - Thu Oct  8 02:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kumogakure's not good enough for that? - Thu Oct  8 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll admit I've never been. - Thu Oct  8 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Went there once to buy something but I was in and out in ten minutes so it hardly counts. - Thu Oct  8 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) looked at her as he scratched his cheek, "Kumogakure...Is a weird place, It's not the best place for meeting new people." He stated lightly, admiring her talent for drinking down sake like that, so he tried to follow in pursuit and chug down the rest of his glass, coughing up a storm. Before in a moment it felt like someone hit him with a brick.* - Thu Oct  8 02:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. . . - Thu Oct  8 02:14:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) looked at Katsune with admiration as he spoke "Wow, You're a lot better a person Than me." He muttered, unconciously sipping at the Sake but he seemed to handle it a lot better. "No, It's fine." He stated, in regards to her saying it was to much information.* - Thu Oct  8 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) looks down at his sake as he spoke "I don't know...I think I'd be too afraid...To move forward, if someone enslaved me...I don't think I would've had the strength." He mumbled but he shook his head "I apologize...I'm probably bringing up memories you'd like to forget." He stated bowing his head lightly.* - Thu Oct  8 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) looked at her, he probably had already drunk a lot more than he should've but he smiled when she spoke. He looked up to her a faint blush was etched across his face as he spoke "That's good,  Life is pretty good at points, It's these moments. The little ones, that make it enjoyable...In my opinion. "He added that last line for good measure, as he took his final sip, looking at his empty glass.* - Thu Oct  8 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) looked up at her as he maintained his faint blush as he spoke "I...I think you look nice." He stated, raising a single finger to his cheek, he scratched it out of embarrassment, his speech was slightly slurred with the occasional hiccup. But after a moment, he turned and laid upon the floor, resting his head before her feet as he looked up to her studying her expression it seemed like he had stuff he wanted to say but couldn't find the words.* - Thu Oct  8 02:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) looks up at her as she spoke and immediately he retorted "I-I'm not d-drunk!"  Followed by a hiccup, as he rested on the floor by the couch as he spoke "B...But seriously, I...I don't know how I m-managed to get y-you to talk to me. *hiccup*." He stated lightly, looking at her from his position.  His checkered hair hanging low over his face.* - Thu Oct  8 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) looked at the glass of Sake as he spoke "Oh..." He mumbled sounding a bit saddened, but being drunk and all, he still went to reach for the bottle of sake. Though it was slow, and he was too out of it to accurately gauge the distance, and ended up just knocking it over. "Oops.." He muttered.* - Thu Oct  8 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) honestly didn't care currently either as he spoke his voice honestly sounded serious for a moment, it was one of those times, when a drunk went to a pretty dark place as he spoke "I'm....A pretty stupid guy...aren't I..? Too weak...to defend themselves...I don't have any friends....And I'm probably not a likable person..." He muttered.* - Thu Oct  8 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) looks up at the ceiling, as he realised, he was asking a girl who knew nothing about him, to give insight as to what he was. "I see....Thanks for your honesty." He spoke lightly, as he looked around. "I'm....A bit sleepy....Can I...stay here?"* - Thu Oct  8 03:20:06 2015

He stated, rubbing his eyes with both hands, as he stumbled a bit taking two steps, before he collapsed in front of her door way. Snoring heavily.* - Thu Oct  8 03:23:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) blinked as he noticed the technique before him, Hideki was a pretty adept teacher so he figured it wouldn't be long before he was able to pick up what it was Hideki was showing them, cracking his knuckles lightly, he inhaled followed by an exhale, his blue eyes focused on the ground before him, recalling the images his brain had recorded of Hideki's instruction. He had just came in, he seemed to be running....A lot.

But he smiled lightly, before cracking his knuckles, he was having a bit of a problem, he was unsure as to if he should improve his running speed, or work on impriving his strength and Taijutsu skill, but having a Genjutsu technique in his aresenal would no doubt be beneficial to him as a shinobi, so he  wondered aloud, after a moment, he shrugged his shoulders deciding a bit of an indepth analysis would prove useful.

So he raised his hands to chest level, hands holding together as he aimed to make a single handseal, practicing the first handseal before gradually  adding in  the rest, making sure his transition between each seal, was beautiful and took advantage of his  handseals, he was extremely fast when it came to the weaving of handseals.

Definately impressive for most of his age group, the boy had natural talent, but it was painfully obvious he lacked a lot of experience, so after weaving the seals, he decided it was time to add chakra into the fray. Slowly  his chakra was added into the mix, and he definately had...A lot to spare, before he focused on Hideki, chakra flaring he aimed to cast the Genjutsu. Which would probably be easily resisted by the male.* - Fri Oct  9 21:43:53 2015
