Before he slowly took a seat once again, jumping a bit as the cold tiles touched his bottom. "C-Cold." He stated lightly, looking towards her "T-Truth or dare?" He asked,* - Tue Sep 29 02:54:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) silently prays to whatever god relayed his thoughts to her, as he looked at her and spoke "With pleasure~" He stated, attempting to give her a gentle kiss on the neck, before he moved to gently pull the sleeves of her coat from her. Before, his hands found her waist, grabbing the bottom of her shirt, he'd slowly aim to lift it above her head. And finally he moved to unclip her bra before setting it all to the side after successfully exposing her chest.

"M-Mind standing up~?" He asked.

He needed to take off her bottoms afterall.* - Tue Sep 29 03:02:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Let me know. - Tue Sep 29 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) was actually expecting this reaction and as such the moment she went to turn away from him, his hand would've shot out in an attempt to grasp her wrist, and with  a single fluid motion, he'd aim to use her weight against her, and send her to the ground beside the lake, with her arm still held in his hand. He seemed to be pretty proficient in taijutsu as well, but as a safety for good measure, had he grasped her wrist, he'd begin sending hisc hakra outwards, aiming to place a seal upon her arm which would cause her to lose control of the limb.* - Tue Sep 29 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) simply sighed as he moved to place his knee upon her back, his hand finding the back of her neck, as he aimed to apply another seal which would effectively rob her of her speech. Keeping his weight against her back he'd simply state:

"You'd make life a lot easier, if you didn't make me try to trick you." He stated lightly.* - Tue Sep 29 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) simply sighed this was definately problematic, but finally his hand moved down to her leg. Placing yet another seal upon it, sealing her usage of it before his hands found her pressure point on her neck, and procceeded to press down upon it hard.  Aiming to render them unconocious, but whether or not said actions succeeded, he didn't knowo, but after sealing her leg, he pulled out some metal wire in which he binded both her arms and legs.* - Tue Sep 29 22:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) simply sighed as his chakra flared and a wall of wind Materialized itself beside him, the moment he heard something come up from the water. The wind acting as an adequate shield from Kohaku's clone.,  he honestly didn't seem to be to alerted by the clone definately seeming to be second nature. And with a simple motion, a powerful chop was delivered to the base of Kohaku's neck aiming to render her unconcious which would also effectively deal with her clone.* - Tue Sep 29 22:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) simply sighed as he lifted the binded girl, gently hoisting her up into his arms, being awefully gentle. Though he didn't actually have any sexual interest in the woman, he slowly looked to Kirie "Let's move."* - Tue Sep 29 22:47:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Don't worry the wire is not tight enough to cut into her skin. - Tue Sep 29 23:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Go for it. - Tue Sep 29 23:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: What do you have planned? - Tue Sep 29 23:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) walks over to Kohaku, his light blue eyes focused on her person, as he extended a single hand to her cheek tapping lightly, before undoing the seal which contained her voice, since she could scream as much as she wanted in here. 

"I plan to harvest her DNA."* - Tue Sep 29 23:04:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) would slowly sigh as he placed a hand on Kohaku's chest, before suddenly her clothes were stripped from her and sealed away. Rendering her naked, if she was hazy, he'd help her get to focus. Walking over to the water, he slowly crouched, gathering a bucket of ice cold water, he splashed it onto her now nude body, aiming to shock her awake.

"Relax,  do what feels naturally to you.  I could help you relax with a small massage, but I'd like you permission before I touch you." He stated lightly, it was more of an offer to make her more comfortable with the situation at hand. He didn't seem to be getting extremely aroused, but then again, maybe he just had a high tolerance for sexual based things.

He felt it'd be more interesting with friends, so he called for Kirie, with a light sigh. His blush became a tad bit more pronounced with her moans, he probably couldn't hide a small bit of arousal. But that was just the beginning stages, he was a man afterall.  "Kirie, She seems bored."* - Wed Sep 30 00:45:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) simply sat beside Kohaku, as he moved to place a hand on her shoulder, it wasn't comforting, but that was his intention. But he watched lightly, he wished the tension wasn't so high in the room, it would've been better for both parties, but if she was going to finish of her own accord he wouldn't stop her.  But he would lean and use this to help himself in the long run.* - Wed Sep 30 01:07:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) (*Kohaku was trying to stay strong, not shaking or showing any fear of course..Or trying to show she was embarrassed, her eyes stayed shut as she moved two fingers inside of herself, letting out a small moan out of instinct of course..She was pretty much a virgin, so she couldn't help but moan. She wasn't as loose as kirie..

Kohaku would've continued on, she didn't really know what would happen at the end, since she's never really..Gotten to any point of pleasure like that..But she did have one thing on her mind. She'd have the single individual known as kenshin on her mind..She'd have to get stronger and faster for the next time she'd see him. She wouldn't die nor give up until she'd gotten yet another look of kenshin, and had shown him how strong she was...She wanted to see that look of amazement..

Her single goal at the moment was to simply have kenshin know she was going to succeed..Even if it meant doing such pitiful sexual acts in a dark cave...Even if it meant being shipped off to some foreign land to be a sex slave..She'd meet him again before she would pass, that was the single thing she knew..Her hand began moving faster as she let out several more moans..She had to meet kenshin again..One last time..She couldn't get him off of her mind, she just..She -had- to please him...

And of course, with that..She'd open her eyes a bit widely as the fourteen year old female let out a moan, hitting her climax rather easily, before nearly falling back..But she wasn't as weak as women like kirie, no..She stayed in her position..She would never fall.*)
