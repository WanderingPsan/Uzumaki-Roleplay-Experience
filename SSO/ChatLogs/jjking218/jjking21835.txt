But slowly he spoke "I'm going to start then~." He stated, his hands gently moving to take hold of her right foot, gently raising her leg until it was extended, he'd plant a kiss on the inner side of her leg, he planted a kiss atop of her foot. It seemed he didn't mind since it was Lera, and he was trying to set a mood.

But slowly he'd move his thumbs to the sole of her foot, with gentle motions, his thumbs would apply a bit of pressure, attempting to help with relieving some tension there.* - Sat Oct  3 14:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) was taking his time, his motions pushed against the sole of her foot, before slowly his hands moved down, this time working on her heel. Taking his time and being careful with his motions, he aimed to woprk out the stress, every so often stopping to give the leg or top of her foot a kiss, aiming to remind her that she was his Princess, or Queen. He enjoyelping her relax in such ways, and was happy she was enjoying herself.* - Sat Oct  3 15:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) smiled warmly as she spoke, he was happy she was enjoying herself, and slowly as he finished with that foot.

"I have to, I know how you enjoy it~"He stated lightly.* - Sat Oct  3 15:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) after a momwnr or so, he found himself complete, as he looked up to Lera, laughing lightly at her words. "If I didn't, I'd dissapoint.~" He stated jokingly, rising from his kneeling position.* - Sat Oct  3 15:13:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) felt Lera's arms wrap around his back, he blinked as he realised she was so light...He actually didn't believe that one could be so light as he spoke "Maybe...I should get you some food when we get back?" He was overthinking it, and most times, the easiest answer was the correct one, but he had never heard of a technique like that. But regardless as he headed out of their house, his hands were raised to chest level.

He weaved a series of handseals, before his palm was pressed to the ground a large seal spiraling outwards, before a large dragon was summoned beneath them. He simply wanted a reason to carry Lera, he didn't actually have a way to get to Sunagakure fast by foot. But Dragon was the fastest method he knew.* - Sat Oct  3 16:34:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) simply nods and finds himself a glass of water, before he moved to take a seat on the couch beside her, not caring much for personal space.  "I plan to do things, But are you really as obedient as you say? Do you really desire to be given orders?" He asked looking towards her as he took a sip of his water.* - Sat Oct  3 17:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) undoes the wraps on his eyes, looking at her through his left eye as he spoke "Then, Let's see if you will really follow orders. Katsune, Open your mouth and stick out your tongue." He stated,this was a pretty harmless order from his position, he wasn't sure if he wanted to be in control but if she would follow his orders it may make for an interesting parthnership. "If we're to do anything, I need to be certain you can follow my orders exactly as I say them, without hesitation."* - Sat Oct  3 17:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked at her eyes, but as such nothing happened, he simply watched and waited. "It was a test, I was curious as to how obedient you are. I care not if you try to manipulate me."* - Sat Oct  3 17:55:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) doesn't attempt to harm her in anyway, but his hand is extended, attempting to  sandwhich her tongue between his index and Thumb fingers, while placing his thumb flat on her tongue. As he spoke "I'm a man that grows bored quickly, so I'd like to add some tules to when I ask you to meet here." He stated, looking for her to nod her head. Since she probably couldn't speak.* - Sat Oct  3 18:07:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) smiled warmly as he spoke "And I gain nothing by killing you, But if we have a mutual agreement I have much to gain from keeping you alive." He stated lightly, attempting to rest his extended arm behind Katsune.

"Trust me for once."* - Sat Oct  3 18:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) would smile lightly, as his hand was extended to her tongue and he simply, attempted to repeat the process of placing his hand upon it,he'd look into her eyes and a faint amount of chakra formed on the tip of his thumb. His chakra finding the roof of her mouth and a small seal making it's way home. As he spoke "Do you trust me now? No pain."His hand was retracted from her tongue and her saliva was wiped on the top of his pants before his arm found itself behind her once again.* - Sat Oct  3 18:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) simply smiled warmly, as he relaxes, "So Katsune,I was thinking. You're the only one who knows about this room, besides me. You can use it as you please."* - Sat Oct  3 18:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) wasn't sure but he decided to make a point as he spoke "I put a seal at the roof of your mouth, It'll prevent you from speaking about what occurs in this room. But, I'll remove it if you like, but I'd like to have you agree to something first."* - Sat Oct  3 18:42:08 2015
