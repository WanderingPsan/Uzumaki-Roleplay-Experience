<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Smoke, or poison bombs... The numerous traps that all line the village, which I'm sure that people of their level can avoid but it slow them down. And, ninjutsu users will be great in being able to give sweeping attacks that won't need direct line of fire. - Sun Sep 13 10:37:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) nodded his head as he listened to Tethys' words, taking a deep breath as he cracked his knuckles. With a subtle yawn he knew this would be fairly interesting to learn, so he'd try his best, he took a deep breath and yawned to himself, raising his hands to chest level he proceeded to crack his knuckles, before he took a deep breath, the Prince himself was definately fairly advanced when it came to learning. He smiled gently, as his hand was extended outwards.

Chakra began gathering along the center of his hands, he took his time gathering a large amount on his palms, which seemed to swirl around in a euphoric manner, it was calm and concentrated. Recalling what he had seen Tethys do but moments before, he smiled to himself, taking a deep breath, as his chakra was expelled from his hand, gathering into that of a vortex, which surprisingly he had managed to get down fairly easy.

The Vortex began to expand, before beginning to spin at an accelerated pace, causing wind to spiral inwards, almost aiming to suck a target in, he took his time, and focused, definately aiming to keep his mind level headed. He didn't say much, but his chakra was gathering fairly fast, causing the vortex to expand, but it wasn't as big as Tethys' was it probably never would be. He didn't intend to be a Ninjutsu specialist.

But he knew that learning it would be ideal for his survival he couldn't rely on his summonings for the entirety of his life, he wanted to have a wide arsenal so he'd have to learn a little bit from all over as he looked to Tethys he simply stated "I'd like to learn about Medicine next...If at all possible." He stated lightly, he seemed to have calmed down greatly and wasn't as arrogant as he was before.* - Sun Sep 13 19:54:27 2015
