<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) thinks: Just go already. - Sun Sep 13 21:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) simply yawned while everyone was out playing, he'd be able to ideally begin working on learning the Jutsu he had been given he figured that'd be the best thing to do in this period of time. He cracked his knuckles and sighed, reaching for the first of his two scrolls labled Chakra Flow. He figured this would at the very least assist him with his training, he already knew his Chakra Flow wouldn't be potent at all but at least it could be a surprise in a battle.

He took a deep breath and sighed, he understood chakra flow was the gathering of the flow of chakra and coursing it through an object. Extending his hand he gathered his chakra upon his palm, and allowed it to simply dance upon his palm, creating a minature Vortex, which was immediately cut off as he closed his hand, immediately he switched to his seals, before repeating the process.

He found this exceedingly interesting, a jutsu such as this would have many applications, which would be amazing when used in an actual battle. Even so, it had outside applications, which could make living a bit easier, which he somewhat appreciated as well, cracking his knuckles he took a deep breath, focusing upon the scroll before him he continued to go over what he was reading.

He was making progress...At least a bit He hadn't quite grasped the concept nor understanding of this jutsu and thus he found it a bit troubling, but he figured  he'd be able to work with it eventually. He had the time and the knowledge to work on it, he considered himself gifted, which was most likely troubling to others because he may sound arrogant to others...Which he completely is, but even so.

He continued reading while he sat there, carefully and gently unraveling the scroll as he continued to read, he found this process exceedingly interesting, and thus he took his time, he liked that it was a sealless technique meaning it wouldn't require him to take the time for seals, but he also knew such a technique would come with draw backs, which he hoped he'd be able to overcome.

He wondered if they'd be able to successfully win this war, he figured they probably would be able to do so, but he decided to help them out, at least after he managed to read a bit more into his Scrolls, he figured they'd survive long enough, he laughed a bit to himself, they were Shinobi they should be able to dance long enough for him to learn these techniques.

So he cracked his knuckles, finally deciding he was ready to begin practicing with an actual weapon, he reached for a small knife, and began gathering his chakra into the blade, causing a minor surge of electricity, which immediately dissipated, but at least it was a start, right? He took a deep breath closing his eyes, as he began to channel his chakra through the blade aiming to increase the potency of the electricity.



* - Sun Sep 13 22:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) had decided to move onto the next scroll in his arsenal, deciding to learn the fireball technique, he once again wondered how he should go about learning this technique, he wondered how it'd suit his arsenal. He wondered if it had outside uses, or possibly the potential to be of great use to an ally as a support skill. But regardless there were numerous Questions, with answers he'd have to discover in the outside world, but he didn't mind that challenge.

As he read his free hand continued gently gathering his chakra as if aiming to cast one of his jutsu, but of course he stopped it before it actually conjured any actual techniques. Cracking his knuckles he simply sighed, deciding he should probably send out a Dragon to scout out what was occuring in the war, so he could directly retaliate. He figured Kirigakure could use a push.

He smiled warmly, maybe he was a better man than he let on, but personally he wasn't all to sure. Maybe he was an evil person, but then again, he didn't believe in the concepts of good and evil, there was simply Human beings,  and he'd allow that concept to live on, Every man had the potential for great good or Evil, but that didn't allow them to be judged.

He respected those who lived fulfilled lives, and as such he wouldn't judge them unless they forced judged him. He was that type of person afterall, he respected Humans, Iselians, they were special, he could never doubt them, not hate them. Even in their most basic form, they were unpredectable...Yet...Extremely predictable, it excited him so. He was apart of this race afterall.

He was given a better start than those before him, but after that 'start', he left a window for others to catch up and surpass him. His genes surely...Were great in assisting his progression, that was perhaps one advantage he wouldn't easily be caught up to in, but even so, he was flawed, as any Human was, he had his flaws.  But he had great strengths,  such as learning, his genes, his abilities, which were unique.

These strengths placed him above those of his peers, but in hindsight was he really any better than his peers? He wasn't sure not at all, he was the same in every way shape or form, he was broken, and at the same time his pieces fit together like a manufactured puzzle, he would be more than Human he desired it greatly, it was his stregnth, but once again his weakness, his desire to aspire for more would be his undoing.

So finally as he stood up, his hands were raised to chest level  beginning to weave a series of handseals, two fingers were raised to the side of his mouth as he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, as a ball of flames was released from his lips gathering into that of a  ball, which soared into the sky before dispersing.* - Sun Sep 13 22:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a deep breath as he cracked his knuckles, his hands raised to chest level as they began to move together in a series of handseals before his hand was raised to his mouth, biting his thumb he drew a bit of blood before slamming it down to the ground. A small seal appeared, and a tiny White dragon appeared before Seisuke "Hey little guy, I need you to do me a favor...And survey the battle field from far above..Tell me anything you see. And stay safe and out of sight." He stated.

Gently patting the dragon atop of the head as it flew off.* - Sun Sep 13 22:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) 's dragon didn't return and thus he felt...A strong....Deep annoyance in his body, anger unmatched as the young boy. Raised his hands to chest level. Gathering his chakra, as he began to weave a series of handseals. His chakra seemingly flared, as his thumb was bought to his mouth, biting down upon it he drew blood before his hand, was slammed against the ground. Immediately ane extremely large seal appeared beneath him, and a truly massive Blue dragon appeared, with a blood curdling roar. It spread it's wings, having a truly massive Wingspan.

The Dragon immediately took flight, and began to flap it's wings, soaring towards Amegakure forces immediately, appearing above them in the sky, it flapped it's mighty wings, aiming to create a strong gale wind, that aimed to knock the Shinobi off balance, before opening it's mouth, and sending Icy Shards towards the Shinobi who were without a doubt simply stunned, at the sudden appearance of a Mythical Creature of such magnitude. Of course it paid heed to the other summoning in the air.* - Sun Sep 13 23:08:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: So uh...whats this other mission Tethys-sama? - Mon Sep 14 10:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: I guess I will continue on with the rest of my training - Mon Sep 14 10:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Tethys. - Mon Sep 14 10:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: Who is that.. is he a prisoner? - Mon Sep 14 10:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) simply sighed as he noticed the prisoner, he didn't know who this man was but he'd have to be some sort of political prisoner, he slowly walked over, placing a hand on his shoulder, probably where the chains were seperated, he'd look towards the Anbu, and nod his head, As chakra was sent from his palm, laying a seal upon the man's shoulder in a moment, probably unoticed, as he simply stated:

"I'll be sure to get you where you're going." 

The seal was simply a precaution, incase something unexpected happened, such as the use of chakra, which would act as a trigger for the seal and allow it's effects to begin going. He whistled lightly, and immediately three of his own guards appeared, aiming to grab the male's chains, and hoist him up, before they began leading him away with Seisuke not fare behind.* - Mon Sep 14 10:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took his time, and didn't actually care about Jatsu's words but he figured entertaining himself would be...Interesting so he spoke "I would, honestly, I don't care much for Shinobi at all, Nor their affairs." He stated lightly, as he continued walking cracking his knuckles, he wanted to simply have some fun afterall,but this mission seeemed to be fairly clear-cut, which he hoped was a wrong assumption. But regardless he continued walking forward, behind the Prisoner, with One guard in front of the prisoner and two to either side.

The Prince walked several paces behind the prisoner, and oddly enough the male held no weapons at all, he didn't have a noticable need for them, not yet, he figured he'd have to continue with his mission, if he wanted to receive due payment, he had to, without a doubt complete this.* - Mon Sep 14 10:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked to the Prisoner, and he tilted his head to the side, motioning for the guards to go take him to get a drink. And as such he was led inside, with Seisuke trailing behind a few steps as he yawned to himself. This was going to be a boring Mission, at least that's what he assumed he had never transported Prisoners and he was being reassured why that was so. He didn't like prisoners at all, and the only reason he was putting up with this was so he could ultimately get what he wanted to in the end.

He cracked his knuckles and sighed, the prisoner was led to a Bathroom, and a bowl of water was raised to his lips by one of the guards, allowing him to get his drink if needed.* - Mon Sep 14 11:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) watched as the Prisoner spit out the water, and immediately went wide-eyed as his guards began to drop paralyzed by that of the Lightning infused water. The prince, immediately got into a defensive stance of sorts, his hands raised to his chest, as he stood in a tight stance. Before immediately he lunged forward, towards Jatsu, extending two fingers, in a curled fashion, he shot his hand forward. And aimed to lunge at Jatsu's juggular. Aiming to momentarily stun the male.

He knew his seal had most likely already taken effect, and as such Jatsu's life span was limited, unless he limited the seal and kept it so he could live at a suitable level while his chakra was locked in place. But then again that was if he survived anyway.* - Mon Sep 14 11:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) raised his hand after it connected with Jatsu's throat, and immediately a small gathering of chakra was gathered in the center of his palm. Before expanding outwards, as he launched it forth at Jatsu, immediately his chakra would expand into that of a small vortex which Seisuke had purpsefully lessoned the chakra flow, in an attempt to have Jatsu caught up in it before being thrown against the wall. He lessened the flow so it wouldn't maintain itself for a long period of time, but had enough force in a single direction to throw someone.

At least that was his intention, he was definately at a disadvantage, he couldn't use his dragons in such a small and confined place, so he had to work around it somehow, as he took a deep breath. This would definately be problematic, but his obvious intention here was to use attacks which would stun his opponent and leave him open for a follow up. at the same token his chakra would be drained at a rapid pace.* - Mon Sep 14 11:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked at Jatsu, his eyes were focused, and oddly he seemed almost inhumane,  he approached Jatsu, as he kept out of Arms reach, allowing the seal to drain a bit more as he simply stated " Hands behind your head." He stated, reaching for a flask of water, which he splashed Jatsu with it's contents, which would ensure that if he used lightning jutsu he'd definately shock himself. He took a deep breath, and sighed, waiting for the man to adhere to his demands. He cracked his knuckles subtly, before focusing on what was occuring.

Jatsu would've been an interesting Ally, something he wish that Jatsu was on his side rather than foolish criminal acts. But even so there was nothing he could do so he'd just go with the flow, and believe in Humanity, which he really didn't at all.* - Mon Sep 14 12:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) would slowly walk behind  Jatsu, he was very limted to what he could actually do, so he got metal wire, and began tying it around  Jatsu's wrists, before looping it against his palms. Which gave insight to Seisuke's knowledge on basic facts, in fact this made him look awefully cruel, because the intention was obvious, if he used Lightning jutsu, it'd increase the heat of the metal, and cause it to burn into his flesh, He didn't want to deal with this man anymore.

"I'm sure you'll enjoy this but you're only going to be given Alcohol as drinks."

He stated, obviously aiming to make him suffer some sort of, physical affliction if he tried such tactics again, after he was done, he hoisted the male up by the strings and continued on their journey.* - Mon Sep 14 12:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whistled he didn't die on his watch afterall, so he was gucci, and returned back to Kirigakure.* - Mon Sep 14 12:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hm... - Mon Sep 14 12:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Sergeant Muhhamed? - Mon Sep 14 12:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) approached Lera, he seemed unscathe after just tackling a High ranking Mission, he approached her with a flask of water which he offered to her, crouching beside her he spoke "Having fun?" He asked, only having caught the final pieces of her training, he offered a gentle smile. Looking genuinely kind in appearance.* - Mon Sep 14 12:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked at her, as she spoke he offered a gentle laugh as he spoke "I see, Well you should eat after training so hard, or you won't feel to hot when you wake up." He stated lightly, offering her a hand, to help her up "My treat."* - Mon Sep 14 12:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: .... - Mon Sep 14 12:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I eat like a horse. - Mon Sep 14 12:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Can you afford that? - Mon Sep 14 12:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: And I'm a prince. - Mon Sep 14 12:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Touche. - Mon Sep 14 12:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure. - Mon Sep 14 12:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) smiled warmly, as she was on her feet, before he turned arcing his elbow inwards, as he offered her his arm, for 'stability' I assure you he wasn't trying to be slick. As he spoke "What type of food do you prefer? Barbeque? Oriental?"* - Mon Sep 14 12:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Quite the charmer though. Aren't you? - Mon Sep 14 12:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) smiled a bit as she spoke to him, offering a gentle laugh as he began to walk speaking "I wouldn't say I'm a charmer, But I try to mind my manners. This is quite common where I come from." He stated lightly, as he led her to a restaurant, definately on the 'higher end', of food chains.* - Mon Sep 14 12:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Huh. I used to come here with my mama. - Mon Sep 14 12:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Ah, Really? - Mon Sep 14 12:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah, you're not the only one with money you know. - Mon Sep 14 12:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But well... - Mon Sep 14 12:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: If its really your treat... - Mon Sep 14 12:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Are you sure you won't regret this? - Mon Sep 14 12:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I won't. - Mon Sep 14 12:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehe. - Mon Sep 14 12:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We'll see~ - Mon Sep 14 12:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) thinks: Suddenly...I feel scared. - Mon Sep 14 12:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) blinked she surely had far surpassed his expectations on what he thought was humanly possible. He coughed a bit nervously, but she hadn't surpassed his budget, and that was also great. He laughed a bit nervously " M-Mm..Certainly not...Eat your fill.~" He was genuinely surprised she ate that much, but then again, she was a shinobi so she had to eat a lot to keep up her energy or that's what he told himself. But even so! He'd accept a challenge, although he didn't quite eat...Nearly as much as that.

For himself he simply ordered a plate of Sushi, and that'd probably be the extent of his appetite along with a glass of water.* - Mon Sep 14 13:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) thinks: This is going to...Put a serious dent in my wallet... - Mon Sep 14 13:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) thinks: But I can't back out now. - Mon Sep 14 13:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) blinked a bit surprised at her sudden outburst of laughter, before she spoke. He released a giant sigh of relief, adding to her laughter a bit "Wow you had me nervous for a second." He admitted, as he relaxed in his seat as he decided to shoot into the darkness "Do you still come here with your Mother?" He asked lightly, looking at her. * - Mon Sep 14 13:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked at her as he studied her facial experession, as he took a sip of his glass of water, following her gaze. As he simply stated "I'm sorry...I shouldn't have asked about a potentially sore subject..." He stated looking at her as he spoke "Y-You should try their steak, I h-heard it's the best in Kirigakure!" He stated, clearly attempting to change the subject, to get her mind off a sad topic.* - Mon Sep 14 13:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) felt her arm, around his shoulders, followed by the small squeeze as he stared at the table. "I'm still Sorry." He paused aiming to put on a gently smile as he spoke "At times like this I should probably say "I'm your family too.", But that'd be a bit weird considering I just met you wouldn't it?" He stated, with a gentle laugh as he stated. "I may not be blood, but I'll be here if you need anything, Lera." He felt a need to put that line in there, but it seemed like it came from the heart. And afterwards, to lighten up the mood, he dawned a giant smile.

"So Sergeant Hassan, Is he a cool guy?"* - Mon Sep 14 13:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) meant what he said, if she was able to detect that it was true. Part of it was because of his backstory, he considered most people apart of some family of his own, it was apart of being a prince--A good one, he considered his people extensions of his own family--But that was a story for another day. "He sounds like a great guy, And it seems like he's done a pretty good job. Honestly, I should probably talk to him."* - Mon Sep 14 13:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) blinked as he felt his hand grasped by Lera, a faint pinkening of his alabaster cheeks. But he was quick to regain composure, his hand slowly held onto hers gently. As he spoke "I just give them as I see them~" He spoke lightly before continuing."He may be my only ticket....To accomplishing what I need to do....But I'm not sure, if It's right for me to ask something of someone I've just met." He stated lightly,  with a slight sigh, his free hand, was moved to to gently usher a strand of hair out of his face as he wondered to himself "I know most Sergeants have their quirks, But how strange could he be?"* - Mon Sep 14 13:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) smiled a bit warmly, as he looked down to her, staring into her eyes through the strands of hair as he spoke "What every prince tries to do, I want to become the King my people deserve.  So I have to become a Sergeant...I just lack the strength to do so." He stated lightly. Part of him wondered why their food was taking so long to arrive, but it was fine,  he cherished these little moments. "I look up to people like Muhhamed. They risked their lives...In that exam for the lives of their people, and I respect those who live such lives."* - Mon Sep 14 13:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see, so you want him to train you? - Mon Sep 14 13:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Yeah...But I'm not sure if it's my place to ask. - Mon Sep 14 13:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *shrug* Well, in the end its his choice right? - Mon Sep 14 13:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Definately is. - Mon Sep 14 13:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But well...He said he wasn't going to take anymore students after me. - Mon Sep 14 13:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Good luck though - Mon Sep 14 13:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It's fine, I respect his decisions, I'll just have to find another way then. - Mon Sep 14 13:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: But what about you? - Mon Sep 14 13:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: What are your goals? - Mon Sep 14 13:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Me...? - Mon Sep 14 13:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Yeah. - Mon Sep 14 13:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm... - Mon Sep 14 13:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Good question. - Mon Sep 14 13:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I've never really thought about it...except to get stronger and make friends. - Mon Sep 14 13:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I see - Mon Sep 14 13:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I spent so long without friends...I guess I just wanted to be noticed. - Mon Sep 14 13:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It's hard to miss you. - Mon Sep 14 13:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I...Hehehe~ Thankyou. - Mon Sep 14 13:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: That means more to me than you realise. - Mon Sep 14 13:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It's the truth, And I'll be rooting for you to accomplish your goals. - Mon Sep 14 13:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thank you and I hope you can become a good king. - Mon Sep 14 13:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I hope so too. - Mon Sep 14 13:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Believing is the first step. - Mon Sep 14 13:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I think you will, you can do it. - Mon Sep 14 13:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'll try my best to meet those expecatations then, Haha. - Mon Sep 14 13:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) would gently squeeze on her hand, as he spoke "This day, actually wasn't that bad." He stated, out of the blue. As he looked towards her gently before his gaze was averted to the side slightly. His light blue eyes for a moment scanned the table beside them, before looking out over the expansive blue sea from where they sat. "This village, is beautiful...Isn't it?"* - Mon Sep 14 13:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked towards her as she rested her head on his shoulder. A relaxed and warm smile graced his face, although subtle, he was happy in this moment, "That's a Nobel goal...One I can stand behind." He stated lightly, as he closed his eyes, at this point, the time he spent waiting on his food was alright, he'd survive without food for a while longer, he had gained something which overpowered his hunger. He felt like he gained someone he could trust.* - Mon Sep 14 13:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) as he sat with his eyes closed embracing subtle peace, which was broken as he felt something soft, against his cheek. And his eyes fluttered open, seeing Lera pull back. He realised what had just occured, and his eyes flashed open out of surprised, his face immediately was flushed with embarrassment developing his own blush, as he looked away after hearing her words. His heart was racing,  he was baffled, unknowing of how to respond to such an action.

"I-I....T-....T-Thanks..." He was truly perplexed, never had he been so flustered before.

Oddly the sensation felt...Almost Human, he was experiencing a sudden influx of foreign emotions...He just fell into silence, not wanting to say the wrong thing. He was happy...That's what he felt...Happiness.* - Mon Sep 14 14:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Mon Sep 14 14:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) much appreicated the distraction, it took his mind away from the emotions he couldn't comprehend. He took his time, eating his food, slowly but with just as much ettiquette, enjoying and savoring the taste of his sushi. Taking occasional sips of his water to wash down what he had just eatten...But he decided to try...And break the silence. "H-How is your food?" He asked shyly.* - Mon Sep 14 14:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) thinks: Why...Am I stuttering..? - Mon Sep 14 14:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) thinks: Why am I...So flustered? - Mon Sep 14 14:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked up from his food to meet her gaze, before it was shifted to the side "I-It's no problem...I'm glad you like i-it." He stated shaking his head subtly in an attempt to clear his thoughts, he struggled to regain his composure. Taking a deep breath before exhaling as he focused his mind.* - Mon Sep 14 14:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Am I...making you nervous...? - Mon Sep 14 14:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Y---No... - Mon Sep 14 14:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehe...Its a little odd. - Mon Sep 14 14:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: My heart...its going crazy. Yet I feel really calm. - Mon Sep 14 14:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Strange huh. - Mon Sep 14 14:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Y-Yeah.... - Mon Sep 14 14:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: My heart is.....beating....So fast...It feels like It'll jump out of my chest.... - Mon Sep 14 14:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm glad I'm not the only one. - Mon Sep 14 14:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It's o-oddly comforting... - Mon Sep 14 14:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You...you're really nice. - Mon Sep 14 14:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Why does everyone...say those things about you? Before...they said you were saying bad things. - Mon Sep 14 14:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'm not sure. - Mon Sep 14 14:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Although...I'm used to being disliked...It comes with the job. - Mon Sep 14 14:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see... - Mon Sep 14 14:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well...maybe you should show them your nice? - Mon Sep 14 14:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I tried, and they insulted my family, my goal, my people. - Mon Sep 14 14:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I...don't really know much about the Gezo...heck I don't really know anything. - Mon Sep 14 14:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But...instead of lashing out. - Mon Sep 14 14:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Maybe you should just explain your ideals. - Mon Sep 14 14:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'll....try. - Mon Sep 14 14:42:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I know... - Mon Sep 14 14:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) felt her head resting on his shoulder once again, as he asked "Does it matter....Prince or not? Genin...Prince...They're all titles. Only thing that should matter is what...we think.." He stated lightly, this time he'd move to gently grab ahold of her hand if she allowed him to that is.* - Mon Sep 14 14:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) would slowly look towards her as he spoke, "If you're okay with it....So am I." He stated, holding her hand lightly within his own, as he stared out over the sea before him.  He had never thought of such a thing, but he couldn't believe it was wrong, he couldn't, he was always told to do what made him happy.* - Mon Sep 14 14:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm okay with it...more than okay with it. - Mon Sep 14 14:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: R-Really? - Mon Sep 14 14:56:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) would attempt to try something releasing her hand he'd slowly aim to put his left arm around her shoulders as she rested against him. "Don't...Sell yourself short."* - Mon Sep 14 15:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) felt her arms move around his waist and smiled lightly, holding her gently. "I see,  and...I'm proud to be here with you in this moment.." He stated lightly, attempting to rest his head gently atop of her own.* - Mon Sep 14 15:12:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) nodded his head subtly as he looked towards Niza, examining his technique in all his glory, he found it interesting and nodded his head he found Niza's techniques interesting because they weren't reliant on strength, which suited his needs although strength would be a nice addition to his build, he cracked his knuckles, and decided to take point. Entering his stance, he inhaled followed by a deep exhale.

His eyes opened as he focused taking a deep breath as he inhaled followed by an exhale as his hand was raised, and he focused on the problem at hand, it seemed pretty simply in hindsight and as such it would be ideal to use in an actual battle, what he needed to work on was his speed of attack, he was kind of sluggish currently. As he decided to attempt the technique, his hand shot upwards.

The palm aimed at the chin of his target, before he lowered his hand back down, taking a deep breath he inhaled followed by a deep exhale as he once again repeated this stance, getting into the positioning needed for the move, before he thrusted his palm up towards the imaginary chin of his target, and then proceeded to lower his hand as he simply stated:

"I think I got it."* - Mon Sep 14 16:39:28 2015
