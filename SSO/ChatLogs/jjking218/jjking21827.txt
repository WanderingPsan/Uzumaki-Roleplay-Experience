<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) raises his hands "Yes, Yes." He stated, as he began to move to the door, he was debating what kind of drinks he could have today, but he wasn't quite sure, either way he headed towards the  bar he had gotten a pretty good grasp of Konoha's geography.* - Sat Sep 26 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm. - Sat Sep 26 01:10:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) acknowledges her glance for a moment, but then proceeds to seal away all his weapon as he looked around offering a warm smile. "So M'lady, What drink is on the menu for today?" He wasn't a heavy drinker, that much was obvious, he also didn't seem to have an expansive knowledge of drinks.* - Sat Sep 26 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll take whatever as long as you're willing to taste it yourself first. - Sat Sep 26 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll take whatever as long as you're willing to taste it first. - Sat Sep 26 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) nodded his head "I see you don't trust me much, So of course, I'll taste it first." He stated lightly, as he decided to order a bottle of light wine. As he spoke "So, I was thinking. After the first time or two, this would be very boring, How about I make this more interesting?" He suggested, as the waitress bought over two glasses, and a closed bottle, before vacating the immediate premesis. Along with any other guests in the room.* - Sat Sep 26 01:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) thought about it for a moment as he spoke "Each Tuesday, We'll play a game. Where your prize will be Two Hundred and Fifty more soldiers if you win. The game will change each weak, and will become progressively harder. At the same token, as a boundary the game will have to take place within the confines of this place, and can't inflict bodily harm to either participants, There can also be no outside intervention. You always will have the right to drop out as well."* - Sat Sep 26 01:21:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: We'll play three Games, If you win Two out of the Three, I'll supply you with Two Hundred and Fifty Soldiers. - Sat Sep 26 01:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I dunno that I should get drunk without a guard handy. Maybe if you found me before Erebus lost his mind and started ranting at you about destroying the shinobi world. - Sat Sep 26 01:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hm. - Sat Sep 26 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Then how about this. - Sat Sep 26 01:24:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Therefore it isn't in my interest to hurt you. - Sat Sep 26 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: How would it be bad for you if I got hurt? - Sat Sep 26 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Like I said. - Sat Sep 26 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I like to think of this world as a game. - Sat Sep 26 01:24:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It 'is' true that killing me would be pointless. You realized that when Erebus sent you that scroll. - Sat Sep 26 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: If I lose a Queen, I've lost an irreplaceable piece. - Sat Sep 26 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Honestly? - Sat Sep 26 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I care not for what was in the scroll. - Sat Sep 26 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: There is only one thing that would make me kill you. - Sat Sep 26 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And that is? - Sat Sep 26 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: If you overstep a boundary. - Sat Sep 26 01:25:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: But when you begin feeling entitled. - Sat Sep 26 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You are no longer fun. - Sat Sep 26 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: So as long as you treat this as what it is. - Sat Sep 26 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: A game. - Sat Sep 26 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You're fine. - Sat Sep 26 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) takes a sip of his glass of wine after pouring himself a glass as he spoke:

"Well then, Do we have a deal?"

He smiled, that masked smile, that disguise he wore upon his face, that made it seem like he couldn't be targeted emotionally---His mask was his greatest Strength, but also his greatest weakness.* - Sat Sep 26 01:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I've never won a game of this type. - Sat Sep 26 01:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not one single time. - Sat Sep 26 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I play them very often too. - Sat Sep 26 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It usually ends with me poor or embarassed. - Sat Sep 26 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You embarrassed? - Sat Sep 26 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Isn't that a sight I'd like to see, But at the same token, I don't enjoy the bad embarrassment. - Sat Sep 26 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not a robot. I hide my thoughts from strangers as part of my duty as hokage. - Sat Sep 26 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: May I call you Katsune? - Sat Sep 26 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yes. - Sat Sep 26 01:31:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What rule? - Sat Sep 26 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: If at any point, you feel to embarrassed throughout any part of the game, I will allow you to reject the turn at no penalty---Afterall, A game in which one is made uncomfortable in a bad way. Isn't much fun at all...Is it? - Sat Sep 26 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: At the same token, I will not exercise this rule for myself. - Sat Sep 26 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Sat Sep 26 01:34:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) extends his hand to Katsune with a gentle smile "Then let's have some fun." He stated with a light hearted laugh.* - Sat Sep 26 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) retracts his hand after a moment, after confirming one of his beliefs as he stated  "Then...Why not play rock Paper Scissors, It's a bit light hearted isn't it?" He paused for a bit, only to fill up his own glass, before offering to do the same for Katsune--Taking his time to show her his hands had no hidden substances on them. But he'd even let her do it herself if she desired.* - Sat Sep 26 01:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) nods his head as he spoke "Of course Katsune-himesama~" He joked lightly, pouring her glass slowly, before he sat the bottle upon the table as he spoke. "The rules are simple, You lose? You drink. Win two out of the three Matches, I'll buy you Two Hundred and Fifty Soldiers, You lose...Hm...I'll have you do something. Maybe, I'll have you run a lap around the building. Haven't decided." He nodded his head lightly.* - Sat Sep 26 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It 'is' weird playing this sort of game with a stranger. - Sat Sep 26 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: During my time with Kenryoku I played with friends. - Sat Sep 26 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: A stranger is only a stranger until you get to know them. - Sat Sep 26 01:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: And I do recall you calling me a friend. - Sat Sep 26 01:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You did say to not tell anyone that we met. - Sat Sep 26 01:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That was for them -- I wasn't lying to you. Only doing what you asked me to. - Sat Sep 26 01:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I appreciate it then. - Sat Sep 26 01:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: We can do without the drinks then. - Sat Sep 26 01:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Like you said. It's no fun if I'm entitled. - Sat Sep 26 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) smiled warmly as he spoke "That I did, So let's have fun." He said raising a flat palm up, and placing a closed fist atop of it. "Best of luck."* - Sat Sep 26 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Well then, Let the first round begin? - Sat Sep 26 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) simply smiled, as he spoke "Rock...Paper, Scissors...Shoot." In unison with each word, his closed fist gently tapped against his open palm, his eyes stayed focus on his opponents movements, before at the final second, he decided to throw out his own symbol, he figured this woud be interesting none-the-less, It was a basic game, but when you add such a....Curious twist to it, Who knows how stressfull this game would end up?* - Sat Sep 26 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) couldn't help but frown in his own right "Hm A Tie? That's peculiar." He commented, before he asked "You worked with Zetsumo?" He asked, still not breaking eye contact at least not after frowning for a bit, before he got back into the ready position. He probably should've said this earlier but "In the case of a tie, the round is void, Sound good?"* - Sat Sep 26 01:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yes, and yes. - Sat Sep 26 01:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I worked 'for' Zetsumo. Not with him. - Sat Sep 26 01:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was a slave. - Sat Sep 26 01:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hm. - Sat Sep 26 01:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I see. - Sat Sep 26 01:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Planned on escaping but. . . - Sat Sep 26 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He interrogated us every week and I was indecisive. I knew that if I thought too much about it.... - Sat Sep 26 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Fair enough. - Sat Sep 26 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd have to say no to loyalty when the genjutsu check came around. - Sat Sep 26 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That jutsu was too strong for me. - Sat Sep 26 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I see. - Sat Sep 26 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I applaud you though. - Sat Sep 26 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: For....? - Sat Sep 26 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) does the chant along with the hand shakes, as he prepares to chuck up his next sign. 

"You made it out of slavery without being broken down to a shell of a person, It's commendable."* - Sat Sep 26 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sat Sep 26 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: It's funny. My name means victory but I never win. - Sat Sep 26 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) smiles a bit  "Seems your luck has turned up some, No?" He spoke gently, as he spoke "I guess it's my drink?" He stated reaching for his glass, he raised the cold cup to his lips, before tilting it back taking a large gulp of the amber liquid before he set his glass down, shaking his head subtly as the liquor rolled down his throat. "Well then...Shall we continue?"* - Sat Sep 26 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mm.... - Sat Sep 26 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sure. . . - Sat Sep 26 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) definately did swallow he was a man of his word! But slowly he raised his hand to the ready position once again, before preparing his chant, and throwing out his next sign.* - Sat Sep 26 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) smiles briefly as he saw the results of this round "Now isn't this exciting~ Drink up." He stated smiling lightly, as he stared forward at her offering a light chuckle.* - Sat Sep 26 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) simply waits until all of her suspicions were erased, there was nothing special in this drink, it wasn't spiked. And he simply, rested is chin on his open palm, staring at her as he waited for her to settle her mind, before he got into position as he spoke "This next round will decide who wins~ Best of luck." He stated lightly, waiting for her to ready up before chanting.* - Sat Sep 26 02:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) nods his head subtly as he begins to shake his hand deciding that if this game was to end now, he'd be fine with that, he didn't actually care who won. He just desired to have fun at the end of the day.* - Sat Sep 26 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Lost....as always. - Sat Sep 26 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked at her a bit, as he poured the glass slowly for her, before resting it on the table. As he spoke "As for my reward, I know what I want." He paused and left it there for Katsune to finish drinking before he continued, his eyes seemed to be all the more serious in this moment, focused. * - Sat Sep 26 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I simply want you to, Shake my hand. - Sat Sep 26 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmph. - Sat Sep 26 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: For the record. - Sat Sep 26 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I have a technique that can blow your hand off. - Sat Sep 26 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: With a handshake. - Sat Sep 26 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) smiled briefly as he spoke "That's fine, If you're going to do it, I don't mind."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) not sure if he would've been notified, But he lives with her so probably right? Regardless he'd enter the room a bit nervous and worried as to the current state of Lera, pushing open the door he'd ask "L-Lera?"* - Sat Sep 26 14:43:37 2015
