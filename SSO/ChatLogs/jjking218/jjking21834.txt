<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) as he held Hideki's wrist his grip was tight, but not aimed at harming him, especially not in his current state as he spoke "Hideki, within those eyes, are Ushinawa's memories, a timeline which had detailed and recorded his life span from start to finish, his pain, his suffering, his Joy. The memories he had of you, which I'm sure he's fond of. But in those eyes, Also store his Darkness, but his light. The story which has been recorded, can never be retold, those eyes, are the manifestation of his will. The form his soul has taken the form of. The world through Ushinawa's eyes. Have you imagined, how lonely it must've been for all those years? Having to cling on....To each spec of light which guided him." He paused, and for some reason.

He felt a clinging in his chest, his heart had skipped a beat...Was it remorse? He felt guilt and sorrow, but he finished it off "I'm sure Hideki, You were one of his brightest lights. Those bonds you've shared, can never be replicated, but you can ensure that his will lives on. His legacy will continue, but if you destroy them, here and now. You snuff out, what was left of Ushinawa...And then, and only then will he be dead. And you would be the one who killed him."

He looked at Hideki's eyes, his voice was sorrowful, but he stated what he thought. He didn't hold back, the truth would hurt, but Hideki was strong.* - Thu Oct  1 23:30:33 2015

It was hard to believe Ushinawa had died, in such a way. But he knew his goal perhaps all to well.* - Thu Oct  1 23:37:23 2015

So he took a deep breath, as he slowly pulled out a small scapel, is index and thumb moved within Ushinawa's socket, and aimed to pull the eye lightly, as to not damage it, before the scapel was used to cut it free. He had to make it seem believable, so he took a deep breath, making a single seal he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, as he blew a hot flame outwards, aiming to scorch the socket making it seem as if the eye was charred out.* - Fri Oct  2 00:25:10 2015

His movements were swift and agile,  and had he managed to touch her bossom, she'd fine that she had lost the ability to move her arms and legs, definately the result of a high ranking fuuinjutsu.

"This test is simple, there is a lot of stuff you don't want to do. But this is a simulation when you're caught by the enemy. Try not to reveal any information, I won't do any advanced torturing but. I'll try to harm you verbally."* - Fri Oct  2 21:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) simply yawned, as he crouched over, and lifted Berith into his arms, before he took off. He didn't want to be interrupted, because this could definately be misinterpretted as something wrong.* - Fri Oct  2 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Berith. - Fri Oct  2 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: What is your rank? - Fri Oct  2 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Berith(BoyUmbreon) says: Genin. - Fri Oct  2 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Name all of your family Members.. - Fri Oct  2 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Berith(BoyUmbreon) says: Don' - Fri Oct  2 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You don't have any family Members? - Fri Oct  2 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Berith(BoyUmbreon) says: No.. - Fri Oct  2 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) would slowly move to flip her onto her stomach, quite roughly, before he placed his knee on the center of her back aiming to inflict a moderate amount of pain. His left hand moved to grab her paralyzed arm. He'd slowly attempt to bend it behind her back, for now he simply held it there not doing anything else at this moment. "Are you sure?"* - Fri Oct  2 21:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked at Zenaki, and nodded his head as he spoke "It's good to withhold that information, But enemy troops will use any information to get to you. If you didn't hold back the information that you had a daughter, They'd use her as leverage over you." He stated lightly, releasing her arm. But leaving her on the ground laying on her chest.

"We'll resume in a bit, I'll be kicking it up some."* - Fri Oct  2 21:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) thinks: Pussy. Senbon don't hurt that bad. - Fri Oct  2 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) scratched his chin "Definately unnecessary, But I suppose that'll be fine. And Yes I'd rather get this done with as soon as possible." He stated, before crouching before Berith's body, he'd extend his left hand, attempting to gather chakra into his finger tips, before aiming to with a swift motion insert a finger into her mouth. Which would prevent her of speaking of what had occured her, nor of the seal he had placed. Before he spoke "No killing her. But try to extract information from her." He stated shrugging his shoulders.* - Fri Oct  2 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: I set you up. - Fri Oct  2 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: I told her this is an exercise. - Fri Oct  2 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: To train in torture resistence. - Fri Oct  2 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) would once again take his position on Berith's back, as he spoke "Prepared to talk now? I can always, make it hurt a bit more." He stated, placing a hand, on the edge of the Senbon,pressing down on it and appying a bit of pressure aiming to inflict more pain upon the woman as he spoke: 

"Let's try this again, What's your full name?" He asked.

Taking a seat in front of the chained woman.* - Fri Oct  2 21:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Berith(BoyUmbreon) says: Berith. - Fri Oct  2 21:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) would slowly smile as he spoke "Good, Good. Where do you live?" He asked, eying her carefully. His voice was cold, he was definately playing this part well. Though he knew where to draw the line, but in the long run this could save her life.* - Fri Oct  2 21:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Berith(BoyUmbreon) says: In this village... - Fri Oct  2 21:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: More specific. - Fri Oct  2 21:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) felt her spit hit his face, and he closed his eyes,  disgust obviously showed on his face anf for a moment he broke character. But his hand moved to casually wipe away the spit from his face, as his hand shot forward to create a firm grasp around her neck, "This is going to be fun, I'm going to break you, Then I'm going to find your family. And torture them before you." He stated, his second hand comming around, as it was aimed at punching Berith in the stomach, enough to hurt but obviously holding back because this was an exercise afterall.* - Fri Oct  2 22:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: desklady: No I have not.  - Fri Oct  2 22:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) would smile briefly, he aimed to muster his own smile, he hoped she was able to come to the conclusion this was an exercise and didn't end up actually hating him, but he grabbed the color of her shirt, before with a single motion tugged it off, he definately hoped she was wearing something beneath it, he didn't intend to go beyond that, but she was a woman, and this would be some of the torture she'd face. But he wouldn't go further than that, it would definately be an overstep of his boundaries, as he heard her scream, his hand was swung.

Attempting to slap her across the cheek.

"Tell me, Do you have a boyfriend? Maybe I could find him, I think you'd enjoy the sound of his bones breaking...One...By...One." He stated, adding a evil laugh to go with it.* - Fri Oct  2 22:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) stood, as he stood, using the tattered remains of her shirt, he aimed to tie it around her eyes like a blind fold, aiming to increse the fear factor, as he was called for Zenaki, and as such he left the room. Figuring someone else would take over as he went into surgery.* - Fri Oct  2 22:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) was effectively put to  sleep thanks to the effects of Zenaki's medicine. Of course he had handed her the eye, he didn't as much as budge as his original eye was plucked from his socket, he laid there and of course he was at her mercy, he just hoped she didn't kill him, he did have Lera, he needed to return back to. Throughout the entire procedure, he was possibly one of the best patients, he had no reaction, nothing out of the ordinary occured, and once she was done he rested peacefully on the table.

His heart rate was steady, he'd survive, and so far it looked as if the surgery was a complete success, he would be happy to learn about this once he awakened all that was left was to sleep off the medicine.* - Fri Oct  2 22:26:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) after a few moments, his eyes slowly fluttered open, it was an oddd sensation "Darkness?" He asked himself, wondering what was wrong. Chances were he without a doubt had bandages over his face which concealed his eyes from the light, he'd need to slowly adapt to the light, but as for now, he didn't worry about undoing his bandages, as he sat up, he noticed the prescence of someone standing over him. 

"What....Happened?" He asked, his expression was light, he felt unusually....Calm, he felt like he was missing something. Even his eye naturally blinked beneath his bandages. His heart was at a steady pace, his memory was a tad bit hazy, but he didn't say anything, he felt for his limbs, they all seemed to be there. His head faced foward, and he watched the darkness before him. 

"Cold." He stated lightly.* - Fri Oct  2 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Back - Fri Oct  2 23:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) relaxed as instructed, as he laid back down, he was cold, but an eerie calm he wondered what was happening, it was an unexplainable feeling, "I've never seen darkness like this." He stated, as he closed his eyes beneath his bandages, relaxing as he drifted off into a light slumber once more, and when the door was opened once again, he was awakened, he didn't say anything but carefully listened to the steps of Zenaki as she approached, his heart rate was a bit accelerated but he said nothing.

"Zenaki?" He asked lightly. 

He was only aiming to confirm his beliefs of who it was as he waited on the table, it was eerie, he wondered if this was how a blind man felt...Uncertain of what was happening around him.* - Fri Oct  2 23:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) heard the sound of her voice resonate against his ears, as he felt the slight shift as she sat down beside him.  "A success...? That's great. I must thank you." He stated, remaining in a lying position for the most part, he didn't want to risk falling off the matress afterall, so he patiently waited and bided his time.* - Fri Oct  2 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mhm. I'd say rest a little bit more. I'll take the bandage away in 30 minutes. - Fri Oct  2 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: It should be fine. By then. - Fri Oct  2 23:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Don't get scared. I am going to heal your eye once more. - Fri Oct  2 23:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) simply nodded his head, as he spoke "Were there any complications?" He asked lightly, he felt the warmth of her technique over his eyes, and began slowly taking away the pain which had accumulated, and as ten minutes had passed. He felt pretty static, and his brain was beginning to wake up completely, out of habit. He tested his hands, opening and closing them, before relaxing them back at his side, he seemed to be recovering pretty well which was good for starters. 

"Thanks.."* - Fri Oct  2 23:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Well... The first attempt didn't go well. I had to replace it. But it works now. - Fri Oct  2 23:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: So both....My eyes are fine? - Fri Oct  2 23:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Kinda yea. - Fri Oct  2 23:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) felt Zenaki's hands on the side of his face, "Cold.." He thought to himself, as he felt her undoing the bandages which covered his face, his eyes were closed, but slowly he began to open his eye. As he did so, it was slow, his eye, was as red as blood, demonic in sorts. It's scarlet gaze stared forward at the wall before him. His other eye on the other hand, was cold, and silver, lifeless, and didn't react to the light as it was opened, but he was forced to immediately close the new eye to prevent the light from hitting it.

"The light...I...It's blinding."* - Fri Oct  2 23:29:16 2015
