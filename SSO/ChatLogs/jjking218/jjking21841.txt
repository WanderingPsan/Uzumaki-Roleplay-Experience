<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) would scratch his cheek nervously as he nodded his head, before he turned on his feet and began heading west as she stated.* - Sat Oct 10 12:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) led her to the lake, before he slowly removed his jacket, setting it down on the grass in front of the lake for her to take a seat, he'd offer her a hand to help her down before he himself would move to sit beside her.* - Sat Oct 10 12:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) shook his head, "I'm not to sure, he was heading towards where the mansion used to be...Last time I saw him which was last night." He stated looking out over the water as he turned to face her.

"I c-could g-go check l-later if you'd l-like."* - Sat Oct 10 12:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: Masked. Wonder who it is. - Sat Oct 10 12:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) blinked with a subtle blush as he noticed her leg being lifted, he slowly extended his hands out to take it lightly in his hands, supporting it atop of his hands. "Hopefully...My classes paid off." He thought to himself, looking to the type of footwear she was wearing, he'd slowly attempt to remove it from her foot, before preparing to work.

"I-I believe in y-your chances as w-well."* - Sat Oct 10 13:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) as her boots were removed, he slowly set them on the ground beside him, and slowly he took her foot in his hands gently. His thumbs moved to the sole of her foot, and with gentle motions, he began massaging the sole of her foot, taking his time and focusing, he hoped to help her relax. His motions were soft, yet somehow maintaining enough strength to help dig out and release the tension, he didn't seem to be in any hurry but retained a subtle blush.* - Sat Oct 10 13:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) as he felt the soft and smooth skin as he massaged her feet, a faint blush appeared on his face growing more pronounced as he continued. But he didn't miss a beat, after a few more moments he transitoned from her sole, to massaging the heel of her foot. He was now moving his thumbs in small circular motions, applying a tiny bit more pressure, since the heel probably had the most tension.

Occasionally he stole glances towards Asteroths face checking his process, but he didn't say a word, silently happy with her words.* - Sat Oct 10 13:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) looked up to her for a moment as he spoke "I'd just like to, get strong enough ti protect those I like, and strong enough to have fun." He stated lightly, as he continued focusing on massaging her heel for a while longer, before he moved upwards, deciding to work on her toes a bit, focusing only a tad,  as he took his time with each one, before giving her ankle a light rotate. And finally, he lightly pulled on each toe, which was an act of 'releasing tension'. But he'd continue massaging her foot until she was ready for him to switch.

"Though...Learning a lot about this world...A-and it's interworkings would be...f-fun." 

His blush was a lot more pronounced by this time.* - Sat Oct 10 14:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) looked to her as she asked her question as he spoke "There.....There are a lot of....'annoying'...People in this world, that I'm unable to handle because of laws, or regulations...Maintaining this mask un front of the populus to sav---" He paused, no doubt there was a lot of malice stored in his heart which was beginning to surface,  but he spoke "A-Ah, I-I got weird on y-you...Sorry Asteroth-sama.." He stated lightly.

As his hands continued to massage her foot, being gentle, as if it was a fragile piece of art he didn't dare harm.* - Sat Oct 10 14:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) looked towards the woman and waved back, scratching his cheek. He didn't really do well around women. But he relaxed at the water's edge, and his gaze focused back on the water momentarily.* - Sat Oct 10 15:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) began to notice her features as she approached, and faintly blushed, as he spoke "V-Very much so."* - Sat Oct 10 15:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) noticed the faint movement in the water he found it oddly unique, as he looked towards her he slowly spoke "My...My name's Cypher." He stated, seemingly captured by her beauty.* - Sat Oct 10 15:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) took notice of her name, but didn't say anything as he watched her as he relaxed on the ground watching the crystals float across the water. A single hand moved through his hair. "She's pretty."* - Sat Oct 10 15:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) simply relaxed, as he looked over the water, watching it briefly, every so often stealing glances towards the woman, but not saying anything.* - Sat Oct 10 16:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yoshiko(BigBootyJudy) says: Do you have a lighter or. . . - Sat Oct 10 16:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) simply relaxed, as he removed his goggles from his face he stood, slowly walking towards Yoshiko's position, there was a gentle smile on his face. "So...Do you have a boyfriend~?"* - Sat Oct 10 16:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) slowly stepped closer perhaps unnecessarily close as he leaned in for a whisper, the air around him seemed to shift as he completed his whisper, he decided to continue walking around the woman.* - Sat Oct 10 16:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) whispers: Maybe you should change that, but....If you try anything to harm me, I'll sell you as a rich man's slave. - Sat Oct 10 16:22:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) had a single hand in his pocket, and as he looked towards Yoshiko who desired to retreat. He simply vanished from his position, appearing almost in the blink of an eye to most untrained eyes. He'd appear at Yoshiko's side, as he simply stated:

"If you didn't catch it the first time,  If you try to harm me...I'll sell you as a whore.  It''d be more cost efficient and less work." He stated, looking at her face, he seemed oddly....Resolved, he was fully prepared to either kill or sell her body for profit if she ever thought about targetting him.* - Sat Oct 10 16:28:35 2015

He admitted, pitching his business plan to Hideki. "The Snow Princess of the Land of Iron~" He stated, as he spoke "I can see it now, A major attraction."* - Sat Oct 10 16:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) yawns briefly as he spoke "She should be more careful, when she prepares to attack someone she doesn't know, She'd lucky I didn't rip her throat out of her neck. I figured older men would find a good use for the throat." He shrugged lightly, he seemed a calm-pissed, by her actions. The male moved south before yawning.* - Sat Oct 10 16:35:24 2015
