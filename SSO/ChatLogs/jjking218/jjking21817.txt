<br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Do a plank. - Mon Sep 14 23:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Like a push up, but don't push up, hold it. - Mon Sep 14 23:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) nodded his head as he heard Muhhamed's words, and without hesitation he dropped to the ground. Seemingly not a stranger to physical exercise, as he slowly extended both legs backwards, and placed his hands firmly upon the ground. Getting into the position most commonly known as the starting position for pushups, and as instructed he simply held his position there. Waiting for what was to come next.* - Mon Sep 14 23:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) felt a foot step atop of his back, and immediately began shaking, as he felt Muhhamed, take a seat upon him immediately he felt the tension and strain rushing to his arms. Clearly finding it hard to support another person's body weight, as he heard Muhhamed's words he groaned a bit under his breath. But he began thinking of what solution he could possibly have to this question, in all honesty he already knew that his forces were outmanned at a Ratio of 2:1, which definately wasn't the best odds. As he spoke:

"I'm not s-sure, I-I don't think it'd b-be favorable to fight a-against those n-numbers...I-I think I'd order a retreat..." 

That probably wasn't the right answer, But he wasn't a fan of such unfavorable odds, call it a personal quirk, but he was also feeling the strain weighing down upon him.* - Mon Sep 14 23:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a deep breath and at this point his stance was no doubt wobbling as he was weighed down greatly, with gravity pulling him down at the moment, but he had to focus  taking a deep breath as he closed his eyes for a moment to focus, trying to zone out the aching of his mucles as he came up with an idea. But it was a long shot, and wouldn't garuntee the win. Opening his mouth he spoke:

"I'd target the smaller group comming from my right flank....T-They're closer...F-Focusing my forces to t-target where t-they're the weakest....Changing the odds in m-my favor...?" 

He stated hoping there was a right answer...Although he honestly had no right answer for this at least not one that would win him this battle.* - Mon Sep 14 23:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) contemplated what he just heard, definately this was adding a sense of stress...Something Muhhamed was expertly doing because the longer he sat on his back the stronger the fatigue and tension became, causing him to think harder to remain focused, as he stated "I use this time to set up traps as we move foward, hoping to cut down my enemies forces before we're forced into direct...confrontation. E-Even if that works, I'm s-sure their forces will vastly...Out m-match my own...Then I will employ t-tactics to aim and lower the enemies morale.." 

He contemplated his decisions for a moment.

"M-Maybe utilize the Bunshin technique to 'increase' the number of soldiers...At least as far as the enemy can detect..If possible.."* - Mon Sep 14 23:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) felt the pressure increasing upon him as he grunted he felt his arms being on the edge, and despertly they desired to be released from this pressure as he focused on what else he could do as he spoke:

"I'd....Have my troops focus on Area based Techniques, S-Such as using Water Ninjutsu to soak the enemies, before using Lightning to take them out in large portions...Maybe incorperate the use of oil to add more strength to fire Techniques..?"* - Mon Sep 14 23:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) he realised his flawed thinking, and he felt the weight of that decision piling atop of him, he would've just ordered his forces to death. And that realisation caused him to cave in, as he fell to the ground, with a grunt he slammed his fists against the dirt. He had much to learn...He wasn't good at strategizing at all, but he knew sometimes being smarter would win the battle rather than being stronger, and he knew he had a pretty basic way of thinking.

"That was....A foolish decision on my part....I would've gotten all of them killed.....I have to think better...Smarter...More efficently...Or I'll cost them their lives...And my own."  

He stated through gritted teeth obviously annoyed with his own responses, he had to improve.* - Mon Sep 14 23:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: True. - Mon Sep 14 23:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) accepted Muhhamed's help as he got off of him, feeling as if a weight was lifted off of his shoulders. He released a sigh of relief, he heard the man's words, and nodded his head, reaching for his red scroll which hung at his hip, he unraveled it, before placing a hand on the seal which was located at the center, and he surged his chakra through it, causing a notepad and a pencil to be uncealed from it's confinements.* - Tue Sep 15 00:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) raised a hand to catch the scroll, as he turned and bowed his head to Muhhamed "Thank you....I'll do my best to absorb all the knowledge written in this scroll." He stated, keeping his head bowed for a bit longer before standing upright.* - Tue Sep 15 00:15:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Heh. - Tue Sep 15 14:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, what elements do you have? - Tue Sep 15 14:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Fire, Wind and Lightning. - Tue Sep 15 14:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hrmm...and uh, what jutsu do you know for those? - Tue Sep 15 14:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Uh....Flame Thrower, Wind Release: Godly Wind from the Mountains, Chakra Flow, and Fireball Jutsu. - Tue Sep 15 14:06:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Deal...But I feel like you're getting less out of this. - Tue Sep 15 14:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its okay, I don't mind at all. - Tue Sep 15 14:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You sure? - Tue Sep 15 14:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: hm! - Tue Sep 15 14:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Alright then. - Tue Sep 15 14:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: How about...we each demonstrate one and then we can both learn and teach at the same time. - Tue Sep 15 14:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Sounds perfect. - Tue Sep 15 14:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Can I see Chakra flow first? - Tue Sep 15 14:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And uh, which one of mine do you want first? - Tue Sep 15 14:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Surprise me~ - Tue Sep 15 14:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) would slowly smile as he reached down for a small rock which was on the ground, looking towards Lera as he spoke "Well it's pretty simple, It's simply concentrating the flow of chakra around or into an object or weaponry. Focus on the feeling of the element you wish to use. And then send it into the weapon." He stated, as he began to gather his chakra, before feeding it into the rock he had picked up, and immediately it began to surge with flames, which covered the rock though the flames weren't to potent, most likely due to his lack of ability with Ninjutsu.

They could be detected, then taking a look at the water, he plucked the rock, sending it flying over the water, but it still retained it's flames before dropping into the sea as he explained "You don't need to remain in contact with the object for the chakra flow to be maintained either. It's an interesting technique."* - Tue Sep 15 14:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmm. Its really similar to what Hassan-sensei taught me, except that was in my fingers instead of an object. - Tue Sep 15 14:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hm...? Your fingers? - Tue Sep 15 14:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Sounds like an interesting technique. - Tue Sep 15 14:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm...Its one of the ones he told me I'm not allowed to teach. - Tue Sep 15 14:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Because its very dangerous. - Tue Sep 15 14:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I see, he must believe in you a lot to teach you it then. - Tue Sep 15 14:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You're lucky~ - Tue Sep 15 14:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Although, its also his personal technique... - Tue Sep 15 14:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehe, I hope so~ - Tue Sep 15 14:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) would slowly watch Lera's hands as they began to move together, gently watching the formation of each of her seals. Taking in the knowledge, as he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, it did seem like it'd be a very good technique and would definately be quite useful in a battle, there were many applications for this technique, and he was glad she was willing to teach him such a technique, so he inhaled followed by a deep exahale, as he decided he should begin practicing this technique alongside of her.

Slowly he decided to first work on the handseals as he began to slowly recall the movements of her hands, as they moved against eachother. And slowly his hands were raised as he attempted to replicate her seals, following in pursuit, he took his time with each individual seal. Making sure he moulded them correctly, and his transition from seal to seal was perfect, and there was no lag in between the motions.

He took a deep breath and sighed, this would truly be an interesting jutsu, he knew if he worked on the ability to transition from jutsu to jutsu he'd be able to amplify his Fire jutsu,  and that would make him a force to be reckoned with then again, he had no intention of going to far into Ninjutsu usage, at least not currently, it was simply a way to keep him alive while he began prepping for his seals, he took a deep breath and sighed.

Eventually he had finished the weaving of handseals, and decided he'd begin working upon the chakra control portion so he did, his hands raised to chest level, as he went through the seals once again, before cocking back his fist, chakra began to flare around his open palm, in a manner similar to godly wind, as he gathered his chakra, holding it there, as he inhaled followed by a deep exhale.

After another moment of holding it there, his hand shot forward, expelling the chakra, which was released in a gale wind, which caused the trees to rustle subtly, as he smiled looking to Lera, he gave her a thumbs up as he spoke "I think I got it." He was very gifted when it came to learning, so he usually picked things up at a faster rate than most, after he was done, he sat on the ground to watch Lera practice the jutsu he had shown her, but he knew she was better with Ninjutsu than him anyway.* - Tue Sep 15 14:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: np_ - Tue Sep 15 14:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Lookin' good~ - Tue Sep 15 14:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm. Want to move straight onto the next one? - Tue Sep 15 14:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: If you're ready~ - Tue Sep 15 14:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm~ - Tue Sep 15 14:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'll show you the Raiton one next~ - Tue Sep 15 14:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a deep breath and nodded his head, as he heard Lera's words before he stated " This one is pretty simple." He  stated, raising his hands as he made a single seal before inhaling followed by an exhale, as a steady stream of flames escaped form his lips, soaring over the ocean and dispersing.  It was definately a basic technique, as he explained "It's an easy technique to perform, and is pretty straight foreward. The flames aren't that powerful, But even so it's good for keeping numerous enemies at bay." 

He explained lightly, as he stopped to look at her description of the technique she was showing him. He hadn't learned a lightning technique yet so he was definately interested in going down that route.* - Tue Sep 15 14:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh...I forgot! I actually have one more Katon jutsu I can teach you as well. If you want. - Tue Sep 15 14:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Oh alright~. - Tue Sep 15 14:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'll try to find a technique to teach you though....Hm...I suppose I'll be on the look out. - Tue Sep 15 14:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its okay really~ I really enjoy teaching. - Tue Sep 15 14:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Especially in good company~ - Tue Sep 15 14:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Mm, and I enjoy learning from a good teacher. - Tue Sep 15 14:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) decided to begin working on this next technique honestly he wasn't used to the Lightning element and had no techniques which called upon said element for power and as such this technique was a bit harder for him to understand. So he cracked his knuckles and began to focus on the task at hand, this jutsu without a doubt would be a an asset in battle. So taking a deep breath he inhaled followed by a deep exhale.

Understanding the basis of the technique his hands were raised to chest level as he began to weave a series of handseals, following in pursuit of Lera's own, as his chakra was beginning to be called upon as he inhaled followed by a deep breath,  as his chakra was conjured to the tips of his fingers, he dropped to the ground and slammed his palms upon the surface.

Electricity ignited from the point of impact, traveling in a straight line as it moved towards the rocky shore, colliding with it and placing a dent into the wall, he nodded his head as he spoke "I think I understand." He was a bit beat, at least training wise, it seemed like he desired to relax for a bit.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked at her as she stepped closer to him, looking down to her as he noticed their faces were so close.

He stated, caught up in this moment.* - Tue Sep 15 15:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked into her eyes, as she stared into his own. He felt his heart racing, he wanted to do something...But could he? Did he have the courage to do it? "Thirty seconds of courage.." He thought to himself leaning closer, as he placed his hands lightly on her shoulders drifting closer, but then he stopped his embarrassment stopping him from going all the way.* - Tue Sep 15 15:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) felt her arms encircle his waist, as he found his eyes drawn to her lips. Until finally, he moved with her pressing his lips against her own, as he closed his eyes. Embracing the feeling of his first kiss, his hands lowered to her hips, as he kissed her. Embracing this sensation, as it took him to a new level of uncharted territory, but he was happy it was with Lera...More than happy.* - Tue Sep 15 15:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) felt Lera pull away, though it felt like he still longed for more, but that was fine. He felt her face burried into his neck, and he subtly wished he was like Lera and didn't back out at the last second. But regardless, his arms moved around her, hugging her gently in his arms, his face was a deep shade of red out of embarrassment, also in disbelief of what had just occured, but he enjoyed every moment of it. * - Tue Sep 15 16:03:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) nodded his head as he heard Niza's words this was truly an extroadinary technique he was actually surprised at Niza's Strength...I mean he did just flip a cow, the young boy whistled, simply amazed as he decided he wouldn't try flipping a cow or he might actually end up getting crushed by a cow. So he took a deep breath and nodded his head to Niza, as he spoke: "If you don't mind me asking...Who is your master?" He asked.

But even without an answer or with one he decided to return to his training. Taking a deep breath, as he approached a 'shadow parthner'. And took a deep breath,  moving his left leg forward in a manner akin to an attempt to remove the footing of a opponent, before following the motion of wrapping his arms around the neck of the invisible person, before allowing his weight to take over, aiming to toss the figure over.

He definately hadn't gotten the most out of that so he prepared to begin the exercise once again, taking a deep breath and paying attention and focusing on the finer details of the exercise at hand, he took a deep breath and sighed, before focusing, this was a little bit harder to accomplish than the previous had been but even so he prepared to get back to what he was doing.

Positioning his footing correctly, he aimed to remove his opponent's balance by the way of taking out his legs, before grabbing their wrist and using their weight to knock them to the ground, which was definately an interesting thing to do, he wondered what kind of training Niza's master had to go through to master these techniques or even get the inspiration for their creation.

And deep down he found himself happy to have met Niza and had the opportunity to learn from him.* - Tue Sep 15 18:25:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a deep breath and nodded his head this would definately be valuable in battle,  at least for any allies he doubted the technique could be self-applied. But either way he slowly unraveled the scroll and began reading first starting with the name of the technique which was "Novice Healing Technique." He nodded his head, cracking his knuckles, before his eyes focused on the jutsu at hand, deciding to start from the beginning, he knew it wouldn't take him long to learn this jutsu in comparison with others.

At the same token he understood he needed to put some effort into the jutsu because it was out of his skillset, he knew he wanted to focuse solely upon Fuuinjutsu. But he knew Ultimately he'd probably end up being a support character, so he needed to support his teammates regardless he began to read"The user places their palms upon a wound inflicted upon their target, healing it."

 Taking a deep breath he nodded his head finding this fairly interesting to say the least but regardless he decided to continue reading. He knew of the person he cared about got injured he'd definately desire to save her."This santizes wounds and stops bleeding. It is capable of compltely healing minor to moderate wounds such as sword-inflicted stab wounds." After he finished the scroll he figured he'd try to focus.

Taking a deep breath he slowly nodded his head, after he finished the technique. And slowly his hands were raised to chest level, inhaling followed by a deep exhale. As the chakra gathered at the center of his palms, creating a faint green glow which immediately dispersed, he sighed briefly but it was progress, so he smiled lightly, and decided to get back to it, with a brief inhale, followed by an exhale. He prepared to try again.

Taking a deep breath he sighed to himself, with a light sigh he decided to slowly go over the handseals once again, his chakra beginning to gather at the center of his palm, as he smiled briefly, holding it there for a moment, he could feel the warmth radiating from his palm, before he took a deep breath and dispersed it, running a single hand through his hair after he had managed to learn this technique.

He slowly walked towards Koeki once again, with a gentle smile he'd sit beside her offering the scroll back to her as he yawned subtly, before cracking his knuckles, he had successfully learned the technique afterall, so that was a start, he yawned to himself, cracking his knuckles, as he heard the announcement.* - Tue Sep 15 20:14:04 2015
