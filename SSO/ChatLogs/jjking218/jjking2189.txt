<br><font color=yellow>*Syounara, Rikudou(Based Gods Son) began walking southwards, not even looking back as his face had an aggravated expression played onto it, his hands in his pocket as he closed his eyes briefly.... 
"We will simply have to make due with what we have..." Rikudou muttered..*

<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Rikudou(Based Gods Son) says: . . .The question is who are you.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Rikudou(Based Gods Son) says: It is rude to ask for names when you haven't given your own after all.

<br><font color=yellow>*Syounara, Rikudou(Based Gods Son) glanced towards Seidou quietly, closing his eyes as he murmured something...He reopened his eyes as she left, exhaling quietly..."We should go."*
<br><font color=yellow>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) sighs, saying"We probably should." Placing his hands in his pocket, he began to head for the door.*
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Rikudou(Based Gods Son) says: Oh but first I should get the scrolls the Hokage ordered us to retrieve, wouldn't want to come back empty handed after all.
<br><font color=yellow>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) blinks a few times, looking over at the Hokage's desk, seeing it empty, as always. He then looked at the two kids that wanted to leave quickly, saying to the side: "People are rather rude nowadays. . ." He looked to the desk once more, seemingly looking for something.*
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Definately.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Let me assist you.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: He said the containment scrolls were to the left.
<br><font color=yellow>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) walks over to the shelves.*
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: I see no containment scrolls, but maybe a Bag will work brother?
<br><font color=yellow>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) looked to the side for a moment, seeing shelves upon shelves of scrolls. He then looked back at the kids, walking towards them as he said outloud: "What's that the Hokage wanted. . .?"*
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: He wanted us to bring some scrolls to the Exams, saying its gonna be a surprise, prize.
<br><font color=yellow>*Syounara, Rikudou(Based Gods Son) quietly walked up towards the large array of scrolls, nodding towards Seidou as he crossed his arms and studied the wall closely. He tilted his head as he read the scrolls carefully, picking up two previously discussed topics; one being a blue colored scroll, the other being one on genjutsu...
"Probaly Tora." *
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: . . .
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: I don't see how an affair that involves mutliple villages would require a prize from just one of them. What made him decide to give out "prizes"?
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Peace times I think?
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: He didn't specify.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Rikudou(Based Gods Son) says: Who said anythign about prizes to other villages...Your making assumptions regardless.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Its obvious?
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Why would he tell us to do this if it wasn't a prize.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: You may go ask him (@ Sour)
<br><font color=yellow>*Syounara, Rikudou(Based Gods Son) turned towards Seidou, shaking his head..."You don't even remember the task silly...It was for the Konoha genin that did well." *
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: . . .
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: He is at the stands.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Be our guest.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: We'll wait until you arrive.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Rikudou(Based Gods Son) says: If you have a problem feel free to state it, sir.
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: Now you're assuming I have a problem with it. Go ahead, I was just here to see if he was doing his job.
<br><font color=yellow>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) using the bag he would slowly reach to the shelves taking off Six elemental scrolls, placing them in the bag. As he would look saying"We better hurry back soon." As he quickly grabbed Two Taijutsu Scrolls, placing them in the bag. As he would sigh, placing his back against the wall signaling he would wait. Saying"If we don't need to be held up here, We should get going before its to late."*
<br><font color=yellow>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) looks at the shelves once more. He took a short breath before turning around, not caring very much for whatever the kids had left to say.*
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Rikudou(Based Gods Son) says: We better leave quickly....Replace the scrolls with blank ones.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: OOOO. This looks ncie.

<br><font color=yellow>*Syounara, Rikudou(Based Gods Son) studied the blue scroll he had picked out earlier and went under a tree nearby the river. He smirked as he tossed the scroll back and forth briefly before carefully checking for traps, as was his careful nature. He unfurled the scroll as he scanned it's writings thoroughly...
"Hm...syrup trap..." Rikudou muttered, rubbing his chin..

2) Rikudou had finished reading the scroll several times as he practiced the small chain of handseals slowly at first, increasing in speed as he felt that he had achieved the combination. He carefully placed the scroll to the side as he closed his eyes and re-evaluated what he had gleaned from the jutsu....
"Alright...So a water source isn't required necessarily though it makes it far more easier...so I should try without the water for now.."  Rikudou thought, reopening his eyes as he found an opening in the forest to test this new discovery out..

3)  Rikudou stood up once more as he made several handsigns as he entered the opening, closing his eyes as he focused his chakra...He had held the last handseal at the end, looking towards a tree as he leaned his head backwards, lining up his shot. He reopened his eyes quickly as he leaned forward, inwardly thinking: "Suiton: Syrup trap!", only to find a stream of water shooting out on the ground harmlessly....He sighed and rubbed his neck, feeling that he would have to try harder and figure out what he did wrong....

4) Rikudou had went back towards the scroll as he restudied the processes, going over it slower as he felt that at last he knew what he was doing. He walked forward back into the clearing the opening once more as he sat in a meditative position... "So if I put in too little chakra, it comes out as water...and more than likely too much it just becomes a large glob of stickiness....I need to assert balance....." Rikudou muttered, going deep within himself to find balance. 

5) He stood up slowly as he felt that at last as he found the equilibrium in the jutsu, making several handsigns. He reopened his eyes, his sharingan active as he leaned backwards. "Syrup trap!" Rikudou inwardly thought as he shot forward, this time a nice small wave of a strange substance flying forward and neatly sticking against the tree, and trapping several squirells...Rikudou tilted his head as he noticed that the animals couldn't move regardless of how much they struggled and he chuckled slightly, feelign that he was now making progress.*

D rank

Description ; 
By accomplishing the rat handseal, and wavering the hand, an invisible barrier forms through the will and developpes through the implanted chakra of the user. Due to the invisible aspect of the barrier, only thus who are able to see chakra may be able to see the barrier.

It's durability depends on experience, uses, knowledge, and could be boosted through an implant of chakra. With much experience, on may not even need accomplish the rat handseal.

Elemental nature can be implanted in place, as once making physical contact could, conjure fire, slippery aspects, blow away, make itself ridgid to allow stractches, and or even electrocute upon contact.(This is what makes it C rank.)*

<br><font color=green>*Rich(Rich2008) says: (You know what, just take it away.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Syounara, Rikudou(Based Gods Son) 6) Rikudou continued to watch the squirells and noticed that the jutsu didn't last very long at this moment in time, as they broke free after several minutes...Rikudou frowned slightly as he crossed his arms, analyzing the scene with his onetomoe...He rubbed his chin as he decided to keep practicing the technique until the trap lasted longer, knowing that he would need this in the future... He smiled as he felt that he was finally getting somewhere, and that he would carry out the wishes of his clan members...

7) Rikudou had completed the Syrup trap multiple times throughout the week, until he felt that he could do it much easier and waste less chakra as he tested the jutsu on a brown bear in the area. He watched carefully as the bear had been wandering around aimlessly, where he then fired the shot under the bears paws. Rikudou dropped down quietly as he watched the bear try to squirm free, but it was stuck solid and in fact the struggling made it harder to break free...
"At last...success..." Rikudou muttered, flipping his kunai as he walked forward to the dinner that would feed him and his brother.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Takumo(Infinite Swag) || It was a cool day in Konoha. The weather was cool, the humidity was low. By the calm streets, there was a house expelling smoke. By the house, there was a group of fat people doing a pretty much cool barbecue. The smell was great. Big hamburgers were located in the grill, and by the side, a lot of bread pieces. An old fat guy was located taking care of the food, Takumo's father.

In the central table, Takumo was sat, reading a taijutsu performance book. He was the only active Akimichi, making him not that bad. He still had the power inhetered by his clan traits, just not that fat. Snacking some nachos, he was looking at the stances that the book was showing with good designed pictures.

The smell of the hamburguers was taking control of the yard. Takumo's father grabbed the hamburguers, and put them in the bread. Placing two pieces of cheese, and covering them with another the another part of the bread. The old guy put them inside a plate, and placed it ontop of the table, saying: "We'll get hard ninjutsu training if you eat all of those ten cheeseburgers." Takumo had a brainstorm, but a disgusting face. He was trying to be different, doing diets and such, but he usually never succeded.

Grabbing on the chesseburgers, he openned his mouth a little bit, and snacking it once. Feeling the fat of the meat, his head started to spin from the inside. He couldn't disguise his Akimichi hunger. He quickly tossed it all, and chewed it in a rush. Feeling the great pleasure, he tossed more five cheseburgers, with his mouth wide openned.

The food dropped to his stomach, and started to be disgested. He stared at the four left burguers, with a OGODWHY face. He thought he couldn't let the training fail, and put three cheseburgues one top of another, and tossed them all at his open mouth. Eating it quickly to hide the horrofying feeling, he started to have a really bad face. He started to sweat hardly on the side of his forehead, and thinking of the awesome training he'd have.

Staring deeply at the last cheeseburguers and it's contents, he grabbed it, and put it on his mouth, entirely. This wasn't a good idea. He felt the previously eaten food starting to come out, rubbing his belly with his right hand. He chewed it quickly like a machine, and put it in. He stood on the chair for a good time, silent and staring at the nothingness, trying to do not vomit. After some minutes, he managed to get up, walking to his dad, with the empty plate on hand. As soon as his father noticed the plate, he said: "Get ready." Takumo grinned with half of his mouth, looking sorta awkward inside...*
<br><font color=yellow>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) would slowly open the bag of stolen scrolls, dumping them onto the ground. As he chuckled, withdrawing the 'Gale Palm' Scroll.  Smiling he would pick it up, holding it under his arm as he went to a secluded area. Cracking his knuckles as he would spread the scroll out. Looking at it with a slight smile, as he began to read"A simple technique that when the users hands are clapped together, wind is compressed and transformed into a powerful gale." Smiling he clutched his hands togethor in a clap like state. Attempting to finish reading this scroll.

Continuing to read this jutsu began to intrigue the boy even more, as he read. The wind would blow his hair across his face. Slightly obscuring his vision, as he simply chuckled as he read"This technique, when used as an isolated attack has the power to easily knock over a human." Chuckling he began making plans of how else it can be used in battle as he thought"When combined with the fireball Jutsu...It can increase its size."OR maybe when I use it to push someone. Then pounce with My Kunai...." Chuckling he would look into the dark sky. Peering into the moon, as he wondered what made him a common theif.

Sighing he would look at his scroll once again, balling his fist he would sigh. Deciding it was time to go to sleep, awaking the next day he sat down attempting to go over the Jutsu again. As he read, from begining to end"A simple technique that when the users hands are clapped together, wind is compressed and transformed into a powerful gale. This technique, when used as an isolated attack has the power to easily knock over a human. Though the true value comes from using it together with projectile weapons like shuriken or kunai. Their speed, power, and ability to wound or even kill are all increased several times. " Standing he decided to test this Jutsu out. As he stood, the sun still low in the sky.

Clenching his fist, he would look look at a nearby tree. Closing his eyes, he began slamming his palms togethor as a Test.  As he went over the steps in his head saying to himself" First you have to concentrate your chakra, then expel it outwards..." Attempting to channel his chakra he would reopen his eyes, slamming his palms togethor. A small gust of wind went over the surroundings. Though he knew it wasn't his wind, he let out a sigh. Annoyance came over him, As he slammed his palms onto the ground. Preparing for another attempt at

Would look the they sky, wondering what was good in this world. Though he usually saw the bright side of things, he would begin to channel his chakra to his core.

As he threw it down he was already darting to the left, throwing a kunai as he kept track of it's flight pattern before sliding in the dirt, rushing towards the left side of the smog to where he assumed Seidou would run to.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) would quickly dash to the side, as planned the Kunai passing by him. As he began to concentrate his chakra into his core, then moving it to his palms. He would slam them togethor. Instantly a huge Gust of wind would emit from around Seidou. IF succeeded, the poison would spread out more possibly hitting Rikudou.*

<br><font color=yellow>*Syounara, Rikudou(Based Gods Son) smirked underneath the cover of his jacket as his mouth was safe from the gas, and the simple concentration of the gas would be surrounding seidou long enough for it to take affect, the spread of the gas diminishing it's effects logically. Rikudou ran closer to Seidou, attempting to jump in the air with a quicky lift off from the ground, flipping once as he attempted to axe kick him in the head and possibly finish the fight with a well placed kicked to the dome.*

If succeeded he would attempt to make Rikudou do a backflip to get off of him. Clenching his fist, Seidou would attempt to follow up by making a swift punch to Rikudou's face. Hoping it would make contact. (got confused in my own rp)*
<br><font color=yellow>*Syounara, Rikudou(Based Gods Son) smirked as he was rebounded backwards, flipping in mid air and sliding against the dirt in a crouched position and his eyes s widened when a fist flew at his face. He opened his eyes wide and was struck, until he disappeared in a puff of smoke, a kunai in his place as he was behind Seidou...

"Got you now.." Rikudou thought, running forward and attempting to kick him in the back with a strong kick, pivoting on his feet as he quickly followed up with a punch to the face.*

<br><font color=yellow>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) would attempt to catch his brothers foot as it spun his way, if succeeded. He would then attempt to kick on of Rikudou's hands to throw him off balance. Thinking "My brother's pretty strong...." Knowing he might not be any match but he wouldn't give up anytime soon.*

<br><font color=yellow>*Syounara, Rikudou(Based Gods Son) eyes narrowed as he struck his brother, obviously successful in HIS attack considering logic and what not. He struck his face but was nonetheless thrown off his balance, going into a quick evasive roll and bouncing back up. He smirked slightly as he stood up once more, thankful that his brother was skilled enough to be a challenge in a fight....He leaned forward to do handseals, but noticed a stranger in their midst, frowning and stopping halfway....

"We're done here, good spar..." Rikudou stated, giving the boy an impassive glare.*

<br><font color=yellow>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) //The colors in the surrounding area became more vivid as the bright sun shined on the entire region. Birds were heard chirping and small animals could be heard rustling in bushes. Suzy straps a small puppet to her back that she planned on using for her missions, which was to capture and interrogate an Iwagakure shinobi and question him about the recent attacks being made in Konoha. She was coming close to the land of Earth, however she was not going to fully enter the region. Still within the green lush of the forest, she found a safe place she would be able to place her body for her recon. 

In her left hand was a cage with a small dove inside. Releasing the small hatch of the cage, Suzy quickly performed the unique hand seal of her clan's jutsu.
"Mind Transfer Jutsu.", she said, forcing her chakra and mentally energy within the bird. Her mind completely overtook the bird, allowing her full control over it's movements and even the ability to fly. Suzy's body layed safetly inside of a small opening under a tree where she would be safe from other shinobi.

Upon exiting the small tree, she quickly was able to sense another shinobi by the use of her being a sensor, and with her mind being in the bird, the Iwagakure shinobi wouldn't suspect a thing. In her bird form, she returned to her body, now knowing there was someone coming to her location. She tried not to make a single sound as she quickly set up her puppet in the middle of the raod where the Iwagakure shinobi was walking alone. Using her Mind Transer Jutsu, she switched places with the puppet and set up the correct seals on the puppet in order for her jutsu to take effect.

The puppet stood in the middle of the road with Suzy's mind inside, waiting for the Iwa shinobi to cross it's path. Once he saw it he came to a stop, raising his eyebrow. "A puppet?", she thought to himself, already on his gaurd at it's sight.
Controlling the puppet, Suzy caused a kunai to be launched in the shinobi's direction, making the puppet appear as a threat. "Hey what's the big idea!?", the shinobi said, using his speed to come up to the puppet and give it a swift kick, his speed was quite impressive.

Upon comming into contact with the puppet, the seals on the outside of it activated, his mind switching places with the puppet and Suzy transfering her own mind into the Iwagakure shinobi. "Wh-What? What happened!? Get me out of here!? What did you do!!!?", she shinobi pleaded as he realized what had happened. "Not until you answer some questions for me.", Suzy said while her mind was inside of the Iwa shinobi, beginning the interrogation while his mind was trapped within the puppet, throwing out multiple threats of keeping him in the puppet forever if he did not cooprate.*

<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Clayr(Wynokx) says: Okay! Where do we begin?
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: There is something I have been meaning to teach you.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Clayr(Wynokx) says: Oh!
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Clayr(Wynokx) says: What's that?
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Come with me.
<br><font color=yellow>*Yamanaka, Clayr(Wynokx) walks towards her sister and places a foot onto the hair on the ground. She suddenly loses teh ability to move. "Wh-What in the...." She says, her body stuck in place. "What is this?"*
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (are you ic Sei?)
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Me?)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (yes)

<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: They cause anyone who steps on them to be trapped for a VERY short amount of time, leaving a quick opening for the clans secret technique.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: LOL)
<br><font color=yellow>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) notes at this point, Clayr would be able to move.*
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: What about Amas that grows Stronger with water, and weaker with fire)
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: lol)

<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Clayr(Wynokx) says: ( Did this mess u up as a child too? o-o )
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: ? o-o0

<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Try it out for yourself Clayr.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: ?)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Clayr(Wynokx) says: ( Courage the cowardly dog in general fucked me up..
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Clayr(Wynokx) says: Alrighty...
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Sound good?)
<br><font color=yellow>*Yamanaka, Clayr(Wynokx) pulls out a kunai and brings it to her hair. She pulls it across the blade. She doesn't cut off too much, she does just enough. Clayr tosses the hair on the ground and holds the Yamanaka Clan's  special handseal. She forces her chakra outwards towards the hair attempting to activate the jutsu.
*
<br><font color=yellow>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) walks over to step on the hair, noticing nothing had happened.*
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Hmmm.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Clayr(Wynokx) says: I messed up?
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: ough the form can vary depending on the user, each Zekkai tends to have the standard appearance of a dark, flame-like aura. An incomplete Zekkai has a dynamic cloak-like form, while a mature Zekkai takes the shape of a sphere. Zekkai has considerable offensive and defensive capabilities: it can corrosively destroy virtually any object foreign to the user, and can repel all but the strongest attacks.)

<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Don't put too much or too little chakra into the hair.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Each strand needs a perfect amount of chakra.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Clayr(Wynokx) says: Oh? How am I going to figure out how much is enough?
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: That you must find out on your own.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: You will know if you used the right amount of chakra if it traps you.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Or me.
<br><font color=yellow>*Yamanaka, Clayr(Wynokx) looks directly at the hair and begins to hold the seal again. She focuses her chakra and begins to hold it together in her core. She then releases her chakra outwards. Clayr begins to slowly diffuse her chakra into the hair laying on the ground. As she finishes, she waits to se if it works.*
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Clayr(Wynokx) says: ( see* )

<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Rahie) says: Why are you growing scared?
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: And the kage house being robbed.
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: Nrmmmmm...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Sigh...
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: Evan, let us spar!!!

<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: I want to see whose taijutsu is better!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Sighhhhh.

<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: Let me see here...
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: Your eyes... They speak of defeat!!!
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) sighed and folded his arms as he stared at the Genin, his life-less eyes gazing at any movement as he said "I won't even go all out..." Saying this he attempted to infuriate the Genin.*
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: My defeat...
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: This village is a shadow of its former state.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: And what would you know about Konoha kid..?
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: I read books.
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: I am not very book smart...
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: All bronze and no brains.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Books bend the truth with however the author wishes.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: *Sigh*
<br><font color=yellow>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) assumed no formal stance--being unusual for him, considering how he loved to show off his Hachimon stance. Instead, he simply rushed towards the white-eyed Leafie. In his words, he had sparked an emotion in Sashi. However, it was determination rather than anger that his words drew from him. With this in mind, he launched his gauze-wrapped towards Evan in an attempt to push him back rather to cause damage.*
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: ....
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (OMGOMGOMG)

<br><font color=green>*Seithin Gringu(Jack Lyzerg) says: ...
<br><font color=yellow>*Seithin Gringu(Jack Lyzerg) looks directly at the child.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Sashi.)
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (?)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (You trying to lolPrimary Lotus me?)
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (No, I don't even know that)

<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (I don't know it)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (So wait, you're just sending wrappings at me?)
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (No, I launched my gauze-wrapped fist at u)
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (It was just a somewhat descriptive attack)
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (I was makin the RP look pretty)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (It just says Gauze-wrappings.)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Well Gauze-wrapped)
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (Oh, forgot the word fist)
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (Mah bad)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (It's okay.)
<br><font color=green>*Seithin Gringu(Jack Lyzerg) says: ( kay. typing )
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (OTher than that was it a good RP????)
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (Cuz I haven't RP fought in a while)
<br><font color=green>*Seithin Gringu(Jack Lyzerg) says: ( Amaterasu or Tsukuyomi? )
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (It was okay, I'ld have perfered if you RPed which-NGR NO)
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (Neither plz)

<br><font color=green>*Seithin Gringu(Jack Lyzerg) says: ( Hmph. Youd only be killed and edo'd )
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (U'll have a gates user at ur disposal)
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (T-T)
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) sighed as the Genin bum-rushed him. Bringing the parrallel arm that mimiced Saishi's up he attempted to slap his hand away. If he succeded he would then used his opposite arm, opening his fist into a palm and attempt to fire said palm into the Genin's chest. If he connected it would push the Genin back to the point of stumbling over.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (You'ld end up like Rose lol)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Juu wanna end up like Rose?)
<br><font color=yellow>*Seithin Gringu(Jack Lyzerg) begins to do a string of handseals. He then finishes with a roar. "Katon: Goukakyuu!!" He exclaims as he releases a huge fireball. The gigantic ball of fire would be aimed at hitting the ground in between the many shinobi present. If they don't dodge it would hit them and cause a great amount of damage.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (AND AKAMICHI NUB NEEDS TO GET OUTTA HERE)
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (Wait, so did u like jyuuken paralyze me or something?)
<br><font color=green>*Seithin Gringu(Jack Lyzerg) says: ( If he did. ure fucked )
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (No, I didn't hit any chakra points.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) ran by the mountains, looking for Suzy.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (And it takes more then one palm to paralyze.)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (RPing by the way.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) would quickly jump backwards, landing on his hands he would skid to a stop before the door. Hopefully dodging the fireball, as he would look at the figure wondering just who it was that would attack the Hokage and ninja so boldly.*
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: I learned not to try and be helpful)
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: or i die)
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (I think I should just get hurt by the fireball?)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (I got dis shit.)
<br><font color=green>*Seithin Gringu(Jack Lyzerg) says: ( Evan. Rotation =/= gonna halp. )

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (It's an Ultimate Defense.)
<br><font color=green>*Seithin Gringu(Jack Lyzerg) says: ( Rotation can't loldeflect jutsu )
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (It would technically disperse the fireball)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (It can lolblock.)
<br><font color=green>*Seithin Gringu(Jack Lyzerg) says: ( I never seen it do that x.x )
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (But only if u were in the center of it)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Rahie) says: hmm?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (HOW DIS NGR GUNNA SAY HMM?)
<br><font color=yellow>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) felt his entire arm expertly pushed out of the way, creating an opening in his defense. In the next instant that the palm hit him, his eyes widen from a bit of pain. He instinctively rolled backwards with the momentum of the push, perhaps into the path of the oncoming fireball.*
<br><font color=green>*Shun of the Red Sand(Shun512) says: (Always leaving me in the dark :C)
<br><font color=green>*Seithin Gringu(Jack Lyzerg) says: ( bcuz icly idk you? )
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (Oh, so u gonna keep that D+ fag but not ME?)
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (that's flaw...)
<br><font color=green>*Shun of the Red Sand(Shun512) says: (Fuck that, Jack)
<br><font color=green>*Shun of the Red Sand(Shun512) says: (Attacking you now)
<br><font color=green>*Shun of the Red Sand(Shun512) says: (D+ VS. S BEST FIGHT EVER)
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) cursed as the sphere was launched toward them, pushing his chakra to the soles of his sandles he jumped back in an effort to avoid any damage to himself. Hopeing that the Genin could escape.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) didn't escape*
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (naw, jk)
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (Let's see what mister Hokage does)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Ngr, it also takes awhile to set up the chakra in your throat unless you pre-meditated it.)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Rahie) says: (Done worry his punk ass is done for)
<br><font color=green>*Shun of the Red Sand(Shun512) says: (I cant believe Jack isnt on MSN)
<br><font color=green>*Shun of the Red Sand(Shun512) says: (</3)
<br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Rahie) Flames would engoulf the Hokages body, but before doing that he'd weave 2 hand seals before the fireball came towards him, as he'd burn into ashes or so it would have seemed to the naked eye, as the flames would clearly out his body would lay there burned to a crisp, as his body would poof off into smoke as it appeared to be a clone in the placement of him. Then all of a sudden what appeared from behind the man in the cloaked uniform would be the Hokage, as he'd speak his words before launching his attack "Attacking one of the Kage is one of the last mistakes you'll ever make.". Drawing his Kunai quickly from within his robe he'd attempt to grasp the collar the cloaked man as he'd pull him back, and he'd slide his kunai knive crosswards to the left side of his neck trying to slit his throat.

<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (So, like)
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (Did the fireball own me or not?)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Let Gringu RP)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Rahie) says: (I wonder how many of your bastards are there already)
<br><font color=yellow>*Shun of the Red Sand(Shun512) would land on the inner Konoha gates in front of the infamous Hokage Mansion. He would look around thinking "What a ruckus...A spy like me cant operate in this envoirnment..." He would then unhook a scroll from his back just in case. He then adjusted his mask so that his identity wouldnt be found out.

Shun looked at the cloaked woman with a smirk, He then slid his thumb under his scroll awaiting being found out.*
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Rahie) says: Evan
<br><font color=yellow>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) is pwned by the fireball I guess? I'm not really sure...*
<br><font color=yellow>*Seithin Gringu(Jack Lyzerg) smirks as his skin suddenly darkens around his neck and torso area. "Impervious Armour..." He says as he is totally unaffected by the kunai slash. He spins his body around and faces the Hokage. "Idiot.." He says as he activates the Three tomoe in his Eye. He would immediately attempt to make eye contact with the Hokage.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Inb4 Alister loldips)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Rahie) says: 6 o clock, send a messenger to tell all the villagers to their homes, and get one ninja to stay with each family.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Yeah yeah....Oi Genin let's go...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Sashi you didn't get hit by the way considering the push shoulda knocked you back away from the fire-ball X.x)
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (The fireball is kinda big tho)
<br><font color=green>*Seithin Gringu(Jack Lyzerg) says: ( naw )
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (It was also aimed toward the middle of the group.)
<br><font color=green>*Seithin Gringu(Jack Lyzerg) says: ( if anything Evan would get hit not you )
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (Then nvm)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (And I loljumped.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) notices the red glare in the mans eyes..As he fell to the ground repeating "The....The...The.." He seemed to be scared out of his mind.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) is not hurt and junk now. Omit previous damage RP.*
<br><font color=green>*Shun of the Red Sand(Shun512) says: (Jack is OP'd as fuck)
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Main antagonist)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Rahie) says: (Not only doesh e have Earth Element, but he's Uchiha as well.)
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: of the wipe)
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: J.s)
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) cursed under his breath as the feeling of helplessness overcame him, turning he shot off toward the wall and yelled back "On the double Genin!"*
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Not exactly true Hokage)
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Im just saying)
<br><font color=green>*Shun of the Red Sand(Shun512) says: (Sashi should RP better)
<br><font color=green>*Shun of the Red Sand(Shun512) says: (J/s)
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: And the element is Steel not earth)
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Lrn2naruto)
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: HE could've gained shar using the Chimera tech)
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: J.s)
<br><font color=yellow>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) hesitates a moment, not being from this village. "Should I got with him...?" He thought for a moment. Thinking of the hostile situation, he nodded and tried to run off with Evan.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) le leave.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) notes how everyone left him there.*
<br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Rahie) The Kunai that he had plunged fourth smashed into pieces against the steel body of this cloaked figure as the cloaked man turns foward the Hokage holds up the tiger seal quickly with one hand before he turns around, and then looks dead ahead, as he'd attmepted to reach for the Cloaked Uchiha's throat trying to grasp it with his hand clinching hard trying to choke the cloaked man trying to see what was the reason for this attack?*
