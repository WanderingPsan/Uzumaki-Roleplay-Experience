<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) takes the glass back and simply smiles a bit "You know I'm a Private, I could help you if you want."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) had the stool of the cup shoved into his mouth, he went wide-eyed out of surprise, and he tried to stop himself from laughing. But afterwards without removing the cup she'd hear:

"Gwaive Mwaeh a Kway"* - Sun Oct  4 00:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) blinked as he felt her forcing the cup further in, and immediately one of his hands moved, to reach for her wrist, aiming to apply some pressure in an attempt to tell her to stop. He didn't seem to be enjoying this to much any more, and would a doubt would've probably been on the way to choking.* - Sun Oct  4 00:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) coughed a few times as he tried to refill his throat with oxygen his eyes looked at Keiko, and he wondered what had honestly just happened. His eyes narrowed, but he didn't say anything. He was more confused than mad, but he didn't know how to adequately respond.* - Sun Oct  4 00:39:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) honestly he wasn't sure if he believed that, he'd be an idiot if he did right away, but following his nature. He put on a light smile, as he attempted to wrap an arm around Kastsune's waist and pull her to him, a half hug of sorts.  "It's alright, I should a least be happy you're comfortable enough to play right?"* - Sun Oct  4 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) definately was alarmed, but he wasn't one to show it at least physically, it may show up in his mannerisms later but he wouldn't treat her any differently, for what she did. It wasn't him, But as he noticed how limp she was  "Come on, you were so lively a moment ago." He stated, keeping his arm around her.* - Sun Oct  4 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) simply sighs, he went and made the situation awkward, though it was possibly a combination of them both, but as she moved to get more comfortable at hs side he spoke "Come on talk to me, or I'll start cheering and seriously buy those pom-poms."* - Sun Oct  4 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sun Oct  4 00:54:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) moved to take a stand, as he spoke "Kay', be sure to watch carefully." He stated with a mischievious smile, taking an extra moment before he stood in case she wanted to stop him.* - Sun Oct  4 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) got kicked on his chin,whincing in pain "O-Ow~" He stated lightly,  rubbing his chin after having her foot make contact with it. He was understanding her nature a bit more as he spoke "Whaaaaaat~? I can't hear you.~" He stated, taking a pose as he spoke "Giiivvveeee me a K~"* - Sun Oct  4 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) ||Would've fell to the ground rubbing his chin, before continuing with the action, having found a new way to have fun, even though it hurt him a bit with Katsune.* - Sun Oct  4 01:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) me laughed a bit as he moved to get back on the couch as he spoke" Now I'm happy I made that rule~" He toyed ligthtly, as he laid on the couch horizontally, with his legs dangling over the side, and he attempted to rest his head on Katsune's lap as he spoke "Was my cheering that bad~?"* - Sun Oct  4 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) laughs gently, as he relaxed on her lap he spoke "Softer than expected~" He stated. Clearly aiming to get some sort of reaction out of her, he looked up at her out of his one visible eye, she'd notice his blonde hair hung low and concealed his other eye.* - Sun Oct  4 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) felt her hand rest on his forehead, he blinked a bit, before she pushed his head, so he was facing away from her he sighed a bit relaxed.

"Katsune, you don't have to hide anymore if you don't want to." He stated lightly, looking at the ground between the spacing of her feet.* - Sun Oct  4 01:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: What do you mean....? - Sun Oct  4 01:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) definately was having trouble with this! He was taught to always look at a person when talking to them. It hurt him mentally, he yawned a bit as he spoke:

"You can take your real name back, and not hide in public."* - Sun Oct  4 01:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Sun Oct  4 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) decides to take this moment of weakness, and turns to look back up at her as he spoke "You should smile more often, It suits you." He commented, lightly, enjoying the comfort of her lap.* - Sun Oct  4 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) takes a quick look at Katsune from where he lay, as he spoke "The real you is always a sight for sore eyes." He laughed gently, it had been a week or more since he had seen Katsune in her original form, he had almost forgotten what she looked like:

"So what's the deal with the body suit~? Fashion statement?"* - Sun Oct  4 01:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm. - Sun Oct  4 01:19:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) blinks as he spoke "Back to my corner Eh?" He joked closing his eyes as he spoke "None the less, I do enjoy the design. Is it custom made?"* - Sun Oct  4 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked back up at Katsune for a moment as he spoke "Have you ever been fishnig?" He asked lightly.* - Sun Oct  4 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Mm.... - Sun Oct  4 01:31:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) sits up as he spoke "Let's switch, sit on my lap~" He spoke in a teasing-like manner "I've heard of jutsu that allow people to swim underground, But for miles? That's amazing, you must have a talent with it."* - Sun Oct  4 01:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) gasped a bit definately not expecting her to sit square on his lap, and wiggle into place. Causing him to gasp once more, as he developed a faint blush struggling to remain in control as he spoke "I see, You might have exceptionally high reserves then. Either way it sounds like a valuable technique to have in battle."* - Sun Oct  4 01:45:23 2015
