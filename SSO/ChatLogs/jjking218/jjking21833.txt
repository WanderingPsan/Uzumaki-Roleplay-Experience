<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) blinked surprised she trusted him so easily, but he nodded his head, extending his hand, he placed his thumb upon the base of her tongue. His chakra flared, and moments later, a small black seal appeared, resembling that of a dragon. It would prevent her from disclosing the events regarding this cave, or Kohaku or anything pertaining to Seisuke to anyone besides himself. She wouldn't even be able to write or signal it. "Done."* - Wed Sep 30 19:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) scratched his chin "I suppose you're right." He stated, offering her a few of the scrolls. "You'd better come through, I'm looking forward to that hug and kiss." He joked.* - Wed Sep 30 19:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) blinked as he felt her arms wrap around his body, before he felt her lips bought to his own. His eyes widened, and he was greeted with a reddening of his cheeks, obviously in disbelief. It was a sensation he wasn't anticipating to come from Kirie, especially considering their path.  He had also thought she would disregard his comments as before.* - Wed Sep 30 19:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked at her for a moment, his eyes looking at her own, before his gaze was averted subtly. "U-Um, Y-Yeah...Here." He stated lightly. Offering them to her.* - Wed Sep 30 20:00:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) had decided to wait for Katsune and as such he took a seat against one of the houses, waiting for her to find him. He wasn't hiding in any way.* - Wed Sep 30 20:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked at the woman as she climbed from the ground, he was relaxing  pretty comfortably, as he rose to a sitting position. He patted the wall beside himself, as if telling her to sit, he examined the dirt which coated her clothing buy didn't seem to mind as he spoke "Hello there." Offering a gentle smile as he looked at her. It was his own, signature smile, one that wasn't easily broken.

He took notice of her frown, but like before didn't comment upon it.* - Wed Sep 30 20:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sitting beside you.... - Wed Sep 30 20:35:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked at her gently, as he relaxed subtly, seemingly having a lot of faith in the woman, as he took notice of her position, with a single glance, he looked at her from head to toe, taking in her shoes, current attire, and any thing out of the ordinary that he'd notice with her appearance. But he spoke "I told you, I consider you a friend. But I'm fine if you don't consider me the same." He stated lightly, his hands resting at his sides.* - Wed Sep 30 20:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm only comfortable telling you about the bounty because. . . - Wed Sep 30 20:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're surely so rich it won't matter to you. - Wed Sep 30 20:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I also think the bounty is a lie. - Wed Sep 30 20:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: A bluff. - Wed Sep 30 20:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) released a yawn not out of boredom, nor out of a lack of interest, but it was simply a natural occurence. Even going as far as to cover his mouth, but he listened to Katsune after taking in the sight of her jumpsuit, he partially wondered what made her decide to wear that. He assumed it was for mobility's sake. But he didn't say much about it and continued to listen to her words, before he himself replied:

"I'm glad to hear you consider me a friend. But for all intents and purposes, I consider a friend someone who wouldn't attack me, and that applies for me onto others." He paused a bit.

Before he took a deep breath. "The bounty is most likely a bluff, and I didn't place it myself, I am also the only gezo offifical in the land of Shinobi currently, So Most likely it's just a bluff."* - Wed Sep 30 20:49:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: We go our seperate ways. - Wed Sep 30 22:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: And plot the next hunt. - Wed Sep 30 22:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: If you want that's. - Wed Sep 30 22:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Lets plot the next hunt. - Wed Sep 30 22:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Want some tea? - Wed Sep 30 22:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: My treat - Wed Sep 30 22:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'd love to. - Wed Sep 30 22:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: But I have to handle some business. - Wed Sep 30 22:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Later tonight? - Wed Sep 30 22:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Sick.. - Wed Sep 30 22:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Very well. - Wed Sep 30 22:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: I shall return to the village. - Wed Sep 30 22:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) vanishes.* - Wed Sep 30 22:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Looking nice there, Katsune. - Wed Sep 30 22:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmmm. - Wed Sep 30 22:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) turned his back and the women gestured for Katsune to come over Seisuke began to explain "It's a simple thing, the Chemicals, will act as a detox for the oils in your body, the ones that compose your scent, and the works, as well as any dirt or build up---On the bright side you'll be blemish free. They're completely harmless, After we have you bath in that, we'll have you take a cold shower, which will close your pores. Then we'll apply another scent on you, well one that will overpower any lingering one." He explained.

The water itself was a amber like color, and smelled strongly of vinegar. Seisuke even went as far as to sit on the ground facing the house, he had no intention of peeking, and the female began to pull gloves onto her hands.* - Wed Sep 30 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) contemplated  wht she asked "It'll work yes, It is impossible to completely change someone's scent, since that's something pre-determined by their DNA, but this will act as a wall which would make it impossible to track you." He stated lightly waiting for her to respond. "All it's doing, is taking out the chemicals and dirt which had accumulated in your body, honestly, by just doing that your scent would be unrecognizable, simply because all the Chemicals, Deodarant, perfume and everything else, are stored in your body as excess oils. All tamper with your scent, we're just undoing years of accumulation."* - Wed Sep 30 22:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. . . - Wed Sep 30 22:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. Makes sense I guess. - Wed Sep 30 22:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) would slowly look towards the wall before him as he spoke "So How've you been save for this?" He asked. The weird woman, stepped forward, and began practically scrubbing Katsune's arms and legs,  between her fingers, her finger tips, her feet, between her toes. Everything no holds barred, it may've gotten a little awkward but no touch had any hidden agenda, she was strictly business and it seemed Seisuke had paid her a lot not to ask any questions. 

Katsune would notice the longer she stayed in the water it began growing almost murky, and her skin would begin tingling, but at the same time, she'd have that clean and refreshed feeling. The woman also proceeded to wash her hair and back. And everywhere in between. After she was done, she'd attempt to guide Katsune out of the tub offering her a hand.* - Wed Sep 30 22:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) didn't look for a moment, if anything he did have his manners, and remained looking at the wall as he spoke "I see, I met Zetsumo's kid, he seems pretty broken, Do you know anything of that?" He asked, his eyes never leaving the wall, until Katsune gave him the okay, he didn't want to intrude upon her personal space? But regardless as she bathed, Seisuke had received a bird with her and Kilm's new identity, authenticated papers and all, she was now "Keiko" For all intents and purposes. But he'd wait for her to give him the okay before he said anything.* - Wed Sep 30 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Wed Sep 30 22:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I'm dressed. - Wed Sep 30 22:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: As for Suitengo. . . - Wed Sep 30 22:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I wanted to give him and Zenaki a new home. - Wed Sep 30 22:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Wanted to make sure they were happy for once in their lives. - Wed Sep 30 22:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Suitengo used to be beaten, among other things. Zetsumo was trying to turn him into an unstoppable monster. - Wed Sep 30 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Zenaki...she's being used as a slave. - Wed Sep 30 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Fujitora's slave. - Wed Sep 30 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Unfortunately I may not be able to kill him now and get her to a safe place. - Wed Sep 30 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) contemplated what she had said for a moment, and he did then decide to turn taking a look at her new attire, before he spoke "I see, But, If you kill Fujitora, You also create another monster of his daughter." He stated lightly, as he stood before smiling lightly as he spoke "You look wonderful." He stated holding his hands behind his back "I got you a present."* - Wed Sep 30 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Wed Sep 30 22:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) smiled a bit, before his hands suddenly move from behind his back revealing documentation under the name "Hibakusha, Keiko." He smiled warmly, as he offered them to her.* - Wed Sep 30 22:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) thinks: Don't care what happens to that man's daughter. I -owe- Zenaki, - Wed Sep 30 22:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) caught the smile on her face, and perhaps this was the first time he had seen Katsun---Keiko ever smile, and it was warming in a way. The papers told everything that would be found on normal travel papers, from Date of birth which was made to coincide with what he assumed she was which was around Fifteen or so, maybe a year younger than she actually was, Place of Birth Blood type, and much more information, which was authenticated by a seal. 

"Is everything to your liking?* - Wed Sep 30 22:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Wed Sep 30 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked at her and extended his hand to her, wondering if she'd take it and shake it as he intended. His smile was genuine as he simply spoke "If you need anything, at all. You know how to reach me." He stated lightly, his blonde hair hanging low over his face, his light blue eyes focusing on her contacts.* - Wed Sep 30 22:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: You know. . . - Wed Sep 30 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: And only because you've helped me - Wed Sep 30 22:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) thinks: Need to dye my gauntlets after this. Fuck having to deal with shit-faced grin hand-shakers. - Wed Sep 30 23:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) smiled briefly as he looked into her eyes, seemingly undeterred by her words, as he spoke "This may be the last time, you shake it. But I will continue offering it, as a testament to my trust." He stated lightly, seemingly believing every word he had just said. Feeling her hand against his own, he tightened his grip lightly shaking her hand in his own as he held her hand there for a moment.

"Like I said, If you need help just ask me. If someone comes after you just tell me."* - Wed Sep 30 23:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: More valuable than a few million yen that someone might pay you to kill me, that's for sure. - Wed Sep 30 23:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) laughed a bit, as he spoke "I'm also not to shabby in a fight. Although I pride myself on avoiding one, if possible." He stated with a light laugh, as he looked at her, before he spoek "But just stay safe, until everything blows over. I'd reccomend Sunagakure, a friend of mine is the Kazekage. Tell him I sent you, and you'll be fine. But that's optional, He'd probably be willing to train you if you take the time to get to know him." He stated lightly nodding his head.* - Wed Sep 30 23:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm. Sunagakure. - Wed Sep 30 23:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Who's the friend? - Wed Sep 30 23:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Sergeant Muhhamed Hassan. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. He'd not recognize my ace. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: face* - Wed Sep 30 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Heard Fujitora's there...but I've also heard he's in Kirigakure. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Fujitora -might- recognize me. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: He's in Kirigakure. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Erebus gave me enemies I never should've had. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I'll try Sunagakure. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I'll have to be careful anyway, but yeah. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Stay save. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: safe* - Wed Sep 30 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. You too. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'll see you later then. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Maybe we can have that drink you owe me then. - Wed Sep 30 23:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Wed Sep 30 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: Ready to go for tea? - Wed Sep 30 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Ah. - Wed Sep 30 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Yeah. - Wed Sep 30 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: That. - Wed Sep 30 23:19:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: *nod* - Wed Sep 30 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) entered her home, looking around, and picking up on any scents which may've been present, just the freshness or her house or something else. But as he entered he commented "Nice place." He'd state, as he saw the tanto thrown towards him, he raised a single hand to catch it by the sheath, not desiring to touch the hilt before it was sealed away. Before he found a seat on her couch if there was one, a bit nervous to be in her house, but he tried to relax the best he could.* - Wed Sep 30 23:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked at her neckless and coincidentally her breasts, and his eyes were averted slightly,  relaxing lightly or attempting to as he heard the kettle's whistle, he carefully heard Kirie's words, and closed his eyes momentarily as he spoke "White eyes...? I suppose that's possible." He stated lightly, he also wasn't sure how many were left, but he figured it'd be easy to find out.* - Wed Sep 30 23:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked at the tea as it was set down before him, and nodded his head "Thank you." He stated lightly, before picking up the glass with a few subtle blows, he raised it to his lips, tilting it back, he took a sip from it before setting it down on the table, as he spoke "I'm sure they'd be able to, I have the ability to remove eyes without damaging them. Training with Koeki has netted me that much." He stated laughing gently, as he looked at her necklace "A family heirloom?" He asked curiously.* - Thu Oct  1 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) smiled lightly as he spoke "It's beautiful, and it suits you." He stated genuinely as he raised his glass to his lips, taking another sip. As he sat on the couch, he looked around her place briefly, not to pry just to get a general feel of his surroundings. But besides that he seemed pretty calm, or gradually relaxing, he asked "Why are you hunting those with doujutsu?" He was genuinely curious as to what her response would be.* - Thu Oct  1 00:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Why?  - Thu Oct  1 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'm just curious. - Thu Oct  1 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: At first I did not seem to be interested by them as I had never seen them in person. - Thu Oct  1 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: But when Kohaku flashed her red eyes at me I became interested. - Thu Oct  1 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: I have a curiosity as to what they can do. - Thu Oct  1 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: And like I said before I know they do something or else Kirigakure would not have hunted those people down. - Thu Oct  1 00:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I see. - Thu Oct  1 00:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Yeah. - Thu Oct  1 00:35:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: But this would count as doing something. - Thu Oct  1 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: I guess. - Thu Oct  1 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Of course. - Thu Oct  1 00:37:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: I am not strong enough to do that. - Thu Oct  1 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Nor it would be wise really. - Thu Oct  1 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: I act on whatever can help me live the longest. - Thu Oct  1 00:38:24 2015
