<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked at her and was happy she was trying, he made sure to maintain a steady grasp on her hands wincing only slightly when she grabbed his hands harder, but he held onto her, as he spoke "That's good, steady. "It was hard not to stare at her body, since this was a pretty unique scene, and she was naked, he blushed subtly but tried to focus. Acting as a support to keep her anchored as he spoke "Once you get the hang of it, we'll practice wading."* - Fri Sep 25 13:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked down to her as he spoke "How do you feel Lera?" He asked her grip loosened allowing some blood to return to circulation.  He wondered why she had been so quiet, and part of him wondered if she was mad at him, he definately didn't want that.* - Fri Sep 25 13:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) blinked as she spoke about being cold he heard the tension in her voice, he wondered if it was much more than that. But slowly he nodded his head, as he aimed to guide her onto his back and swim to shore. He figured he could at least help her preserve some energy. As he got to shore assuming she was on his back still, he'd lay her down upon the shore attempting to get their clothes.* - Fri Sep 25 14:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) felt her clinging onto him, as he tilted his head to the side, attempting to view her out of the side of his eye. "L-Lera, what's wrong?" He asked lightly, as he stood in place, his full attention was on her, he hoped he didn't push her to far, or that it was nothing to serious.* - Fri Sep 25 14:09:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) blinked as she bursted out into tears, he looked at the ground, it seems he had pushed her too far. "Lera...I...It happens, But I wouldn't have let any harm come to you....But I shouldn't have pushed you so....So far....I'm Sorry." He stated with a bit of annoyance at himself, why was he so foolish?  He couldn't believe his own stupidity. He silently cursed himself, for making Lera cry that was the one thing he swore he'd never do.* - Fri Sep 25 14:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) shook his head as he stared at the ground between his feet "It's....My fault...I was stupid." He couldn't believe that thought never crossed his mind, and the signs were---So obvious. He messed up "L...Lets get you dressed...Don't want you getting sick." He stated, not caring that she held onto him, he'd need to make this up to her somehow.* - Fri Sep 25 14:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) turned to face her as he stepped closer attempting to wrap his arms around her and hug her tightly as he spoke "Lera, you can show me when you're afraid, I'll be your stability, I'll always be there for you...You don't have to be scared." He looked into his eyes, and it seemed like he meant every word of what he said.* - Fri Sep 25 14:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) in hindsight probably did sound like he was quoting some Soap Opera, but the good intention was still there! After she pulled back and gave him a kiss he spoke "I'll make it up to you somehow."* - Fri Sep 25 14:28:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) blinked as he observed the clones,  a bit stunned he had only seen this technique in use once, and as such he found it...Definately amazing up close, as he approached one of the clones, he even aimed to place a hand on it's shoulder seeing it maintained a physical substance, "Wow, That's pretty cool." He stated lightly genuinely interested in this technique.

"Did Muhhamed-san teach you this?"* - Fri Sep 25 19:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nope. Setsuna taught me. - Fri Sep 25 19:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Maybe i should teach Hassan sensei though... - Fri Sep 25 19:47:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm~ - Fri Sep 25 19:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a deep breath and sighed, he found Lera's technique to be truly interesting, and he wondered how he could get this done the most efficient way, eventually he decided to just go at it. He recalled the seal she had formed, and found it unique, he briefly recalled the woman named as Setsuna, he wondered where he had met her but he could quite place his thumb upon it, and it seemed Lera was working quite hard which was good. He always enjoyed the sight of her training.

She worked so hard and he envied her work ethic, but he had to train for himself as well, so cracking his knuckles he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, as he raised his hands to chest level, he had decided to simply begin practicing the action of completing the seal, it definately was repititious, but even so he continued to try his best not desiring to dissapoint Lera, he was happy she gave him an indepth analysis of the technique.

Somehow he felt like it made it make more sense to him, when he understood the basis of the technique and it's drawbacks, he felt like he could draw out it's true potential,  maybe even work on combination techniques, he knew he certainly had great reserves, but he wondered if this technique would be taxing on more than simply his chakra reserves, he'd probably need to improve his stamina as well.

Inhaling through his nose he exhaled through his mouth, he figured this would be a fairly interesting exercise, so he continued to work with the seals he was learning. He needed to get them down pact before he simply moved onto the next part of the technique, the seal would probably be the most annoying thing to master because it was so simple, but even so he tried at it, yawning briefly, he focused.

Concentrating on the jutsu, as he made the seal, before attempting to gather his chakra, but not doing much more than that, he realised he felt an imbalance of sorts in his chakra system, so he relaxed. Before repeating the process, doing steps one and two in unison but not going further as he aimed to master the use of the steps in conjunction, he was definately taking his time with this technique which was fine.

After a few moments, he had decided it was time to give it a go his hands being raised to chest level he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, as he weaved the single seal before gathering his chakra. Beginning to mould it he focused on that of another person, attempting to send his chakra outwards, there was a puff of smoke beside him and a small dwarfish version of himself appeared.

He smiled to himself, cracking his knuckles, as he looked  around before dismissing the clone, and he repeated the process once again, inhaling followed by a deep exhale, as his hands were raised to chest level. His chakra gathered before being sent outwards, causing a explosion of smoke beside him, a single clone which was a perfect replica of his person stood beside him. "I think I got it Lera-sensei~"* - Fri Sep 25 19:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) slowly sat upon the ground as he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, slowly he unsealed a small scroll from his pouch, which he then proceeded to unravel, laying it atop of his lap, he cracked his knuckles subtly before he had decided it was time for him to read this was a B ranked Technique known as Fire Style: Fire Ash Burning. He decided it would be an invaluable technique to learn so as he opened the scroll his finger found the first line of text.

"The user spews a stream of chakra infused gun-powder from their mouth, which surrounds the region. As the gunpowder is composed entirely of ash, it stays in the air around the victim like a cloud, which can be used like a smokescreen." After reading the first part of the scroll he nodded his head finding it quite interesting. Before he cracked his knuckles.

Finding his place once again in the scroll he continued reading what was listed." After surrounding the enemy with the ash, the user can ignite it with a flint placed on their teeth beforehand to create a spark, resulting in a violent explosion, burning the enemy. " After he finished that bit he decided to begin to take a look at the handseals.

He inhaled followed by a deep exhale, as he looked forward, crouching he stared out over the water, before his hands were raised to chest level, and he began to slowly practice the handseals in the scroll, taking his time, he took his time with each individual seal, making sure it was perfect before moving onto the next one.

He took care to practice the intervals between the transition aiming to make it smooth and logical he hoped that, that practice would make a difference in the long run, he yawned subtly as he focused  on his seals, focusing on speed as well as precision he didn't want to lack either and mess up the technique or get messed up before he could execute the seal.

So with a deep breath he exhaled, blowing the air from his lungs into the area around them before his hands were raised and he completed the handseals for the jutsu before inhaling and exhaling, a black fume was released from his pursed lips, gathering into that of a fine powder. Before he ignited it with a bit of his chakra.

Causing an explosion. He smiled subtly "That was...Easy." He stated, with a gentle laugh, as he turned and noticed Lera,  finishing up what seemed to be the first portion of her training, he opened a bottle of water, before walking over to her and offering it to her "Here drink up~."* - Fri Sep 25 20:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) would slowly reach into his back pocket, before he pulled a small scroll holding it out towards Lera along witha  bottle of water, he wiped a bead of sweat from his brow taking a seat.* - Fri Sep 25 20:15:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a seat beside Lera on the ground , as he patted his lap seemingly wanting to hug her tightly as they sat. Maybe just harrass her,  but leaving the choice ultimately up to her "Why don't you join me then~?" He offered lightly.* - Fri Sep 25 20:29:39 2015
