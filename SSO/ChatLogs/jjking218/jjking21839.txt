<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a deep breath the moment  he felt the shadow weakening his hand shot forward aiming to grab the hilt of Samehade, at the same time, he probably would've noticed the giant hands aiming to grasp the blade themselves., and as such his hand was extended aimed at where Suitengu was prior. A large accumulation of chakra was gathered, before released aiming to blast the male directly in his face. With the attempt to free the blade.* - Tue Oct  6 23:11:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) with his hand still on the hilt of Samehade, he'd leap into the air doing a handstand on the hilt of the blade, as chakra gathered into his  leg, he was glad he had such great hearing, chakra began to almost vibrate around his leg, before his leg was shot forward at Suitengu's tendrils, aiming to slice through them with a single kick.  He was enjoying this game of tug of war, definately the most interesting thing he's done in a while.* - Tue Oct  6 23:18:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a deep breath, his ears alerting him to the multi-side attack, and as such his chakra once again surged to his leg, as he began to shift his grip, while moving in a circular fashion, his leg shooting around in a circle, aiming to slice the threads as they approached, after every half rotation, his hands switched place atop of the hilt, though this tactic -would-, give Suitengu a bit of lee-way, causing the blade to shift more towards his side as he attempted this.* - Tue Oct  6 23:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) finally stopped his motions as it seemed like the threads had stopped momentarily, as his hand extended towards the conjunction of threads and mechanical arms, before he shot it forward, aiming to side-swipe Samehade, a ball of wind appearing at the base of his hand, that aimed to carve into the table below it, and due to an outside momentum, send samehade flying towards the table over Heiwa's head.* - Tue Oct  6 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) slowly made a single handseal, as his chakra flared out around the room, effectively placing a barrier around the room. Which would allow him to sense for movement, since Samehade no doubt hit the wall and probably bounced forward,  and at the pace they were moving, this would allow him to reach for the blade, and as  he kicked off the table,  a single blast of wind was shot from his hand, towards Suitengu's body aiming to knock him off course, it was playful and he held back not aiming to actually hurt the male.* - Tue Oct  6 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) blinked as he saw the sudden movement through his 'third eye'. Though he had just enough time to react, his hand grabbing the table, and pushing off to the side, skidding in the space between Hideki and Heiwa, just narrowly avoiing that attack. Thank god for his reflexes,  he assumed Suitengu was getting serious now. And as such his hands were slammed together, releasing a gale wind, attempting to once again blow the male off course.  As his hand was extended to grasp for the hilt of his blade once again.* - Tue Oct  6 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) blinked as he noticed Heiwa still beneath the table, and Suitengu still lashing out violently. Does he let the kid die? And go for the blade? Could he live with himself if he did that? Could he ever see Lera again, would she respect his decision to abandon the kid? He knew she wouldn't, but as the threads approached  Heiwa, the Jounin slid beneath the table, attempting to shield Heiwa with his body, It was what he could do, as a final Requiem for Ushinawa.

A thanks for what he did for him, a debt he could never repay, but who knew, maybe he'd survive after all, I mean, what are the chances, he'd  get impaled, That only happened in movies.* - Wed Oct  7 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) felt the threads piercing through his body, causing him to gasp out in agonizing pain, his heart skipped a beat. It had possibly been the most pain the male had felt to date, and he looked at Heiwa, finally opening his eye revealing the Scarlet Tomoe, the cursed eye of Heiwa's father. Illuminated the Mist, as it looked towards the son of it's original owner. The tomoe's light seemed strong...And vibrant, as a Requiem to Ushinawa's will.

Seisuke's hand lazily fell to his hip, more appropriately, the side of his belt buckle which held a small seal. And with a small portion of his chakra, something was unsealed. Dropping before Heiwa, as the male was bought from beneath the table, being held before, Suitengu, his eye was almost dull at this point. A small portion of blood leaked from his lips, as he looked down at Suitengu.

Gasping out in agonizing pain as his joints were penetrated, but deep in this moment, he felt pity, not for himself...But for Suitengu no matter how he looked at it...He was following in the steps of his father, a child forced to fight, kill...But even in this pity, and pain. Seisuke found himself, releasing a pained and sorrowful chuckle, as he simply stated: 

"History has repeated itself, You....Definately are...Your father's child." The male spoke in a low tone, through pained groans, he was feeling light headed, as he looked at Suitengu. Before he closed his eyes and prepared for what was to come.* - Wed Oct  7 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) felt the spikes inching their way further into his body, causing him to gasp out in pain once again, but this was a pain...A pain of finalty, Sorrow, Unfinished business. So when the threads finally latched around his heart he felt the pain, the suffocation, the slow beat of his heart in the envelope of the threads as he thought to himself.."So this...Is death?" with his eyes closed. He felt that life force..His soul, being snuffed out like a flame.

A single tear was shed from his eye, rolling down his face, before falling off the epicenter of his chin, striking the ground. The small droplet of water seemed to resonate, the sound seemingly louder than ever, his life, was like that drop of water, it started off slow, but when it found something to do...When it fell from the cloud, it was but an instant, when it picked up speed that when it saw it's destination..

It had already crashed against the pavement below, and in his final moments, he found himself, wishing that life wasn't this cruel...That he hadn't formed any bonds, this way no one would be hurt, had he not went to Kirigakure, he would've never fallen in love, he would've never learned to...'Enjoy the little things in life'. He wouldn't be here, and he wouldn't be dying, But even in the wake of this revelation. If he was asked "If given the chance...Would he do it all the same way?" He'd give them a resolved "I would." He enjoyed the little things, he enjoyed Humanity, and in this moment. He found out:

What the Gezo feared.

But it was to late, all he could do is pass on his resolve to the next Generation, his memories, his bonds, his adventures. So as his heard was ripped from his chest. He simply mouthed the words:

"Lera...I really...Enjoyed the little things, and the time...I've spent with you on this earth." 

The second half was cut off, and blown off into the wind, his voice dissappeared and his final thought was of the one he loved. "I love you."* - Wed Oct  7 00:45:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) if this was an anime his eyes would've sparkled at this opportunity to escape this horrible place. As he spoke "I feel terrible...For bumping into you, I wasn't paying attention but...I could help you out with whatever work you may need done, even be a Butler of sorts---But I'm sure...You have enough of those, I could maybe help as a body guard if your job calls for it...Or anything in between.." He suggested hoping something he said appealed to her.* - Wed Oct  7 04:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hikensha, Takumi(Nexus 420) thinks: I'm pretty sure I come from the same place as she does.  - Wed Oct  7 04:54:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) rubbed his head as he spoke "I possess a unique fighting style that I've learned from my ancestors---I'm eager to serve because as you said. It is a great honor to be of service to such a beautiful woman as yourself." He stated, bowing his head lightly to her, as he looked up gently  "I assure you, I can defend in a fight, don't let my size fool you."* - Wed Oct  7 04:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) nodded his head as he spoke "Where at...?" He asked looking at her wondering if he was to demonstrate in the middle of the pathway, he watched her carefully, he figured if this was his only way out of this place, he'd make sure to do his best, even if it meant surving some randomn woman.* - Wed Oct  7 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) nodded his head as he was taking to a more secluded area, and slowly he took a deep breath, his hands were raised at chest level, as he felt like he was beginning to focus his body. Before eventually he lowered himself into a relaxed stance, his muscles seemed to be relaxed. And so did his expression, as he acted as if there  was an invisible enemy before him, and slowly but surely chakra gathered around his hands, and he inhaled. Before witha  sudden spurt of speed----

Definately a lot faster than most would expect, he sent a high jumping kick towards the imaginary enemy, before his body elegantly regrouped with the ground, he went into a leg sweep. He proceeded,  to show several different combos, which seemed to flow, each movement each transition was fluent. And the chakra upon his hands, seemed nearly masterful.

It gave the impression if he striked rock, he'd without a doubt be able to make a sizable dent in it. After a few moments, and a few more displays of techniques and power, he released the chakra on his hands. "H-How'd I do?"* - Wed Oct  7 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) scratched his chin as she spoke and ultimately he looked at her and spoke "I rely on my speed, and Ninjutsu to get through an opponent in the least amount of time, but most people would think this tactic means I have a low amount of stamina, But I'm proud to say I have a lot of stamina, so I can last for a while." He admited with a light smile, as he looked at Asteroth, part of him wondered what he was potentially getting himself into. She'd probably notice how much of an abundance of chakra he had.* - Wed Oct  7 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) approached Asteroth once again "H-Hello Asteroth-san." He stated, as he approached the woman, though keeping a moderate distance for personal space reasons.* - Wed Oct  7 11:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) bows his head apologeticaly. "I-I'm sorry, Didn't mean to sneak up on you." He stated. Before his head was raised he looked up to Asteroth as he spoke "S-So how've you been?"* - Wed Oct  7 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) raised a single finger to the side of his cheek scratching out of emabrrassment, listening to her complaints, and honestly if he hadn't already figured it out. He had a feeling she was one of those entitled girls,  but he spoke "Y-Yes Free of ch---" He paused hearing the next part, which caused his eyes to be averted to the side out of slight embarrassment. "Y-Yes, I-It's much more than I-I could ever ask for." Under normal means, he doubted a girl would talk to him anyway.* - Wed Oct  7 12:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) blinked as she moved past him, turning he noticed how her arms met behind her backs, and the gentle gait of her hips, which caused him to develop a faint blush. And as such his eyes once again drifted away, but her remark did catch him off guard. "H-Huh? Agenda? N-Nothing, I'm All yours---I mean...I-I'm here to help you t-that is my plan." He realised how stupid that sounded and he silently cursed himself. "W-Why would you say something so cheesy?" He asked himself. He was definately flustered.* - Wed Oct  7 12:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) did in fact follow behind her keeping a steady pace, and distance, as to not intrude in her personal space. He listened to her words, looking around he examined the village around him, and since he had lived here practically his entire life, he didn't see it the same way, not that he'd care to state his views. But as they entered the restaurant, for a moment he sped past her in order to grab one of the chairs, and pull it out for her to sit. 

"M-My t-treat?" He asked a bit surprised with the command rather than the question.

But he nodded his head "I-I'd be honored."* - Wed Oct  7 12:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) looked at her as she reached for her handkercheif, looking at it as he showed obvious hesitation. "Why..Am I doing this again?" He thought to himself, she was obviously beautiful but..He tried to push the thought from his head, as he took a knee beside her chair, and slowly begins wiping it down, taking care. He finished wiping it down, in record time before standing allowing her to sit and once she did he prepared to push the chair in for her. 

Was he doing anymore than playing the part of a loyal slave? He wasn't sure, but as she seemed to forget his name, a sparkle of annoyance graced his eye for a moment, before it was immediately snuffed out "C-Cypher."* - Wed Oct  7 12:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) felt her hand pat his head and he looked towards her, and slowly his hands find the shoulder of the chair gently pushing her in. Before he heard her snap, and decided it was for the waiters and waitresses, as he took a seat on the seat across from her, and listened to her words, "B-Binds me to you?" He asked. Looking at her for a moment before his gaze was averted as he spoke "I...I'm not sure, to be honest. B-But I said I-I'd do something, S-So I'll stick by my word..." 

He paused looking at the table before him, before he mumbled "It's a p-plus, the  o-one I'm helping i-is beautiful." He muttered lightly.

Before shaking his head, as he realised he had said that aloud, that which had been meant to be a thought, but when he noticed the workers saying such harsh things about her, he found himself growing...Irritated.  As he looked towards one of the waiters, motioning for the male to come over, though he did give him a look that stated irritation, and that if he didn't come it'd be...Somewhat unbenficial to his health. 

But as he awaited for the male to make a life's decision, his gaze shyly returned to Asteroth.* - Wed Oct  7 13:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) blinked and his blush became a bit more pronounced in response to her words, he felt his heart sink a bit when she commented on his age, and his gaze found the ground for  a moment. A saddened expression graced his face, for all of a moment, but even within that saddened look, there was a bit of excitement, having believed in her words, and potentially giving him the feeling of 'hope'. He looked at the waitor before he scratched his chin.

He honestly wasn't expecting to be put on the spot, but he wanted to impress Asteroth somehow, even though he knew he had no chance, but he gazed at the menu, studying hard. He was looking for what was the most expensive item on the menu before finally his eyes found the two most expensive things on the menu. And when he saw the prices, his heart stopped working.

"I-I...I-I'd like to order...The.....Ma-Masa To-Toro....and t-the W-Wagyu Beef Dish." If she looked hard enough she could see the gears turning in his head as he ran the prices,  it would no doubt put a hefty dent in his wallet.* - Wed Oct  7 13:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) thinks: If...If only I was...a Bit older... - Wed Oct  7 13:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) visibly pouted for a moment at her comment, as he stared at the table, before he caught wind of the employee's words. And the Gezo that was shot towards the employee, was clearly a threat against his life if he was to try anything of the sort, but his eyes shifted to Asteroth once again, as he spoke "I-I was thinking maybe the W-Wagyu---But d-do you prefer F-Fish or Beef dishes?" He asked looking up to her, before hearing the second half of her sentence.

"U-Um...I-I suppose...I-If you're willing to tell."* - Wed Oct  7 13:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) looked at her as she thought, a unique expression he thought to himself, before he watched as she leaned forward,  causing him to sit back out of embarrassment his posture seemed to straighten up as she spoke and when she spoke of beaches the possibility of seeing her in a swimsuit was one of the first thoughts that came to mind, but he felt as if he understood the jist of what it was she was saying.  Falling prey to the batting of the eyelashes---Such a devious tactic.

He nodded his head "I-I'd b-be honored t-to." He stated lightly, seemingly eager to help her.* - Wed Oct  7 13:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) scratched his cheek lightly, admiring her smile as he spoke "I-I'm not sure...W-What all there's to tell, I've b-been training with m-my Grandfather since I-I was a kid....I enjoy going f-for jogs, and swimming..." He stated lightly before he looked to her as he spoke "Is...Is there anything you'd like to know s-specifically?" He knew there probably wasn't much but he figured he'd see if on the off chance she had any questions.* - Wed Oct  7 13:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) honestly had no clue what Masa Tora nor Cavier was, so as he looked at it, he wondered what it was picking around with his chopsticks as he heard Asteroth speak "U-Um, Besides Running a-and swimming, I suppose I-I enjoy being around people...I-I don't really.. have m-many things I dislike..I...feel neutral about a lot of stuff. I'm not sure what..makes me tick, I haven't gotten pushed to that point yet." He admitted as he added "But, I don't like when p-people, insult those I know."* - Wed Oct  7 13:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) would blink at her reaction, as he noticed her reaction as he spoke "H-Here, have m-mine then..I haven't t-touched it yet." He stated, offering to push his plate forward, "I-I'm sorry, I thought y-you might've liked it." He stated, sighing, it seemed he was messing up all over the place.

"N-Nothing else I can think of."* - Wed Oct  7 14:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) sighs a bit as he spoke "I'll make this up to you anyway I can, when you think of something let me know...I'm really sorry Asteroth-san."* - Wed Oct  7 15:05:23 2015

Relaxing his muscles, before his light blue eyes focused on Hideki, he lowered himself into a relaxed stance. His body seemed a lot less tense in this moment, as he stared at Hideki, he waited for the girl to get her attack in. He was simply shifting his weight from side to side, but the moment she threw her punch.

He seemed to vanish from his position, at least to those with slower vision, he appeared beside Hideki, with a pivot of his foot, he was launched into the air, sending his leg around in an arcing fashion in an attempt to land a kick against the side of Hideki's head.* - Wed Oct  7 23:01:32 2015

Before chakra gathered onto his hands, causing a veil of wind to coat them, which seemed to be spiraling around fiercly. Approaching Hideki, he sent his fist forward, aimed at the male's chest.

The male seemed to be extremely focused and somewhat natural speed, his movements were fluid and so was his stance.* - Wed Oct  7 23:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) wasn't quite done, and he took brief  notice of Hideki's movements, and as such he decided to get a bit adventurous, as he approached the male, the chakra still very much on his hands, he swung his hand horizontally aimed at his chest. With his hand being pulled back, chakra immediately transfered to that of his left leg, which was sent diagnolly aimed from his left hip.* - Wed Oct  7 23:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) was quite easily binded as the snake wrapped around him he focused somewhat losing concentration, and effectively snapping him out of this spar.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) scratched his head subtly as he felt Hideki's hand on his head,  "I see...Well thank you for sparing with me. Hideki-sensei."

But he looked at the two figures who had just approached, he waved subtly. "Hey there."* - Thu Oct  8 00:16:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) caught the bottle of water before he spoke "Thanks Old Man." He pushed the bottle into his pocket, before he gave the two before him one final look before sighing, 

"If you ever change your mind, Just shoot me a bird." He stated, before attempting to turn to face the woman at his side.* - Thu Oct  8 00:24:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) turned and saw yet another woman...Was it a blessing or a curse? He couldn't decide, but he took a deep breath aiming to calm his nerves, as a single hand moved through his hair, pushing his checkered hair back some, as he bowed respectfully to Kirie assuming she was there for Tetsumi, but he  followed behind Katsune.* - Thu Oct  8 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anyway. - Thu Oct  8 00:28:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: Not sure. - Thu Oct  8 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: I'd be willing to give you a round, But I warn you, I'm fast. - Thu Oct  8 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. Me too. - Thu Oct  8 00:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. North of here then? - Thu Oct  8 00:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: Uh sure, If you have a spot. - Thu Oct  8 00:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) followed behind her, as he scratched his cheek with a single finger, looking at the woman as she stopped, and immediately he found a spot across from her as he scratched his cheek. "Not sure, Probably not, I haven't been hit before." He stated lightly, looking at her as he entered a relaxed stance. Which probably wasn't the best idea, he was throwing away his potential for defense with this stance.

"Is that a deal breaker?"* - Thu Oct  8 00:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) nodded his head as he focused on her person, he inhaled through his nose and exhaled through his mouth, "Yeah, whenever you are." He stated, as his chakra began to circulate around his hands, and his light blue eyes studied her person, looking for parts of her body which seemed to contain some sort of defenses, or armored in any way. He smiled lightly before he asked:

"How long have you been fighting?"* - Thu Oct  8 00:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) blinked as she approached him, she by far surpassed him by speed, and due to this surprise his reaction time, was greatly lowered. So when he attempted to raise his hands across his chest to guard against such an attack, that once her hand connected, he felt the force explode outwards, burning the fabric of his clothing, and stinging his arms, as he was thrown backwards, hitting the ground with a skid. "S-Shit.." He muttered, unbeliving of such a technique.

He wasn't sure if it was a fire nature attack or not, but he got to his feet, quickly he wasn't the most tankiest of people, but he refused to be down and out from a single attack. And as such once he stood, if allowed his hands began surging with wind natured chakra, and he approached Katsune, at a fast speed but not as fast as hers.

His hand was moved horizontally aimed at her high abdomen. he had held back  he wasn't aiming to hurt he like she wasn't aiming to hurt him, at most it'd inflict small cuts, If not just damage clothing and small welts that didn't break skin.* - Thu Oct  8 00:52:28 2015
