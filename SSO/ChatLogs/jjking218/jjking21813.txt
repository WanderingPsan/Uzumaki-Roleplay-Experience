<br><font color=yellow>*Kudo, Shikato(SakoUchiha) began to heal the wounds of his squad member. He had just been retrieved by the head medic from the outskirts of the village and his body was torn up pretty badly. Shikato analyzed his partners body as he carefully healed him with Shousen no Jutsu. The Medic knew if he were to mess up, it would surely be the end of his partner. Shikato continued to heal him when he noticed his partner starting to breath heavily. He quickly stopped what he was doing and wondered what was going on. "Dam...I thought he was okay...Whats going on!!??" He exclaimed. Shikato finally realized his teammate was poisoned. Without thinking, He quickly began to focus his chakra to his hands and make quite a few handseals while mumbling, "Ni....Tori...Tsuchi...Ichi..." Shikato quickly put his hands to his partners chest and and unleashed his chakra into his chest. Carefully he started to extract the poison from the body, making sure not to mess up even a little. A few minutes after he extracted the poison, he noticed his teammates breathing slow down and return to normal.

Shikato smirked and whispered, "You're gonna be fine now.." He got up on his feet and turned to the head medic. "Its fine now sir..I was able to save him." He said to the head medic. The Medic leader was very impressed by Shikato handling the pressure of his friend almost dying. Shikato had been saving countless number of lives for years now and he was getting more and more skilled. As a result of this, The medic leader stepped down from his duty and gave Shikato the title of the Medic Corp Leader.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) slowly enters the room, oddly enough, he said a certain air of Elegance around his person, holding an almost perfect posture, and well kept hair. His eyes were a clear sea-blue in color, and his clothes were wrinkle-free, being almost perfectly symmetrical on either side of his person, his eyes shifted around subtly before they settled upon those before him, he opened his mouth subtly, before nodding his head to two of the guards behind him who scurried out the door as if on command. "Hello everyone."* - Mon Sep 07 14:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) slowly shifted his eyes to Mitsuko, examining the faint reddening of his cheeks he didn't seem to address it as he approached her, maintaining a distance at what would be called personal space. He took a brief assessment of her current attire, before offering a warm and gentle smile as he spoke "I'm Seisuke, and you're M'lady?" He asked, he didn't seem to afraid of getting sick if that turned out to be the case, as he extended his hand with his open palm upwards, as if asking for her own hand. His sea blue eyes stared into hers, with an inquistivie gaze.* - Mon Sep 07 14:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) raised her hand to his lips, planting a gentle kiss upon the back of her hand, before he stood upright once again. He seemed to be one who had a fine grasp on manners, although he had no insight into her minds, he wouldn't have made any judgements at all. As he asked "Mitsuko? That means Child of Light if I recall correctly. It's a beautiful name." He stated, offering her another one of his smiles, as his gaze shifted for a bit "Is the Kage in by any chance?" He asked lightly, she may've noticed his hands were practically unnaturally soft for a male, most likely showing that he hasn't had to work a day in his life. Giving little insight into his past.* - Mon Sep 07 14:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) contemplated her words, as his hand was dropped to his side "That's certainly...A bit saddening." He stated, raising a single finger to the side of his cheek, and gently scratched it, "Definately a bit problematic." He stated aloud, seemingly a bit perplexed on what to do, and slowly he tapped one of his pure white boots, which seemed to be trimmed with a golden fabric as he asked "Do you know of any Second in Commands? Or Higher Ranking individuals in the village?" He asked.* - Mon Sep 07 14:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looks towards her and his face dons a somewhat emotionally detached appearance, a single finger was raised to his cheek. And his gaze was averted to the side of her face, as he opened his mouth. "But I'm shy." He stated lightly,  unable to respond appropriately to the information he was just given. His blonde hair seemed to shift in the subtle breeze which was born from the awkward silence he probably would've caused.

But I am permitted to pet if you'd like. I'd rather get to know you while I'm waiting for the Raikage." He stated lightly, offering her a warm smile.* - Mon Sep 07 14:58:20 2015

"Good things come to those who wait, Love." He stated, as he listened to her last part, about not telling as he stated "There are always people watching me, I'd rather not do anything foolish."* - Mon Sep 07 15:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looks at her lightly taking notice of how sad she looked and he continued petting as he spoke "Mitsuko-san,  would you mind keeping me company? Maybe we can find something else to do to bide the time, Maybe I'll be able to help you out later." He offered, he was able to compromise if anything! Not like he had anything against it, he just didn't understand her.* - Mon Sep 07 15:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) nods "Maybe." He stated, continuing to pet her, as he thought about how soft her hair actually was. But didn't pay much mind to it, as he smiled lightly speaking "Would you care to accompany me to my Office? At least there we'll be able to eat some proper food and drink." He offered, with a gentle yawn.* - Mon Sep 07 15:10:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) slowly leads her to an upscale place, looking almost like a miniature castle, as he entered the front there seemed to be Numerous guards, as well as butlers and maids. Entering further, they entered a room with white tiles, and a single desk, looked to be made from some high grade wood, there was only a single chair though as he spoke "We could share my chair, or I can call for another,  I'm not sure how comfortable the latter would be." He stated, moving to take a seat in the chair, allowing her the decision where she wanted to sit.* - Mon Sep 07 15:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) blinked as she sat on his lap, but didn't do much more than that,his arms resting on the arm-rests of the chair, as he stated "Thanks, and, It's thanks to my father. He doesn't like the idea of me being close to the general populus." As he said this a single maid entered the room, asking Mitsuko if she desired any food or drink.* - Mon Sep 07 15:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked back into her eyes as he simply stated "Probably not, but feel free to stay here for as long as you want. The maids won't say much, unless you cause a lot of trouble." He stated lightly, the maid exited and returned with a bottle of high-end wine, which she poured a glass before offering to Seisuke. Who nodded his head in thanks, taking a sip of the glass. As he looked back to Mitsuko.* - Mon Sep 07 15:38:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) watches her toss the glass, and immediately a maid rushes in and begins cleaning as he simply stated "Peculiar." As he heard her request, and slowly his hand moved around her person, aiming to wrap his fingers around her neck, and lightly squeeze, holding the pressure he'd look into her eyes "Hm...You seem to really like punishment, don't you?" He'd ask, his firm grip probably pressing her firmer against his body.* - Mon Sep 07 15:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) examined her face, a bit perplexed by her facial expression. As he kept one of his hands around her, neck the pressure was being increased. As he guided her face closer to his own, so close she'd be able to feel his breath, and him hers,  he stared into her eyes as he complied with her demands to be choked. While his maid poured him another glass of wine, which he took a seat of. "Is this what humans usually interact with eachother?" He wondered to himelf.* - Mon Sep 07 15:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) suddenly got a wicked idea, "Mitsuko-san, How about you stay here with me, I'll be sure to do this for you as often as you want, if you agree to be my toy~ You're pretty fun to play with." He stated, finding this activity of choking her almost enjoyable, it was so foreign, it excited him a bit, as his grip tightened once again, as she began to drool, looking at her tongue as it lolled out of her mouth his free hand set down his glass, before laying his arm across her lap, he felt his fingers tightening around her soft flesh, and it seemed to trigger something within him..He couldn't quite place it.* - Mon Sep 07 16:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) as he felt her go somewhat life-less, he released his grasp, allowing her to lay atop of him. Slowly he took another sip of his wine as he spoke "Interesting hobby she has. " He stated lightly, gently stroking her hair as she slept atop of him. He wondered how long she'd be out, but one thing was for sure she had caught his interest, but he was curious what her answer would've been to being his toy. He'd have to find out later.* - Mon Sep 07 16:14:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) contemplates what was just asked, as he wonders what he would use her panties for. But it was bad manners to turn down a gift wasn't it? "Mm, I'd love them, but wouldn't you feel awkward walking around with none on?" He asked, wrapping his arms around her waist as she sat atop of him.* - Mon Sep 07 17:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) once again contemplated the choice he was offered deciding it best not to lose an eye, his gaze was averted as he spoke "So be it." Deciding it safer not to peek at the woman as she removed her panties finding human customs very much interesting, as he removed his arms from her waist wondering how this would end.* - Mon Sep 07 17:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) didn't peek, he decided to keep his eyes to peek another day, he waited until she called him back, as he looked at her white panties, his nose picked up on her scent, which caused a light reddening of his cheeks unconiously, but he didn't think much of it, slowly he reached for the white panties, he felt their warmth, having just been on her, as well as a light wetness as he asked "Wet?" Not towards anyone in particular he was just a bit baffled, by how they were wet. It seemed he was pretty naive in such situations.* - Mon Sep 07 17:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) tilted his head "Love juices?" He asked, still confused on the matter, but within a moment, he touched his pocket with the panties and they seemed to vanish from the realm of existence stored away for safe passage preserving everything from their warmth to the wetness, until he needed them again next time. As he felt her lips touch his cheek, he blinked, having not been kissed before he was confused by this act. Mitsuko perplexed him greatly, as he spoke "I probably should begin doing the same, if you'll accompany me to see the Raikage, I'd be more than happy to train with you."* - Mon Sep 07 17:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuko(Neorellik26) whispers: ..Love juices, is what is released from your lower area..This is what you do, you get something that is really ..Let's say lubey, lotions  something like that..Then you take my panties and placed them on your. While you sniff and enjoy the smell of them. You you rub your lower area over and over. I'm sure your love juices would come out and then you will understand.  But that is for a time, when you are alone. Anyways, let's go to the see the Raikage. Also don't tell anyone I told you that ok. Just for use to. - Mon Sep 07 17:43:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) the room was gigantic, with thousands upon thousands of books lined on the walls. He decided to go and take a seat at a desk to wait for her to find what she needed.* - Mon Sep 07 18:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) slowly approached Mitsuko deciding to take a seat beside her on the floor as he asked "Would you like my maids to fetch you some clothes, food or drink?" He asked, looking over her towards the books she specified. He wanted her to be comfortable, a host should always make the guest feel comfortable afterall, he seemed to be foreign to company and thus it interested him greatly.* - Mon Sep 07 18:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) motions for his maid to go get water, and immediately his maid scurried off and returned with a glass of water for Mitsuko. As he then relaxed beside her on the ground, calling for one of his maids, he used her lap as a pillow. Seemed like he was very entitled.* - Mon Sep 07 18:21:26 2015

When he spoke it was clear and precise, not a single blemish in sight.  "If you have a minute?"* - Mon Sep 07 19:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked toward the Shinobi around Raikage as he simply stated "In Private would be ideal."  The young boy shot his guards a light nod, and Nine of them dispersed leaving a single at his side. He ran a single hand through his hair, as he stared towards the Raikage wondering why Shinobi gave eachother such odd names, but that didn't matter to much to him currently.* - Mon Sep 07 19:39:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) simply nodded his head, leaning towards Mitsuko, and to his guard motioning for them both to come, although the guard was left outside by the door, leaving only him and Mitsuko should she decide to come with the Raikage.* - Mon Sep 07 19:42:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) was irritated, as he simply stated "Kirigakure Shinobi, Stand down. This is an order from a Gezo Nobel." He stated, his Gezo Seal was hanging right from his neck, and by god he seemed pissed. No anger didn't do what he was feeling justice, he was heated. His hands began to clench and a single vein sprouted on his forehead. "This is neither the time nor the place for such things." He warned the Shinobi, hoping his words did something to the Gezo-ccentric Kirigakurian troops.* - Mon Sep 07 22:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) ||The Young Gezo prince looked around subtly before his eyes settled upon Nigen, "I see...This is what is called fire is it not? I've never seen such things up close." He commented, a bit baffled by the flames, and the foreign scent he was smelling. It aroused his nostrils, with it's forbidden smell, he enjoyed the sight, how it danced around so happily, untamed free, powerful yet modest. Simply interesting. "Passion." He whispered beneath his breath.* - Tue Sep 08 20:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) obviously side-lined Yan.* - Wed Sep 09 17:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a deep breath as he watched the Raikage's movements, finding them interesting. He nodded his head subtly, causing his hair to sway, as he spoke "Seems interesting and easy enough." He stated lightly, as he focused, taking a deep breath he inhaled followed be a deep sigh, recalling the movements the Raikage had made. As he slowly attempted to mimic the male's motions, extending a single hand. As he took a deep breath and sighed, as he smiled lightly.

Before aiming to move his hand to the right, as he had seen the Raikage do but moments prior. "I see, It's an interesting technique, have you ever used it in battle?" He asked lightly, raising his hand once again, as he moved it to the side subtly repeating the process a few times, it wasn't an ideal movement, but he had the general idea of moving his hand right. His movements becomming swifter, not neccessarily as gentle as the Raikage's though.* - Wed Sep 09 17:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a deep breath and sighed, as he accepted the scroll. Cracking his knuckles, he rolled his shoulders "Should be easy enough." He stated, beginning to gather chakra at the tips of his fingers, before dispelling it, one may've noticed small seals on each of his fingertips which immediately faded away, he practiced the steady flow of gathering his chakra before expelling it, if someone could sense him, for such an underdeveloped Shinobi, his reserves were massive.

He yawned to himself, as he finally met the person of the hour,the construction worker. "So...Dirty.." He commented, rolling his eyes as he stated "Follow me." Beginning to walk down the path with the man behind him, as a mongrel should be, the prince obviously considered himself better than Humans, but he was Human himself...Wasn't he? It was hard to say, but regardless, he continued walking down the streat surveying the damages, along with the worker.

They walked, and walked, continuing to traverse the streets, until they had traversed the entire village once over, and slowly they returned to where they had began, Seisuke didn't look any happier than when he had left, and thus, he returned to Niza's side, with a subtle sigh he simply spoke "I'm done." He stated, approachig the Raikage.* - Wed Sep 09 19:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a deep breath and nodded his head, as he looked at Niza's form and slowly he took point, following in pursuit. Raising his hand as he had seen Niza do but moments before, as he aimed to hold it steady, closing his eyes, he inhaled sharply, before exhaling subtly. Pulling his hand back, he suddenly striked forward, keeping his fingers stiff, he aimed for approximately where someone's adam's apple would be. Before his hand slowly lowered to his side.

He took a dep breath and calmed himself, surprisingly this arrogant prince, was awefully fast at picking stuff up, he could even be considered a prodigy, but amongst Gezo terms, what was he actually? Possibly he was an idiot, a sad tale, of a banished prince. Who knew, but regardless, he looked to Niza "How was that Sensei?" Seemingly not addressing him by the title Raikage but now, Sensei.* - Wed Sep 09 20:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looks to Kirie as he asked himself aloud "A New toy...? No a pet....Hm...Father did say I should stop that." He shook his head subtly "That doesn't matter, answer my question woman." Stated the blonde male, complete with blue eyes, wrinkle-free clothing, white boots with gold trimmings and a following of guards.* - Thu Sep 10 21:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) narrowed his gaze Upon Kirie, as he simply stated "Kneel woman." Ignoring her inquiries all together, his gaze Settled upon Tethys and lastly Muhhamed, who seemed to be the eldest. Most likely the wisest out of those currently present, possibly their leader? He wasn't sure, but his guards seemed to drift closer to his sides, in a defensive manner.* - Thu Sep 10 21:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) stared at Tethys as he spoke "First you can teach your Shinobi some respect, You'd think they'd know how to address a Gezo Official. Hmpf." He stated, running a hand through his hair "I'll ignore her spitting on the ground at my feet, but next time, I won't be so forgiving." He stated, with a tinge of annoyance in his voice "Prince Seisuke of the Yukimura Clan." He explained lightly, his guards taking a kneeling position around the male.* - Thu Sep 10 21:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) contemplated the information he was just given.."Customs are different?" He asked, thinking about this, as he then spoke "These customs, tell me more. I'm to stay a period of time in Ninja Villages to learn how our henchmen live, Father believes it'll be ideal for becomming a better leader." He stated lightly, before looking to one of his henchmen, and simply taking a seat on the man's back as he kneeled. * - Thu Sep 10 21:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) shifts his eyes to Kirie momentarily as he simply averted his gaze back to Tethys as he spoke "I see."* - Thu Sep 10 21:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) turns to Baen "You are what we call a 'nigga'. My friend."* - Thu Sep 10 22:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) simply sighed as he mumbled "Imbeciles.." Beneath his breath, maybe they would force his hand, and he would be able to bring hell to Kirigakure, No...He wouldn't do that, he couldn't, Kirigakure still had value. He took in the information Tethys had provided without intervening, but as the Genin talked, one could detect, a massive amount of chakra simply shifting in the boy's body, becomming simply monstrous and untamed as his fingers instinctively curled and uncurled, he felt his blood...Boiling.

But he didn't say anything, he inhaled followed by a deep exhale as he remained upon the back of his Servant.

"I wish for accomodations, while I stay here." The prince said after a moment of thought.* - Thu Sep 10 22:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) contemplated what Tethys had just said as he spoke "Last time I checked, Royalty didn't pay for anything." He stated in reference to how life was where he was, I mean why would he even carry money? Everything was handed to him afterall.* - Thu Sep 10 22:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) contemplated this as he spoke "So what you're telling me is...You desire money for failing to complete the mission which was to Eliminate Zetsumo -and- his forces. And as I've heard, Zetsumo is still currently alive, and so is a great deal of his officers. So. Did, I hear you correctly? Private?" Asked the Prince, his guards standing up, as they seemed to tense up as he spoke:

"I'd appreciate it next time, if you actually -completed- your whole objective before  asking for a reward for a half-assed job."* - Thu Sep 10 22:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) simply sighed "Mongrels these days. You lack a lot of information don't you? You understand The Empire doesn't just put all it's money in a bucket, and everyone grabs what they need correct? Thus to get your money you must go through the correct channels, and have proof of completion. And in regards to spititng, I believe your whore, did it Not once...But twice hasn't she? An insult to my family, and to myself, so tell me, 'Private', am I really the one you desire to play games with? I came here to be peaceful. But god help this Village, if another Mongrel spits at my feet." He paused for a bit:

"I will make Zetsumo look like a child having a temper Tantrum."* - Thu Sep 10 23:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) eyes widened for only a moment "I see, this is a mongrel's limitation on verbal punishment. A lot lower than originally anticipated" He stated,as he stood from his seat on one of the guards, who immediately moved before the prince, as one of the three was hit in the face being knocked to the ground in a single movement, but he didn't seem down for the count. One of the two standing guards, made a single seal, channeling their chakra outwards towards Tethys', as he'd feel the ground shaking beneath him, before caving in, potentially causing him to fall into a pit. Which was a genjutsu, meanwhile.

The second remained in a defensive stance, drawing a Katana, as he prepared for battle.

"Shinobi are definately not as developed as I thought."* - Thu Sep 10 23:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) sighed once again, Shinobi definately had interesting abilities,  but the first male Tethys' had striked had begun to stand again, these Shinobi were roughly Jounin level, and were extremely skilled, and as such when Kirie fired her hair at him, the guard which was stationed in front of him, immediately reacted, and his blade surged with lightning, before was shot towards the hair aiming to cut it off before it hit him, as he simply stated "This is simply dissapointing, To think these  are Shinobi barbaric, even the women." He muttered, as he began walking towards the south, with the swordsman following behind him.

The Genjutsu Specialist, was simply wrecked for the most part, or would've been had he not attempted to move, seemingly a lot faster than the other two, but a lot less resiliant, there was a crack heard as the fist connected with the male's shoulder, signaling a fracture or break, and the final man, a Taijutsu specialist that Tethys' had first attacked, seemed to be enjoying the fight as the young boy simply stated:

"I've had my fun for today, this surely won't be the last time, I see....All of you again." He stated lightly, before his hand was placed into his pocket and another waved in a non-chalont manner, to those behind him. "Until next time."* - Thu Sep 10 23:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) simply sighed as Jin moved to approach him, within a single motion, his hand was shot out towards the male's Adam's apple in a non-lethal gesture, but then again? Why would he even raise a hand to touch a mongrel, it'd soil his palms, the Prince without hesitation, aimed to walk around him, the Swordsman, prepared to strike Jin in a moment's hesitation, it honestly seemed like Jin hadn't quite understood the magnitude of the situation he was in and how much of a disadvantage he was in, and as such the Prince was unafraid of the male, and thus continued walking.* - Thu Sep 10 23:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) simply continued walking without hesitation, not even blinking when Jin pulled back, he was either very sure of his own ability, or had a serious disregard for life. Either way, that made for two very startling possibilities for Konoha he was:

A: Stronger than he let on.

B: Had nothing to lose, and thus he could go after them using the worst tactics.

And either way, this was going to be fun.* - Fri Sep 11 00:01:29 2015

It was out of my place to say such things, and as a Military member of the same Rank. I hope you can forgive this, and we can work forward together, in serivce to the Empire." He seemed genuinely apologetic, and even left his guards a few yards back, going as far to subtly bow his head.* - Sat Sep 12 00:59:56 2015

He stated lightly before hearing her introduction "Lera..? A Beautiful name. Healthy and strong, if I recall correctly. My name's Seisuke." Stated the prince lightly, retracting his hand after possibly holding on to her for a moment to long, as his hand fell to his side, he offered a gentle but welcoming smile. "It's a pleasure to meet you."* - Sat Sep 12 10:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Training with Tethys huh? - Sat Sep 12 10:41:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) his gaze shifted to Jin for a moment, he was trying to be nice, he had his reasons for doing so and if he was going to be trapped in this damned World of Shinobi he should make some allies. "So tell me, What is it people do around here for fun?" He asked gently, Was he putting on an act? Could he actually...Be Human? Was he imitating them? Mocking them? They'd have to find out.* - Sat Sep 12 10:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: --Although, I'm assuming gawking at the beauty of women is a very big source of entertainment, due to the large count of males to female in this area. - Sat Sep 12 10:44:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) thinks: This is ridiculous. - Sat Sep 12 10:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: You said this guy is a Gezo prince? - Sat Sep 12 10:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: God damnit, words! use your words! - Sat Sep 12 10:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I see, So he isn't actually Gezo. - Sat Sep 12 10:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Thought so. - Sat Sep 12 10:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) says: Form your words more clearly infront of a prince, especially from Gezo. - Sat Sep 12 10:49:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) thinks: Why are you surpsied now, I yelled it out for a reason! - Sat Sep 12 10:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: But i wasn't Paying attention to you!!! - Sat Sep 12 10:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) moved to run a single hand through his hair, as he simply stated "Great beauty can be found in those who aspire for strength, And don't sell yourself short." His gaze subtly shifted to Angetsu as he simply stated "I don't need special Treatment, in the Empire me and your Kage-Stand in are the same rank. I may be a prince, but while I am here, I'm simply a guest in your Village." He stated lightly. Anyone who could sense would probably detect a hint of a lie in what he just said, but figuring it out would be their poison.* - Sat Sep 12 10:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Not that you'd receive special treatment. - Sat Sep 12 10:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: But anyway, I'm out of here. - Sat Sep 12 10:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I haven't got time for this. - Sat Sep 12 10:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) contemplated the words which were stated by those around him, as he first decided to address Angetsu "Flirting? I can't be nice to people?" He asked for clarification, he was a bit baffled on the lives of the Ninety Nine Percent, as he then turned to Jin "Putting myself on your level? I'm not sure, as far as I'm concerned, the use of the word 'Mongrels' at least when I used it previously, was due to your inability to hold a conversation, with a foreign Political representative. If I recall you were quite rude, and so were quite a few others, I apologize for what was said, but in return I believe you're also at fault for what happened." He paused, offering a gentle smile, which was tinged with mal-intentions.

"So let's put the past behind us, shall we?" 

Before he looked to Lera "You're fine, I'd rather I not be thought of as a Prince--In hindsight, I think I will -extend- my trip -indefinately-." He glanced to Jin with a mischiveious smile "I'm in your care...All of you."* - Sat Sep 12 11:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) thinks: ...He's staying here...Everyday there is a new reason for me to leave... - Sat Sep 12 11:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Uh, I can help you with that Jin. - Sat Sep 12 11:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: One second.. - Sat Sep 12 11:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) contemplated Jin's actions, as he simply stated "In this world, there are two types of people, my friend. I desire to see which you are. As for apologizing, I've already done so to those who deserved apologies." He as he simply stepped forward, past Lera, and crouched beside Jin, as he whispered in a gentle tone, one which could've been easily swept out by the wind, and directed at Jin. As the prince whispered to Jin, so lightly, that Jin may've second guessed his ears the male stated:

"I will have you dance like a pig to your slaughter." 

He stood up lightly, as he spoke "So, let's put the past behind us, and work towards a greater future, As Allies, and ultimately as friends."* - Sat Sep 12 11:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm? - Sat Sep 12 11:12:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) smiled gently, as he turned to Lera, his 'peppy' attitude appearing once again "Lera, would you mind showing me around?" He stated, offering a wide and warm smile, showing genuine happiness and excitement.* - Sat Sep 12 11:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) says: I'll show you around. - Sat Sep 12 11:20:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) slowly walks along the path deciding to continue his journey and see a bit more of the Shinobi world, of course he was accompanied by his handy-dandy  guards, he noticed a male, and slowly waved off the guards to hide before he found Ushinawa "Hello there." Stated the prince lightly.* - Sat Sep 12 12:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) commanded his guards to scatter and as such they did as the boy simply stated "You could say that, although I'm looking for a skilled Teacher. I wish to expand my knowledge of Shinobi." Is what he said, giving him a brief explanation as to why he was here, he may've simply been passing through, the prince sighed for a bit before he spoke "I'm Seisuke, and you're?" He asked lightly.* - Sat Sep 12 12:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Ushi. - Sat Sep 12 12:56:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Why do you wish to get stronger? - Sat Sep 12 12:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) glanced to Ushinawa, as  he spoke, and he sighed a bit before he contemplated his answer before finally speaking "I wish to get stronger, to protect my kingdom and it's people is all." He stated lightly, despite being an arrogant jackass at time, he had the right goal at heart, he desired to keep his people safe, not to cause problems, he desired to protect and had no inherent desire to kill.* - Sat Sep 12 12:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked to Ushinawa, as he spoke, looking forward he took a deep breath "I suppose that's doable, But, I won't act as if I don't know you if you get in trouble. In return I'll help you if I'm able to." He stated lightly, his fist gently clenching and unclenching to take a deep breath and  sighed. He didn't understand Ushinawa, he felt as if someone acting as if they didn't know him ,would hurt him more than helping. But he also wanted to put out there that if Ushinawa got into trouble, Seisuke would help if he had the opportunity.* - Sat Sep 12 13:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hm... - Sat Sep 12 13:11:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) says: Right... - Sat Sep 12 18:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a deep breath and nodded as he sat down upon the ground as he was waiting for his armor to be completed he was intending to wait for a few days. And was genuinely surprised that he only waited a few hours he looked towards  the girl as she approached with his armor, and offered a light and graceful smile. Examining the work she had done, "It's simply beautiful." He stated lightly, before looking to her as he stated:

"Stunning."

He paused a bit feeling as if he had forgotten something before his hand was extended to the girl, "I never did introduce myself, I'm Seisuke of the Yukimura Clan." He stated lightly, offering her a gentle smile, as he examined her appearance for the first time.* - Sat Sep 12 18:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) would slowly smile, before aiming to help her rid herself of that burden known as his Armor,slowly he'd release her hand "Suzuna? That's a beautiful name." He stated warmly, giving the young girl a gentle smile, as he spoke "I'm in the market for a personal Armor Smith, Would you be interested in filling that position?" He stated, gently, his blonde hair ever so gently shifting in the breeze, as his hands began unintentionally flexing. Causing chakra to gather on his finger tips before being expelled.

The process of chakra gathering before being expelled was repeated several times, probably a nervous tick. He was in a foreign village afterall,  but if she could make armor so good and efficicently, she'd be an invaluable asset. "That doesn't mean, You won't be able to accept other clients. But I'd be your...'benefactor', Frequent Customer."* - Sat Sep 12 18:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) reached into his pocket, and offered her a few bills which tallied up to a Million yen, "It means you will be able to of course." He stated lightly, as he offered the money to her looking at her he tried to get an assessment on her, this was the first Armor smith he had seen and he wasn't expecting a female. But that was cool, his hands slowly continued to clench and unclench as a steady flow of chakra was being sent into them, he recalled one of his techniques.

And slowly he was trying to strategize whether the use of this armor would in any way act as a deterrent to any strategieies he already had in place, he was also trying to figure out how he could work with his Summoning, it'd be ideal if he wasn't holding himself back. But he knew the armor gave him an added boost of sorts, so that was fine, he cracked his knuckles lightly.

His gaze shifted along the girl, taking in what she wore. She'd probably notice the crest of the Gezo Empire upon his chest, and his clothes seemed to be wrinkle free and perfectly symmetrical, his blonde hair seemed to be combed perfectly, not a single strand of hair sticking up, and his blue eyes focused in on her as if trying to pry deep into her soul.* - Sat Sep 12 19:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a deep breath and smiled, somewhat appreciative of her acceptance of the position so readily, watching her hand as she moved to undo the bun which she had her hair tied into, his gaze shifted down from her shirt, to her pants, to her open toed boots. He found her appearance interesting for what reason, he didn't know, but regardless he decided this would be good since he had added a skilled member to his forces a Armor smith was invaluable. He couldn't express his happiness.

Regardless, he slowly tested the weight of the armor, finding it fit him well, he believed it would provide adequate protection without inhibiting his progress to much, so that was a plus. As he looked to her he spoke "Are you hungry by any chance?" He stated, looking gently into her eyes, he had skipped a meal today and intended to catch up.* - Sat Sep 12 19:19:53 2015
