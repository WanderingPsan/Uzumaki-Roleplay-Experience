<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) nods his head gently as he accepted the scroll wondering what was hidden within it's confinements.* - Tue Sep 22 20:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) yawns briefly as he slowly opened the scroll before him, and inhaled followed by a brief exhale as his light blue eyes scanned over the scroll before him, he yawned to himself, he wondered what exactly this scroll held...What secrets were in it's confinements he found the possibilities both beautiful and endless before he read the title of the scroll it was called "Temperature control." He nodded his head cracking his knuckles subtly as his left hand moved to brush a bit of hair from his face.

Focusing on the scroll before him he began to read the scroll, with a gentle nodding of the head, he smiled warmly  this technique should be a breeze to learn or so he had originally hoped, something told him his comming days would be filled with endless, boring times, wondering if there was something better he could be doing with his time, but he figured any answers would come in due time, so he focused.

Running a single hand through his hair, he wondered if there was anything he was missing, then he recalled that he was definately missing a lot of stuff, but it wasn't of much importance to him as of late, he had been well along the path to successfully learning this technique in which case he'd slowly yawn before scrolling to the final page of the scroll he was given, deciding to gaze over it gently.

Once he had finished that scroll, all that was left was to crack his knuckles, he truly was skilled when it came to his ability to learn, so he looked to Koeki and offered a gentle smile as he simply stated "Done." He had managed to learn this technique in a few minutes definately a prodigy in one way or another or maybe it was simply good genes.-+* - Tue Sep 22 20:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Great. - Tue Sep 22 20:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Now practice on that fish! - Tue Sep 22 20:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Try to regulate its temperature. - Tue Sep 22 20:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Understood. - Tue Sep 22 20:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a deep breath as he sat befor ethe fish, inhaling followed by a deep exhale, he decided this would be a pretty decent time to get some work in on both the Medical techniques, he knew, so he yawned briefly. Slowly his hands were raised to chest level, as he cracked his knuckles gently, inhaling followed by a subtle exhale, as his blue eyes focused on the fish before him. Making a single seal, he gathered his chakra.

Before his hands were extended over that of the fish, and a thin veil of chakra began to escape his hands, aiming to focus on that of the fishes body obviously intent on raising it's temperature, before he paused an decided to switch, practicing the basic healing method Koeki had shown him earlier, he definately couldn't afford to be slacking off so he yawned subtly before getting his head back into the game.

Slowly but surely he began to transition between the the two techniques aiming to maximize his abilitiy with both of them in the short amount of time he had been allotted, which in itself would be a challenge he was more than happy to accept, overall he knew that mastering both techniques would easily  help him advance in his abilities overall, and he was definatley slacking overall, so he decided to focus.

He had decided that later he'd begin to focus on visual training, as well as mental he'd practice a larger variety of techniques mentally than he would doing them physically, especially since he was so mentally gifted being a prodigy and  all he never was a major fan of training technqiues, he was always more for simply using them and learning until they served their purpose.

So taking a deep breath, he was noticing some basic improvement of the fish, perhaps more than Koeki had intended, as he lowered his hands to his lap, offering a gentle smile to her as he spoke "I think I did it." He  stated relaxing, one thing she'd quickly realise was that his reserves seemed to be definately out of this world.* - Tue Sep 22 20:46:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) waves lightly as he spoke "I was wondering if you'd be interested in helping me complete a task Koeki has assigned me?" He asked gently, noticing the Ermine, but not paying it...Too much attention someone had told him Muhhamed had his quirks as did many other Sergeants so it wasn't out of the realm of possibilities.* - Tue Sep 22 21:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: What task? - Tue Sep 22 21:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I need to spar against a Higher Ranking official and receive Feedback. - Tue Sep 22 21:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: So you want to spar me? - Tue Sep 22 21:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Yes if it is at all possible. - Tue Sep 22 21:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Sure.. - Tue Sep 22 21:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I've just been playing with Ermine all this time anyway... - Tue Sep 22 21:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) nodded his head backing up as Muhhamed had instructed, before he inhaled taking a deep breath and exhaling out of his mouth, as he nodded his head focusing. Oddly enough he wasn't sure if he should consider Muhhamed's gesture an insult or not "Is he saying he'll beat me before the animal returns?" He thought to himself, before focusing as he asked "Is that a new pet or something?" He asked lightly, entering a fairly relaxed stance, as his hand reached for Samehade's hilt.

And then out of consideration, he realised it wouldn't be wise to use that blade in a spar so he moved into a bare handed stance.* - Tue Sep 22 21:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) went wide-eyed as he saw Muhhamed begin his barrage of attacks immediately  his hand moved to his side gathering a small amount of chakra into the center of his palm, before releasing the small vortex of wind forward, not attempting to completely stop the jutsu which were aimed at him he probably lacked the ability to do so anyway, his intention was to slow down their momentum greatly and help shift them off their original course, he knew he'd need to work on his reaction speed though.

After he launched the initial attack, he immediately aimed to run North  of course he didn't stand still when he fired the jutsu he aimed to keep on the move to make himself a smaller target.* - Tue Sep 22 21:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) blinked as he suddenly saw the Shuriken shooting forward at a Renewed amount of speed, he attempted to dive out of the way, but even so he was still hit by a few of the shuriken, getting stabbed on his side, leg, and shoulder, in his attempt to dodge, staining his white cloak a bit red with his blood. As he skid along the ground due to the force, "O-Ouch..." He bit his bottom lip, defeinately not having the durability of those before him, which would definately be a problem.

The pain radiated through his body, one of the few times he had been phyiscally hurt and he seemed to lack any major resistence to pain, he tried to think of what to do, but it was obvious he had a lack of experience thinking while in pain, and Ultimately he opted to reach for his belt, grabbing a Kunai which he threw forward aimed at Muhhamed's leg, as he aimed to buy himself some time to regroup.* - Tue Sep 22 21:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) blinked as he observed Muhhamed's form, the abilities the man had put into use surprised him greatly almost making it unbelievable, he found it hard to believe this was the power of a Sergeant, then again, the male had prided himself up until this point of never engaging in battles he wasn't sure he could win, and it seemed like he was a victim of doing just that this time. And so he sighed toh himself.

Watching as his Kunai was avoided by Muhhamed's manipulated shuriken, he began to concentrate, focusing his basic sensing abilities to focus on Muhhamed's chakra, and this time he decided he'd do better if he used Samehade, if he was going to train he minds well as do it at his best, but the shuiken which were left within his body, hurt him greatly.

But as Muhhamed's weapons approached, he'd raise Samehade defensively, aiming to use it to sap the Shuriken's chakra as it collided with the large blade.* - Tue Sep 22 21:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a deep breath and focused, his eyes somewhat widening as he realised Muhhamed's expansion of his attack's radius. And immediately he aimed to retaliate somewhat, leaping backwards some he'd aim to create a bit of distance, while Samehade was swung at any Shuriken which seemed exceedingly crippling such as any going for his chest, and legs, those seemed to be the priority of his defenses, of course any aimed at his head would be attemtped to be dealt with.

He probably wouldn't have had the speed to react to all of the Shuriken aimed for those areas, and definately not enough to retaliate to all the shuriken in General, so he had to make due with what he considered to be Priority.* - Tue Sep 22 22:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) grunted out as a few Shuriken connected with his legs, and possibly even his arms, he would've fell to a knee if he didn't have a shuriken sticking out from his leg, he winced in pain "O-Ouch...I give...I give." He stated, exercising his right to forfeit, probably one of the few times he could forfeit since it wasn't a serious fight, he didn't' have the durability of most of his class, he was fairly weak at that which saddened him, but he at least knew where he had to focus.* - Tue Sep 22 22:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) was looking to have paper skin more and more, as he spoke "I-I think I should lay down for a bi---" And like that he dropped like a light. * - Tue Sep 22 22:24:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) moves a hand over the side of his scroll...Unsealing another scroll...Which he handed to Lera.* - Wed Sep 23 10:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) using his free hand he scratched his cheek lightly looking away as he spoke "I t-thought you'd like it." He stated lightly.* - Wed Sep 23 10:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) smiled lightly as she kissed him, "It's no problem, I'm just glad I was able to help you out." He stated looking toward her.* - Wed Sep 23 10:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Would you like to go learn the technique now~? - Wed Sep 23 10:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure~ - Wed Sep 23 10:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) simply smiled as he took a seat beside Lera, on the ground he smiled lightly as he spoke "I figured you'd have some fun with it~" He stated lightly as he unsealed another scroll for himself, deciding to take the easier way around, he unraveled the scroll reading the name of it "Kaze Boru." He sighed lightly he looked to Lera occasionally as he spoke. "Think you'd be up to taking a small break after this session?~" He asked gently, before reading further down his scroll.* - Wed Sep 23 10:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: mhmm, I think i would~ - Wed Sep 23 11:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) smiled gently as he heard her speak, he figured she'd enjoy yhe challenge, as he continued reading his scroll making somewhat decent progress, as his gaze gently shifted to her as he spoke "I thought it would be, so I made sure to keep an eye open." He stated. He was enjoying this casual time, with his light blue eyes continued to scan the page of the scroll before him as he sudddenly had a thought "Out of the elements you possess which is your favorite to use?"* - Wed Sep 23 11:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm....Thats a difficult question. - Wed Sep 23 11:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I use earth a lot, to defend myself. - Wed Sep 23 11:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But I also use wind and fire. - Wed Sep 23 11:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I see~ - Wed Sep 23 11:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I don't think I have a favourite...though I don't use Raiton much. - Wed Sep 23 11:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) simply relaxed where it was he sat, reading over the scroll, he was much more of a reader than a trier, as such, he preferred to try out techniques in the heat of battle, he smiled lightly, cracking his knuckles, as he  focused on what was actually going on before him, he figured this would be a fun thing to try in battle. So as he read he yawned gently, shifting a subtle glance towards Lera as he spoke:

"None the less, Just imagine how surprised someone would be if you whipped that technique out on them in battle~?" He joked laughing subtly.* - Wed Sep 23 11:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhmmm. It'll definitely be a good one. - Wed Sep 23 11:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You know...I can't imagine entering the chuunin exams now. Last time I was so much weaker..but now. - Wed Sep 23 11:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You're practically radiating with strength~ - Wed Sep 23 11:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Heh, why thankyou kind sire. - Wed Sep 23 11:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) simply relaxed, with a gentle yawn, he took note of Lera it seemed like she was getting serious,in which case he'd take a deep breath and yawn for a moment, deciding it best to focus on what was going on, he looked around briefly before he focused on his scroll, he figured he should probably be doing a trial run of this but it was fine if he wasn't he trusted his instincts when it came to this stuff and he felt like he had it down, so he'd trust himself, plus he found the sight of Lera focusing so interesting he had decided to focus on it for a while.* - Wed Sep 23 11:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) smiled a bit, as he noticed she seemed to have gotten the hang of the technique, he began slowly clapping his hands "Congratz~!" He stated lightly, as he observed her progress, he looked at the clock for a moment, and realised he had to run and do something some 'final' touches for their break, so he spoke "I have to go pick up something really quickly, Buuuut. In the mean time, I have one more thing you may be interested in learning~ I'll be back in a few." He stated offering her another scroll, definately of an easier breed.* - Wed Sep 23 11:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm? okay~ - Wed Sep 23 11:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hrm? - Wed Sep 23 11:51:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thank you~ But I already know them both. - Wed Sep 23 11:52:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Whats this one? - Wed Sep 23 11:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Exploding Flame Shot... - Wed Sep 23 11:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: That...sounds...explosive. - Wed Sep 23 11:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I hear it is~ - Wed Sep 23 11:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Brb den~ - Wed Sep 23 11:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) slowly strolls back up taking a seat by the northern tree, he decided to gently watch Lera's practicing, not wishing to disturb her focus in anyway, he smiled subtly, it was calming and in a way, made him happy to see her working hard, but luckily he had time to setup their break, he hoped she'd enjoy it he had spent some time preparing it, at least in advance.* - Wed Sep 23 12:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: He already fought me once - Wed Sep 23 12:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) smiled a bit having realised Lera was done with her training or rather had least learned the technique he slowly aimed to approach her from behind, and gently wrap his arms around her waist as he spoke "Do you think that jutsu will be useful?~" He asked gently hugging her lightly.* - Wed Sep 23 12:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked into her eyes for a moment before he spoke "That's great~ Are you ready to take a break?" He asked gently, leaning forward to give her a kiss on the forehead.* - Wed Sep 23 12:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm always ready if its with you~ - Wed Sep 23 12:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) smiled warmly, as he spoke "Then let's go~" He stated, releasing his hug, before he attempted to elegantly sweep her off of her feet. He'd been hitting the gym for this sole purpose had she permitted him to! Afterwards he'd begin walking towards where he had set up.* - Wed Sep 23 12:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) would head towards his location which surprisingly was an isolated are, with lush grass, and a small lake within spitting distance. Set atop of the grass near the lake, was a red blanket,  with a small basket atop of it.* - Wed Sep 23 12:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) looked at her as he slowly approached the Blanket, he'd slowly attempt to lay her down upon it. Sealing away his weapons and the work with a single motion as he spoke "I'm glad you like it~" He stated gently, laying down beside her on the blanket. * - Wed Sep 23 13:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) felt her head against his chest, and faintly ushed, as he listened to her words, his gaze was averted out of embarrassment. Old habits die hard don't they? But surprisingly he managed to come up with something to say, he was working on it.

" My Ulterior motive was to look upon someone who is beautiful and precious to me...At a place 'almost' as beautiful as she is~ Although...Privacy is a plus~"* - Wed Sep 23 13:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) slowly moved his arm around Lera as she laughed, releasing a low chuckle as he stated:

"It's hard not to compliment you~"  

He stated casually, enjoying the time he was spending with Lera, it was also fun to slow down every once in a while and live in the now.* - Wed Sep 23 13:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) slowly closed his eyes, asa he listened to her humming which gradually evolved, the tune was relaxing. He enjoyed it greatly, this was the first time he had heard Lera sing and the sound seemed to almost caress his ears as he uttered almost unconciously.

"That sounds nice."* - Wed Sep 23 13:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) felt her lips touch him, and it only acted to further calm him, as he felt her head settling back upon his chest. His eyes opened for a moment, gazing at the sky which was slightly hinted upon through the spacing of the leaves above them, providing a nice shading, with the subtle sea breeze blowing by.

"I understand now...How you can have something worth fighting for. Something...You'd risk your life for Lera. I believe I have begun to understand."* - Wed Sep 23 13:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Wed Sep 23 13:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: When...when Jin was killed and I couldn't do anything about it. - Wed Sep 23 13:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I gave up on caring - Wed Sep 23 13:22:46 2015
