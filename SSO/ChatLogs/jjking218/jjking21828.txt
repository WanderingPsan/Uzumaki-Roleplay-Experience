<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) was definately not in the mood for Setsuna's shit right now, and definately contemplated blowing this entire hospital up for a single girl's insolence. But then again Was she worth it? He didn't honestly know, nor did he care, But if she was moving that incessantly fast, without a doubt she'd leave a path of disorder in her way.

So he decided to take the easy way out and lept out of the window, landing elegantly upon the ground, because Why not? Open landing the chakra flow to his legs was cut and he simply walked back towards Lera's side.* - Sat Sep 26 16:17:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) seemingly went from a freefall to landing atop of the Kage's Mansion, the look of obvious irritation, and his blade was now unsealed. Though not held in his hand it was tied to his back.* - Sat Sep 26 16:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Oh....does the new girl want to take Lera...  a love triangle. - Sat Sep 26 16:27:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) leaps off of the building landing on the right side of Setsuna, he took a deep breath to calm himself before walking forward. Anyone who could sense would feel a build up of chakra on his left hand but that's all it was a build-up.* - Sat Sep 26 16:33:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) felt his hand grabbed, and the chakra immediately settled , he looked towards Lera for a moment before his gaze was averted to the side "So be it." He stated, with annoyance still very much present in his voice not towards Lera, but towards Setsuna. He wouldn've opened his mouth to respond to what Setsuna had stated, but decided it was so far from what was true it didn't deserve an immediate response.* - Sat Sep 26 16:39:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Enough. Stop arguing you two. - Sat Sep 26 16:48:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) blinked but was getting into the kiss, feeling her hand moving through his hair as she kissed him deeper, his hands slowly found her back, pulling her in a bit closer as he closed his eyes embracing this moment.* - Sat Sep 26 18:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) gasped a bit as she broke the kiss finding himself longing for more, part of him wouldn't have minded losing his clothes. But as she rested her face against his neck, he held her in his arms.

"Y-Yeah...This wouldn't really be the best place for that...." He spoke jokingly, as he hugged her. "How do you feel about playing games more often~?" He asked, between breaths.* - Sat Sep 26 18:07:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) entered a fairly upscale restaurant, which seemed to almost be fit for Royalty, it seemed like the entire place had been cleared out--Save for staff. And when they entered they were led to a room which looked like a dining hall fit for a King,  there was a single table in the middle of the large room, which seemed to have fountains of water in the four corners. As he carried Lera to the table, he pulled out a seat for her to sit in before setting her down, and pushing her chair in.

Before he himself proceeded to take a seat across from her. "How do you like this place~?"* - Sat Sep 26 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) smiled lightly as he looked around, listening to Lera's words, as the waitor came over he spoke:

"Only when they're trying to impress~" He stated lightly. Proceeding to order a glass of wine unless Lera had a taste for something else.* - Sat Sep 26 19:06:27 2015

"Just enjoy yourself~."* - Sat Sep 26 19:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) blinked as he asked "Is this your first glass?" A bit surprised, but he was happy she liked it. Slowly he rested his glass down upon the table, and it seemed like the Waitor was making his way around to take their food orders, The menu seemed to be quite expansive. "I wouldn't reccomend drinking much~."* - Sat Sep 26 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) laughed a bit, as he flipped through the menu slowly, occasionally taking a sip of his wine before resting it upon the table as he spoke "Feel free to take your time~" He told her, as he ordered Kaiseki Ryori for himself as he spoke "I'd reccomend their Sukiyaki Lera~ It's delicious, if you can't find anything else~'* - Sat Sep 26 19:21:48 2015

Seisuke looked at Lera as he spoke " That could be arranged~" He joked playfully in response to her staying here, but he was joking at least now.* - Sat Sep 26 19:27:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) after a few moments the waiter returns with their food, and Seisuke whispers something into the man's ear, and within moment a pianist mounts the piano, and begins playing a calm tune. "I hope you enjoy your food~."* - Sat Sep 26 19:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) was happy, everything was going according to plan, and slowly he began to eat his food taking his time to savor the exquisite taste as he spoke "I thought you would~"  Before he paused for a second raising his wine glass as he spoke "A toast, Lera...A Toast to us~?"* - Sat Sep 26 19:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) tapped his glass against hers as he spoke "Forever." Before tilting his glass back and taking a sip as he looked at her for a moment admiring her beauty before he returned to his food. Taking it slow,  he wasn't in a rush afterall.* - Sat Sep 26 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) finished his food moments later, before he spoke "Did you enjoy it~?" He asked lightly, wiping his lips, as he finished off his glass. Before setting it off to the side,  along with his napkin as he blinked noticing Lera's feat with the clean eating with so much food, definately commendable.* - Sat Sep 26 19:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) nodded his head "It definately was." He stated. before standing from his sitting position as he spoke "Shall we?" He stated,offering her his hand, he was referring to leaving. It seemed like expenses had already been covered.* - Sat Sep 26 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took notice of her look at the Piano as he stopped "Want to take a look?" He asked lightly, holding her hand lightly in his own.* - Sat Sep 26 19:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm? Mhm...maybe. I've always wanted a piano - Sat Sep 26 19:49:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ...Okay. - Sat Sep 26 19:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) was expecting something loud, and uncontrolled as she played, but he blinked genuinely surprised at how fluent the sound was becomming able to hear the sound radiate throughout the room making a gentle lullaby, which made it hard to believe this was her first time, he was genuinely impressed, maybe she was some piano genius a few years ago? It was definately her turn to impress him, and he was definately impressed.* - Sat Sep 26 19:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) was simply stunned as the sound resonated within him, striking a chord, which seemingly played to the wave-length of his inner beat.  She was definately something else, and he found it hard to believe, she hadn't played this before, he'd definately ask her about that, she must've been some genius or prodigy ,he had never heard of such a thing happening before.* - Sat Sep 26 19:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) blinked as he listened to her improv ending, deeply moved as she finished, he clapped his hands, first starting with a slow pace which began to steadily increase as he spoke "That was beautiful."* - Sat Sep 26 20:03:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) offers his hand to her once again.* - Sat Sep 26 20:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) leads her back to the house, and more specifically to the room they shared, approaching the bed he'd motion for her to sit as he spoke "I've been trying to learn how to help you relax when you have stressfull days. I mean it's the least I can do...So I've been trying to learn how to give Massages, And I wanted to show you what I learned." He stated, looking a tad bit embarrassed. * - Sat Sep 26 20:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) blinked before scratching his cheek nervously as that definately went a lot better than expected, but slowly he gazed upon Lera's body, he felt his heart racing. But he needed to focus ona nd remember what he had learned, so slowly he moved to turn off the lights in the room, before setting a few candles, just to give a clam and relaxing atmosphere, and slowly he moved and got some massage oil, he bought since that was part of what made massages help people relax as he spoke:

"I-I'm going to begin~" The smell of the candles was a faint Lavender scent, which began radiating through the room.* - Sat Sep 26 20:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) would gently coat his hands in the oil,  rubbing them together lightly, before he moved his hands gently to the bottom of her back, applying a bit of light pressure, as his hands slowly began moving forward, one on either side of her spine, being careful not to drift to close, as he spread the oil upon her back. His hands slowly moving up her back until they rested on the back of her shoulders, before returning back down, along her sides, before returning to the point he began.* - Sat Sep 26 20:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) realised there was something about working hard for the person you cared about which made this experience so much more rewarding for him, as he slowly moved his hands back up her back, this time, he began to pay attention to her shoulders and neck, taking care to go with the flow of blood, with gentle motions, before returning back to his starting position. Within moments, he switched to a different technique, beginning to apply smaller circular motions with his hands, while moving up her back, hoping to provide a deeper circulation, and level of comfort.

"I'm glad you're liking it~."* - Sat Sep 26 20:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) smiled warmly as he spoke "As often as you want~" Slowly leaned over her,placing one hand, against her far hip, and one against the side of her closest to him, and slowly he began pushing them gently in opposing directions, one hand going away from him, and one closer,  he applied a small amount of pressure and moved up her back, this was an act of gently kneading the flesh, and after a few moments, his hands were recovered in oil, as he prepared to move onto her arms. Blushing a bit subtly as he heard her moan.

But he had to focus, he wasn't done just yet~* - Sat Sep 26 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) was definately having trouble, his heart was racing, and he felt his body definately heating up. And occasionally he had to stop to catch his breath, he could only maintain his focus so long when it came to Lera. And slowly his hand moved to her arm, with gentle caresses and rubs. He wanted to just jump onto the bed with Lera---Part of him was definately telling him to do so. But he was trying to hold off for as long as he could. Wanting Lera to enjoy herself for as long as possible.* - Sat Sep 26 20:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) blinked as he was pulled and it was almost a sigh of relief that escaped his lips, as he was pulled atop of her. 

"Neither can I!" He declared.

Attempting to kiss her hard, and passionately.* - Sat Sep 26 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) was helping himself out of his clothes with her aid, tossing them aside. As he was left in the nude, alongside of her, being taken in the moment, he allowed himself to be taken away by the emotions he was feeling and a deep desire for Lera.* - Sat Sep 26 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) also wasted no time, exploring her body, feeling her warmth against his. He took in her scent, her touch, and taste. And relished in all of it, not wanting this moment to end.* - Sat Sep 26 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) curse these Pg-13 Movies!* - Sat Sep 26 21:02:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Well I am off. - Sat Sep 26 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: If no one has a mask, I might take up Mamoru on that spar. - Sat Sep 26 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: <*Sigh*> - Sat Sep 26 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I guess I'll spar with you Mamoru. - Sat Sep 26 23:42:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Niza--sensei. - Sun Sep 27 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Could we train a bit more? - Sun Sep 27 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I have nothing else to teach at the moment though. - Sun Sep 27 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: How about a spar? - Sun Sep 27 00:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I suppose we can spar. - Sun Sep 27 00:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I haven't spared in my entire life. - Sun Sep 27 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: This should be interesting. - Sun Sep 27 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: .... - Sun Sep 27 00:07:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Wheere too? - Sun Sep 27 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: We can go to the training fields. - Sun Sep 27 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It's in use. - Sun Sep 27 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Oh...right. - Sun Sep 27 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Hm... - Sun Sep 27 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Nowhere else comes to mind, unless you wish to do it here. - Sun Sep 27 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Shall we just head south then? - Sun Sep 27 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I have an old house which we can use. - Sun Sep 27 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Alright. We can head there then. - Sun Sep 27 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I plan to use only my Newer Techniques. - Sun Sep 27 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Need practice with them. - Sun Sep 27 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Understandable. - Sun Sep 27 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Most of them are higher end. - Sun Sep 27 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: But I'm confident in your ability to dodge. - Sun Sep 27 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Right. Should be fine. - Sun Sep 27 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'll let you start us off. - Sun Sep 27 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) felt the sudden gale wind, which did in fact knock him to the ground, he rolled a few times before immediately he got to his feet. Inhaling followed by a deep exhale, he decided to shake it off, as his hands moved together to make a single handseal, he wasn't as foolish as most others, but hegathered his chakra before sending it outward, with the creation of two clones.  One of the two, immediately channeled it's chakra to the soles of it's feet before leaping high into the air.

The second, extended their hand towards Niza, and released a small ball of wind at his person, which if connected would create some...Interesting consequences.* - Sun Sep 27 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) smiled as Niza seemed to split his vision at least away from him, immediately he began charging forward. The clone which had taken to the air had begun channeling chakra to it's leg as it began falling down towards Niza with an astonishing amount of speed, the chakra forming almost a razor sharp edge around it, as it aimed to collide with Niza's air bullet, and press forward. Meanwhile, the second clone was successfully dealt with. The real Seisuke, reached for the hilt of Samehade.

Drawing it from it's bindings, he ran forward, aiming to clear the gap which had formed between the two of them.* - Sun Sep 27 00:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) watched as his clone was punched in the face rendering his technique fairly useless, but regardless it gave him the time he needed to successfully clear the gap between him and Niza channeling the chakra into the soles of his feet. He shot himself upwards, Samehade in hand, as he approached Niza, he swung his blade Horizontally in an attempt to hit Niza along his side, hoping that his clone would be used as an adequate distraction from the original shooting towards him.* - Sun Sep 27 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a deep breath and nodded his head, Samehade had connected with Niza, and thus sapped some of his chakra. He felt Gravity beginning to work, as his feet touched the ground he looked to Niza wondering if maybe he should sheath this blade, in hindsight it wasn't very...Spar friendly, but he shrugged his shoulders Niza would definately be fine to continue. So the male decided to in fact, sheath his blade before charging Niza bare handed this time.* - Sun Sep 27 01:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) entered a similar stance to Niza,  as he approached, upon doing so. Seisuke aimed to send an open palm towards the center of Niza's chest, an oddly direct strike, any sensor would notice a steady flow of chakra building up to the male's hands as he attempted his strike, he knew it was definately foolish to challenge such a skilled Taijutsuist head on, but he had to prepare to lose big to gain big, so he wasted no time with his attack.* - Sun Sep 27 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) smiled a bit as he noticed Niza aiming to use the backside of his hand, he had anticipated that, but he didn't actually know how to follow up. And as such this hesitation allowed the attack to connect with his throat, leaving him winded momentarily as he staggered backwards a bit open for another attack, as he tried to re-fill his lungs with oxygen.* - Sun Sep 27 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) felt Niza's hand connect with his chin, quite litterally knocking him onto his butt, as he hit the ground, he felt his senses shift a bit, he was definately in pain more than he had ever experienced in his life but he'd survive, but he took a deep breath, inhaling followed by an exhale, he was definately in a bad position. But he decided to use that technique again,  he honestly hated relying on the Clone technique, but he made the seal once more and conjured a single clone. Which stood by his side, taking a deep breath he needed a moment to regroup for now as well but he had a plan.* - Sun Sep 27 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) took a deep breath and the moment he saw Niza preparing to use a technique he immediately began moving kicking off his foot, along with his clone, both of them slammed their hands in unison utilizing the great break through, as they attempted to simply overwhealm him in unison with one strong Gale Palm, as they attempted to follow up and clear the distance between them.* - Sun Sep 27 01:38:08 2015
