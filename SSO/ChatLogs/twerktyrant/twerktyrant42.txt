<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) narrows her eyes, her hands suddenly came together to formulate a single handseal. "Alright then, we must fight then..unfortunately.." the little girl remarked before pursing her lips and allowing a large fireball to hurdle from her lips, intent on slamming into Hiro. 

She had no idea the skills her opponent had possessed, but she had assumed he used fire as a weapon seeing as how the wall was rekt by a fire technique....


--She needed to test the waters * - Wed Nov 25 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watches as her fireball was met with equal strength, her eyes coming to a close. "I see...this won't be as easy as I thought then..." the little girl remarked, slowly opening her eyes to reveal a change...an immature sharingan now lay within her eyes. 

"You've made a mistake, attacking Sunagakure with the likes of edge...do you even know what he wants, are your goals even similar?" she remarked, her hands slamming together in order to formulate a small set of handseals. 

Immediately following, fire attempted to coil around Hiro as chakra was transferred around his being, using both his auditory and visual senses as a crutch to enact the jutsu...

Should he be caught, he'd be trapped within genjutsu, one which pulled at his deepest fears. * - Wed Nov 25 21:11:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //It was in that moment, Hiro had taken the time to break the genjutsu that Izanami advanced, bursting forth at breakneck speeds with the aid of her great fire propulsion. A split second was needed, and she took advantage of it to the fullest. 

*ZOOM* she drew her katana and coated herself in a vibrant flame, every portion of her body was lit up as she soared into Hiro. Katana drawn and flame encasing her blade, she'd violently spin, aiming to tear right through his torso with the intention of slicing him right in two, giving him not a chance in the world to even utilize Kai. 

Or so, that is what she had intended. * - Wed Nov 25 21:21:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //Widens her eyes as the massive flame streaks across the ground towards her location. "I can't combat that...no way, I don't have any techniques wide enough.....if we take that head on...we're dead for sure."


"MOVEEE!" she roared at the top of her lungs as her sharingan eyes focused themselves upon the massive wall of flame. Immediately, she took off, moving at massive speeds with the intention of avoiding the great fire annihilation. 

--She had blitzed off with the intention of avoiding bodily harm..

Flame flickered around her being as she had barely escaped its clutches, or so she had thought. The massive amount of flame had encapsulated her arm, the girls eyes widening as she screamed in agony, losing control of her great fire propulsion mid flight, sent hurdeling off to the side, smacking into the sand with a couple of heavy thuds, eventually coming to a skidding stop, leaving a trail of destruction in her wake..

"A-agh..." Izanami groaned as she attempted to slowly pick herself up, only to find that her arm was burned beyond help...the burn was so great that her nerves were literally shot, the adrenaline rushing through her system the only thing keeping her from passing out. It was over, it was at that moment that Izanami finally understood the gap between their power. "M-m-..." immediately she dropped unto her face, proceeding to release a blood curdeling scream. 

She had failed, not only herself but her village, and most importantly her late brother. "I-i can't lose...I have to protect my village...I have to protect Tetsumis memory..." the little girl mumbled with a facefull of sand. "I can't die here..I don't want to die here, not yet, not yet, not yet!" the girl remarked, tears now cascading down her face, mixing with the charred sand below. 

"T-Tetsumi...please..." she murmered as strands of her once prestine white hair lay strung aroudn her body in a wired mess..

"Help...me.." * - Wed Nov 25 22:05:39 2015

Izanami was defeated both mentally and physically at this point, she couldn't help but feel as though she had failed herself and her village. 

The girl then proceeded to lay her head into the sand, her useless arm laying at her side. * - Wed Nov 25 22:57:42 2015
