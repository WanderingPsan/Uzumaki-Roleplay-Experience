<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: M'kay. - Wed Oct 21 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) takes a hold of the leaf she was just given, her onyx colored eyes falling upon the vegetation. First, she had wondered where Marissa got the leaf from, but quelled the question from her mind when she thought of the several floral shops in town. "Hm...just using our chakra? So cool..." she thought to herself, hoping her experience with fire natured chakra would give her a bit of leverage over wind. 

Thus, she began, concentrated on splitting the leaf...but, all her concentration was met with utter failure, the girl staring at her leaf in silence. By no means did she quit however. * - Wed Oct 21 04:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: W-wow...nothing happened... - Wed Oct 21 04:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: It's alot harder than I thought.. - Wed Oct 21 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //IZanami contuned to ponder why she hadn't of atleast drawn upon a simple gust of wind, not even a brisk of air washed over her being. Could she have been this inept at the wind natured element? She then closed her eyes and began to sharpen her focus on the element at hand, the young girl making sure to completely block out any outside sources of interference. 

"Concentrate..." she thought, her mind subconciously focusing on wind and wind alone. The leaf in her hand began to rustle, developing an extremely miniscule cut. She was seemingly making progress. * - Wed Oct 21 05:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: . . . .  - Wed Oct 21 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: This is harder then I thought it would be. - Wed Oct 21 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: The wind Nature is not as soft as you would expect - Wed Oct 21 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) narrowed her eyes as the miniscule cut was formed, the young silver haired girl capable of feeling out her progress, even if it was insignificant. "I made a little one..I can feel it...but I need to cut it all the way in half or i'm not getting it right.." she thought, her face contorting just slightly, clearly reflecting her level of concentration. 

She pressed on, aiming to agument the level of chakra she had placed into the wind nature; hopefully this would allow her to form an even bigger cut than before. The cut within the leaf gradually grew once again, creeping further across the small piece of vegetation.

--This practice was hard indeed, probably one of the hardest things she has done. * - Wed Oct 21 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: It can be gentle, but it can also be stern. The wind will alwas want to work agasint you. . You must learn to work with it. .  - Wed Oct 21 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: be the breeze - Wed Oct 21 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Love the breeze - Wed Oct 21 05:09:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: and yes. .Actually I or Iza can - Wed Oct 21 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Really? That'd be awesome! - Wed Oct 21 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) would proceed to grip the leaf by both hands at this point, a few beads of sweat accumulating upon her brow, a vein pulsating about her left temple. "Izanami, come on you can do this.." she stated within her mind, more or less giving herself a pep talk-a means to get herself actively training, actively progressing towards a succesful use of wind natured chakra. 

Izanami, was prodigious in nature, and excelled in all things ninja, so failure for her wasn't an option. Had she failed, she wouldn't be able to live it down. After idle moments of concentration, a soft whisk of air passed right over the leaf, literally slicing it in half. 

Izanami had finally found success in her approach. "I got it!" she yelped. * - Wed Oct 21 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: That's good Izanami! - Wed Oct 21 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: That's great Iza!~ I knew you could do it. .  - Wed Oct 21 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: so I will start you off with Chakra flow.. You already know Chakra flow Fire. . So it should be an easy stepping stone into the world of wind jutsu - Wed Oct 21 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Mmm, right. - Wed Oct 21 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) turns towards Marrisa with a serious expression, her sliced leaf in hand. "I'm ready." * - Wed Oct 21 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) catches said scroll and immediately takes a seat, criss-cross applesauce. She began to study her ass off. * - Wed Oct 21 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: . . .  - Wed Oct 21 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Do you all think I'll be remembered when I die? - Wed Oct 21 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: What kinda question is that bitch? - Wed Oct 21 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) stops reading for a second and glances over at Marrisa. "Don't say that like you're planning on dying.." she stated softly with a frown. "But...you'll be remembered, of course..." she stated before proceeding to read.
 
Iza hated talking about death, it really didnt sit well with her. * - Wed Oct 21 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Of course. I'll probably live long after you've died and I'll definitely remember you. - Wed Oct 21 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: I'm sure you will be. - Wed Oct 21 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) proceeds to continue to read through the scroll whilst she takes casual breaks to converse with Saeza, hiroshi, and Marrisa. More or less however, her focus would've been more inclined towards the scroll. * - Wed Oct 21 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) smiles as she soaks up the information presented upon the page like a little sponge; her eyes beamed with intentions of gaining knowledge, she was clearly in her element when she was learning ninjutsu. * - Wed Oct 21 05:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) continues to read upon ehr scroll, the girl finally obtaining enough information to actually put the jutsu to use. "I-I think i've got it.." she thought, taking out a single kunai and then attempting to force a strong wind natured chakra unto it. 

Though, she didn't really invoke a strong flow onto it, as her mastery over wind was rather..shitty to be blunt. * - Wed Oct 21 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) takes the scroll and begins to read it again, once again nodding towards Marrisa. "Hm.." she hummed as she sat down and opened the scroll, her silky white hair cascading down her back. "Let's see..." the girl hummed, aiming to capture most of the information once again. 

She began to avidly read the contents of the scroll, her onyx colored eyes coming to a narrow. "Marrisa is so nice...I wonder what happened to her to make her so nice..>" Izanami thought as she continued reading.* - Wed Oct 21 05:41:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) proceeds to continue reading, her eyes barreling right over the information. Immediately, she'd begin to casually pick out key information, taking this key information and executing it in real time, aiming to apply the handseals as she ran over the information. * - Wed Oct 21 05:43:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) stares at Koji as he approaches, her eyes coming to a narrow; she had just fought somone else from her clan, and was outmatched in every way physically. 

She'd dodge the leaf whirlwind by throwing herself back, bounding right out of harms way. The moment he attempted to strike her in the arm, she'd allow it to combust, effectively putting up a viel of flame in anticipation of his attack.* - Thu Oct 22 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) would immediately propell herself backward with the aid of flame, hopefully speeding right away from Koji. Her hands would suddenly come together where they would form a singular handseal, the tiger seal.

As she was propelling herself backward, she'd launch a powerful ball of flame right for the approaching Koji. * - Thu Oct 22 03:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) clasps her hands together the moment he attempts to make contact, effectively drawing upon her new element; hopefully from her being ensued a powerful gale of isolated wind. 

Said wind would threaten to propell Koji away * - Thu Oct 22 03:32:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) would reply with a similar technique, aiming to intercept Kojis with her own, though of course hers was augmented by the fact that she had a veil of flame covering her entire body. 

-Though, it was strange...she rarely went head to head with people in taijutsu, especially if they were so much larger than herself. * - Thu Oct 22 03:47:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) would have been thrown to the ground, the girl wincing as she rolls across the sand. "Agh!" she groaned as she skid to a stop by bracing herself with her hands and feet alike. 

"Dangit..." she remarked, the shroud of flame immediately dropping. "Y-yeah, of course!" she stated, her hands coming together to form a single handseal, a clone appearing at her side. * - Thu Oct 22 03:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) obviously didnt have enough reflex to dodge all thirty two of the strikes, and thus she laid subject to every single strike, wincing with each one that connected. It felt like the assault would last an eterinity before she was finally sent hurdeling back, landing back first in the sand with a heavy thud. 

As for the clone it simply disappeared.* - Thu Oct 22 04:04:28 2015
