<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watches as her blade creaked and wined under Hiroshis strength. "Even coated in earth it's barely withstanding a blow...meaning I can't afford to get hit even once..." Izanami thought, having somewhat grasped Hiroshis physical aptitude. 

That being said, her blow was detered, and another strike was sent hurdeling her way. Immediately she pushed herself off of the base of the blade and over the strike at her chest, the girl continiously rotating like a little top as she spun off to the side. 

Had she been able to avoid the strike, she'd land on the sand in a crouched position, bracing herself with her one good arm. 

--"Hm..." the girl hummed before reaching into her weapons pouch, grabbing at a total of three shuriken, each wedged between the folds of her fingers. With a quaint flick of the wrist, she launched said shuriken, two aiming for Hiroshis left and right shoulders respectively, and one launched directly at his head. * - Sun Dec  6 06:14:36 2015

"Hm..." the girl hummed before adjusting her narrowed eyes towards her opponent. "Weights?" she remarked within her head as Hiroshi dropped the turtle shell right off his back. 

"Well alright then." the girl stated aloud before adjusting her one good arm, allowing it to sway at her side. -"As long as he's getting serious...so will I.." she thought as her eyes softened, yet simultaneously gained a more focused look within them. It was clear things were about to kick up.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watches as Hiroshi draws what appeared to be a small pellet, the girls eyes coming to a narrow as it slammed into the ground. Smoke began to coat the area now, leaving anyones sight near useless at this point. Luckily, Izanami had both her ears and senses to compensate for her lack of sight, atleast, partially so. 

"Hm..." she hummed as she attempted to hone in on his chakra, inable to pinpoint an exact location, her lack of experience with sensing leaving her at a disadvantage. 

She too however had possessed the ability to traverse through earth. The little girl immediately sank into the ground, right alongside Hiroshi. That being said, an underground battle would soon take place. * - Sun Dec  6 06:33:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watched as Hiroshi approached, the girl simply extending her hand out towards the boys position, or where she had assumed him to be. "Hm!" she grunted as a spark raced from her open palm; the spark jolted through the softened earth, traveling only slightly before erupting into a small yet violent explosion. 

The small explosive combustion would most likely rocket Hiroshi out of the ground, and as such, Izanami would catch the residual blast of what was to come, she too tossing herself out of the earth. 

Had this all been succesful, she'd find herself airbourn, performing a few flips in order to stabalize herself before she hit the ground. * - Sun Dec  6 06:39:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) immediately took the kunai from her mouth with her one arm and threw it with deadly accuracy, the kunai moving right towards Hiroshi as she herself plummeted down towards the starchy trap Hiroshi had prepared. 

--Not today.

Suddenly, Izanami was thrust forward with a vibrant flame, her body flickering through the air as she moved in line with the kunai she had thrown just moments ago. Had she succesfully caught it, she'd speed past Hiroshi with the intent of slicing right into his thigh, leaving a small wound of the sort. 

She'd skid to a stop thereafter, placing herself far away from Hiroshis position. * - Sun Dec  6 06:48:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) skids to a stop, the girl slowly turning around to face Hiroshi. "Not everything." the little girl responded with a small grin, giving the kunai in her hand a quaint toss. 

That being said, shed toughen her gaze even more. * - Sun Dec  6 06:54:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) "I've never once used this in a battle without much concern for my own life, but i'll use it for this moment, and this moment only. Father taught me not to only rely on my eyes, but here I will only allow them to aid my abilities I already have!" the girl remarked, her eyes closed all the while. 

Immediately, as the shuriken soared forth, her eyes snapped open, revealing an immature sharingan; something that was probably only visible by Hiroshi at this point in time. 

--It was time to get serious now, this time it was going to get real. Izanami flickered from view once more, this time using her fire propulsion ability to get her out of harms way of the shuriken. Unlike last time, she moved at a much more fierce rate then before, even the most trained of eyes would have a hard time tracking her position.

She completely sped around the wind jutsu, moving far enough to even reach her opponents back as she skid to a stop, her body steaming from the intense heat as she attempted to send a ball of flame right into his back. This ball of flame packed enough concussive force to rock him right from his feet. 

--She was also well aware of the trap, noting she too was behind it. * - Sun Dec  6 07:06:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watched as Hiroshi began to turn around, her eyes prompting her to the build up of chakra present throughout his body. "Is it possible he can actually follow me? Or is he simply trying to predict where i'd be." she thought within her head before immediately jolting off to the side, swinging her arm forth, aiming to send a torrent of flame at his side, aiming to once again send him hurdeling away. 

It was clear she wasn't messing around anymore.

"Toh!" she yelped as she applied her great fire propulsion technique in a much different way. The girl cast the fire behind her limb, aiming to increase the speed at which the attack was thrown. 

Thus, she swung at Hiroshis head, aiming to send his face right into the dirt. * - Sun Dec  6 07:26:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) --*Boom* that was the moment Hiroshi had finally slipped up, which allowed for Izanami to make her own decesive strike. Hiroshi would find his brain rattled by intense strength which would most likely send him crumbling into the dirt; but of course, through her calculated observations, she was positive she wouldn't permenantly injure him with this technique.

"My mother is dead aswell, aswell as my brother, Tetsumi. I have to become a chunnin for not only his sake, but for my younger siblings aswell. I owe it to everyone who has supported me this far to ascend in rank, and I don't intend on letting it slip by me." she retorted before attempting to send another bolt of lightning.
