<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: -omit- - Sat Nov 14 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) narrows her eyes but for a brusque moment, her onyx colored eyes focusing themselves on Leras being. "Alright, i've never really fought her, so I don't know what she can do...so I better play it on the safe side." Izanami thought as she removed her bow sword. 

With a gentle flick of the wrist, she set her bowsword into the sand; her hands then suddenly jolted together to formulate a total of five handseals..


--After formation of the handseals, Izanami would advance. The little girl would speed forth across the sand at her top speed, which by her standards were just a bit above average. Her katana was slightly drawn, in preperation to either attack, or prepare an attack. 

She was at Leras side in a matter of moments. 

--Hmph! She swung, aiming to send a blunt strike into Leras side. * - Sat Nov 14 07:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) narrowed her eyes as Leras skin suddenly took on properties akin to that of toughened diamond. "What the..." the little girl thought as her katana was ultimately rendered useless. Of course, she was struck in the head and thus her kawarimi was activated. 

Izanami was replaced with her bowsword...

"So...physical attacks aren't going to work much at all...noted." Izanami thought with a little grin. Immediately, Izanami sheathed her weapon and performed a single handseal.

From her lips suddenly came hurdeling a massive ball of flame, though of course, she was holding back a large portion of her power. * - Sat Nov 14 07:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) widens her eyes as her kataon jutsu were met with suiton. "Dangit..I forgot she knew how to use water..." the little girl thought with a small smack of her lips. Immediately, the girl would thrust into the air with the added help of flame used as miniature jets. 

These jets would send her rocketing into the air, hopefully high above the water which was coming right at her. 

Whilst in the air, Izanami would propell herself right back down at Lera, moving at immense speeds all the while. Should she have enough time to reach her, the little girl would simply attempt to bludgeon her in the stomach with the blunt end of her blade.* - Sat Nov 14 07:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) had released the technique as it had served its purpose. Almost immediately, Izanami would find herself suddenly taking on more weight. "What the.." Izanami thought, her eyes coming to a narrow as she were touched. 

Immediately, flame would flicker around her being, a defense mechanism she commonly used in order to force people to take some distance. She had only hoped her flames were strong enough to get a little effect out of Lera. * - Sat Nov 14 08:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Only if he could do that... - Sat Nov 14 08:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Jeesh...when your kid niece surpasses you.. - Sat Nov 14 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Gotta work harder... - Sat Nov 14 08:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) releases her fire, heaving a heavy sigh as she struggle to lift herself. Her face was scrunched, and her body teetering. It was clear the added weight was something she's never really experienced before. 

"What kind of technique is this..." she thought. * - Sat Nov 14 08:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) gets up and dusts herself off, clearly winded from her highspeed movement aswell. She suffered a bit of damage aswell, moving at such intense speeds with a fragile body wasn't good for her. 

"Hmm..gotta work on that.." she thought, her eyes trailing back over towards Lera. Her shroud had dissapted. * - Sat Nov 14 08:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) stares at Marrisa, her eyes immediately catching unto the wiggling blade behind her. "....What the.."  Izanami thought. 

Immediately, she'd create two clones. These two clones would speed forth with the intention of meeting Lera in close combat. One aimed for a high spear kick, the other aimed for a low sweeping kick at her ankles. * - Sat Nov 14 08:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) widened her eyes as her clones were struck down. "Well that's not good.." the girl thought, clearly against attacking Lera head on now. "Welp, guess i'll have to keep my distance for sure now..." the girl thought, her eyes coming to a narrow. 

She reached into her weapons pouch and drew four shuriken. 

With a quick flick of the wrist, and a little addition of flame natured chakra, she'd throw all of them for her clones. * - Sat Nov 14 08:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) grins, the girl simply slapping her hands together to form an even greater fireball, the fireball rocketing right towards the girls wind style jutsu. * - Sat Nov 14 08:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) notices that Lera infact....wasn't there anymore at all, the girl immediately thinking to freakout. "I couldn't have burned her alive, noooo..." she then however had collected her thoughts and went about the multiple scenarios that could have taken place. 

"Maybe she's just hiding...but where.." shed think, closing her eyes. Here, she'd begin to concentrate and focus....using her lackluster sensing abilities to heighten her depth of perception, if even slightly. * - Sat Nov 14 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) immediately bounds upward the moment she felt Leras immense presence beneath her, she was far too keen as to what was going to happen next, simply based on her many spars with Trilliam. 

Hopefully, she'd have the reflexes to leap out of the way. If not, she'd be caught and pulled under of course. 

Had she escaped, she'd skid across the ground, awaiting Leras next course of action. 

"Maybe I'll finally get to test my abilities.." * - Sat Nov 14 08:39:40 2015

The shuriken were then skillfully manipulated around his body, starting at his arms in order to bind them to his sides in order to hinder his movement. With little to no hesitation, she'd tuck and wrap her end of the wire around her katana. 

She'd jam the katana into the solid dirt below in order to establish a makeshift base in which she'd draw strength from in order to keep the male from simply taking off with her. Had she been succesful, he'd be pinned. * - Sun Nov 15 04:43:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) widens her eyes as MIstunara formed a weapon based purely on chakra, or so it had seemed. Izanami had never before seen such shape manipulation and consistency with chakra, it was truly shocking. "That's a really impressive technique...did she make that herself?" the little girl thought before her opponent came rushing towards her. 

Izanami would react accordingly by lifting her blade, simultaneously moving backwards in order to avoid the intial strike. Immediately, she'd bound forth after narrowly dodging the first strike in order to send one of her own. She'd swing diagonally at her shoulder, allowing a bit of leway in her strike in order to give her room to dodge, if she even needed it.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) narrows her eyes as Mitsunara avoids her intial strike. "Hm..." the girl hums, clearly focused on the battle at hand. Izanami, would then pull back the moment Mitsunara had began her move. The little seven year old girl, would seemingly mirror Mitsunaras physical movements, aiming to recreate the same attack she had used, in the same instance, but almost in reverse. She did it this way in order to parry the blow at her legs, striking with an equally quick attack. 

The two blades would most likely collide, Izanami a bit fearful of what was to come if she made contact with such a strange blade. * - Sun Nov 15 05:36:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) skids away, her little body moving right across the sand at an intense rate of speed. Immediately, she'd hault her gathered momentum by jamming her sword into the sand. 
"Huff.." she sighed for a moment before adjusting her onyx colored eyes towards Mitsunara, a small grin possessing her face. "You're really good with a sword miss.~ And thank you, I try to do my best." she remarked. 

With a quick flick of the wrist, she adjusted her katana, allowing for it to hover at her side, her grip loosening ever so slightly. 

--*Pwoof*--

Flame suddenly danced to life around her blade, making things a bit more lethal than before. "Do not hold back okay?" * - Sun Nov 15 05:43:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Bye Ai. . .  - Sun Nov 15 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Mhm... - Sun Nov 15 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watches as Mitsunara lunges, the little girls calculative gaze focused upon her movements. "Hm..." she hummed, her body instinctively reacting by lerching to the side. Whilst lerching to the side, Izanami had avoided a good proprtion of the attack, the sword ripping right through her black cloak. 

Izanami thus reacted with a swing of her own fire imbued sword, aiming to send it hurdeling into the womans own, aiming to test the strength of her chakra enhanced blade to her own manifested chakra blade. * - Sun Nov 15 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) adjusts her stance as the technique came hurdeling for her position once more, her arms tucking themselves in towards her body, allowing for her sword to take the slash, the two swords colliding once again, the fire sword against her etheral blade. Izanami stood tall as could be, her face holding a rather...vexed expression, as if she didn't understand what had just happened. * - Sun Nov 15 05:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) grins as Mitsunara disperses her blade, the girl indeed not anticipating such an attack. Without even a hint of emotion or physical movement, Izanami acted. 

Fire would jump from her blade and take form, the form of a small fist in order to ram right into the womans torso before she had a chance to actually slug the little girl. 

The fire was quick and precise, almost like a small pistol...It wouldn't burn, nor hurt her much, it simply served the purpose of pushing her back. * - Sun Nov 15 05:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) noticed as the fire did virtually nothing. "....Holy..." immediately, the girl was immediately punched, her head reeling back. A bit of blood trickled from her nose, her body suprisingly durable for a seven year old girl. 

"Oof!" she yelped, her eyes widening as a bit of daze ran through her head. "This is bad..I was holding back on my ninjutsu, but it looks like I need to give it a bit more oomph..." she remarked as she struggled through her daze, fire suddenly encapsulating her being at a much more intense rate. She raised her hand, allowing for a powerful explosion of flame to erupt upon mitsunars body...

This one..was much more powerful, enough to send them both hurdeling away from eachother infact. * - Sun Nov 15 06:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) huffs a bit, her eyes adjusting themselves towards Mitsunara, the little girl blown back by her own attack aswell, creating enough distance between the two to allow Izanami a bit more time to react. 

"Well..she's crazy, confirmed...." Izanami thought, her hands coming together, forming a single handseal. "Hhmph!" she yelped in order to gather Mitsunaras attention. 

--Accordingly, sand and fire alike would swivel around her being; hopefully Izanamis genjutsu would take hold. If Mitsunara was caught, she'd be trapped in a genjutsu that revealed her worst nightmare...

For her Izanami could only think her worst nightmare was a world withought fights. * - Sun Nov 15 06:19:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) attempts to back away as Mitsunara begins swinging at the air, clearly going batshit crazy. "Well then...." Izanami thought, her face contorting just slightly. The girl attempted to hop away, giving herself a considerable amount of distance from the primal being now before her. 

Izanami couldn't feel anything but sympathy for the woman, whatever she saw, it was surely something gruesome for her psyche. "Now, we wait for her to deal with it..." the little girl thought, her eyes narrowing as she observed the woman, aiming to paint a picture about whatever she was going through in her mind. 

--She wasn't about to get sliced up today, no sir. * - Sun Nov 15 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: Maybe putting her in that genjutsu was a bad idea. Didn't know her reaction would be this severe... - Sun Nov 15 06:29:32 2015
