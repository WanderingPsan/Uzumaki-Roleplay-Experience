<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) walks off to be alone ocne more, the little girl heaving a heavy sigh. "Alright, time yet again to practice,what will I use this time..." she thought whilst simultaneously adjusting her onyx colored eyes towards her feet. "Eh...doesn't really matter I suppose, i'll just use the same combination i've been using." the girl remarked as she took a step forward. 

"Wait!" she thought, her face lighting up as though she were struck with a brilliant idea. "I could try using jutsu in conjunction with my great fire propulsion...I need to become more skilled than I already am if I want to land more hits." she remarked, the girl beaming a small grin before giving a nod. She then lifted herself into the air, propelling herself high above her position with the aid of fire jets. 

She zoomed upward where she'd eventually level out by altering the scope of her flame. "Hm.." the girl hummed as she glanced at her one good arm. "Guess i'll get started." she remarked before extending her arm out towards the vast expanse of sand before her. She intended on repeating the same excersize she had used once before, but this time in mid-air. 

A befitting silence loomed overhead as Izanami hovered above Sunagakure no Sato, the small girls face tightened and her eyes narrowed as she observed the scenery before her. "Hm..." she hummed, extending her index and middle finger whilst drawing back all other fingers. That being said, she began fummeling quite a bit of chakra within the tips of her fingers, moreso concentrating it into a single singularity composed of raiton chakra. 

The singularity before her fingers took the form of an orb, a vibrant, crackling orb of lightning natured chakra which beckoned to be released. "Hmph!" she grunted before allowing the raiton chakra to explode forth, snapping free of her fingers restraints as it zoomed through the air, snapping and crackling as it soared on ahead. It was clear she was getting much more proficient with lightning style ninjutsu, that much was sure. 

Immediately, Izanami soared forth with the aid of her great-fire propulsion, aiming to apply enough speed to soar past her lightning bullet. She blitzed past the bullet in a vibrant display of viscious flame, the girl rotating to a stop as she positioned herself right  before her lightning bullet, the little girls eyes narrowed upon the jutsu she had launched prior to this technique. 

She cocked her arm forth, allowing for her index and middle finger to point right at the lightning bullet she had shot off just moments before. This in mind, she immediately shot a bullet of lightning right towards the one already soaring towards her.The two bullets of lightning collide and explode upon impact, sending stray sparks of raiton chakra in odd directions. 

Izanami watched as her two attacks collided and produced a vibrant display of raiton natured affinity. "Perfect." she remarked with a small grin, her eyes lighting up just slightly as she saw her techniques make their mark. "However, there is still a bit of leeway in my timing, that can't do..." she remarked as she slowly hovered back towards the ground, relaxing on her fire release in order to land daintly upon the sand. * - Thu Dec  3 05:52:51 2015
