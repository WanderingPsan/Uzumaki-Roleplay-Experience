<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Wiping out Bandit Camps. - Mon Sep 28 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Taking them all prisoners. - Mon Sep 28 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) stumbles across the bandit camp, her eyes falling upon said bandits they were charged with dispatching. "Alright...." she remarked, her eyes twinkling with purpose. Immediately, her hands reached into her weapons pouch where she'd grab at a plethora of prepped shuriken for the purpose of capturing the bandits. 


Her method made doubly sure that she wouldn't injure anybody. This would in turn give her the ability to train her reflexes and aim aswell, even giving her a bigger reason for doing this. So, she began, giving a quick whip of the right arm, allowing for two shuriken to fly forth from her grasp. 

These shuriken zipped about, one zooming right past the shoulder of several bandits who turned around in confusion. With a quick flick of the finger she had expertly manipulated the shuriken around a good portion of them, making sure that the wire pivoted around their torsoes so their arms were binded to their sides. She repeated this process for another set of bandits, grouping them in threes. 

The wire, wrapped around the bandits in tandem, the girl effectively herding them into a single area where she'd round them up like cattle, forcing them to be pinned to eachother back to back, front to front, it didn't matter. The bandits were helpless, each one of them appauled that a little six year old girl was capable of such deft manipulation. 

She milked the process over and over from each appearant bandit, grouping them by the many. She attempted to group them in a fashion which would prevent them from helping eachother escape by passing kunai or what not. After binding them with the wire and shuriken, she'd stick the shuriken into the ground and add a supporting kunai through the circle of the throwing star as a weight to make sure they couldnt dislodge the shuriken and walk away. After all that, she had appeared succesful in taking down her portion, now only awaiting the success of the others. * - Mon Sep 28 02:29:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) wanders about a bit, aiming to break away from the line of shinobi so that she could do her own thing. She thus decided to take it upon herself to practice her new ninjutsu. She brought her thumb to her face and chomped down, drawing a bit of blood before formulating a small set of handseals. 

After forming the handseals, she slammed her palm down unto the ground and yelled. "Summonin' jutsu!" 

A black kanji radiated outward from her palm before a small explosion of smoke followed. 

After the smoke cleared...a small monkey appeared. 

The monkey gave Izanami a quick glance and hopped unto her shoulder. * - Mon Sep 28 03:15:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) continues to practice her summoning techniqe, aiming to master it show she can pass it on to her step-mother, Berith. Her hands came together in a flurry of handseals she easily completed. Just like before, she didnt rely on using the blood just for the sake of not wanting to pester the animals. She slammed her hand onto the ground, a black kanji radiating from the centermost point of her palm. 

Nothing happened. * - Mon Sep 28 05:39:12 2015

She slammed her hand on the ground once more and casted another circular set of kanji.* - Mon Sep 28 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) stops for a moment and retracts her hand, the girl bringing her hands to about chest level where she would once again formulate handseals.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) adjusts her position so that she was a considerable distance away from the bystanders. She then took out two shuriken, holding one in each hand. Both of her shuriken were specially prepped with wire on their ends. 

With a quick swing of the arm, she launched the shuriken and began to manipulate them, her mastery over the technique allowing for her to manipulate each shuriken with a single finger. * - Tue Sep 29 06:16:19 2015

She wasn't too thirsty for a sparring partner, if she had to settle for training with herself then so be it. ONe thing she wouldn't do is sit around and stare into space all day, especially after making a promise to get stronger. 

She continued to manipulate the shuriken, this time adding a unique spin unto them. She concentrated her fire natured chakra into her hands before transferring the gathered energy unto the wire. * - Tue Sep 29 06:19:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) she began to twirl the wire this time around, aiming to manipulate it around and around, building up speed. The wire and shuriken eveventually became hard to discern with the naked eye, the girl giving the illusion that she were swinging ropes of fire. 

It was a little trick she began to use more frequently, finding it increasingly useful on slippery opponents. * - Tue Sep 29 06:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //Continues to swing the flaming wire, aiming to control its scope and retain the overall heat as it swung round and round, she needed to learn how to further control her flames so that she could use them in any which way she wanted. 

"I wonder...if I could even make daddys fire shroud a better technique when I get better." 

A small smile crept unto the little girls face as she thought about her father. * - Tue Sep 29 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) relaxes the fire natured chakra which ran along the wire, the fire which had once coated the translucent wire had flickered and dissipated into nothingness. "Hmmm...." she hummed as she let the shuriken simply land with a heavy thud into the sand before her, their elegant dance above her head cut short. 

"What should I practice next?" she inquired * - Tue Sep 29 06:46:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //*BOOM* As the two were caught in their conversation, a plume of sand exploded before them, filling the air with the little earth particles, obscuring sight of what breached the earth but for a brief moment. A wave of kinetic energy washed over the ground, sending Izanami hurdeling back, to which she responded by performing a small flip and landing on her feet with a skid. Something had attacked. 

Low and behold, it was a giant scorpion, her eyes widening as she onlooked its mass. "W-wow..>" she remarked, a ghostly white complexion flushing over her face. "That's a hugeeee scorpion..." she stated, erecting her position by standing tall once more, her black cloak flowing in the sunagakure winds. She was a little six year old girl sent to brave the desert creatures of Sunagakure, perhaps she was at the wrong place?

*BOOM!* another large eruption of earth exploded at both their sides,  leaving her to turn around in order to inspect the other scorpions which had now surrounded them. There were a total of four now, just enough for the two of them to handle adequately. "Uh oh...there are more than I thought!" the young girl remarked.

Immediately, she snapped into action, spinning around to face the scorpion before her, making sure to cover Taigas backside. She thus brought her hands together at about chest level, her fingers coming together in the form of a cross, the cross a technique specific seal for the cloning technique everyone had grown accustomed to. "Shadow clone jutsu!" Izanami yelled at the top of her lungs, evenly distributing the chakra amongst her clones, calling on about two to appear at her side. 

"Get ready guys!" she yelped, all their hands thus transitioning into a string of handseals devoted for one of her favorite techniques. All three of their hands ripped through the handseals at a moderate pace, forming the required handseals for the fireball technique. All three Izanamis would lerch forth, cocking their heads towards the scorpions. Immediately, fire natured chakra would rocket forth from their gullets, taking the form of large balls of flame as they intended to hurdle right at the scorpions, threatening to explode  upon them in firey vengence should tehy connect.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) immediately hops into formation without another word, placing herself behind Yan, expecting Koji to place himself behind her aswell. 

She then expected Trilliam to be beside her as they pushed on. She was severely anxious about the mission, as she didn't really want to see any bloodshed. * - Wed Sep 30 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) continued to follow behind Yan, her eyes coming to a narrow. The little girl, found it immesenly odd that the villagers had such reactions upon seeing the Sunagakure shinobi, were they, afraid? The poverty stricken people seemed to incite alot of, inquiry within young Izanami.

Her lack of understanding of the world lead her to ask so many questions she could not formulate answers to. She had a lot to learn it seemed.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) widens her arms as the clone shoots forth, the relentless nature of the terrorist shown in full force as it swings its weapon forth with the intent to injure Yan. Luckily, Yan was more than capable of reacting, giving the girl her own set space of time to react aswell. 

She immediately leaped into the air, her right hand brandishing two shuriken. With a quick flick of the wrist she launched her shuriken, hiding one in the shadow of the other-one of the shuriken specially prepped with wire. He'd only be able to see the wire if he had a good set of eyes. 

The shuriken swerved for the real mans position. * - Wed Sep 30 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: He's scoping us out, looking to how we react. Don't show too much of your technique yet. - Wed Sep 30 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: The original is the middle building blocked by the congestion of the townfolk. There he can command his clones and watch closely those who enter the village. He's using the townfolk as shields. - Wed Sep 30 04:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) would land just behind Yan, turning so that she could watch his blindspots, if he had any. She simply watched in helplessness as the village was torn apart by several explosions. "Tch.." Izanami sucked her teeth, a wave of regret washing over her. She couldn't believe that all these innocent people were getting involved, they needen't risk their lives over shinobi business. 

"We could've saved them.." she thought as she manipulated the shuriken back towards her, choking upon the string so that she could manually swing the shuriken, the weighted weapon on the end acting as a means to make it heavier on that one end. 

She treated it much like a nanchaku at this point, prepared to launch it if need be. * - Wed Sep 30 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) retracted her shuriken and placed it in her weapons pouch. "He's gone.." she remarked, her eyes coming to a narrow. * - Wed Sep 30 05:00:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) adjusts her cloak and walks off. She proceeded to help out the civillians to the best of her ability, either by calming them down and reassuring them everything was fine, or distributing rations of food. * - Wed Sep 30 05:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) turns and glances at the child, appearing to be in a similar age range to herself. "Oh, maybe she's hun-" she stopped in her tracks, the air whisked right from her lungs as she saw the girls leg torn clean off, blood soaking the ground which she grovled upon. 

Izanamis eyes widened as she soaked in the gruesome scene, the young girl short of breath as the girl screamed in agony. 

--She began to furiously tremble as a hand was stretched out in her direction. Images of Flexus then bombarded her mind, the images of her friends death seeming to share a likeness with this young girls pain. 

Her lip quivered as she struggled to form words, the girls body seemingly inable to move. 

"W-what do I do...how..-how can I help?" * - Wed Sep 30 05:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //Having been sheltered and taught jutsu for a good portion of her life, she hadn't at all come in contact with such gruesome reality; the only reality she knew of was having a good time learning new techniques with her father. 

//
Izanamis eyes widened as the girl simply fell limp, her outstretched hand hitting the ground with a thud. It was only when the girl had lost her battle with life, did Izanami will herself to move. She shot forth and skid to a stop, her hand immediately clasping unto the deceased girls. 

"W-wait! I'm here! I'll help you I swear! Just...let me! I can...I can help you!" the girl stammered, inable to form cohearant sentences at this point. 

"Please, I can help you..don't die...I can help!" the girl frantically called, her head feverishly darting around in search of help. 

"Somone please! HELP HER!"  she cried, tears now forming in her eyes. She barely knew the girl....but she felt like, it was all her fault, the shinobis fault that she had to lose her life in such a gruesome way. * - Wed Sep 30 06:07:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If we separate them and cut off teamwork between the two, I imagine we will be more successful. After all, they are a team and wanted together, therefore they probably are more capable when together. - Wed Sep 30 18:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: True, but I'm worried about the hesitation of lethal force by Izanami. If she fails to act in a serious situation it could end badly. - Wed Sep 30 18:24:38 2015

Her mind ran rampant, inable to settle down enough for her to simply take a breather. 

She had to clear her mind, and the only way to do that was through training. * - Thu Oct  1 05:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) She walks over towards an empty spot, making sure no one saw her so she wouldn't bring about suspicion or fright. "Time to practice...I need to get stronger." the little girl whispered underneath her breath before grabbing at a shuriken within her holster. 

She let the shuriken hang from a wire, the girl giving it a light twirl. * - Thu Oct  1 05:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //She begins to twirl the shuriken faster and faster until the wire and shuriken alike were one blur, appearing as a propeller within her right hand. "Now, add the fire.." Izanami thought to herself as she began to concentrate her fire natured chakra within her right hand, allowing the flame natured chakra to flicker to life and speed down the wire. * - Thu Oct  1 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) She twirled around on a single heal, the flame which now coursed down her wire exploding to life as it engulfed both the shuriken and the wire alike, flame cascading aroudn the girls entire being as she savagely swung the shuriken around. 

The flame enshrouded the shuriken and wire, giving the appearance of a flaming propeller on her side. * - Thu Oct  1 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) takes a step back, her eyes cautiously watching the flame natured chakra which enveloped her shuriken and wire, the girl giving herself a quick nod to confirm her intent on changing the shuriken and wire over to her other hand. She slowly brought the shuriken and wire over to her other hand whilst attempting to retain its spin and fire. * - Thu Oct  1 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //Had succesfully brought the shuriken over to the other hand, retaining both adequate speed and level of katon. She had even suprised herself with how fluid her transition of the weapon was, causing for a brusque smile to appear over her face. "Hey, that wasn't as hard as I thought." the girl throught to herself whilst simultaneously attempting to pick up the speed of the spin, pumping a bit more fire natured chakra down the wire. * - Thu Oct  1 06:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) had suddenly released the shuriken, allowing it to bolt straight into the sky, its gathered speed and momentum giving it the stark appearance of a speeding flame bullet. "It's like...a shooting star..." Izanami thought to herself as she onlooked the shuriken. With a quick flick of the wrist, she had manipulated the wire in a sense she curved it around before it was allowed to return to earth under normal gravity. * - Thu Oct  1 06:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //Izanami had then suddenly lost control of the shuriken, the flaming metallic weapon snapping right off the wire, sending itself hurdeling into the ground below, slamming into it with a viscious thud. The gathered heat it had possessed upon its body had actually melted it slightly, leaving it nearly bent out of shape. 

"Huh.." she remarked before grabbing at another shuriken, aiming to test her luck with a second. * - Thu Oct  1 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) "Wait a minute.." the girl thought to herself before adjusting her overall stance and bringing her hands to overlap one another, forming a cross. This cross gave birth to a clone which came bursting from a cloud of prestine white smoke at her side. 

The clone darted before the real Izanami and assumed a position, drawing its own set of shuriken. "Let's see who gets hit first!" Izanmi yelped as she threw her shuriken, her clone reacting by throwing her own. 

The two then began to release a flurry of shuriken at one another, the sound of clings and clangs filling the air. * - Thu Oct  1 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //After a short shuriken struggle, the two opposing sides had grown weary with fatigue, their precision and aim taking a severe hit. As such, the original Izanami would slip up and miss the shuriken soaring for her, allowing it to succesfuly graze her cheek, drawing a bit of blood in the process. 

As for her clone, she was struck with a rogue shuriken and disappeared. 

"I-I think that's enough for now.." remarked the young girl as she went about collecting her weaponry. * - Thu Oct  1 06:14:36 2015
