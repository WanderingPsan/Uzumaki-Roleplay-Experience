<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) glances at Akira and gives a brief nod, acknowledging his broken arm before adjusting her attention towards Trilliam. 

"If you're able to, then I guess we can spar." she commented before giving a brusque nod. "I will use my fire style, but nothing crazy..." * - Mon Nov 23 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Well I can spar but if I do that again...Kiyoko will get mad... - Mon Nov 23 06:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Theres that weird hand seal and that weird clone again. - Mon Nov 23 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: I should ask Marrisa about that... - Mon Nov 23 06:26:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I wanna go home  - Mon Nov 23 06:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) carefully watches as Trilliam springs into action by first creating three clones. "Hm?" she hummed, wondering what kind of strategy the boy was employing this time around. 

"This should be interesting." Izanami thought, a small grin coming over her face as the clones took action. 

Immediately, the little girl drew her katana and bounded backward. Immediately, she attempted to avoid the arc of lightning which zipped toward her, the girl narrowly avoiding its advance. "Whoa...forgot how fast that was.." she thought as it zipped right by her head. 

Immediately, her eyes would catch the tail end of one of trilliams clones escaping into the ground. "What's this?" she inquired before jamming her sword into the dirt below, immediately hopping upward and standing upon its end. 

--As for the earth pillars, Izanami would bound into the air using her sword as a spring-board, her fingers coming together to perform a similar action just as Trilliams first clone would have performed, a bolt of lightning racing from her fingers to meet with her sword. Naturally, the sword would serve as a great conductor for the raiton natured chakra, allowing the bursts of lightning to pulsate right through it and into the ground.

--Hopefully Trilliams clone underground was in range. * - Mon Nov 23 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hmm.. - Mon Nov 23 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watched as more attacks were launched at her, the girl seemingly in tons of trouble being that she couldn't quite avoid something whilst in mid-air. However, thanks to her great fire propulsion technique, she'd find herself out of her pinch almost immediately. 

With one short burst release of flame from her feet, she sent herself hurdeling away from the attacks and into the wall. She rapidly spun before coming to a prompt thud on her feet, utilizing the suimen hokou no waza technique to keep herself from slipping right off. 

"Hm.....never seen that before...." she remarked with a small grin. * - Mon Nov 23 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: (a option came up) - Mon Nov 23 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: (gave me the option to copy your shit LOL_ - Mon Nov 23 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watched as the earth encircled her, a much familiar outcome. This reminded her of her early spars with Trilliam. "Earth nature is such a hassle to deal with..." Izanami thought, reaching behind her back to grab at her bowsword. "Money says hes going to launch something at me as soon as I break out of this dome." the girl thought. She immediately swiped at the earth corridor as flame flickered across her sword, aiming to create a weak point in the earth before bursting through. 

She shot through, awaiting the attacks that were sure to come for her. * - Mon Nov 23 07:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watched as the creature attempted to headbutt her, the girl responding in an appropriate fashion. She'd send her elbow right into the creatures head, applying a small burst of chakra into her strike, intially sending the creature hurdeling off in the opposing direction with some added -umph-.

"Hm.." she grunted, the girl suddenly applying a more powerful burst of chakra to her feet. To the naked and untrained eye, it'd appear as if she were eaten alive by flame..

Those who had the necesary reflexes and sharp eyes to follow would notice she'd blaze right over towards Trilliam at record speeds, aiming to place herself directly behind him. His goggles would've have most likely picked up on alot of fire, making it that much more difficult to track the girl by heat. 

A gust of hot air would overwhelm their area as Izanami touched down behind him. 

Had trilliam been inable to follow, she'd raise a kunai to his neck. * - Mon Nov 23 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) was suddenly pushed away, completely caught off gaurd by Trilliams new move. She was sent skidding across the dirt, the girl crouched , hands jammed into the ground in order to hault her momentum. 

Ultimately she came to a stop, a look of bewilderment possessing her face."He's improved, he's not as reckless before..." the girl thenafter simply grinned. 

"I guess that's good enough, you win.~" she stated * - Mon Nov 23 07:51:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) gives a brusque nod as she walks over to retreive her katana. "Restraint means we are getting better at controlling our ninjutsu." she remarked. * - Mon Nov 23 07:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm...Iza, how about a small spar with father hm?.. - Mon Nov 23 07:59:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: I dont think I remember the last time we sparred... - Mon Nov 23 08:04:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) draws her katana, allowing it to hang at her side. "Alright, here I come.." she remarked before speeding forth, reaching her father in a matter of mere seconds. 

She dug her feet into the ground and came to a skidding halt, her sword subsequently being swung for Fujitoras midsection. * - Mon Nov 23 08:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Use the force. - Mon Nov 23 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: -omit- - Mon Nov 23 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watched carefully as Fujitoras blade was drawn, her eyes briefly catching unto the weapon of choice. "It's that blade that man was using..." the girl thought, her eyes narrowing even further as she braced herself for impact, attempting to bring her weapon before her in order to avoid a direct strike. With a clang of metal, she was sent backward. 

"Alright, don't count on me holding back then.." she remarked before she propelled herself back down with the aid of fire, aiming to speed right into Fujitora with a hastened attack of her own. 

She swung diagonally. * - Mon Nov 23 08:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watched as Fujitora had simply avoided her attack. "So you want me to go faster then?" she inquired, turning around to face her father, her eyes coming to a close. "Alright, I'll do better then..." she retorted, fire suddenly picking up around her being as she blitzed forth with intense speed, aiming to move at blurring speeds towards her father. 

With a simple flick of the wrist she attacked, aiming to slice at his side. * - Mon Nov 23 08:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: He dodged mid air...without use of fight.. - Mon Nov 23 08:26:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watched as Fujitora attempted to speed past her, her body conciously reacting by conjuring flame at her side, attempting to form a solid wall of flame natured chakra in order to impede his advance. 

This of course was without the aid of handseals or general application of her hands at all. Hopefully her flame would be quick enough. * - Mon Nov 23 08:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) stops for a moment, her fire dissapatting as she listened to her father. "E-erh thank you, i've been practicing pretty hard.." the girl stated with a brusque smile. She was then told of a -sacred- ability, yet anotherone of these sharingan abilities she's yet to be able to achieve. 

"Wow..must be nice..." she thought..* - Mon Nov 23 08:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: Continue to advance...With it you'll be greater than those without it. - Mon Nov 23 08:42:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) gave a brusque nod, her eyes coming to a narrow as she threw up both ehr left and right arms in order to perform a single handseal.  A prestine white smoke erupted at both her sides, allowing for three clones to stand beside her. 

"Don't hold back too much." the clones stated, each holding a small grin. 

Then, immediately her hands came together to form a single handseal, her cheeks swelling up. "Katon..." the little girl thought as she reeled her head back. Immediately, a fireball would come hurdeling from her mouth, heading straight towards Lera. 

Clone #1: This Izanami would too slap her hands together, but instead of forming a single handseal, she would simply clap, gathering chakra in response to the original. Then, a powerful gale of wind would rush forth, aiming to plow into the fireball and accent its power as it hurdeled and crackled over towards Lera. 

Clone #2: This clone would simply stand beside Izanami, making not a single movement. 

Clone #3: Clone three would bolt off towards the right side, moving closer over towards Kiyoko and Aza would be. * - Mon Nov 23 20:07:02 2015

"Dangit.." the little girl chimed before glancing over at her clone, the clone giving a brusque nod before suddenly applying the transformation technique. The clone would transform into a single shuriken, the likes of which Izanami would brandish in her hand before taking off into the sky via great fire propulsion. She had narrowly avoided the wave...


Clone #1: Was wiped out by the wave, nothing more nothing less.

Clone #3: This clone rushes at lera from the side with increadible speed, attempted to draw its blade and launch an attack on the womans clones, using the crescent moon beheading technique in order to get the jump on them. * - Mon Nov 23 20:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Mon Nov 23 20:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) quickly tore through a total of five handseals, her cheeks expanding as she gathered a large amount of air. With a flick of the wrist, she had launched her shuriken, using her advanced skill with weaponry to allow the small weapon to zip right through the levitating shuriken around her. 

"Here goes.." Izanami thought as she then clapped her hands together, seemingly preparing a large technique in response to the shuriken surrounding her. * - Mon Nov 23 20:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Is he fucking his maid? - Mon Nov 23 20:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) // Was struck by the shuriken, the little girl crying out in pain as the shuriken hit her. With that being said, the little girls limp body began hurdeling back down towards the earth under the influence of gravity...

--She however, was then enveloped in a plume of white smoke, revealing to any onlookers a seperate Izanami in her place. Izanami had replaced herself with the henged shadow clone she had just threw, and accordingly she was hurdeling right towards the earthen wall. 

"Hmph!" she grunted, cocking back her fist and swinging it right into the wall, applying a brutal burst of chakra in order to accent her strength. That wasn't all however, her appendage was laced in a powerful flame which then only accented the strength of the blow even more. Had it been powerful enough, Izanami would punch right through the earth and send pieces of the earth construct flying. * - Mon Nov 23 20:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: Probably shouldn't mention my maid came onto me. - Mon Nov 23 20:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) widens her eyes, her hand extending itself; the girls vision was clearly obstructed by the debris floating around the air at this point, but she had one shot and she had to make it count. Her index and middle finger lay extended, the crackle and pop of raiton chakra was heard through the air as a small orb was produced before her fingers. 

Suddenly the orb was released with the intention of making contact, aiming to explode upon contact of a physical substance and send raiton chakra everywhere. Due to her close proximity, Izanami would most likely be affected too. * - Mon Nov 23 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Sorry buddy... - Mon Nov 23 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) dropped to the ground, kneeling ever so slightly, the girl noticeably panting a bit. "Whew....I have great chakra, but I can't say the same about my stamina." she thought as she grinned towards Lera. "Okay, that's it for me, you win.~" * - Mon Nov 23 20:54:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) "There.." she remarked, the girls eyes falling upon the Edge who had seperated himself from the crowd of shinobi, her eyes trained on the single entity alienating himself from danger. "Now.." the girl thought from the air, chakra suddenly exploding around her in a fit of flame, her eyes suddenly changing in demanour as she bursted forth, zipping through the air like a flamming jet. 

--She moved at obscene speeds, aiming right for Edge himself. The girl drew her katana, and began spinning like a buzzsaw, concentrating fire natured chakra into her sword all the while. The brilliant flame surrounding her being made her appear as though a literal flaming saw streaked across the sky towards Taiga. Should she meet any interference, she'd plow through whatever she could. * - Mon Nov 23 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) is impaled and stopped in her tracks, seemingly defeated. Fortunately, it was simply a clone who did the attacking, and thus it disappeared, having taken sufficient damage. * - Mon Nov 23 22:33:48 2015
