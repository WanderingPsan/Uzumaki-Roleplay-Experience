<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watched as the shuriken were thrown, her eyes immediately picking up the shuriken which her father had thrown. This right here was her forte, something she had been practicing over and over again. 

With a quick toss of her own shuriken, she had attempted to intercept all the shuriken her father had thrown with a similar method. As for the dynamic entry, well...

Flexus had to deal with that on his own.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watched as a fireball came hurdeling across the water in her direction. She was already preparing handseals for this moment, the girl having the same idea of launching her own firestyle technique at Fujitora. 

After quickly forming the handseals, she cocked her head in the fireballs direction and attempted to send one of her own. Fire exuded itself past her lips, the flame immediately growing in mass as it hurdled over towards the larger one. She had attempted to make the two flames collide, atleast holding it off a bit so Flexus could regain his bearings. * - Mon Sep 14 20:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watches as mud begins to cascae down the waterfall, something she hadnt really seen coming. "What do i do?" she remarked to herself before jolting forth, aiming to launch herself into the air with the aid of chakra. 

She'd bound right up Flexus, aiming to use the suimen technique to expedite her progress up to his head. 

She took advantage of his giant form to give herself more distance as she then lept once again, boosting herself even further then she would've if she had simply jumped from the water. 

Hopefully, she had avoided the mudflow, the girl landing with a quaint thud on the side of the waterfall. * - Mon Sep 14 21:15:56 2015

She was a bit hesitant in her attempt to injure fujitora, but she had wanted to prove to him that she was ready.

She launched the wooden shuriken with the intent of smacking him upside the head, aiming to disturb his concentration just slightly. * - Mon Sep 14 21:33:52 2015

"Lemme try this!" she remarked, the girl attempting to fire off yet another fire technique, this one was different then the last, this one was a more controlled stream of fire directed right at her father. * - Mon Sep 14 21:58:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) drew her bowsword in response to Fujitora drawing near, her dark black eyes coming to a narrow as she twirled the weapon between her fingers before catching it in both hands. 

The weapon soon found itself engulfed in a flame, though a moderately weak flame. Without much hesitation, she lept forth and swung at her fathers torso. * - Mon Sep 14 22:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) widens her eyes as Fujitora was engulfed in flame, the girl literally drawing a blank in response. 

'E-erh..." she thought, her eyes quickly darting around as she was pushed up the mountain a bit. "Uhhh..."she thought, her eyes immediately darting towards the water. 

She had simply released her chakra upon her feet and relqinuished her attempts at struggling with her father who was now coated in flame. 

She'd plummet right into the water with the intention of escaping. * - Mon Sep 14 22:24:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) brings back both her left and right hands, allowing them to delve deep into her weapons pouch where she would pull four, specific shuriken for a specific purpose. Without much hesitation, she launched all four with a flick of the wrist.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) she would suddenly tug back on her right and left hands accordingly, grasping unto translucent string only the keen eye could pick up on.

"Gather your chakra, make sure its the right nature!" she yelped.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watches as Fujitora forms a single handseal, her eyes mistakingly falling right upon the trigger.  Eerie clones thus suddenly begin to form, spawning right from the ground and what not. 

Her first reaction was to toss a shuriken at one, the moment the shuriken ripped through its being, it had multiplied. 

"It's not real?" she thought, her eyes then coming to a close. "Genjutsuuu? Maybe?" 

She then held a handseal up, attempting to perform kai upon herself to sway her from the genjutsu. Dependent upon her skill, she'd most likely be stuck and forced to fight off the clones. * - Thu Sep 17 02:11:12 2015
