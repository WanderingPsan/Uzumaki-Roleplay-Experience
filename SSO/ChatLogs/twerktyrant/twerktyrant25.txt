<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Alrighty. For the time being, I'll only use a single blade...C'mon at me whenever you're ready. - Sun Oct 25 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hm.. - Sun Oct 25 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Okay. - Sun Oct 25 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) draws her own blade, which in fact was given to her not long ago. "Here it goes.." she thought to herself as she casually adjusted the weapon between both hands, aiming to find a grip she was content with. 

After a few moments of fiddling with her handling, she lowered the weapon at her side and nodded. The nod was a means to start the training, Izanami kicking off with her right foot, applying a bit of chakra in her stride to enable her to reach her top speed far quicker than normal.

--She would have reached Saeza in no time. 

After speeding across the sand, she'd skid to a stop and tilt the blade slightly, cradeling it at her right side. Her little arms thus gave a quick swing. * - Sun Oct 25 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //It was true, her strike was immensely slow, supported by the fact that she was a complete rookie when it came to a katana. "Dangit.." she thought as her blow was cast away.  She backed away for a brusque second before lunging forth once again, this time aiming to come down upon Saeza with an overhead swing. * - Sun Oct 25 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) stops in her stride, wondering what she was doing wrong. "Eh?" she grunted, glancing at her blade before handing it over towards Saeza * - Sun Oct 25 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) stares at the wooden sword, her eyes narrowing just slightly. "Verticle strikes...?" Izanami thought, wondering what the purpose of a hundred was. "Isn't that.. a lot?" she inquired as she took the wooden blade within both her hands. 

She then proceeded to give one quick swing before looking towards Saeza with confused eyes. * - Sun Oct 25 03:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) purses her lips a bit before giving a brusque nod. "I guess." she thought. 

She then took a step back before closing her eyes and bringing the sword up, and swinging it downward as instructed, obviously she wasn't as quick and concise as Saeza was..* - Sun Oct 25 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) squints a bit and nods, her eyes coming to a close at this point as she raises her blade once again, the girl tightening her grasp ever so slightly before performing another swing, this time applying a bit more speed-her control over the weapon still clearly lacking. * - Sun Oct 25 04:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Alright. That's a bit better....Only 97 more to go...I won't say a thing till you're done. - Sun Oct 25 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) cries internally, she had only swung a couple of times and she had many more to go. "This is....going to hurt.." she thought to herself as she swung once more * - Sun Oct 25 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) stops for a brusque moment, her eyes coming to a close as she exhaled through her nose. "It can't be much harder than any other thing i've done..." she thought to herself. 

She begun swinging once more, her arms starting to burn a bit. * - Sun Oct 25 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //Izanami was a ninja of prodigical talent, a girl deftly able to learn and master different faccets of skills specific to that of ninja. This however, didn't take away from the fact that whatever she had learned from scratch posed no difficulty. She has been in more difficult situations, but the repeated swing of a sword....and her lack of physical strength would prove to be challenging.

She swung, time and time again, aiming to steadily build a foundation of swordsmanship with the repeatition of a swung blade. Muscle memory should serve her well had she completed all one hundred of the swings. "I can't back out now that i've asked for this training!" izanami yelled within her mind as she swung again. Sweat gathered upon her brow and steadily cascaded down her smooth face.

After a numerous amount of swings, Izanami had seemingly reached her breaking point, her arms tingling; a loss of sensation giving her the misconception that her arms were made of jelly. "U-ugh.." she groaned as she let her arms hang at their sides, her grip forever fastened aroudn the base of the wooden sword, inable to release it..."I can't give up...not when I'm so close..." she thought, her jelly like arms struggling with all their might to lift themselves. 

---She began to swing her wooden sword more and more, aiming to push past her feelings of pain, as her friend Flexus had once instructed her. She wasn't the little girl she once was, who would once give up if the going got to tough. She had to press on and become stronger if she wanted to meet her goal; mastering the art of a sword was only a small step, and if she couldnt even get over this step, how could she scale the steps further ahead. * - Sun Oct 25 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) faceplants and dies of exhaustion * - Sun Oct 25 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //The girl was only seven, making it this far was a miracle. "Oh how this reminds me of training with Flexus..." she thought to herself, giving a quickened smile, momentarily honoring the death of her friend. She thus released the sword and faceplanted, seemingly exhausted. "Fifty..." she thought to herself, wondering if she could actually bring herself to do that many pushups after going through that many sword swings. 

She proceeded to lift herself up in rhytmic fashion, aiming to establish a casual flow to the way she had excersized, hopefully adding a bit of ease. She moved at her own pace, which of course was slow due to exhaustion. She continued to mentally push herself.

"DO this..." she firmly stated within her mind as she proceeded on with her pushups. "Do it for everyone you lost, do it for the sake of being able to protect what's dear to you." she stated within her mind, aiming to pump herself up for the added benefit of continuing on with the pushups. At the rate she was going, it'd take awhile for her to even finish them all.

Eventually, she dropped unto her face after completing a mere twenty nine, gasping for air as she basked in the hot sun.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) starts to gather her composure at this point, taking a second or two before answering. "I want to become strong, so i don't have to be a spectator anymore." she firmly stated.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) adjusts her gaze once more, staring straight ahead. "I knew deep down...he died, I was just hoping he didn't....I was just waiting like a fool..." she thought to herself, her eyes coming to a close as she suddenly grew quiet. She was indeed immensly close to Dravae, even going as far as referring to him as uncle dravae. 

Tears began to well in her eyes, the concrete news of another person she held dear departing from this world smacking her like an armored truck. 

"Seems like there's no escaping the reality of the world we live in.." she thought, her arms which once felt akin to that of jelly regaining some feeling, her fingers suddenly clenching into a fist. "I can't escape this feeling of helplessness either..." she stated within the deepest parts of her mind, the girl finding her inner self floating in this abysmal pool of darkness. 

--"Maybe Baen was right...maybe...I really need to get myself in check...people die in this world, die more times than I can count on either of my hands..." she thought, her eyes coming to a close as she pondered her purpose in life. "Shedding a tear for each and everyone of them...makes it so much harder....but, I care too much....I care too much about my loved ones...not to." she stated

"Emotions, these emotions we have...why do we have them...they just make life so much harder than it needs to be...without it...i wouldn't have this weird, pit in my stomach everytime Flexus or Drave is mentioned...everytime I get images of that...girl...." 

She whispered aloud this -"I can't.."

"I can't let my emotions take control of me anymore...." actively recalling baens statement. "As a ninja...I will see countless people die...it will happen..." her heartbeat progressively slowed as she calmed herself down. 

A completely stoic and almost plastic look fell upon her visage. "I have to accept it.." she stated, a static sense of monotonous tone present in her voice. It was appearant, that throughout all of this, she had finally come to terms, come to accept the world she was born into. 

She was cool, collected, and unphased, an almost tranquil, almost emotionless presence taking over her being. "Though, I still will get stronger to make it all change..."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) glances into the air, her brow lifting ever so slightly. "Wonder what this labrynth thing is...." she thought. * - Sun Oct 25 22:58:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: All Labyrinth people , meet me within the southern region of the village. - Sun Oct 25 23:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) after a long trip via sea, they would reach their destination. Izanami had no compass herself, but she could tell that things definately weren't right. "I get a strange feeling in the pit of my stomach from just being here..." she thought, her eyes carefully darting around. 

"So this is it?" she inquired, wondering what in the world they'd actually do upon the island...and how in the fuck he owned his own island. * - Sun Oct 25 23:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) had gotten her hair ruffled, and noticed her sudden spike in chakra. She of course didn't say anything and simply ndoded. "Thanks." she stated with a small grin. 

She then turned over towards Nina and Marrisa as Fujitora moves deeper into the forest. "Are you guys ready?" * - Sun Oct 25 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) nods at Nina before adjusting her gaze towards the forest. "As a team.." she repeated softly. * - Sun Oct 25 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) proceeds to nod over at Nina and Marrisa. "Let's go.~" she stated, striding forth into the forest, hoping the two would follow. 

* - Sun Oct 25 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) proceeded deep into the forest, her eyes coming to a narrow as they scanned her surroundings. To her, it started looking like a typical forest, although the different sets of colors and what not threw her a bit of kilter. 

"I wonder what kind of creatures live in here.." she thought, her eyes trailing voer towards Marrisa as she attempted to break off from the two. 

Izanami didn't try to stop her either, she figured she knew what she was doing. * - Mon Oct 26 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) stares at Nina and Marrisa for a second as they bump into eachother. "How strange.." Izanami whispered before answering the question. 
"I'm not going to leave, no." * - Mon Oct 26 00:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) treks slowly behind Nina, her eyes glancing around in search of the estranged whispers she was hearing. "This place gives me the creeps.." she whispered...* - Mon Oct 26 00:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) proceeds to continue walking through the forest, aiming to keep her wits about her as she went deeper and deeper still. * - Mon Oct 26 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) Izanami glances over at Nina, her eyes coming to a close. "It's getting pretty cold.." the little girl thought to herself before nodding in response to the slightly older girl, utilizing suimen to walk right over the water. 

--She attempted to regulate her body temperature through simple means, her body suddenly igniting with flame, covering her in a secondary epedermic layer of fire like skin, keeping her body warm throughout the trip. 

--Due to her mastery over fire and her large chakra reserves, it'd be extremely easy to hold such a technique. * - Mon Oct 26 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: When did my shroud become a childs play thing? - Mon Oct 26 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: -omit- - Mon Oct 26 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) widens her eyes as the branches themselves begin moving; the roots aiming for her specifically seeming to be rather agressive. "Tch!" she sucked her teeth and drew her katana, spinning around whilst still in her fire shroud. Given her high control over fire, she'd be able to deftly manipulate the form of the fire shroud, allowing a bit of flame to extend beyond her arm, taking the vague shape of an arm and katana as she spun around with the intention of slicing right through the roots.

--This was a means to protect herself from getting dragged away. * - Mon Oct 26 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) narrows her eyes at Nina, giving a quick suck of the teeth. Immediately, Izanami bursts forth with intense speeds whilst her fire shroud fought off the branches. With a quick stroke of her fire enhanced arm, she'd effectively send a stream of flame to slice at multiple branches and vines at once, giving Nina a bit of breathing space. 

"I'm not going to leave you alone!" * - Mon Oct 26 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) widens her eyes as Nina gets targeted once more, something she hadn't anticipated. "Why are they going for her?" she thought as she sped forth, trying her earnest to deter some of the branches, it was in her best interest to keep the roots away from nina. 

* - Mon Oct 26 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) narrowed her eyes. "Enough of this!" she yelled within her mind, adjusting her gaze towards where she was hearing the voices from. Her hands clapped together to form a single tiger seal, her chest expanding as she heaved in massive amounts of air. 

Suddenly, from her lips roared a massive ball of flame that was more than strong enough to rip through the roots, hurdeling its way over towards the tablet. 

--Izanami wasn't done yet, as she then clapped her hands together and applied  a small gale of wind to increase the potency of the flame. 

Her intention was to destroy the tablet...* - Mon Oct 26 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: I remember when I first came here...It's how I discovered me fire shroud..Seven Days and Seven nights..A heart of flame with the courage to fight.. But only those born with this ember will glow just as bright.. - Mon Oct 26 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) had dropped to a single hand, her fireshroud dispersing itself as she was hit with a sudden wave of daze. "U-ugh.." she groaned; clearly experiencing some weird wave of fatigue. "I-it's a monkey." she thought, her eyes coming to a narrow as her vision blurred. 

"Maybe.." she thought, her hands coming together to form a few handseals witht he last bits of her strength. She bit her thumb, drew blood, performed handseals and summoned a monkey of her own, attempting to send it over to retrieve the tablet. * - Mon Oct 26 02:34:52 2015
