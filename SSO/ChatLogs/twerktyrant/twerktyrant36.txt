"Alright, a trip to Kumogakure shouldn't be too bad all things considered......I kind of hope it won't be super boring though.." izanami thought, the little girl giving a quick twist of her upper lip as she thought of how boring the mission could possibly turn out to be. With a sigh and quick adjustment of her long black cloak, she struts offward into the distance* - Tue Nov 17 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) proceeds to treck through the sand, her eyes wary of any sand dwelling creatures that might be lying in wait for an easy meal.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) sees a slight shift in geography, small patches of grass began to intermingle with the sand which had possessed a good portion of the wind country. "I must be getting close to the land of fire....from there I can just head up north and hit kumogakure eventually..." she remarked, her eyes coming to a close as she thought of her own personal health. 

"Before I continue on however, I must find a village to take refuge in...or atleast take a break in a safe area or something..." the girl thought with a simple nod. * - Tue Nov 17 06:34:40 2015

Immediately, she shot forth with the intention of hiding behind a tree. She hadn't gotten a clear look at their faces, but as a little girl, she was instructed to never simply roam out into a random village full of random people without first being under the assumption said random people were either pedophiles or rapists. * - Tue Nov 17 06:38:56 2015

She skid to a stop just at his side, the little girl ripping her katana from its sheathe before attempting to send it hurdeling into his torso, using the blunt end of course. * - Tue Nov 17 08:33:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watched as her wrist was grasped, the girl simply catching wind of the attack. "Hmph." she grunted, her free hand adjusting itself ever so slightly. 

Binding snake glare, a jutsu Hideki had once attempted to use upon her once before. It wasn't going to work today. "Suprise.~" she responded as a quick yet sharp jolt of flame sparked around her being, intent on slicing right through the snake that had attempted to coil around her, or in the very least burn it off. 

--She thus twisted the katana around in her hand and jabbed the lethal end upon the ground, the little girl using it as a base ot hoist herself up upon. Upon rapidly hosting herself upward, she'd adjust her body so that she'd send a heel towards his chin. 

She was more or less upside down at this point. * - Tue Nov 17 08:40:57 2015

Suddenly, a small sphere of lightning natured chakra crackled before her fingetips before a quick bolt of lightning came hurdeling right from her fingertips, much like a bullet. 

It was quick and concise. * - Tue Nov 17 08:51:12 2015

Next, she laid her eyes upon the rotating kunai. "The rotating shuriken technique...let's test eachothers skill shall we?" she remarked as she tossed up about two shuriken of her own and applied the same technique, allowing each one to hover over its respective palm. * - Tue Nov 17 09:00:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) strolls upon the manor, her eyes falling upon what was only shambles and pieces of what she once called her home. "W-what is this?" she stuttered within her head, the little girls eyes fumbling about the rubble. Her heart rate quickened, a massive knot lodging itself within the pit of her gut. She almost felt sick at the sight of her destroyed home. 

The girl immediately shot forth and rummaged through the rubble in search of any bodies, more specifically two little boys. "Dai, Sei!" she roared at the top of her lungs, a paniced tone overcoming her voice. "You aren't in there are you?!" she questioningly roared. 

She plowed through the rubble in a frantic search for her brothers, openly assuming they had been caught in the destruction. "...M-maybe they weren't in there...m-maybe they were at school.." she thought

Immediately she turned and only thought of the worst. "W-what if they didn't...what if they are under the rubble...dead?!" she thought, the little girl gripping her head as a few tears rolled down her cheeks. "Don't think that way, they are alive!" 

She paused in an attempt to calm herself, her eyes suddenly adopting a more serious air around them. "I'm going to find whoever did this..." * - Wed Nov 18 01:40:41 2015
