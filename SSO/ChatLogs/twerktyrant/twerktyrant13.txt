One emotion stood above else however; happiness. 

Izanami had felt extremely warm and ecstatic to know that, in this world of seemingly endless chaos and loss, there were still people around her that cared for even her pitul existence.

She quickly tore through a small set of handseals, a total of six to be exact. "No problem." she stated before cocking her head and exuding a powerful ball of flame right into the air above. The flame washed her surroundings in a vibrant orange hue, growing in size as it swallowed up oxygen from its surroundings. It eventually collapsed on itself and exploded. * - Mon Oct  5 05:14:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //She once again takes a moment to make sure that there were no civillians or shinobi passing by before releasing the technique, a means to make sure she didn't injure anyone.

Izanami murmered to herself as she extended her hand once more, a much larger spark being produced. With a quick jolt of the arm, she tossed yet another fireball. She had hoped to produce more favorable results this time. * - Mon Oct  5 06:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //The ball of flame would eventually make contact with the sand, once again violently exploding.

This time, she'd apply even more juice, should she have the skill to do so. "Gotta' get stronger.~ I made a promise!" * - Mon Oct  5 06:22:17 2015

With that, she'd toss the small ball of flame, allowing it to slam into the ground where it'd erupt, sending flame erupting in odd directions. She'd watch in awe, shocked that she was able to produce such a powerful flame. "Wow.." she stated, her smile growing a bit larger than before. 

"I'm getitng better..I can feel it." * - Mon Oct  5 06:27:24 2015

"Let me see..what other technique can I use." she inquired in a hushed tone of voice, aiming to keep her training to herself, for the most part. "Oh! I know!" Izanami yelped, giving a quick clap of the hands. 

Her hands then came together to form just a single handseal, the girls flame natured chakra exuding itself from her body in the form of a line of fire running along the ground at hastened speeds. * - Mon Oct  5 06:29:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) "No problem.." Izanami stated, a smill grin overcoming her face. Her hands suddenly came together where they would formulate a single handseal, her fingers crossed atop of eachother. A plume of prestine white smoke would suddenly explode around her visage, shielding the girls little body from view. 

Amongst the smoke, were two clones. Hopefully, unbeknownst to her opponent, one of the said two clones would quickly transform into a shuriken she had held unto, shielding it within her cloak. 

--The smoke cleared, revealing Izanami and her doppleganger. "Alright! Here I come!" she roared, her clone darting forth, the girl zipping right behind it. * - Tue Oct  6 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //The girl and the clone immediately bolt off in opposing directions, the girls hands sifting through two shuriken, one of them the clone of course.

The clone that dodged down towards his southern position would form a single handseal, fire intended to zip across the ground and directly at Yan. It was a low leveled technique in nature, but it served the purpose of distraction. * - Tue Oct  6 05:22:08 2015

"He used the clone to throw himself out of harms way." she thought to herself as she gave a quick twitch of the fingers, manipulating her shuriken around so that it swiveled through the air and right towards Yans direction. 

The shuriken majestically danced around the air as they weaved their way towards the blonde haired shinobi.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) would have appearantly been caught by the technique, caught off gaurd by the pillars that rose from the earth. Luckily, she had prepared for a moment like this. She had erupted into a cloud of smoke, leaving nothing in her position but prestine white smoke. 

She had substituted herself with the shadow clone she had produced just moments before. The shadow clone was infact equal in every way to Izanami, so it was the perfect tool to use as a medium for the basic technique. 

With that being said, Izanami now found herself on the ground, further away from Yan than she would have hoped. "He's going to try to catch me with the earth again..." the little girl thought, her eyes casually flickering towards the ground. 

She then shot forth, her hands whipping through yet another set of handseals, six to be exact. From her maw came a fireball of good size, the orb of flame intent on hurdeling for Yans position. * - Tue Oct  6 05:59:40 2015

"Dangit.." the little girl murmered under her breath as she rolled off to the side in order to avoid the raging wave, catching herself on all fours, sliding across the sand as she peered over at Yan. 

She needed to find away to secure atleast ONE hit. * - Tue Oct  6 06:16:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) inhales and then exhales, a brisk sunagakure breeze coursing over the area, causing for her tattered black cloak to sway in its gentle embrace, her snow white hair swaying aswell in stark comparison.

"I'll show you how much better i've gotten!" she yelled, her hands coming together to form just a single handseal, the girl inhaling a massive amount of oxygen, her cheeks swelling up with chakra. She then cocked her head forth and exuded a large amount of katon natured chakra with immense ease.

A small orb of flame shot free from her lips, the orb growing in immense size the moment oxygen touched its composition, growing into a massive fireball, the roaring sounds of flickering flame filling the air. It was evident she ascended to even higher levels of fire mastery in such a short amount of time. * - Wed Oct  7 05:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: She's gotten better. - Wed Oct  7 05:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watches as the sand comes up to gaurd, her eyes widening as she had almost forgotten about the sand he had utilized for combat. "Oh...that's going to be hard to get around..." she thought to herself as she then formulated a single handseal, a poof of smoke appearing at the side as she dashed off to the south. 

From the prestine white smoke came a clone dashing, both of the little girls avoiding the sand with rather impressive reflexes. 

Both clone and Izanami would reach into their pouches to grab at their specially prepared shuriken, the girls launching them without much hesitation. One shuriken soared from the north whilst one soared from the south, each aimed to curve in at Tetsumis position. 

Both, had been prepped with wire which was hard to see without proper sight. * - Wed Oct  7 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) narrowed her eyes, applying a coating of fire natured chakra into the wire which ran along the shuriken, giving it a confident swing, giving the impression that she were swinging a mighty long rope composed of fire itself. Hopefully, the added power of the flame natured chakra atop of the shuriken would be enough to combat the basic iron tools he had summoned. 

She'd continously swing them around with the intention of batting them away with fire, the clone performing similar actions. 

Unfortunately, it'd be eventually disposed of. * - Wed Oct  7 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) would swing the shuriken in hopes of allowing it to wrap right around the clones, performing a brusque backwards hope whilst doing so. "Er-erh...that's too many to fight at once.." she thought to herself. 

Had the shuriken been able to secure a line upon even one of the clones or atleast, landed before them she'd perform her technique, the clones placing themselves in the correct position. 

She'd proceed to rip through a small set of handseals before exuding a powerful flame right down the wire, the flame threatening to jump from clone to clone, using their bodies as a means to transport itself across to her opponent. 

* - Wed Oct  7 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) viciously glances around as all of the clones surrounded her, the girl attempting to figure out a way to pull herself out of this situation. As her brother asked her about her will to continue, she responded with a simple. 

"Not giving up just yet, I have this thing anout giving up to early!" the girl yelped, flame suddenly enveloping her entire being, coating her body in a second epedermic layer of fire. 

She then dashed forth, drawing a kunai with the intention of flowing katon right through it, aiming to stab right through the clone. * - Wed Oct  7 06:33:23 2015
