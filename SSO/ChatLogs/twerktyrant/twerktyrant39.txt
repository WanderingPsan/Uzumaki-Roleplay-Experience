<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) proceeds to make her way to a large portion of open sand with the intention of using the desolate area as a training grounds. She didn't want to run the risk of injuring anybody, so the only way to train her ninjutsu prowess was to train alone. The girl gave a quick nod before shoving her cloak right off her tiny body, allowing it to fall into the floor. 

After tossing the cloak to the floor, she'd begin. 


She'd slam both her left and right hands together at chest level, her fingrs would then rapidly intertwine to form handseals. After forming the handseals, the little girl would allow her cheeks to swell with fire natured chakra. "Katon: Goukakyuu no jutsu!" she thought before exuding a powerful flame into the air before her. 

--Immediately following, she'd back track on her handseals and began to form yet another small set of handseals in preperation for another technique. "Hm!" she grunted as she held her hands clasped together. Fire natured chakra reached a boiling point within her gullet before she then released it out in the form of a massive, more concentrated form of a fire. 

Unfortunately, she wasn't at all quick enought o quickly transition through the two jutsu. There was still a considerable amount of lag time in which she switched techniques, meaning had she tried something like that on the battlefield, she wouldn't of been able to get both of her jutsu off in succession. 

"I have to do much better then that...I can't allow openings like that when or if I get into any kind of fight..." she remarked before taking a few steps backward, moving over towards her cloak before she stooped low to pick it up. "Tetsumi, I hope you're watching..." the little girl remarked..She then strode off back to the village. * - Fri Nov 20 06:58:59 2015

"It was  a big mess...just a whole big mess of misunderstanding. From my point of view..Shira tried to bash somone over the head with a bottle, which led to his detainment...or atleast an attempt at his detainment..." she paused for a moment as her flan came to the table. 

"Then...Ivel tried to split them apart in order to stop them from hurting eachother by using the fire run technique. In response, they saw it as an attempt at injuring them so of course....that fuled the fire for the reasoning, no pun intended.~"
