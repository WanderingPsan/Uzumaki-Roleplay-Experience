Out of the smoke came a small elderly woman, hunched over, hand casually resting upon her lower back. "I'm off to go sell some clothes.~" the elderly woman stated with a small grin. * - Thu Oct  8 03:44:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) would simply go along with whatever they had planned, the small girl attempting to first blend in before making a move. So, as she assumed the role of an old hag, she had to play the physical part aswell. 

She took the pick axe and what not with the intention of ambling forth, attempting to begin working in order to please the gaurd. 

She casually glanced around, a bit sickened with how they treated even the elderly. * - Thu Oct  8 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: I need to figure out where their leader is.... - Thu Oct  8 04:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) quickly glances around as the workers began to move, her eyes immediately falling unto the bandit who had been to distracted by yelling at the workers to even pay her any attention. He'd see tons of old ladies everyday, so why bother keeping an eye on her. 

She decided to use this as a means of escape into the crowd, attempting to mingle with those going to get water as they passed by her section, using her skills gathered as a ninja to seamlessly transition into the crowd itself. 

Here she'd began to ask questions under her breath, choosing her words carefuly as to not arouse much suspicion. 

"Oooh, my aching back.." she called as she looked over towards one of the many workers, speaking to no one in general. "My bad mind and all this heavy work keeps me from remembering why we are doing this....ooh how I miss my son.." she stated, hoping somone would comment on why they were all working. * - Thu Oct  8 04:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) proceeds to head back with section A, moving underground where she had assumed the leader to be placed in. It only made sense as the underground caves seem to be the safest area. 

Dependent on the number of bandits around, Izanami would sieze this moment to slowly amble off with the intention of avoiding any prying eyes. 

Had bandit activity been to severe, she would keep to her role as the old woman. * - Thu Oct  8 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) glances around, her eyes widening as the compound was placed on high alert. "!!" she began to walk just a bit faster now with the intention of still givnig the outward appearance of an elderly woman. 

"H-how!?" Izanami yelled within her head as she treked on, aiming to come closer to the leader, wherever she had been hiding. * - Thu Oct  8 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) stumbles into the cave where she discovered the woman, though much to her suprise, Trilliam had reached her first. "!!" she immediately whipped a shuriken free from her cloak, allowing it to swivel right from the womans hand-hopefully forcing her to either take the shuriken to the hand or divert her weapon which would ultimately preserve Trilliams hand. * - Thu Oct  8 05:46:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) "It's dangerous in here...the cave's going to collapse at any moment!" cried the girl in her mind as the kunai were tossed into the room, Izanami quickly spinning and tossing her own set of kunai, easily knocking them both back. 

The explosive kunai now twirled off in seperate directions, each probably holding the lethality to rattle the cave and cause rocks to fall. 

"I can't use much explosive jutsu here or i'll endanger us all..." Izanami thought, spinning around once more, now facing the woman. 

Without much hesitation, Izanami shot forth with increased speed, cloak fluttering in the wind as she drew a kunai from her pouch, intent on preparing herself to attack. * - Thu Oct  8 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) "Tch..." Izanami suddenly brings her hands together, her eyes coming to a narrow. "Don't underestimate me, or you'll get burned!" yelled the little girl as she summoned about three clones, each of which already held unto a single handseal. 

As they held unto the seal, a wall of flame tore through the ground, the flames aiming to cut off the arriving bandits access to the battlefield, more or less leaving them confined to their entry ways, lest they want to play the fool and run through and receive nasty burns. 

Through the efforts of all three clones, a large wall of flame was formed, leaving only Ivyana, Trilliam, and Izanami to battle. 

It was in this moment the girl unhenged and returned to her normal form, that of a short seven year old girl. * - Thu Oct  8 06:17:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) would take said blades within her possession, wondering at first what the big deal about them was. She didn't possess the elemental affinity to wield them either, so to her they were just two swords.

"Well, if these swords are really improtant, we can't wait out in the open....unless you're willing to do that.." she stated

She was then distracted by a small cave. She intended to aid Yan into it in order to take refuge. * - Fri Oct  9 05:30:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) backs away from her squadmate, her eyes coming to a close as she focused on her chakra. "Alright, don't get too close or you might get burned, okay?" she inquired, hoping the religious individual would heed her warnings and keep his distance. 

She inhaled through her nostrils and then exhaled through her mouth before she gave a quick bend in the knees. She then launched herself high into the air with the added propulsion of chakra. "Now, all I have to do is keep calm and concentrate all of my fire natured chakra into the palms of my hands and my feet." she thought. 

Suddenly, fire would erupt from her feet and hands simultaneously. The rate at which the fire was propelled caused her too to be rapidly propelled through the air. * - Sat Oct 10 04:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) slammed into the wall, finding her trajectory to be rather unpredictable. After creating such a jutsu, she didn't expect herself to move so quickly. "Agh!" she yelped as she slammed into the wall, ultimately falling right back into Brysons arms in a fit of dizzyness. 

She didn't hurt herself all too much...but damn did it knock the air out of her. * - Sat Oct 10 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) coughs as she asked to be place down. "U-uh yeah, thanks. I just didn't think i'd go that fast..now I know to practice in an open area."* - Sat Oct 10 04:41:10 2015
