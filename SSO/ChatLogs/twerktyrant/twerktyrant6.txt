<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) rushes forth with speed on par with an average chunnin, the girl having improved considerably over her training. Without much hesitation, she lept into the air and gave a brusque twirl with the intention of sending a kick towards her fathers face. She knew he would react accordingly, so she wasnt worried about injuring him * - Tue Sep 22 20:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) dies of internal bleeding * - Tue Sep 22 20:43:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) had attempted to react to such a strike, but was knocked in the stomach and sent hurdeling back, inable to even adequately see the strike. 

She was sent tumbling back quite a good distance, the girl grabbing at her gut in suprise. * - Tue Sep 22 20:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: I didnt even see that.. - Tue Sep 22 20:44:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: You'll need to use your mind Iza. - Tue Sep 22 20:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) had seen this technique once before, the girl knowing in the back of her mind already that this was indeed a genjutsu her father was trying to press upon her. There was always the question whether or not she actually had the mental fortitude to break said technique. 

She'd quickly bring her hands together to form a single handseal with the intention of regulating her flow of chakra, hopefully disrupting the genjutsu.

After that, shed set her eyes upon her father, her hands immediately reaching for her specially prepped shuriken. With a quick whip of the arm, she launched four, two of which were cleverly hidden in the shadow of their two pedecessors, and only two of which were attached to wire which was barely discernable by a trained eye. * - Tue Sep 22 20:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) had tugged on her own set of manipulated shuriken, possessing a fine ey for this stuff, able to weave her shuriken inbetween the others. She'd manipulate it in a fashion where they would attempt to coil around the wiring attatched to Fujis own shuriken, with the intent of weighing them down so they couldn't get any further, or atleast with the intent to mess with their accuracy. * - Tue Sep 22 21:01:26 2015
