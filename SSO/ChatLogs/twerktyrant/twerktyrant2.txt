<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) thinks: But the fact you feel the need for that many, against your opponents is the scary part. - Sun Sep 13 09:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Our village member count doubled. - Sun Sep 13 09:58:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The Brawn is nothing without the brains. - Sun Sep 13 10:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: The fact that he escaped the battle in Konohagakure with no troops and already had one-hundred to just guard Himura when I arrived tells me we're in a run for our money. - Sun Sep 13 10:01:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: But ran before they got captured. - Sun Sep 13 10:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: I didn't send Baen after you. His mission was to go scout the outskirts of Konohagakure. - Sun Sep 13 10:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: He stumbled upon that village. - Sun Sep 13 10:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Oh, Must have been him then. - Sun Sep 13 10:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: And I took advantage. - Sun Sep 13 10:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: So yeah Tethys, Other than that there isn't much to report. - Sun Sep 13 10:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I didn't get a chance to speak to Zetsumo himself but I got a good look at him. - Sun Sep 13 10:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: They did try to interrogate me but I just played dumb. - Sun Sep 13 10:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Once thing I will say though Tethys. - Sun Sep 13 10:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Zetsumos men seem quite Genjutsu heavy. - Sun Sep 13 10:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: So it's probably best to teach everyone Kai. - Sun Sep 13 10:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Genjutsu... - Sun Sep 13 10:26:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: If I ever see her again... - Sun Sep 13 10:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: But that gives us another thing to work on. They'll need to either see us or us see them for their trigger. If we can somehow, make an attack on them while their view is disrupted. - Sun Sep 13 10:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: We would have quiet the advantage. - Sun Sep 13 10:28:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Sun Sep 13 10:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Smoke, or poison bombs... The numerous traps that all line the village, which I'm sure that people of their level can avoid but it slow them down. And, ninjutsu users will be great in being able to give sweeping attacks that won't need direct line of fire. - Sun Sep 13 10:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We should have more sensors... - Sun Sep 13 10:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: It might be a good idea if some of us that can go underground, scout the outskirts periodically. - Sun Sep 13 10:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Yeah, they could also notice if their in genjutsus or not with their abilities. That way it be a awareness and protection. - Sun Sep 13 10:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well. We can't sense chakra whilst underground, but we know everything that goes on above ground. - Sun Sep 13 10:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) thinks: Then popped out - Sun Sep 13 10:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: I was still talking about sensors, in our forces. - Sun Sep 13 10:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm, I know what you mean. - Sun Sep 13 10:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: ... It be nice to know if they have any sensors or medics. They could be pegged from prime targets... Sadly I can't expect that info so easy to come by. - Sun Sep 13 10:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: They probably do to be fair, though they didn't notice me until I walked by them all. - Sun Sep 13 10:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Don't know why the fuck I went back there. - Sun Sep 13 10:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Also for those that don't know. - Sun Sep 13 10:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Zetsumo looks like a more evil version of Tethys. - Sun Sep 13 10:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: I'll have to step my game up then. - Sun Sep 13 10:44:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Also me and you need to speak about those eyes, Tethys. - Sun Sep 13 10:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I need to know more on that, classified or not. - Sun Sep 13 10:45:45 2015
