<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) wasn't the most adept taijutsu fighter in the world, and as such this battle would prove to be one of her more difficult ones. Just as Izanami would have predicted, the woman was no pushover when it came to speed.

Izanamis eyes widened as the first attack came, prompting her little body to react before she would end up crippled once more. Immediately, Izanami spun on her heel, tossing her body off to the side just slightly. The attack aimed for her stomach narrowly missed its mark. 

"She's fast.." Izanami thought to herself as she partially drew her katana with her one good arm, aiming to hit her in the side with the blunt end of her blade. * - Thu Dec 10 02:21:39 2015

"Oh my..." the girl remarked with a slight giggle. * - Fri Dec 11 05:17:00 2015

"So, she artificially increased my mass through the use of earth natured chakra, some how. I have to do the same thing with my earth natured chakra, but how do I go about doing that?" the girl inquired within her mind once more, her face physically scrunching as she concentrated a bit harder. 

Her earth natured chakra was conciously being built and manipulated, but she hadn't yet found the ability to manipulate her own mass. * - Fri Dec 11 05:26:24 2015

"Hn..." she groaned a bit, conciously aiming to manipulate her mass by picking up on the resonating feeling of chakra lera had applied to her own body. Should she take an example of how Leras chakra affected her, maybe she could rebuild the affect in a different form. * - Fri Dec 11 05:34:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) would keep going as instructed, she was clearly getting closer, as she felt her mass reverting back to its natural state. The progress was slow and gradual, but it was there, she just needed to amplify it even more. "Hmmmm..." she hummed as she proceeded to catch on to how the jutsu worked, it was getting more and more simple as she pressed on. The weight that had once plagued her began to suddenly roll away. * - Fri Dec 11 05:46:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //Izanami immediately caught unto the weight further increasing itself, noting that only Lera could have brought upon such a change. "Even more weight that before?" Izanami thougt, her lips pursing just slightly. She squirmed a bit as she attempted to lock down her focus on her earth natured chakra, aiming to use it to manipulate her own mass, aiming to aleviate whatever weight that was already added on. * - Fri Dec 11 05:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) proceeds to lower the mass upon her being in resposne to the sudden increase of mass applied to her via Leras doing. She was really making this tough, Izanami was smart, and extremely prodigious when it came to learning and mastering techniques, but even she was met with difficulty at some points in her life. 

She wasnt the type to simply drop a task because it was difficult however, so this time around, she poured all of her ability into it with the intention of ridding herself of mass.

Hopefully she'd meet favorable results * - Fri Dec 11 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) would find herself bounding off the ground, much to her suprise. "W-whoa, I think it worked?" she inquired within her head, a confused grin tossed in Leras direction. "I guess I did! haha." * - Fri Dec 11 06:05:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) walks over to the rock and begins practicing, wasting no time of course. "Hm...." she hummed as she pressed a flat palm into the rocks surface. "Hmmm......" she proceeded to hum as she closed her eyes, attempting to further agument the rocks mass, aiming to decrease it. Unfortunately she wasn't at Leras level, so all she could do was merely move it.  * - Fri Dec 11 06:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) Izanami would take a step forth, pressing her palm further into the rock as she poured a bit more earth natured chakra into it, her eyes coming to a narrow as she attempted to lighten the load essentially. She attempted to manipulate the general mass of the rock so she'd be able to lift it, just like Lera had done moments ago. Unfortunately, just like before, she wasnt anywhere near Leras mastery. * - Fri Dec 11 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) sighed, she could feel herself getting slightly better at the technique, her eyes coming to a close as she focused innately on her earth release chakra and nothing more.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) proceeds to get some training in, using the sunagakure arena as a base of operations essentially. Here she could train her earth release technique Lera had taught her moments ago. A hot sunagakure breeze blew overhead, causing for the girls white hair and black cllothes to elegantly billow in its embrace. "Ah..." she remarked with a wide grin. * - Fri Dec 11 22:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) she'd of extended her hand towards a rock that had idly been chilling amongst the arena, her onyx colored eyes narrowing unto the rock. "That rock should do..." Izanami stated within her mind as she slowly walked over, pressing her hand flat to the rocks surface, aiming to bring about a rapid change in physical mass, forcing the rocks general mass to bend to the will of ehr chakra. * - Fri Dec 11 22:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) Izanami would forcefully lighten the rocks mass via earth release chakra, taking away some of the physical strain it had required for her to move it.  That being said, she wasn't quite masterful enough with the technique to actually lift the rock without effort. "Ah.,." she hummed as she pushes against the rock, sliding it across the sand with minimal difficulty. 

She was then interrupted by Geo dude, her eyes slowly transitioning over towards the male. "Just training." she remarked. * - Fri Dec 11 23:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Oh..Thats cool what you're doing..Wish I could do stuff like that. - Fri Dec 11 23:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) gives a brusque nod before ambling back over towards the rock, casting casual glances over at Geo dude. "You're a taijutsu user, aren't you?" she remarked as she proceeded to rinse and repeat the technique. She'd force a change of mass upon the rock via earth nature chakra, lightening its mass in order for her to physically move the rock without actually straining. 

"You can do this without the aid of jutsu more likely than not." she retorted. * - Fri Dec 11 23:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Yeah...But it's really cool how you can move it and stuff without touching it...I can't even mould my chakra enough to use Ninjutsu and Genjutsu and stuff... - Fri Dec 11 23:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) walks over and stares at the rock, placing a single palm upon it as she hears Geo dude speak. "Is that so? Hm...I suppose that means you get more time to refine the one area you're actually good in, so that must mean something, doesn't it?" she inquired as she pumped a good amount of earth natured chakra into the rock, lightening its mass much more so than before, finally understanding the gist of the technique Lera had taught her.

It was just seconds ago, Izanami had barely grasped the ability to use it. She was a natural at jutsu it seemed....

--She hoisted the huge boulder above her head with her single, functioning arm. "There it goes.." she whispered * - Fri Dec 11 23:08:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) glances at Geo dude and grins. "Catch." she'd remark, tossing the rock at his direction, the boulder of course appearing as heavy and dense as it hurdled towards the male. If he had dodged, it'd land in the sand, leaving a little mark, not really befitting its apparant weight. 

Had he decided to catch it, he'd notice it wasn't near as heavy as he'd of thought, its weight akin to that of a paperweight. * - Fri Dec 11 23:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) chuckles and proceeds to explain, reading the confusion right off his face. "It's a technique that lowers the literal mass of objects I come in contact with..." she remarks before closing her eyes, lowering her own mass as she said this, her body literally floating into the air at this point. She slowly ascended, moving overhead. 

"It can also affect the mass of people should the jutsu be mastered." * - Fri Dec 11 23:16:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) lowers back down towards the ground and stares at the sand, her eyes slowly trailing back up towards Geo dude.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Well...I don't know actually...I've mastered my skill with all of my jutsu...And I've developed a new technique but it's not ready for use yet..Honestly...I'm kind of plateued...I think I'm going to ask around about Taijutsu techniques.. - Fri Dec 11 23:20:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) sighs as the booty warrior avoids the strike, her eyes narrowing as she took a step forth. "That hair is a problem." she thought as she grabbed upon her katana, the girl immediately zipping forth with the aid of fire, swinging her katana free from its sheathe as she blitzed about the booty warriors immediate location. 

Immediately, she'd aim to engulf the man in flames, intent on burning his hair right off. A simple swing of the sword and manipulation of flame was all that was needed. 

She had prematurely released her great fire propulsion technique, just before her assault so that the momentum produced from the intial propulsion would carry her. 

She'd skid to a stop and sheathe her katana once more, adjusting her gaze towards said booty warrior. * - Sat Dec 12 00:20:51 2015
