--After gathering the required amount of fire natured chakra within her gullet, she cocked her head and exuded the chakra accordingly. The chakra came in the form of a long extensive and fast moving chord of flame which raced across the ground.

"Why'd it get all super misty?" she remarked to herself, her eyes darting around in search of Mizumi.* - Fri Sep 18 03:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) keeps her gaze set straight ahead as the syrup trap comes at her general direction, her sharpened eyes allowing for her to pick up on it at the last given moment.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) her eyes would come to a narrow as shuriken came swiveling at her position; growing quite irritated that her opponent was using mist to fight. Almost immediately, her body had become condensed in a dense shroud of fire natured chakra, the chakra encapsulating her being in the form of armor. 

--The armor had buffeted the blow of the water based shuriken, steam wafting from her position as the shuriken collided.* - Fri Sep 18 03:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //Though it was increasingly hard to tell right from left within the mist, there was no doubt in her mind that a monstrous wave was hurdeling in her direction, leaving her limited time to think up solutions as to how to either avoid or counter the wave. 

She then faced away from the direction the sloshing waves were coming from, aiming to use her ears as a means to judge direction. 

With a quick handseal formed, she had attempted to shunshin in the opposing direction with the intention of avoiding the most catastrophic point of the wave, not really wanting to get thrown under and ripped apart by immense currents. 

--She still however was overrun with water in the long run and was sent tumbling. * - Fri Sep 18 03:39:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) had been seen a few yards away from her original position, bracing herself by her palms. She was quite shaken and disturbed, that much was appearant in her facial expression alone. Never has she ever been in a battle where she actually risked serious injury. This was quite the awakening for her. 

--She hacked and coughed up water as she attempted to regain her battered composure. * - Fri Sep 18 03:51:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) begins to pant heavily her eyes coming to a narrow. "Hng...." she groaned as she struggled to her feet. "Get rid of this mist!" she yelled at the top of her lungs. * - Fri Sep 18 03:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Yes! - Fri Sep 18 03:59:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) narrows her eyes, giving a quick nod towards Mizumi. "I'm not going to lose, not yet!" she yelped, her hands delving into her weapons pouch where she prepared specially set shuriken. 

With a quick flick of the wrist, she had launched three, two for his right side and one for his torso, her arms keeping themselves positioned at her sides after the intial launch of the shuriken. * - Fri Sep 18 04:02:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) had immediately pulled back on the shuriken the moment they threatened to make contact, the girl of course not wanting to bring about any real bodily harm. 

With a quick jolt of a single finger upon her left hand, she drew back the shuriken and manipulated its course around; as for the other two she performed the same action, swinging them around in a manner so they would align themselves around Mizumis body. 

They proceeded to swivel on a set point, curving right around him with the intentions of wrapping him in wiring. * - Fri Sep 18 04:09:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: His masks seem to be like sown strings. - Sat Sep 19 18:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Do they make up his abilities, or is he strong enough without them. - Sat Sep 19 18:03:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Or are they meant to be kept secret? - Sat Sep 19 18:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Had he gotten caught in his genjutsu and his focus dispersed, would the masked be rendered useless? - Sat Sep 19 18:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: That's the theory Tethys came up with, Koeki. - Sat Sep 19 18:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: The contents were a variety of Tethys' techniques. - Sat Sep 19 18:09:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Niza... were there any about how to wield swords, or sword related information? - Sat Sep 19 18:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: At least he was able to pass down his Techniques, They will be most useful in the battles to come. - Sat Sep 19 18:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I guess not, Koeki. - Sat Sep 19 18:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: When I remember seeing him, I don't recall any threads being used to control them. This is somehing different than puppetry, I believe. - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Well..we need to test that theory out. - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: If it works, we'll have one card to play. - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Another question.  - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I wish there were Jin, but sadly there are none... - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: That would be hard to test though. - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: These threads..yo- of course. - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Sending a squad to do that would be suicide. - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Hm... - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kamigami, Kyu(Jetray78) says: I'll have you guys know that I am not human. Don't want any ass whoopings. - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: These threads sound seemingly pretty durable. - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: If they were just normal threads then they would be no problem.  - Sat Sep 19 18:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) thinks: These threads, perhaps are composed of chakra. I know of only one style that could counter those effectively.  - Sat Sep 19 18:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: But yeah, the masks' bodies seem to be composed of these threads. - Sat Sep 19 18:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Maybe you could stick them together. - Sat Sep 19 18:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Actually Koeki. - Sat Sep 19 18:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Theres a lot of those mud clones and that syrup water jutsu. That might tangle them. - Sat Sep 19 18:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Lead the way Izanami. - Sat Sep 19 18:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I asked Tethys on that too. - Sat Sep 19 18:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Zetsumo was able to operate them, and still fight himself, from high in the air. - Sat Sep 19 18:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: He infromed me the threads were easily cut but blade edge. - Sat Sep 19 18:13:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Yet... - Sat Sep 19 18:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kamigami, Kyu(Jetray78) says: You guys need a plan created by an experienced strategist. - Sat Sep 19 18:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Infact, I've alrady thought of a squad designed to kill Zetsumo. - Sat Sep 19 18:15:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: He can outpace and therefore out manuever Zetsumo. - Sat Sep 19 18:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Next you have Hassan. - Sat Sep 19 18:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Hassan can easily take out the lightning mask Zetsumo has. - Sat Sep 19 18:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kamigami, Kyu(Jetray78) says: Speed, Defense, Strength, and Intellect. All that is needed is combination, which requires teamwork. - Sat Sep 19 18:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Plus, Tethys told me Hassan has Genjutsu. - Sat Sep 19 18:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Next you bring Lera. - Sat Sep 19 18:17:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Let's do this! - Sat Sep 19 18:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) drops off her bow sword next to the tree before adopting a makeshift stance before Flexus, awaiting for his good to go. "Your move!" she yelped. * - Sat Sep 19 18:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) had attempted to dodge the jabs, the girl reacting by pushing herself backward and away from the attacks, her eyes widening in response. 

She was quite nimble for her age, able to set her eyes on the attacks and move back accordingly. Hopefully she was quick enough. * - Sat Sep 19 18:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) gives a quick nod, her eyes coming to a narrow as she tried harder to dodge this time. She was infact, just as quick as his punches, living her with little room to actually dodge and counter attack accordingly. She had to be on her toes, or else she'd be hit with an obscene amount of strength. 

The girl swayed first to the side, then off to the other side, attempting to avoid the jabs, just barely. 

Had she avoided the jabs at her gut, she'd leap upward, thrust her palm into Flexus' wrist. She used the boys arm as a means to balance herself in mid air as she swung around her lower body, aiming to send a kick at his jaw. 

--She was rather proficient at taijutsu for her age aswell. * - Sat Sep 19 18:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) is fucking owned and sent hurdeling back instead, good game. 

She simply tumbles across the grass in pain, taking a few moments to recover from such a powerful blow. 

She hadn't experienced pain often....and this was a rude awakening. The moment she put on that headband, she had agreed to deal with said pain for the rest of her life. 

Was she ready? * - Sat Sep 19 19:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) widens her eyes, her heart beat now beginning to run away, aiming to burst right from her chest. She hadn't been pushed to such a degree, in which she was actually threatened...

She had to step her game up, and quickly. This wasn't a life she was used to, a life of pampering and things being handed to her. 

She bounded off to the side, attempting to avoid the strike, skidding across the ground. Without much hesitation, she ran forth with the intention of meeting Flexus' side. With a bound, she had attempted to launch herself to eye level and send a heel to the side of his face. * - Sat Sep 19 19:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) would have been promptly slammed into the ground, the slam stealing the air right from her lungs. She was completely winded and dazed at this point, more or less stunned for a couple of seconds before she was able to gather her thoughts. 

She was just in a real battle the other day, and yet again she was forced into a situation where she had felt completely helpless. * - Sat Sep 19 19:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Mmm no...Wait. - Sat Sep 19 19:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) picks herself up, slowly of course, her eyes coming to a refined narrow. "I'm not done...not yet." she remarked, a fire embedded within her darkened black eyes. She was beaten and bruised, but even this little girl had wanted to continue. 


She knew Flexus held no intention to seriously injure her....though she disregarded the notion of simply giving up. * - Sat Sep 19 19:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) would have attempted to lean back with the intention of avoiding the strike, not wanting to lose her head. "Egh!" she yelped as she narrowly avoided the attack, the girl moving into a handstand before performing a quick backflip, aiming to gain just a bit of distance. * - Sat Sep 19 19:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) grunts and dashes back in for Flexus, aiming to engage in close combat * - Sat Sep 19 20:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) had attempted to leap right over the punch with the intent of sending her head skyrocketing into his face, hopefully landing off a headbutt. * - Sat Sep 19 20:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) had slammed into Flexus' face and dropped to the ground, out cold. * - Sat Sep 19 20:33:42 2015
