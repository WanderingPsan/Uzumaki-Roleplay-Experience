<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) jumps ontop of the cliff, the sunagakure wall overlooking the vast ocean of sand which encapsulated her little village. "Sunagakure..." the little girl whispered as a breeze of hot sunagakure air rolled overhead, causing for her prestine white hair to billow in its gentle embrace. Her black cloak which stood in stark contrast to her white hair would dance alongside it, giving her an almost majestic disposition. 

"My home...where i'm supposed to be safe...where my family is supposed to be safe..." she stated once more, the girl adjusting her gaze towards the ground, her onyx colored eyes narrowing themselves ever so slightly.

"T-tetsumi...." she stammered, the sudden feeling of sadness seeming to overwhelm her, even if only momentarily. "You were supposed to grow, get strong and become the Kazekage....dad told me all about how rough you had it...you didn't deserve to die so young...not that way, not like that!" she yelled, confident no one was around to hear her. 

"You died a hero...my hero..." she clenched her fist and adjusted her gaze out into the expansive ocean of sand before her, a much more sullen disposition possessing her eyes. Remneants of tears cascaded down her cheeks from her moistened eyes; her eyes were different, the onyx color that had once possessed them overtaken by a vibrant crimson, her blood was boiling...and through this her sharingan had become activated 

"I will find whoever did this, Tetsumi....I swear on my own life. Guide me, and I'll help you rest in peace!" * - Tue Nov 24 18:57:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) brings her hands together and creates a single shadow clone, dispersing it into the world; its destination, kirigakure. She wanted to gain information about somone, and fast...* - Wed Nov 25 06:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) is in the process of getting checked in, and of course notices people coming towards the gate. "Hm?" she hummed * - Wed Nov 25 06:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: She has white hair but not a kiri nin. SHE'S A WITCH! - Wed Nov 25 06:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //Her calm, calculative eyes immediately drifted towards Heiwa as he approached the gate, the familiar face immediately striking her interest. "There he is..I didn't have to search hard at all it seems.." she thought before attempting to stride forth and into the gate, moving directly towards the little boy. * - Wed Nov 25 06:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) stops for a moment to notice Inobu. "O-oh hm.....cracking down on who enters and leaves I see....smart. I am Izanami, I was a former shinobi of Kirigakure at one point...back when Sunagakure wasn't strong enough to stand on its own...I actually graduated to genin status here." she remarked, flashing both her sunagakure headband and kirigakure headbands respectively. * - Wed Nov 25 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: I don't recognize him.~ - Wed Nov 25 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: Nor the person up top... - Wed Nov 25 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: ..She's not here because of Edge's attack, is she? - Wed Nov 25 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) tucks her headbands back into her cloak and nods. "If it helps, I just want to ask Heiwa a few questions, I don't really NEED entry, especially now that he's right there." * - Wed Nov 25 06:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Why..send someone if he's just going to be coming himself? - Wed Nov 25 06:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) takes a step back as he jumps down, her senses finely tuned unto the man. Stranger danger was a bitch. 

"Family related questions." she stated * - Wed Nov 25 06:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: I've never met him here...and he's the Mizukage? Shouldn't you have a bit of influence inside a village before being appointed Kage? - Wed Nov 25 06:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: You related to our little Heiwa here? - Wed Nov 25 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: Then again...Kirigakure was under special circumstances I guess.. - Wed Nov 25 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Unfortunately. - Wed Nov 25 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: -omit- - Wed Nov 25 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Yes. - Wed Nov 25 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inobu(Punka) thinks: This is gonna get interesting. - Wed Nov 25 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) glances at Heiwa, lamenting on what Liu had just ordered them to do. "They are going on a mission then? I suppose i'll tag along and ask my questions.." she stated, partly ignoring Lius question, openly assuming the man was just being an asshat. * - Wed Nov 25 06:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ... - Wed Nov 25 06:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) glances back over towards Liu, her eyes trained on his being. "Edge is of no concern of mine at the moment, I'm well aware sunagakure was attacked, I led the counter-defensive against him...one third of his army was defeated, he'd be foolish to attack again.." she remarked before taking a step backward once more. 

"In a sense, I am traveling alone..yes, but i'm not physically in danger, my grandfather would kill me if I actually went this far...so i'm just acting in place of the real one." * - Wed Nov 25 06:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: ..A clone. Like Mizumi. - Wed Nov 25 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: My family was just attacked, my brother was killed...I want answers or atleast hints as to who did it...I was hoping Heiwa might help me piece together what pieces of the puzzle I have.  - Wed Nov 25 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: So you're just a clone? So my guards failed to check you...Hmm....  - Wed Nov 25 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: May I please just ask him a few questions..? - Wed Nov 25 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: You could have sent a letter. I'm sorry but unless you meet them within your village's borders, I cannot allow you to continue to impede them in their mission. - Wed Nov 25 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Just leave, wait for us to head out, and follow us. - Wed Nov 25 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: *nods* - Wed Nov 25 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) thinks: ^ - Wed Nov 25 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I understand. - Wed Nov 25 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) promptly takes her leave, turning and walking away, if allowed of course. * - Wed Nov 25 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) summons and monkey and allows it to lie in wait in the tree, commanding it to act as soon as Heiwa approached * - Wed Nov 25 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: A frog that relays information huh... - Wed Nov 25 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) steps out of the shadows of the surrounding trees like a rapist(er, ninja i mean). 

* - Wed Nov 25 06:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) slinks back into the shadows ever so slightly, aiming to conceal her presence as best as possible. She had heard about that frog, and clearly she needed to get Heiwas attention somehow without alerting the frog. 

The boys excuse seemed to prove fruitful for now. * - Wed Nov 25 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) proceeds to jump down from a tree, intending to land directly beside Heiwa * - Wed Nov 25 06:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: Hey there. - Wed Nov 25 06:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: So.. - Wed Nov 25 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: Mm. You're really intent on this meeting. - Wed Nov 25 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: What's this about? - Wed Nov 25 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: Of course...I need answers to my brothers death. - Wed Nov 25 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: What makes you think I'd know anything about that? I don't even know your brother. - Wed Nov 25 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: I know, but you do know my father right, if even slightly? - Wed Nov 25 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: Fujitora. We met, briefly. - Wed Nov 25 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: Briefly, I see.  - Wed Nov 25 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: Do you happen to know anyone who wholds resentment toward him? - Wed Nov 25 06:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: No. I've only visited Sunagakure once. If it was someone there.. - Wed Nov 25 07:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: (Holds*) - Wed Nov 25 07:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: It doesn't have to be anyone specifically in sunagakure, anyone at all. - Wed Nov 25 07:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: No. Your father's name doesn't carry much farther than Sunagakure. If someone holds resentment they haven't mentioned it. - Wed Nov 25 07:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: Unfortunate... - Wed Nov 25 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: It wasn't done in the assault on Suna by Edge, I take it? - Wed Nov 25 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: I guess my search continues then.. - Wed Nov 25 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: No, it was done way before... - Wed Nov 25 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: At first I had assumed it was edge...but I'm not so sure anymore.. - Wed Nov 25 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: Is that all? - Wed Nov 25 07:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: More or less..... - Wed Nov 25 07:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) withdraws two kunai from underneath her cloak and launches them towards a deer which was passing, her aim remaining true. The kunai landed with an audible thwack, causing for the deer to topple over, more or less dead. * - Wed Nov 25 07:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: Also....we should keep in contact...we are family afterall.. - Wed Nov 25 07:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: ...I'll send a messenger when I return to Kiri. My team needs to return to the mission. - Wed Nov 25 07:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: *nods* Don't forget your deer.  - Wed Nov 25 07:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) forms but a single handseal, attempting to shunshin away. * - Wed Nov 25 07:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) clone disperses* - Wed Nov 25 07:11:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxas The Hokage) says: Waiting I guess - Wed Nov 25 07:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Waiting on who? - Wed Nov 25 07:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxas The Hokage) says: on what more or less - Wed Nov 25 07:20:44 2015
