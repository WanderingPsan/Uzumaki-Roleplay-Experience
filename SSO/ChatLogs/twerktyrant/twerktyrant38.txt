With a quick grin and nod of the head. "Sure, i'll be a flower girl." * - Wed Nov 18 08:02:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) had walked over towards Bryson under the assumption he'd give her some kind of spiritual or religious advice, instead she was met with terrible news. She was pulled in towards the man and informed about her brothers death, Tetsumis death. 

Normally, had it been anyone else Izanami would have calm and collected, but this, this was her beloved older brother he had spoke of. As far back as the little girl could remember, Tetsumi has been nothing but kind, caring and protective, qualities all elder brothers should have possessed. To hear that your kin had suffered a fate such as death was at the very least, immensly unsettling. 

Immediately, the little girl jerked backward, aiming to get away from Bryson, her actions clearly fueled both by confusion and anger. "What do you mean dead..Tetsumi is my older brother, he isn't dead, he shouldn't be dead....he's supposed to be there for me...." she murmered for a brusque second before taking a few more steps away from Bryson. Her onyx colored eyes swiftly made contact with the sand before her. 

"He's supposed to watch over me and see me grow into a great ninja, he CAN'T be gone...not yet, not now.." she continued to mumble as her eyes began to moisten with tears. She immediately took both her little pale hands and shoved them into her face, more specifically before her moistened eyes just before tears began to cascade down her cheeks. Strands of white hair which were once orderly and tame now lay strung across her face in a tuffled mess, a jumble of the prestine white strands tucked between her fingers as she bawled. 

"T-tears...a ninja...*sniffle* Isn't supposed to cry..." she murmered through struggled stiffles of air before she dropped to her knees. "Brother...why so soon.." she simply lay upon the sand now, wallowing in her own sadness * - Wed Nov 18 09:28:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) walks off to a lone position in Sunagakure, the little white haired girl taking this moment to train. It was all she could do, the only thing she could do in order to keep her brother Tetsumi off of her mind. Tetsumi was gone now, and she didn't even get the ability to say her last goodbye. That left a heavy pit within her stomach as she stared at the ground before her. 

"I need to honor my brothers memory by becoming as strong as I possibly can...but before that, I need to figure out who murdered him in cold blood...and get rid of them..." she remarked before closing her eyes, there was only a slight hint of indifference in her tone, for she tried her earnest to keep as calm and collected as possible. 

Her hands then suddenly came together, forming a single handseal. "Fire style..." she murmered before arching her back forth and placing her index and middle fingers before her face. These two fingers congenially met at their tips in order to form a makeshift ring which served no other purpose but to control the scope of the flames which subsequently came hurdeling from her maw. The flames met the hot sunagakure air in a vehement and vibrant display of orange and red, the dull brown and grayish colors of the sand temporarily washed in the vibrance of orange. 

Immediately after performing the fireball, Izanami would contort her handseals with the intention of forming a total of two handseals this time around, her cheeks swelling ever so slightly as she drew chakra manifested oil into her mouth. Her intention was to swiftly hange techniques as fast as possible.

Unfortunately, there was slight delay in her jutsu execution, which in turn translated to a failure on the battlefield which could have resulted in her immediate death. Though it was just a few moments in which her delay resided, these moments were all an opposing shinobi needed in order to strike her down. "Not quick enough..." she remarked aloud. * - Thu Nov 19 06:32:57 2015
