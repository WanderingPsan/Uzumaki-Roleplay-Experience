In a fit of speedy display, Izanami soared forth across the ground, reaching Hiroshi in a matter of seconds, her bow drawn.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I guess impressive could be one of three... - Tue Oct 20 09:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: My Wind Armor takes ridiculous amounts of chakra and focuses them around my body at an insane rate that changes my body....My 2 finger Nukite takes all of the chakra that I would be using for Wind Armor and focuses it on just 2 fingers, it creates a blade so sharp I cut through Jiki's Iron Sand Armor and shield in one lunge and stil cut into his body. - Tue Oct 20 09:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sounds like you could've taken on Zetsumo alone. Then again, I never was skilled enough to test his strength that well. - Tue Oct 20 09:41:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Is a technique I developed that uses my body as a medium and forms hundred of explosion tages made from my chakra, they all eplode at one, just before they explode they summon another to explode as well, it creates a never-ending massive explosion. - Tue Oct 20 09:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: It could probably level a city. - Tue Oct 20 09:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: And it's a forbidden jutsu. - Tue Oct 20 09:44:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Fuuinjutsu? - Tue Oct 20 09:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: In short, its an explosion that keeps going until it kills the target. - Tue Oct 20 09:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Nope. - Tue Oct 20 09:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I never was good at fuuinjutsu. - Tue Oct 20 09:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Explosive tags are extremely weak though. - Tue Oct 20 09:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: They are made from my chakra. - Tue Oct 20 09:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Meaning one of these is enough to blow the shit out of most things. - Tue Oct 20 09:46:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) stares over at Tetsuki, her face contorting slightly under the veil of her hat. "Shes the same age?" * - Wed Oct 21 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Ha.. same age as my cousin. - Wed Oct 21 00:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) tilts her hat just a bit in regards towards Tetsukis comment. "Thank you.~ My daddy gave it to me.." she responded * - Wed Oct 21 00:15:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) says: We can collect butterflies together.  - Wed Oct 21 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) frowns a bit at Tetsukis comment, remembering back to how Tetsuki spoke of her father in the restaraunt. 

With a quick grin, Izanami took her hat right off her head and attempts to give it to Tetsuki. "Here, of course we can be friends.~" she stated * - Wed Oct 21 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) folds her arms and glances around, wondering what they should do indeed. "Uhh...what do you like to do?" she asked * - Wed Oct 21 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Ha she gotta go to school. - Wed Oct 21 00:25:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: *Squints* - Wed Oct 21 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: Blegh, no. - Wed Oct 21 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: Anyone around here want to spar? - Wed Oct 21 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) glances at Arata. "Hm..I kinda' do.~" * - Wed Oct 21 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) says: I'll cheer for you.~ - Wed Oct 21 00:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hehe, thanks.~  - Wed Oct 21 00:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: Let's go then. - Wed Oct 21 00:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) turns and stares at Arata. 

"Mkay.~" the girl chimed, following directly behind Arata had he moved somewhere else * - Wed Oct 21 00:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: brb - Wed Oct 21 00:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watched Aratas eyes, the girl immediately bounding backward, aiming to claim a bit of distance. She knew well enough not to get to close to people with those kind of eyes. 

"Just like Koji.." she thought to herself, her arm drawing upon her bowsword..* - Wed Oct 21 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) says: Pretty eyes!~ - Wed Oct 21 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) flinched as Arata charged forth with speed just above her own, her eyes widening as she attempted to quickly duck to the right. Unfortunately for her, his attack speed was alot quicker than his movement speed, and she was accordingly struck. 

She'd get hit in one of her chakra points, thus causing a rather strange sensation to course through her. "He's really fast!" she thought as she contorted her little body into a roll. 

Upon rolling, she'd complete a quick handseal, a plume of prestine white smoke exploding before her, a clone leaping forth from the smoke with the intention of sending a kick to Aratas jaw. 

As for the real Izanami, she'd take this moment to prepare yet another handseal. * - Wed Oct 21 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) says: Wow, go go Izanami-chan! - Wed Oct 21 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) was suddenly caked in a layer of flame which almost acted like a seperate skin, the flame obviously intent on licking Aratas fingers had he approached any further. 

She wasn't able to combat such a quick combatant in close quarters, not yet atleast. * - Wed Oct 21 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) says: Wow! You became fire Izanami-chan! - Wed Oct 21 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) skids backward, releasing her fire shroud as soon as he called the spar off, which of course didnt last long at all. 
"That was short.." Izanami thought before adjusting her position. "I'm Izanami." she stated. She then glanced over at Tetsuki with a smile.* - Wed Oct 21 00:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watched carefully as her tenketsu was unsealed, noting no visible difference or anything, though she felt the change entirely. 

"A pinky promise?" she inquired * - Wed Oct 21 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: Mhm. - Wed Oct 21 00:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: A pinky promise, for both of us to get stronger. - Wed Oct 21 00:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) stares at Aratas pinky momentarily, a small grin beseiging her. She thus extended her hand in an attempt to lock pinky to pinky. She proceeds to nod, confirmation of her agreement. * - Wed Oct 21 01:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hmm.. - Wed Oct 21 01:02:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Uhm.  - Wed Oct 21 01:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) folds her arms and glances up, trying to recollect her time spent with her father. "It was pretty fun I guess, we'd sit and he'd teach me stuff. I really liked learning from him. He's super nice." 

She paused for a moment. "But then evryone wanted to learn from him..and then he started hanging out with other people more than he did with me. All these other girls always wanted to learn from him.." * - Wed Oct 21 01:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) bats her eyes as Tetsuki explains her situation, which was about twenty times worse than hers. "O-oh..I'm sorry...why did he do that?" she asked * - Wed Oct 21 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) says: He wanted to make me strong. - Wed Oct 21 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) says: Hmph! - Wed Oct 21 01:16:48 2015
