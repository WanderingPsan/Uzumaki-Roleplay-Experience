<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watches as Trilliams clones approaches, being the fact that she only had one arm put her at a disadvantage, now that Trilliam had produced clones meant she was at an even greater disadvantage then before. 

She concentrated a bit of chakra into her blade, flame suddenly engulfing her katana before she flicked her arm forth, aiming to strike in a crescent like formation, her swing aiming to account for each clone approaching her...

From the blade shot a crescent like arc of fire natured chakra which shot through the air at good speeds, aiming to melt right through the clones and proceed on to Trilliam. * - Sat Nov 28 03:58:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watched as Trilliam put up the wall, the little girls eyes coming to a pronounced narrow as she slowly swivled around. She quickly adjusted the katana within her hand, extending both her index and middle fingers out towards the earth...

Suddenly, lightning crackled before her finger in the form of a small ball before jolting outwards with the intention of slamming right into the earth, potentially piercing it...

However, due to the differences in elemental trainings, she doubt it would go all the way through, she just wanted to frighten Trilliam a bit. 

"Be aware, Izanami...he can virtually attack from anywhere as long as their is earth..." she thought. * - Sat Nov 28 04:07:28 2015
