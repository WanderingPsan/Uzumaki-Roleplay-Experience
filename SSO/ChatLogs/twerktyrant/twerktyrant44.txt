<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) archs an eyebrow, completely thrown by the technique Lera had just used. "What the..." the girl thought, moving back ever just slightly. She was amazed Lera had the ability to create a new element . "W-what exactly..does it do?" she inquired* - Sun Nov 29 20:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Its....difficult to put it into words. - Sun Nov 29 20:43:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Right. - Sun Nov 29 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Right then...tell me in your own words. What do you think Earth is? At its core. - Sun Nov 29 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Uhm, effecting the earth around you with chakra in order to manipulate it to your desired affect.  - Sun Nov 29 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Or are you talking about...literal earth, not the nature. - Sun Nov 29 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: The academic answer. Yes thats right. - Sun Nov 29 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: But theres more to it then that. - Sun Nov 29 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) simply sits and listens to Leras explination of earth, the girl giving a brusque nod. "I see..." she remarked after her explination had ended. 


"It manipulated gravity itself you said?" clearly confused as to what Lera had meant by this. * - Sun Nov 29 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Yes, Gravity. How do you think I'm able to fly? - Sun Nov 29 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I see.. - Sun Nov 29 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I almost forgot about that. - Sun Nov 29 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Mhm. It works both ways as I'm sure you remember. Both to increase and Decrease. - Sun Nov 29 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Earth is also exeptional at capturing enemies without harming them. - Sun Nov 29 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Mhm... - Sun Nov 29 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Trilliams dome like jutsu proves that much. - Sun Nov 29 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Ah yeah. The one I taught him? - Sun Nov 29 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Earthen Coridoor. Very useful. - Sun Nov 29 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Especially for someone who uses Fire as well. - Sun Nov 29 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hm. - Sun Nov 29 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Anyway. We'll start with the basics today. Finding your Earthen chakra. - Sun Nov 29 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: For that, you should be in direct contact with earth. - Sun Nov 29 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) glances at the rock surface, the little girl staring at the rock slab. Immediately, she hops unto the rock slab and sits down after Lera gestures for her to sit with her. 

"Are we going to meditate?"  she inquires * - Sun Nov 29 21:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Mhm. - Sun Nov 29 21:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: It'll come to you naturally. - Sun Nov 29 21:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) crosses her legs and nods, the girl closing her eyes after a few moments of idle relaxation. This wasn't the first time Izanami had meditated, in reality she had meditated many times before since her father had instructed her to do so in order to find herself. 


--Of course this would come natural to her, but she needed to discover and connect with her earth element and that would take awhile. * - Sun Nov 29 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //Whilst mid meditation, Izanami picked up upon a difference in Leras chakra, the girl vaguely pinpointing its location in the rock. "There's no mistaking it..that's her chakra flowing through the rock..." the girl thought

Izanami took this as a que, aiming to send her chakra into the rock itself, aiming to tap into the feeling of being connected to the earth* - Sun Nov 29 21:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hey.~ - Sun Nov 29 22:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Do you have any missions I can complete? - Sun Nov 29 22:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***KazeKage**(Gamuhz2) says: Sure. - Sun Nov 29 23:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) goes off to fucking deliver wood and shit, didn't matter where it seemed. All this mission literally consisted of was a crippled seven year old aiming to deliver material to god knows who. Fortunately, the person in charge of deligation in regards to where the wood had went gave her the specifics. 

The wood supply needed to be delivered to the outskirts of Sunagakure no Sato, there happened to be some mild construction going on there. The village was in the process of making outposts, these outposts serving as points in which people can take refuge in case a sand-storm blows by.

Izanami helped load up a medium sized wagon full of wooden planks and set off, marching on ahead of the cart in order to act as its first line of defense, who knew about people these days, theyd do almost anything to get their hands on some wooden boards...*-_-*

With all said and done, she had completed her mission without much delay, the little girl taking wood from point A, to point B rather swiftly. With that in mind, she had returned home, intent on awaiting the second portion of the chunnin exams;  she was still unsure as to who she'd be teamed with this time around. * - Sun Nov 29 23:31:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) immediately hops upward, reaching the top of the sand mound; a quick flick of the wrist followed her bound, the little girl releasing a total of four explosive tags around the flag. 

With the tags armed, she'd land next to Hiroshi. 

"Hiro and I will advance, Paine and Momura, watch over the flag......" shed remark before glancing at Hiro...

"Hiroshi, transform into a windmill shuriken..."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) attempts to land upon the sand hilld, with a prompt thud and bend of her knees. "Alirght, good work!" she yelped with a mighty grin before attempting to grab unto the flag and wrench it from the sand hill. She kept her senses tuned in about her with the intention of not letting herself succumb to any suprise attacks. 

If she got the flag, she'd take off into the skies with it once again, intent on taking it right back to their own base. By no means did she intend to leave Hiroshi here by himself the entire time.* - Mon Nov 30 02:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //the moment Ais paper came to rush for the flag, izanami took use of her great skill with fire, a simple flick of her wrist heading for the flag allowing for her to bend her fire to her will, producing a flame wall of the sorts to counter act the paper moving for the flag.

"Hmph!" the girl grunted as the flame which encapsulated her suddenly manipulaed itself into an anvil like shape with the intention of slamming right into Kinami as she attempted to strike her. 

The flame would cause concussive damage and would ultimately lead to Kinami being thrown back, moreso than being burned. As for Ais paper, the fireshroud would most likely burn the little strips of it attempted to bind her before it had enough time to get its job done. 

With that being said, if Izanami was succesful, she'd bolt away from the flag, immediately propelling herself towards Hiroshi with a simple sigh. She thus attempted to stay by his side, assuring he wouldnt be captured * - Mon Nov 30 02:54:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watched as Kinami dodged the first strike. "Interesting..." the girl remarked, her eyes coming to a narrow. As Kinami attempted to roundhouse her, the girl would find that Izanami had equally sharp reflexes. The girl would relax her fire shield and duck, avoiding the roundhouse kick, narrowly of course.

That being said, Izanami would propell herself forth with fire in the form of a short burst, blitzing forth at immense speeds towards Hiroshis body, attempting to grab him out of the way in order to avoid cloth bindage.

She was panting a bit this time, her eyes narrowed a bit. "Hng....come on hiroshi step your game up...I can't protect you forever..." she remarked, keeping her senses fine tuned to her surroundings. 

The tackle sure as hell hurt, but it was by no means enough to down her. She's taken greater hits then that.

With that, she transferred her chakra right into Ai, enacting a genjutsu; one that would simply serve ti disorient her. That being said, she'd send Ai into a genjutsu that pulled at her deepest fear. * - Mon Nov 30 03:43:34 2015

That being said, she'd release her great fire propulsion and begin plummetting herself, her hand extended towards Kinami. "Bad move." she remarked before a bolt of lightning streaked from her fingertips with the intention of moving right through the girls thighs. 

The bolt of lightning was quick and deadly, aswell as numbing if struck....

It also helped that Izanami had good accuracy. * - Mon Nov 30 04:03:12 2015
