<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) closes her eyes, the zen state of mind her father was talking about something she thought she had already achieved. "I thought that's what I was doing.

"So I wouldn't succumb to emotions on the field of battle" * - Sun Nov  1 03:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) purses her lips slightly. "Is there?" she thought to herself before closing her eyes once more. Only a girl at about the tender age of seven, she found the thought of meditation to be extremely boring and without reward. It'd be a miracle if she could perhaps focus for even a moment. 

"Emotions...do I need them then?" she inquired within her head, perplexed at the situation she found herself in. * - Sun Nov  1 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) scrunches her face a little as she ponders upon the question. "are you asking whether or not I can look at others getting hurt without getting angry or sad?" If I can remain completely..calm?" * - Sun Nov  1 03:56:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) continues to keep her eyes closed. "Well of course I can...now that i've come to realize that the world is cover coated in sugar and rainbows....I've got nothing else to do but accept it for what it is, and accept what happens around me.." she paused for a moment. 

"But isn't that being...emotionless?" * - Sun Nov  1 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Think of what Zen meditation truly means.. - Sun Nov  1 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: A state of mind of which you are at peace with yourself..Nothing outside of this room or your mind matters for now or the enxt few days. - Sun Nov  1 04:01:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) gives a brusque nod. "Mhm." in the back of her mind she was completely confident she could pull something like that off. * - Sun Nov  1 04:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Good..Try it now. - Sun Nov  1 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) closes her eyes and simply sits there, finally buying into this meditation bullshit everyone seemed to be doing these days. "At peace with myself huh?" Izanami thought within the deep confines of her mind.  "That sounds like a bunch of bologna." she thought. 

There, she sat. Transfixed in a state of silence and stillness. She moved not a muscle, despite the strong intentions to simply bolt out of the room. After what seemed to be like hours, she finally attained a state of complete peace and concentration; or so it had seemed on the outside.

--Inside, Izanami lay amongst a vast expanse of nothingness in a pensile state. The nothingness which she so lackadaisically lingered in seem to represent her mind. 

"So you've finally made it! " a voice mystically called to Izanami off in the vast expanse of nothingness. Izanamis brow quirked, the voice sounding strikingly familiar. 

"M-my voice?" Izanami inquired, her eyes coming to a modest squint. Through the modest squint, she could make out a figure, a figure of bright white which pranced along directly towards her. "Wh-who are you?" Izanami beckoned to the white, phantasmal being. The being had however, came to form, and suprisingly enough, it was Izanamis form...a clear doppleganger of herself. 

"Why I'm you silly.~" the second izanami responded, giving a quick and gentle smile which was simultaneously met with a cock of the head. 

--Izanami stood in awe for a moment before pursing her lips. "No..you aren't me...you're who I used to be.." 

The second Izanami looked on with a smile nontheless. "Yep! I used to have fun, learning jutsu and fighting!~ But now, you're always so boring and moody all the time..."

The real Izanami responded with a prompt. "Of course I am, don't you know what I went through..? I finally figured out what the world is really about, what happens out there...there's no such thing as fun." 

--"Nah ah!" the second Izanami interrupted with a finger wag. "YOU make it that way, the world is what you make it, you just have to try harder! Being a stick without emotions won't get you anywhere, it'll just leave you as mean as all these evil people you see going around hurting people. You need to be you, not anyone or anything else."

Izanami was taken back, was she just being scolded...by her more innocent self? 

"B-but how?" 

The second Izanami thus feintly smiled. "Just....be you....it's alright to let go, but don't get rid of who you are. Just keep your mind at peace and your heart always passionate for what and who you love, let everything else go...don't hate...don't be jealous....don't be sad..just be you, be at peace." the second Izanami lowly stated before coming forth and giving the original a quaint hug. 

--The hug, it felt...warm to the touch.

--Be herself, but let go...she understood what she meant. * - Sun Nov  1 05:02:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) "Give me one sec, just let me take out the stuff I can't use.." she stated, removing her bowsword and katana, placing them into the sand off to the side. After such, Izanami would stroll forth and sigh. "Alright...I'm ready..." she thought to herself, her eyes coming to a narrow. 

"He beat Trilliam, so he's obviously better then he looks." she murmered in a hushed tone of voice, making sure she her opponent couldn't hear. 

--"Alright, here I come!" the girl yelled, her hands suddenly slamming together. ripping through a total of five handseals as she simultaneously bolted forth. * - Mon Nov  2 02:52:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watches as a familiar technique churns about before her. Immediately, she'd throw herself into the air, directly above the earth style ninjutsu HIroshi had attempted to slow her with. Her reflexes were sharp, that much was clear. 

--Whilst mid air, Izanami would reach into her weapons pouch; her hand instinctively grabbed at two shuriken which she would then launch right towards the grounded Hiroshi in hopes of grazing his right arm. * - Mon Nov  2 03:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Yeah it is who you betting on Uncle. - Mon Nov  2 03:02:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Think you can show me that charka enchanted strength technique now? - Mon Nov  2 03:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watched as her shuriken were diverted with wind style ninjutsu, her eyes coming to a narrow as Hiroshi shot upward to meet her in mid-air combat. "He's quick..." she thought as she immediately through up her arms, aiming to pad the heel drop with her forearms. Unfortunately, being a little girl, she didn't have the physical reslience nor strength to combat the blow, so she was sent hurdeling into the ground. Her little body hit the sand with a severe thud; she was rendered motionless atop of the sand. 

--Poof--

Her body then exploded into a plume of prestine white smoke which was blown away bot the hot sunagakure winds, revealing in her place her slightly rusted katana. 

Izanami now stood in the position she placed the katana in, making it a point to use the weapon from the beginning as a means to test the waters. Her intentions were never really to get rid of some extra weight, rather she was intent on using them as a means of cautiously approaching battle. 

"So he uses earth and wind nature, atleast from what I've gathered so far...He's however far sharper at reacting physically, he won't be easy to beat." Izanami thought, her mind clearing itself of all the unecessary excitement that had to be offered from the outside world, all she needed to focus on was keeping calm and collected...* - Mon Nov  2 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: That's not a technique I possess. - Mon Nov  2 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Hey is he talkin about that thing. - Mon Nov  2 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) gets hit and dies of internal bleeding * - Mon Nov  2 03:23:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Tch. - Mon Nov  2 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) immediately attempts to avoid the right hook aimed at her stomach by bounding backward, it was a narrow escape but an escape nontheless. The boys knuckles, skimmed her cloak as she jumped backward, the girl easily able to tell she'd be in trouble if the strike had landed. 

"The speed of his attacks are no joke either..." she thought * - Mon Nov  2 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Why is she holding back...Hm.. - Mon Nov  2 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: This is pretty boring. - Mon Nov  2 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) had possessed sharp reflexes, but by no means was she sharp enough to avod the mutliple set of kicks aimed at her body. She had swiftly blocked and avoided each strike until the very end, where in which a right kick would push her back, throwing her little body right off of the sand. 

She was then sent skidding a couple of a feet away, the girl aiming to hault her advance by jamming her hands into the sand. 

She winced slightly, giving just a brusque grin. "Nice hit, I bet if you wanted I would've been done right there.~" she called. Her tone was to be expected of a little girl, much like the old Izanami everyone has grown to know. 

--Her expression then took on a sudden seriousness. "Alright, I think I've got enough out of what he does...taijutsu is his specialty..and he covers his weak spots by utilizing elements to slow his opponents down..."

"Phew...here I come!"

Immediately, her hands slammed together in order to form a single handseal. Upon formation of the single handseals, a ball of flame came roaring from her gullet; her father and trilliam especially would come to note that the ball of flame was drastically weaker than what it usually is. * - Mon Nov  2 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) grins as Hiroshi had dodged, something she had anticipated...and hoped he would do, seeing as how she didn't want to roast him. Her eyes kept constant vigilance over her opponent, carefully watching as two clones were formed. "Clones?" she thought. 

Her hands then came together, holding a t-like shape before her chest. Two clones of her own appeared at her sides, however, the clones she had formed were much more capable. 

"Alright, i'm going to get a little more serious, okay?" * - Mon Nov  2 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Children please - Mon Nov  2 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: -omit- - Mon Nov  2 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //Both of the clones would react accordingly.

Clone #1: This clone would react by vaulting forth, a spark flying free from its hand as the earthen clone approached. From the spark, came an explosion of fire upon their positions; the goal being to cause the both of them to disperse, making sure to level the earth so it couldn't reform while sacrificing itself. 

Clone 2: This clone had went all out, performing a shortened set of handseals to spew a line of fire right at the approaching clone, aiming to encapsulate it in flame. As for Izanami, she reacted to the wind bullets by bounding backwards, performing a few rigid flips before landing on the wall. 


All the while, her mind was clear and focused on one thing. 


From her weapons pouch she drew three shuriken. With a quick flick of the wrist, she had launched the shuriken; all three of them had a translucent wire attached to the end. Anyone with an enhanced line of sight would be able to tell. 

These shuriken swerved for Hiroshis position, two for his right and one for his left. * - Mon Nov  2 04:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) "Now.." she thought, anticipating once more that he'd attempt to use wind to divert the shuriken. Immediately, fire ran along the wire and eventually lit the shuriken upon the end of the wire on fire aswell; the wind which slammed intot he fire enhanced shuriken only served to increase their potency. 

Wires of flame danced from her fingertips, but of course in doing so, so was their course. The shuriken swervered off to the side, the girl giving a quick flick of both arms, aiming to steady the shuriken and swing her flaming wires around.

The whips of flame elegantly danced through the air as they soared towards Hiroshi. Her skill over fire had allowed her to sustain the flow of chaka whilst continously manipulating the shuriken she had prepped before hand. * - Mon Nov  2 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: She makes me so proud at times. - Mon Nov  2 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watches as her flaming whips had missed, her eyes narrowing just slightly, "He hid in the earth..." she thought to herself as she relesed the fire upon the wire and shuriken, allowing them to revert back to the standard ninja tools they once were. 

With a quick flick of her arms, she manipulates them efficently whilst her clone stabs her katana into the ground. She'd manipulate the shuriken around the katana. 

The shuriken would rotate and rotate around and around until it developed a tight enough grip; after tightening the wire, her clone would position the shruiken acorrdingly, taking a kunai and stabbing it through the hole of the shuriken so that it;d be much harder to knock loose. 

Doing this, she had effectively formed a makeshift tight rope. She slowly crept unto the tight rope. "Trilliam hides underground all the time...yet he's somehow still able to know where people are...maybe if I stay off the ground and on artificial platforms, he wont see me.." she thought. * - Mon Nov  2 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: The moment he comes up... - Mon Nov  2 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) the clone on the ground was the closest possible person towards Hiroshi. Izanami couldn't help but laugh herself, she went way to far and above for a little spar...making a tight rope. 

The clone strolled forth and extended her arm in order to complete the fist bump. "That was pretty fun, we should spar again sometime." the clone remarked before giving a cock of the head and grin before poofing away. 

As for Izanami, she'd hop off the rop and land with a little thud. 

"I learned alot myself.~" * - Mon Nov  2 04:34:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watches the ground tremble, her eyes remaining cool and seemingly glazed over with a sense of tranquility. His brute strength in fact didn't scare her one bit. "If you can't even beat me, I doubt my grandfather would be bothered to face you." she stated * - Tue Nov  3 07:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Be careful Iza.. - Tue Nov  3 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) slowly strides forth, her eyes casually grazing the sand before her. Immediately, she stopped mid-stride, craning her neck just slightly so she could glance over at her father. "I'll be fine." she stated. 

With that being said, she took her position, coming just yards away from her opponent. The little girl seemed confident on the exterior, but by no means did this say she was cocky. 

Izanami, took it upon herself to hold a stoic and otherwise serene internal state of mind. She found it best that she hold this kind of quality about herself, especially in battle where if she had allowed her thoughts and emotions to run rampart, could cost her a strike or worse, her death. 

"Can we begin?" she inquired in a monotnous fashion, her lackadaisical attitude in response to her opponents words were surely bound to upset him. * - Tue Nov  3 07:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) "He has a firm and strong body...he's clearly got the upperhand in all things physical. " the young girl thought, her stoic expression remaining true. "If there's one thing I've learned over my short time as a shinobi, it's that brute strength and powerful ninjutsu doesn't solve all the problems we encounter..." 

She paused for a brusque moment before taking a step back, her hands suddenly coming together; upon coming together her fingers would intertwine to form two handseals. "No matter how much we bulk ourselves up physically or enhance ourselves with ninjutsu...and no matter how much we try to deny it, we are in the end people...and as people we all have something that we fear."

After formation of the two handseals, Aklys would more than likely fall for Izanamis visible and audible trigger for her genjutsu. Though it was low in rank, it held a pretty dastardly effect. To him, sand would rotate all around his being, obscuring his view of the outside world momentarily. 

--After a few seconds, the sand would subside, and reveal to the bohemoth his worst fear. * - Tue Nov  3 08:10:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //is thrown off gaurd as her genjutsu had literally no effect. "Nothing..." she murmered under her breath as she brought her hands together in the form of a single handseal. "Tr-" before she could even finish speaking, the bulking man was rushing at her, advancing on her position in a matter of seconds. 

--A clone had appeared in her stead and took the brunt of her blow before being instantaneously dispelled. Izanami herself was sent hurdeling across the sand like a ragdoll. 

She skid to a stop just short of the wall, her body seemingly crushed under the force. 

Blood trickled from the young girls lip, her first thought being to panic....that was, until she thought about what her father said, she needed to be at peace, yet at the same time seperate from what was going on around her.

"I see.." Izanami murmered under her breath as she slowly rose, staggering to her feet as she slowly regained her bearings. "You aren't a normal person...I guess i'll have to use more ordinary methods..." she remarked, a tuffle of prestine white hair shielding her face from view. Her katana lay idle in the sand, just out of reach.

"Do not cry when in pain....do not run when in danger....do not lose who you are, Izanami." she stated within her mind, dragging a forearm across her face to wipe the blood free. 

Her hair began to whisp around before standing on end, as if a small gale was lifting it into the air; her cloak elegantly danced in stark contrast. Immediately, fire erupted around her being, enshrouding her in a powerful cloak of ninjutsu. Anyone standing nearby could simply feel the heat radiating from the girls skin. It was in this moment that she lifted her head, her eyes visible for all to see. They were focused, driven...yet at the same time, detatched. 

"Katon.." she thought, her hands slamming together to form a singular handseal; immediately following her head cocked, a fireball sent hurdeling from her maw right towards Aklys. With her little body hidden behind the fireball, shed form another five handseals * - Tue Nov  3 08:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //The fireball she had shot had missed, and upon missing, it would swerve into the ground an erupt, sending a plume of sand and smoke up into the air in its wake. The fireballs power was clearly enough to leave a crater in its stead. 

She watched as Laxys attempted to strike the ground, the girl taking note of his ability to create shockwaves. Immediately, the girl would leap into the air in order to avoid the strike upon the ground; her reflexes were sharp that much was clear. 

Her stoic expression remained strong.  * - Tue Nov  3 08:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) thinks: She needs to tag out, that hit did quite a number on her. She'll get herself killed like this. - Tue Nov  3 08:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) narrows her eyes, oh how oddly that was familiar. "Hm..." the girl hummed as Aklys launched at her position to deal a devestating blow. Once more, she was rocketed from her position.

--However, she didn't succumb to the blow, her body was enveloped in a shroud of prestine white smoke,  the girl immediately replacing herself with her katana. 

Thereafter, she'd once again launch a powerful fireball, this time using all of her ninjutsu power. It was clear she wasn't going to allow herself to be made a fool today. * - Tue Nov  3 08:50:20 2015
