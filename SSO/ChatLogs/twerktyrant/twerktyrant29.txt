<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) walks into the house and sets her homework upon the table, giving it a rather empty glance before slipping off her shoes. After slipping off her shoes, Izanami would proceed to stride right into her room, closing the door right behind her and locking it. 

"Phew..." she sighed, moving over to her bed. With a slight jump in her step, she ambled up unto the bed and took a meditative position. She was instructed by no one else but her father to begin this strange ritual of meditation; her father insisting that it would be good for her. 

So, after taking on a meditative stance, she began to drift into her spirituality, closing her eyes.

The world around her drew black, her earthly tethers slowly fading one by one as she gradually seperated her physical and spiritual self from the binds of normal life. She needed to erase herself, yet at the same time remain true to who she was.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) walks into her house and sits her homework down upon the table once more, giving it but a simple glance. "I'll do that later when I actually have the time..." the girl whispered within her head before gradually shuffling over towards her bed. She'd slowly amble up unto the bed and flick a thick strand of white hair over her shoulder. 

"Time to meditate like my dad taught me.." the girl thought to herself before closing her eyes. Once more, she had begun the ritual of seperating herself from earthly tethers. Each and everyday, she was feeling more serene and disconnected, as if she were gradually lifting the weight of the world from her shoulders.

"Alright, here we go.." she thought before immediately bolting forward, aiming to clear the distance in a matter of moments.

Upon reaching Ivel, she'd unsheathe her blade halfway, intent on slamming the end of her hilt into his gut. * - Thu Nov  5 20:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) narrowed her eyes as a fireball came cascading on her position, immediately engulfing her being in fire. Normally, this would've spelled immediate end for the little girl. Fortunately, she had prepped a kawarimi before hand, replacing herself with her bowsword she had set down just moments ago. 

--In her prior position, Izanami would slap her palms together in order to form the tiger handseal. "Katon.." she thought, her lips pursing ever so slightly to allow passage of a fireball. 

Her fireball skid through the air, its trajectory thrown off clearly on purpose to allow a bit of leway for Ivel; she didn't want to seriously harm him. * - Thu Nov  5 20:48:51 2015

Smoke filled the area, a hot sunagakure wind coursing over the area. Izanami stood tall however, her eyes trained upon Ivel. * - Thu Nov  5 20:56:32 2015
