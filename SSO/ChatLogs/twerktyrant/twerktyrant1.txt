<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) mimics his actions and continues. "HMMMMhhmmmmmmmmmhHMMMMMMMMMMMMHMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM 

HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM?" * - Sun Aug 30 17:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) passes out * - Sun Aug 30 17:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) collapses aswell, although she was struck with a fit of giggles. "Thank you.~ I try!" she remarked * - Sun Aug 30 17:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) moves over to sit on the bench with a sigh* - Mon Aug 31 21:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) glances over at Jiki as he lowers beside her, the girl positiong her bow sword across her lap appropriately. 

She gave a brisk grin and responded. "Nothin'. Just, hanging out I guess. I might start practicing, fire looks so pretty at night!" * - Mon Aug 31 21:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) glances over at Tetsumi as he inquires about Fuji, her eyes coming to a gentle close. "Well, yeah but he's probably busy doing something." she remarked, her hands coming together at the palms, her eyes opening to fixate themselves at the ground.  * - Mon Aug 31 22:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) simply remains silent for the most part, the girls eyes simply trailing back and forth between them both. These two seemed like they wanted to squabble, and she wanted no part in that. "Erhm..." she hummed just slightly, bouncing off of the bench and unto her feet. "I guess I'll start practicing now." she stated in an attempt to clear the awkward air. * - Mon Aug 31 22:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) glances over at Dravae, her right eyebrow perking upward just slightly. "Are you two mad at eachother?" she inquired, adjusting her gaze so that she looked straight ahead. Her hands came together, palm to palm at chest level, the girls fingers thust intertwining to perform handseals. These handseals would give birth to fire based ninjutsu. 

From her mouth, she expelled flame. * - Mon Aug 31 22:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) closes her eyes for just a brusque moment, adjusting his gaze over towards Dravae. She wasn't really aware of what her real mother was like, the only mother figure she really knew of was Berith. "She did it too?" she inquired, thus turning back to face the direction she was training in. 

Her hands contorted to form the required handseals, the girl formulating another set of handseals. She thus pursed her lips and exuded fire into the air. It was a small fireball, but it was a fireball nonetheless. * - Mon Aug 31 23:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) glances over at Zehl and shrugs a bit before going back to her own business, the girl aiming to increase her skill with the fire-style. Her hands came together, palm to palm. Her fingers would immediately begin to intertwine to begin forming the technique specific set of handseals. She'd stop on the tiger seal and begin focusing her fire natured chakra, aiming to gather the warm chakra within her gullet.* - Tue Sep 01 00:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) had no idea who Kronos was herself, so she just went about her business practicing her ninjutsu. What place was it for a little six year old girl who knows little about the world to know about Kronos? 

Her hands came together, her fingers immediately contorting to form handseals. Immediately following, came the congregation of flame natured chakra within her gullet. This chakra was then expelled through her pursed lips in the form of a small stream of flame. * - Tue Sep 01 00:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) glances over at Dravae and pouts. "Why do I have to go inside?" she honestly questions. * - Tue Sep 01 01:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) hums and proceeds to walk inside, her eyes quickly shuffeling over towards Kronos * - Tue Sep 01 01:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) barges out of the building, clearly unhappy with being trapped inside. "Boooring!" she yelped, the little girl immediately marching over towards Dravae. "It got boring and quiet so i came out." she remarked. * - Tue Sep 01 02:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) quickly salutes Dravae, responding with a brusque. "Aye!" * - Tue Sep 01 02:24:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Dravae(VantetheGreat) whispers: I know he has herd the news of your moters death by now and many know the it was due to your birth he may try to take you from us in some wierd delusion. - Tue Sep 01 02:34:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Dravae(VantetheGreat) whispers: I think it will be best if you bug testu about him playing with you to keep him around justu incase Kronos tries something) - Tue Sep 01 02:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dravae(VantetheGreat) whispers: so Nami stay away for him avoid him as hard as you can okay. - Tue Sep 01 02:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) glances over at Yan as he practices his water based ninjutsu, her eyes coming to a refined narrow. "Maybe I should practice my fire..." she thought. She then immediately brought both her left and right hands in so they clasped together at the palms. Her fingers then contorted at odd angles to formulate the handseals necessary to the jutsu. 

She'd focus her fire natured chakra into her gullet before cocking her head forth and pursing her lips. From her lips rolled a steady stream of vibrant flame which washed across the sand. After a few seconds of usage, she'd cease the flow of chakra, causing the flame to dissipate. * - Tue Sep 01 14:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) pressed her lips together, the girl taking note of her chakra output. "It's still not like daddies, mine is so much smaller!" she thought, a bit of frustration lingering within her mind. "Gotta' keep trying!" she yelped, her right hand immediately clenching, determination shining through her eyes. 

Just like before, her hands would come together in order to form the required handseals. Within her body, her fire natured chakra would come to fruition. With a cock of the head and pursing of the lips, a stream of fire once again rolled from her lips. This fire was a bit more vibrant and larger than before, though by no means was it the best * - Tue Sep 01 14:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) heaves a heavy sigh, the girl having decided to use this time to take a breather. "Dangit! What's the trick?" she thought, the girl wiping a bit of sweat from her forehead. 

She once again attempted the fireball jutsu, her eyes coming to a narrow as flame spewed from her lips once more. * - Tue Sep 01 15:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) purses her lips in frustration. "Still not okay." she remarked, the girls hands coming together to form the required handseals. She'd land on the tiger handseal, her fire natured chakra beginning to concentrate itself within her gullet. 

Thereafter, she'd exude said fire natured chakra in the form of a ball of flame which zipped across tthe sand before dissipating.  * - Tue Sep 01 15:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) places her bowsword on her back and sighs. * - Tue Sep 01 16:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) catches said scroll with a glance of inquiry * - Tue Sep 01 16:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) proceeds to walk away whilst waving at Dravae. "I'll be right back, i'm going to go collect drugs!" she remarked * - Tue Sep 01 16:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) went on about her business to begin drug hunting, something the girl had never really considered doing before. Drugs? What were drugs? Could her six year old mind even come to a conclusion as to what drugs were? "Are drugs like super bugs, but instead of calling them bugs they call them drugs? Or are drugs like..dugs but they forgot to make the r inside the dugs? WHO KNOWS!" she thought as she skipped along to her destination. * - Tue Sep 01 17:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) had succesfully made her way to the slums of Sunagakure; these slums were notabley littered with gang violence, piss-poor enviornmental conditions, drug dealers, drug addicts and any other negative aspect of life one could possibly think of. Was it wise to send a little six year old girl into such dangerous territory? 

She sighed and held her hands behind her back, the girl casually walkign through with a smile on her face * - Tue Sep 01 17:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Soujiku Ryuusei(Vartio-uncaged) whispers: Ey fam. - Tue Sep 01 17:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Soujiku Ryuusei(Vartio-uncaged) whispers: That booty looking small. - Tue Sep 01 17:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) stabs * - Tue Sep 01 17:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) STAAAAABS * - Tue Sep 01 17:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) she had approached some elderly man sitting on the side of the road, perched against one of the sand walls. Her eyes narrowed just slightly, wondering why he looked so down...

Upon getting closer she could tell, this man was sick. Patches of skin had been missing from his body, and some teeth had rotted away, he was definately in bad shape. 

"Uhm, hi sir, I'm here to take your drugs!" she remarked, clearly not understanding the situation at hand. 

True to nature, the man grabbed at his precious drugs and what not with the intention of keeping them self, leaving Izanami only one option. She had immediately launched forth, bowsword in hand at this point. With a plentiful leap, she made it to the man and swung, bludgeoning him over the head with the weapon, knocking him out cold. 

"Hm! Sorry!" she remarked before grabbing at the bag and trotting off. * - Tue Sep 01 17:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) stops for a moment and snaps her fingers. "Oyeah!" she pocketed the substance and walked back over to man. 

--Of course, she had to admit them to the hospital, it was a key part of the mission, she had almost forgot. It took awhile but he was finally admitted. 

Izanami would rinse and repeat the process as many times as it took. * - Tue Sep 01 17:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) comes back and salutes Chiyari. "DONE." * - Tue Sep 01 17:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) catches the reward with a wide grin. "Thank you!" she remarked. * - Tue Sep 01 17:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) nudges Dravae in the side with her bowsword. * - Tue Sep 01 17:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watches as Dravae fals over, seemingly playing dead, her cheeks puffing just slightly. "I didn't poke you that hard!" she remarked, walking over with the intent of nudging him in the side. 

She gave him a couple of nudges, her facial expression softening. "U-uhm...h-hello? " she stammered, clearly getting a bit worried. * - Tue Sep 01 18:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watched as the bugs began to crawl over Dravae, her eyes widening in disbelief. "Ahhhghhh!" she roared at the top of her lungs as she now held the blunt end of the bowsword overhead. 

"BEGOOOONE!!!" she roared as she began to whack Dravae with the intention of ridding his body of bugs.

"LEAVE!"

"LEAVE"

"LEAAAVEEE" * - Tue Sep 01 18:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) would've felt the shaking ground, the girl literally rocked from her foundation. She'd lose her balance and fall flat on her face, receiving a mouthful of sand. "Oof!" * - Tue Sep 01 18:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) shoves her hands into the ground and lifts her face right from the sand, a waterfall of dirt and sand alike cascading from her mouth. "Blegh...pew..." she spat sand as she looked over to see how Dravae was. 

"A-are you okay?" * - Tue Sep 01 18:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) proceeds to give a plentiful hop unto the wooden stand, the girl casually sitting atop as she looked down at Dravae. "So...those sick men I helped, they were addicted?" she inquired. * - Tue Sep 01 20:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) looks down at the ground a bit, her eyes narrowing. "Drugs....they make people sick yet they still do them...I dont get it?" she thought * - Tue Sep 01 20:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) grumbles and stands on the pole she was posted on; the girl reaching for her two wooden shuriken. With great sleight of hand, she launched the two shuriken, one aimed for the side of Osamus head, the other for ground before Mayas feet; clearly she disliked one more than the other. 

"Stop it!" she yelled. * - Tue Sep 01 21:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) whispers: Do you trust me? - Tue Sep 01 21:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) folds her arms. "What's going on?" she inquired. * - Tue Sep 01 21:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) is grabbed, the girl immediately shaking her head. "H-hey wait! What's going on?" she remarked, her eyes widening gaze fixated ahead. She heard a familiar voice, a voice she had come to know.

There was something different although. * - Thu Sep 03 02:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) squints and pouts at Dravae, her eyes narrowing just slightly. "What are you trying to hide!" she yelped, aiming to lock eyes with the man.* - Thu Sep 03 02:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) glances around and gives a shrug, the young girl noticing that there werent that many people around. "Guess i'll practice again.~" she remarked to herself, her hands coming together at the palms. Her fingers then intertwined to form handseals specific to a single technique. After forming the required handseals, she would then concentrate on her fire natured chakra with the intent of gathering it within her gullet. 

She'd proceed to exude a medium sized fireball out unto the sand before her.* - Thu Sep 03 16:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) turns around and glances at Fujitora, her eyes widening. "Daddy!" she yelped before immediately jumping forth in order to hug him.* - Fri Sep 04 23:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) glances around a bit, simply absorbing all the information she could. * - Sat Sep 05 00:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) looks over at Fuji as she says this * - Sat Sep 05 01:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) glances at Yan, noticing that he had dropped into some kind of stance. "What's he doing?" the girl thought. 

Nonetheless, she took it upon herself to place her bowsword upon her back whilst diving into her pocket to retreive two wooden shuriken she had always kept handy. 

With a determined look in her eye, she had spoke. 

"Here I go!" she yelped, giving the two wooden shuriken a flick right as she drew them from her pouch, making it hard to notice she even drew two at all. The shuriken sped forth, the second shuriken neatly tucked into the shadow of the first. 

She aimed for Yans right leg. * - Sat Sep 05 01:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) widened her eyes, the girl responding in a natural way of course. Her shuriken were useless against the water, her intial thought being to run away. "Wait no! The fire jutsu!" she yelped, her hands coming together at about chest level. She too weaved handseals, but not nearly as quick as a seasoned shinobi; hopefully she could make it in time. 

She pursed her lips and cocked her head, exuding flame into the air, aiming to use it as a continous stream. Hopefully, she had enough prowess to atleast combat the water jutsu even though it was of a weaker level. * - Sat Sep 05 01:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) narrows her eyes as the two techniques collide; her technique clearly weaker than that of her opponents. Although, intially it did infact come to equal terms with the type of jutsu he had used. Steam had filled the immediate area, a clear after affect of the ninjutsus collision. 

Luckily, Izanamis eyes were fine-tuned, and allowed her to percieve even more handseals being weaved on her opponents end. "He's going to hit me!" she thought as she released her ninjutsu, catching wind of yet another wave rushing her way. 

She was by no means quick enough to avoid it by normal means, which is precisely why she threw up a single handseal. The tiger handseal more specifically. 

*Swoosh!* in a plume of sand she had seemingly vanished, the girl utilizing the shunshin technique to compensate for her lack of natural speed. She had sped all the way over tot he side in order to avoid said water technique. * - Sat Sep 05 01:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) turns around and glances at Yan, the girl giving a quick shake of the fist. "What if I drownnnnned!~" she yelped, pouting only slightly. "  * - Sat Sep 05 01:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) widens her eyes, taking note of the technique he had just used. "Just like...." she thought. The girl immediately drew her bowsword as the clone drew forth, intent on using her weapon as a means to keep the clone at bay. "What do I do?" she inquired within her head * - Sat Sep 05 01:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) the girl glanced at the clone, her intial thought being to simply run away. She instead had an idea. She propelled herself backward, throwing her body right into the wall. Whilst in mid-air, she performed a sharp flip, planning it so that her feet pressed against the wall. Upon making contact with the wall, she'd apply a small layer of chakra to her feet to keep herself balance; her right hand had returned the bowsword to her back. 

The chakra she had once applied to keep herself pinned against the wall was then released in a violent burst as she launched herself into the air, boosting just over the clone and Yan respectively. 

As she soared through the air, she formed a familiar set of handseals, this time drawing her right hand towards her face where her fingers would come together to make a makeshift ring, used for the controlling the scope of her flame. 

A good-sized plume of flame rolled forth with the intention of swallowing the clone, and perhaps slightly reaching Yan.* - Sat Sep 05 01:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) had landed atop of the sand as the fire had cleared, the girl perched in a crouched position. "What the..." she remarked, her eyes feverishly darting around in search of her opponent. "Where did he go!?" * - Sat Sep 05 02:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) widened her eyes and held up both her arms. "WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIT!" She called, as if she were issuing a time out. * - Sat Sep 05 02:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) "Thanks" she remarked before she takes the water and begins to drink, in small sips of course. * - Sat Sep 05 02:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) places a hand on a head and grins a bit. "I lost.~"* - Sat Sep 05 02:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) widens her eyes, becoming very enthused by how he was able to throw flaming shuriken. She almost missed the question in fact. "O-oh yeah! I can." * - Sat Sep 05 03:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) glances at the tip of her bowsword. "Will this work?" * - Sat Sep 05 03:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) glances at the tip of the bow, her eyes coming to a refined narrow. Her black eyes which were once full of child-like innocence now possessed by fierce determination. She was adamant about learning this technique. 

Izanami couldn't quite explain it, but she felt at home when it came to all things shinobi related, like it was her purpose....

"Hmmmmmmmm....." she hummed as she concentrated, not even able to produce a flicker. * - Sat Sep 05 03:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) "PHew.." she remarked, a bit winded from her attempt. "Okay wait..I can do this, lemme' try again..." she remarked, her eyes coming to a narrow. She adjusted her bowsword, placing it at such an angle where she could easily stare at the tip of it, aiming to invoke her fire natured chakra right unto it. ONce again however, she had miserably failed. * - Sat Sep 05 03:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) heaved a heavy sigh,  clearly unable to make anything of the ninjutsu. "Dangit..." she remarked, her eyes coming to a reserved close. "Kay...I got this....I totally...got this.." her intial step to actually performing the technique being to focus her chakra correctly instead of just absent mindedly giving it a go.* - Sat Sep 05 03:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) keeps on attempting the ninjutsu, her eyes coming to a refined narrow as they now bore daggers at the tip of her bowsword. A bead of sweat rolled down her brow before *spark*. A bit of flame erupted at the tip of her blade, her eyes widening just as the flame died down. 

She had mustered the ability to produce a mediocre flame, but a flame in reality. She was definately making progress. * - Sat Sep 05 03:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) sits on the bench and removes her bowsword from her back, the young girl setting it aside momentarily as her eyes trailed over towards Yan. "Hmm.." she hummed. * - Sun Sep 06 15:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) turns around and stares at Chi, Yan and Orakuru respectively, wondering just what they were talking about. Instead of keeping silent, she had decided to inquire about what was going on. 

"What are you guys talking about?" * - Sun Sep 06 16:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //Was only a six year old, but even a girl as young as her could understand that whoever this was, was not a nice man. Underneath her clothing she had brandished two shuriken within her right hand, prepared to launch them just in case. 

She was ready to combat the so called bully in her eyes. * - Sun Sep 06 17:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) stares at Tethys and responds with a simple. "Daddy told me not to approach strangers." she responded. * - Sun Sep 06 17:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) bats her eyes, nearly telling Tethys until she had remembered something Dravae had instructed her about. * - Sun Sep 06 17:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watches as a battle begins to take place, the young girls eyes widening to extreme proportions as Tethys zooms across towards Ushinawa * - Sun Sep 06 18:24:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) widened her eyes in response to the fight going on, not really having seen anything of this caliber at all. This was her first time watching a real fight, and how inense it was.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chiyari(Guujin) whispers: Assist Teyths. - Sun Sep 06 19:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) widens her eyes as everyone begins fighting, the little girl immediately leaping off of the bench and unto the sand, aiding her propulsion with a fine burst of chakra. This what have hopefully sent her skidding behind Chiyari, where she had assumed it'd be safe. * - Sun Sep 06 19:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) walks forth and makes a quick leap unto the bench, her eyes coming to a narrow upon orakuru. * - Sun Sep 06 20:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: Pssst.. - Sun Sep 06 20:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) nudges Fujitora and whispers something. * - Sun Sep 06 20:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: What are you guys...doing? - Sun Sep 06 20:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: Somone's going to die? - Sun Sep 06 20:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: They're planning a attack..All out war.. - Sun Sep 06 20:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: Isn't..killing...bad? - Sun Sep 06 20:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: It is...Very, but this man who they target..At one point wanted to kill your mother , he killed many.. - Sun Sep 06 20:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: Mmm... - Sun Sep 06 20:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) sits down and folds her arm, adjusting her now blank stare unto the sand below. How could she feel about such a touchy subject. "Killing is wrong...killing is down by bad people...yet.....my daddy is going to go help kill...but he's killing a bad person so it's okay for good people to kill? But..wouldn't that make them bad too?" she thought.

At this point she slightly gripped her head, confusing even herself. * - Sun Sep 06 20:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Tre sanders) whispers: Stay in the mansion or hidden tunnel witht the REAL me.. - Sun Sep 06 20:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) grows bored of just sitting around, so without much thought to it, the little six year old girl began focusing on her fire ninjutsu. She had to grow more skilled with it or else she wouldn't have much leverage on the other students within the academy. 
--In reality she was more than suited to be a genin, but guess it mattered not to the higher ups. She took out her bowsword and began to flow fire natured chakra through it.* - Tue Sep 08 16:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) stops for a brusque moment and glances at her bowsword, noticing that it had not indeed been engulfed in the scope of flame she had been desiring. She'd adjust her grip over the bowsword, her eyes coming to a narrow as she focused unto the end. 

Almost immediately, the end had become engulfed in a powerful flame, the likes of which was at about the right level considering her age.* - Tue Sep 08 16:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) closes her eyes and relaxes the flame which vibrantly danced about her bowsword, the girl giving a confident nod. "I'm getting better everyday!" she thought for a second before growing silent. 

"But...this ninjutsu im learning...am I learning it to kill bad people...like daddy?" she thought for a brusque moment before igniting the bow once again. * - Tue Sep 08 17:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) glances over at Namuko and nods * - Tue Sep 08 17:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) twirls her bowsword around a bti before catching it between both her hands, the girl once again attempting to flow fire natured chakra right through the weapon. The weapon would've suddenly found itself ignited, well atleast the tip. Fire danced upon the weapons tip as she struggled to keep it active. * - Tue Sep 08 17:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) noticed that her silent friend had grown even more silent, which left her with limited things to do. "Guess..I'll just practice." she murmered to herself as she sat unto the bench, her eyes coming to a slight narrow as she grabbed a kunai. 

She held the kunai upright within her right hand, her focus drawn to the lethal end of the weapon. Suddenly, it'd be engulfed with flame, the flame flickering to life. * - Thu Sep 10 01:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) suddenly jerked her head in the direction of a miniscule voice, her eyes drawn to the head poked through the surface of the earth. 

"..." she suddenly froze in place, her body motionless, dumbfounded at what she had just witnessed. 

[ Her face: https://avvesione.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/chihayafuru_2-11-chihaya-surprised-shocked-panic-cute-blank_stare.jpg]

"Just...a head..." she thought before suddenly falling right off the bench and unto her back, paralyzed from the shock of a seemingly disembodied Yan. * - Thu Sep 10 01:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) slowly came too, turning over to face Yan. "Head...I dunno'" she remarked, glancing around herself. 

"Who is edge...? Like..the edge of something?" * - Thu Sep 10 01:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) glances at Fujitora and shakes her head a bit. "not yet, I haven't tried!" she remarked, glancing down at her kunai. She began to flow chakra right into the kunai, the tip of it igniting with flame. The flame flickered and danced upon the kunai as she attempted to control its scope. * - Thu Sep 10 02:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) hops unto the bench, clearly ignored. "Egh..." she groaned. * - Thu Sep 10 02:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) takes said scroll and glances it over. "What's this?" * - Thu Sep 10 02:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watches on, her eyes lighting up as she saw the technique being used. "Ooooooh, cool!" she remarked. 

"I'll learn I-" she suddenly fell sound asleep, scroll tucked in her arms. * - Thu Sep 10 02:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) glances at whoever she was teaching. * - Fri Sep 11 02:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) stares at Anguo and narrows her eyes. "Hey, do you wanna' learn or not?" she inquired, getting slightly annoyed that he remained silent even though she had asked a question. * - Fri Sep 11 02:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) makes a soured expression in Anguos direction, having second thoughts about showing him anything with the kind of attitude his was giving.

"Dunno'...having second thoughts." * - Fri Sep 11 02:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) glances over at Fujitora has he proceeds to walk away towards their house, the girl giving but a brisk nod and smile. "Yeah, sure!" she remarked. * - Fri Sep 11 02:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) proceeds to open her scroll, the girl casually reading from the information posted on the technique. The technique was rather simple in its use, like a scaled down version of the fireball technique. "This isn't too hard..." she remarked to herself as she proceeded to mimic the handseals posted upon the face of the scroll, aiming to lock their order in her head. * - Fri Sep 11 02:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) glances over at Flexus has he pulls out a chicken sandwhich. The girl initially paid him no mind. 

"UHm...hi?" * - Fri Sep 11 02:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) she goes back to her business almost immediately, her eyes grazing over the scroll as she ever so slightly unraveled it and unraveled it more and more, soaking in all the information it had to provide like a sponge. Izanami was more than capable of rapidly learning techniques of this level, that was evident. She had an inherit ability to learn and master techniques rarely seen in children her age. * - Fri Sep 11 02:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) she once again returns to her scroll after asking Flexus about his hunger, he seemed to rapidly demolish the sandwich he had, which had lead her to believe that he was infact starving or something. If that was the case, she had no problem offering him food. 

--Anyway, she began to read the information even more, aiming to soak up as much knowledge as she could, aiming to get a basic understanding of the technique. She was comprehending it, all of it, and at an accelerated rate. * - Fri Sep 11 02:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) bats her eyes a bit and glances over at Flexus, her eyes widening a bit. "So you don't get fat?" she inquired before turning right back to her scroll with the intention of soaking up the information provided within it. She was making record time in learning its contents. It was strange, because this time around she took to studying the information closer. * - Fri Sep 11 02:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) takes a moment to stop reading her scroll, glancing up from her work before adjusting her gaze towards the sky. "Can I stll even use the fireball?" she thought to herself before bringing her hands to about chest level where her fingers would rapidly intertwine to form handseals. After forming the handseals, she'd purse her lips and exude a particularly strong flame right into the air. 

After a few seconds she let the flame fade. "Yup." * - Fri Sep 11 02:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) proceeds to set her scroll aside, having finally learned the technique, deciding that she had enough of the formalities. She brought her hands together at about chest level once more where her fingers would rapidly intertwine to form the required handseals. After the handseal execution, she pursed her lips and attempted to exude the flame-She had failed.

She didn't get the technique righ this time around. * - Fri Sep 11 02:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) had puckered her lips slightly, feeling a slight stinging sensation of the failed flame technique whisking her lips. ""Ouchie...I messed up and hurt myself a little bit.." she thought, her hands once again coming together to form the required handseals for the dragon fire technique. Unfortunately, she had once again failed to perform the technique, though this time she was able to produce the flame necessary, just not in proper form. * - Fri Sep 11 02:53:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) glances over at Ryuga, not really paying him any mind since she couldn't really discern what he had said. She more or less kept to herself at this point, the girls eyes coming to a narrow as she brought her hands together, adjusting her gaze towards the sky. 

With a few quick handseals, she had drawn the necessary chakra to perform her technique. She cocked her head and spewed a good sized flame into the air, clearly practicing her technique. * - Sat Sep 12 01:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) bats her eyes just slightly, wondering what in the world was going on with Ryuga. Then she thought about it, he was using an ability similar to Tetsu. "Hmm.." she hummed for a brusque second before weaving another set of handseals, building up fire natured chakra within her gullet. 

Without much hesitation, she launched yet another fireball right into the air. * - Sat Sep 12 01:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) proceeds to continue practicing her firestyle, making sure it was in its tip-top condition, especially if she wanted to become a genin. As it stood, it'd be absurd to let her pass onto genin at the ripe age of six, though that wasn't to say she lacked the skill level. She was more than qualified to become a genin at her current level, that much was obvious. She once again wove handseals, gathering up her fire natured chakra.* - Sat Sep 12 02:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //After succesfully intermingling her normal chakras and her elemental chakras, she would give birth to a fire natured chakra that had its own distinct properties. She'd gather this chakra within her gullet and then expand it out up her throat and out into the open world where she'd cast a powerful jutsu. 

The jutsu sped forth with the intention of meeting the air with powerful heat. * - Sat Sep 12 02:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) turns around and attempts to perform a different jutsu this time, rhytmically motioning through an extensive set of handseals. She then glanced over at Koji and Flexus, wondering what those two were up to. Initially she decided not to pay them much mind. 

She decided to just continue to practice her firestyle. * - Sat Sep 12 02:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: .... - Sat Sep 12 03:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) suddenly reaches into her weapons pouch, drawing a single shuriken. With relative ease, she threw the shuriken with great skill and precision, aiming to curve the weapon right into the side of Kojis head. 

The shuriken of course was wooden, so it'd most likely simple stun him and deter his focus so Flexus could get away from the creepy dude.* - Sat Sep 12 03:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hm.. - Sat Sep 12 03:51:28 2015
