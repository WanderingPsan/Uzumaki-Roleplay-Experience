<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) takes a seat and folds her legs over one another, sitting in a criss-cross applesauce like stance. That being said, she decided to meditate, allowing for Lera to observe whatever she wanted to see. 

With that, she would begin to meditate on her earth element. * - Tue Dec  1 20:39:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Speaking of Training...I need to get on with mine... - Tue Dec  1 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) stares at Lera as she popped up from the ground, her eyes coming to a close before the little girl gave a brusque nod. "No, I don't have any questions; I think i'll give it a try myself." the girl remarked. With that in mind, she swiveled around on her heel and stared at the ground with the intention of starting the technique. 
 Immediately, she attempted to soften the earth beneath her via chakra, aiming to practically swim through it as Lera had done just moments ago. 
"Hm...." 

Unfortunately, her first attempt had failed, leaving Izanami standing ankle deep within softened earth. Had she used enough chakra to completely submerge she would have buried herself alive, precisely as Lera had warned just moments ago. "Let me try that one more time...." the girl thought, internally breaking down the jutsu and gauging just how much chakra it required in one attempt before making another. That being said, she'd manipulate the earth around her once more with the intention to sink right in, the girl slowly slinking into the softened earth. 
--She then progressed to add motion into the mix, aiming to actively soften the earth as a means to move right through it. She had popped up directly besides Leras feet with a small cough. "Nothin' to stop the bugs from getting in your mouth though." she remarked. * - Tue Dec  1 21:00:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) stares at Lera as she pulls her clone into the ground, the girl giving a brusque nod once again. "I remember that....Trilliam used something like that awhile ago, or atleast he tried to use it on me.." she stated before grinning. "Lemme give it a try, should be simple."* - Tue Dec  1 21:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) attempts to sink into the ground and move over towards Leras clone, with that being said, shed reach upward and rab at the womans ankles before attempting to yank her down into the softened earth. Izanami was confident she could nail the simple technique in one go, there was nothing complicated about it in the slightest. * - Tue Dec  1 21:11:02 2015

"Hmmmmmmm...." she hummed, her onyx colored eyes focusing on the weapon itself. She flowed chakra, but nothing happened, nothing at all. 

"Hmmmmmm......." she continued to hum before her weapon became suddenly enveloped in earth-like chakra, the girl heaving a heavy sigh. "Wasn't as easy as I thought...I should stop being so sure of myself....that's how I ended up losing my arm..." the girl thought before releasing the chakra flow technique and sheathing her blade. * - Tue Dec  1 21:28:57 2015
