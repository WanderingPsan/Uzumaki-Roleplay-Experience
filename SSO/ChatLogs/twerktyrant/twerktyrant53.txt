<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Throwing a punch is a joke. Very clearly it is not a threat that we, as shinobi, face every day. - Wed Dec  9 03:18:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) lands and nods, her back faced towards Fuji. "I just didn't want alot of people to see." she remarked, the girl slowly turning around, her sharingan eyes fixated upon Fujitora. He'd immediately noticed that they had matured slightly, adopting one more tomoe than before. 

"I wanted to practice with these..."* - Wed Dec  9 05:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) gives a brusque nod, the girls eyes narrowing just slightly. "I'm ready whenever you are." the girl remarked, lowering her stance a bit, wondering what Fuji had prepared to do. 

"These eyes, I wonder just what and how much they are capable of." * - Wed Dec  9 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watched the fire technique hurdle towards her direction, the girls eyes coming to a narrow. Her cheeks swelled, and her chakra heightened, almost immediately, her own flame came forth, however in a different form. She spewed flame which hit the floor and rose into the air in the form of a wall, blocking the fire technique, a large explosion erupting between the two.

"Hn!"

Unfortunately, she wasn't able to copy techniques as her father and Hiro were able to. 
"Everythings much more clear though..." * - Wed Dec  9 05:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) follows Fujitora with her now enhanced eyesight, the girls eyes coming to a narrow as he bolted toward her side. Immediately, she'd draw her own blade, ripping it free from its sheathe before allowing it to swing inbetween her fingers. She'd catch it in a reverse grip as Fujitora swung. 

--*CLANG*

The two weapons clashed, Izanamis eyes easily allowing her to keep up with such highspeed movement, everything she perceived on a much more sharpened and defined level than before. "Everythings much more clear to me now." * - Wed Dec  9 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //Izanami watched as the shuriken and kunai came her way, leaving her a limited amount of options. Dodge and avoid them all, or risk taking some of them on. She was pretty confident about her reflexes either way. 

Immediately, she twirled her sword around within her right hand, allowing for her to catch it in a reverse grip. Once more she began batting away the kunai, swatting away as many as she could whilst ducking and weaving. 

Immediately after, she'd extend her hand and concentrate wind natured chakra, aiming to send a large pulse of wind at the oncoming weaponry, aiming to blow them back to avoid injury. * - Wed Dec  9 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) narrows her eyes, had she possessed both her arms this would render a simple counter, but being that she couldnt perform handseals, she had to rely on her reflexes and wit to get out of this one. So, that being said, she ducked and weaved and hopped around the battlefield with the hopes of avoiding any stray fireballs. 

Shed of course give a casual counter of a small flame wall conjured of her own free will in the instance she couldnt dodge. * - Wed Dec  9 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watched as a portion of her flames were seemingly sealed; her eyes narrowing as he sliced through her flame. "Hm." she remarked, giving a quick swing of the blade, applying a earth chakra flow this time around, nigh doubling the durability of her weapon against his own blade as they clashed.

HOpefully this would prove strong enough to combat whatever force he was coming at her with. * - Wed Dec  9 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) //Her reflexes were sharp, her sharingan eyes narrowing the moment Fujitora went to grab her shoulder. Immediately, with the aid of fire propulsion, she rocketed away, performing a few sereise of flips before coming to a skidding stop in a crouched position. 

"Phew..." she remarked, clearly getitng used to her new pair of eyes as time passed. * - Wed Dec  9 06:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) watched as Fuji shot what appeared to be balls of flame, the girls sharingan eyes coming to a narrow as she extended her one good arm whilst katana in hand, once again displaying a sudden change in chakra nature. *ZIP!*

A bolt of lightning would streak forth from her index and middle fingers, speeding right towards Fujitora at breakneck speeds. 

As for the exploding fire shots well, she'd redirect herself as quickly as possible in order to avoid the balls of flame. * - Wed Dec  9 07:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) skids to a stop, releasing her fire propulsion ability as she exhaled, clearly winded by such intense bursts of battle. "Hm..." she hummed, her sharingan eyes narrowing unto Fuji, assessing his every moment and precise detail even the greatest of eyes would normally miss. "Alright.....I think that's it for me haha." she remarked. * - Wed Dec  9 07:40:22 2015
