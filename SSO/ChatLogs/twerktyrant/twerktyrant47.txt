<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) moves to a secluded area in which she could find peace. "Alright, time to work on my ninjutsu again...this is going to be a lot harder since I won't be able to use half of my techniques..." the girl remarked, a small suck of the teeth promptly following before she readjusted her katana and took off her cloak. That being said, Izanami would proceed to begin. 

First, she began by extending her left arm, which of course was her only arm at the time. "Hm..." she hummed as her onyx colored eyes focused on the expanse of sand before her, the plethora of sand giving off the appearance of a brown ocean. A hot, sunagakure breeze blew overhead, causing for her silk white hair to billow in its gentle embrace, her body remaining placid and unmoved.  Her index and middle finger extended themselves whilst her other fingers curled inward.

Lightning would crackle and pop to life as streaks of raiton bolted around a small, vibrant teal orb. "Now..." the girl remarked as her eyes narrowed themselves even further. The orb of lightning style chakra seemed to collapse upon itself before suddenly bolting forth, zipping through the air at immense speeds, nearly intraceable by normal means. It streaked across the sky, leaving nothing but sound in its wake. 

--"My turn." Izanami stated within her head as she lowered her arm and leaned forward. As she leaned forward, she concentrated a good amount of chakra into her legs, one simple propulsion was all that was needed to zip forth, the girl narrowly passing her technique she had launched off just moments ago. A mixture of fire and lightning possessed the air, the two elements combatting for dominance. 

Izanami immediately bolted before her lightning bullet, her arm extended like it was just moments ago. "HmpH!" she grunted as she skid to a stop and launched another bullet of lightning, allowing this one to hurdle towards the one she had already launched mere moments ago. The two bolts of lightning would violently collide, erupting in mid air, sending tendrils of stray lightning off in odd directions. "Still not good enough." the girl remarked. * - Thu Dec  3 01:30:52 2015
