<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mashai(Novaraven747) would look over his puppet. He took great care of it, being his first and only puppet he had created to date.

He inspected all the nooks and crannys of the puppet making sure its joints were not sticking or jamming. He would smile and would bring chakra strings from his fingertips and cause the puppet to move off off his lap and begin floating in the air.

Mashai moved a few fingers on each hand. After about a second, the puppet's appendages would twitch slightly. He then moved a few more fingers again. The puppets arms would strech out and would hang to it's side after about the same time delay as before.

<Hmm.. Looks to be in working order.> He though.

He moved his hands towards himself and a few fingers on each and the puppet raced back to Mashai. He then moved his hands forward and moved a few fingers again and the pupet raced forward. Both took about a second to register before the puppet responded.

<Hmm. The control is good, but its not perfect. The delay is still too long> He though frowning.

He would lead the puppet back to himself and would let it rest on his lap once again. He loved his puppet. It was the only friend he needed really even if it didn't talk.* - Sun Oct 25 20:50:59 2015

To some people it looked like he was talking to himself but he was talking to his puppet which was drapped on his back. Every so often the Puppet would turn it's head towards Mashai and then back in front of him. In reality, Mashai was controling the puppet. But he didn't see it as a puppet. He saw it as a living thing. Something with life. Even if it was him giving it that life.* - Mon Oct 26 18:41:42 2015

Mashai would move his left hand forward and move a few fingers with it. The puppet responded with and forward movement with both its hand balled into a fist and would then stop suddenly and would move back as Mashai drew his hand back and moved his fingers again.

He then moved a few of the fingers on his right hand and the mouth compartment opened and released a few senbon from the mouth of the puppet. He then qukcly moved his left hand to have the puppet chase after the senbon. 

Mashai then move is hand over one another like a cross and the entire upper body of the puppet would spin causing the arms to hang out and would hit anything in its way.
