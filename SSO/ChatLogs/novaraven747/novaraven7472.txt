<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mashai(Novaraven747) would get into a stance and connect himself to his puppet via the chakra strings. He would cross his  to his chest and move his fingers a little, the puppet in the carry responded by moving it's hand and grabbing the cloth surrounding it.

Mashai moved his hands out and moved his fingers. The puppet would lossen it's bindings and would leap from the carry and to Mashai's side. The carry would fall behind Mashai and sit there in a heap.

He would move his wrist and fingers on his right simultanoiusly. The puppet responded by pulling it's right highest arm back to prepare to throw a punch. He then moved the hand forwards and move his fingers slightly. The Puppet would close it's hand into a fist and would move forward throwing a puch at the air.

Mashai then quickly pulled his left hand across and would move his fingers a tad. The puppet's upper section of the body would rotate as a secondary attack.

Mashai then pulled his left hand back towards him and moved his right hand across slightly. The puppet responded by coming out of the spin with a closed fist to act as a third attack and then brought it's lower right fist up for a fourth hit.

He then brought his hand back towards him and the puppet would creep back and would rest on his shoulder.

The puppets head chattered a bit as Mashai moved his fingers.

"Mhmm. That felt like a good combo Takuro. But  we haven't tried using the weapons yet." Mashai said.

The puppet chattered again as Mashai moved his fingers again.

"Hmm. It's more the fact I don't want to waist perfectly good weaponry.. but, we can always think of ways to repleace or adapt the movement?" He said

The puppet remained silent for a while and then nodded.

"Alright, now get back into the carry. We're done training fot today bud." He said.

The puppet would stand on the ground and would wait for Mashai to help cover him

Mashai would grab the end of the carry clotha nd would begins to wrap it around Takuro and Takuro would help get it around himself. After a while had passed the puppet was fully covered and would chatter again withing the carry.

"I know it's cramped bud but untill I can learn to seal objects then it's your temporary home for now." He said.* - Sun Nov  1 21:47:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm usually the paper pusher of the village though so I don't get out on missions often. - Mon Nov  2 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..Uh, well, I am a chunin. - Mon Nov  2 21:51:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You should care about your strength as a ninja, though. What sort of technique styles do you use? - Mon Nov  2 21:54:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Not many one-armed Shinobi. - Mon Nov  2 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I couldn't save my best friend or my brother. They are both dead because I wasn't there to protect them. Now I've devoted my life to becoming stronger so that no one else will be killed needlessly. - Mon Nov  2 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I suppose so, but even if you get stronger, you can't stop everyone. - Mon Nov  2 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And that's why you have an entire village to help you. Many of us who settled back into Sand have worked tirelessly to create a safe enviroment...We are the most stable village in the entire world at the moment. - Mon Nov  2 21:57:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I could train with you and maybe critique you, if you'd like. Otherwise Trilliam is someone you'd probably liket o go hang out with. He's a fun guy. - Mon Nov  2 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: He didn't. - Mon Nov  2 22:03:31 2015

"Here let me show you."He said.

Mashai would pull the carry off his back and let it balance. He then would connect chakra strings to the puppet inside. He would move his fingers and wrists slightly and the puppet grabbed the inside of the carry. Mashai then movaed both hands slightly and the pupppet pulled the carry off of itself and would just list over to Mashi's side.

"This is Takuro, My friend." He said smiling.* - Wed Nov  4 16:01:42 2015

"He said that he has his own voice and doesn't need my help with speaking only translating. So no I wasn't talking." Mashai said.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mashai(Novaraven747) would move his fingers and wrist sligthly and the puppets head turned to Yan.

"Takuro. Relax. He's most likely interested about you. Not may people see a puppet all that often." He said.

He moved his wrist and fingers and the puppets head turned back towards Hiro.* - Wed Nov  4 16:24:44 2015
