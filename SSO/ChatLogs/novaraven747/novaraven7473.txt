He made a mental note of Chikyu, Zenaki and Lera's positions, if he should be approached by any of them or he need to approach them for any reason. He turned his head back and tilled his head back slightly and looked to his carry.

"You doing ok Takuro?" He asked the puppet quietly. Of course, Mashai made the puppet respond like he normally did but moving his fingers on a single hand and coasung the puppets mouth to open and close making a sound as the puppet's mouth clomped together and make the sounds it usually make when "talking". 

"Yeah... It's rather quiet. But that isn't a bad thing." He responded. The puppet communicated again.

"Sure, we can train later. We need to try and make some effort to use the weapons if we can. I can always buy more." He said smiling. The puppet "spoke a bit more before going silent.

Mashai turn his head back to his front and smiled.* - Sat Nov  7 11:41:00 2015
