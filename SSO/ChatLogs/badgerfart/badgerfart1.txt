<br><br><font color=yellow>*Setsuki, Aera(BadgerFart) walked along the road, with all the misplaced confidence a D ranked genin could have. She'd seriously neglected her training over the past few years and her body had suffered for it. So she didn't noticed when the bandits snuck up on her. It was pretty quick as far as these things go, she fought back: swining her sword out to gut one or two bandits. In the end however, there were just too many for one genin to fight.

After recieving several stab wounds and getting beaten within an inch of her life. They stripped her of anything valuable and left her for dead, with noone to save her and nobody to heal her. She was as good as dead, the life slowly leaving her after a few hours.* - Sun Oct  4 13:08:54 2015
