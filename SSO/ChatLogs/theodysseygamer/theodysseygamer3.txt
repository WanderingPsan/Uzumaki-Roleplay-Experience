<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) ran as quickly as he could to the housing area in the north. He started from the right and would make his way left, all the while scouting the area. He knocked on each door, explaining that the explosions in the sky was because they were under light attack from a small force of raiders. Some refused to leave the safety of their homes but he quickly explained to them that in situations like these it was standard for everyone to be escorted to the safehouses built by the village purely for the guarantee of safety.

Some people were stubborn but with a bit of patience he was able to move everyone out of their homes and direct them to the place Jin had told him to direct people to. He made sure to duck and weave inbetween the ally ways of the houses to scout the area out, wanting no stone to be unturned. When he was finished he'd continue to scout the area out, moving up to the north gate...* - Sun Sep 13 21:49:39 2015

He kept alert at all times, looking around himself as he moved from house to house, keeping a watchful eye out for any that may want to cause harm to his village.* - Sun Sep 13 21:55:37 2015

He moved along the shorelines making sure nothing had set off any of the traps and that no one was approaching them, Once he made the rounds he moved back to check on some villagers still in the area, asking them if they had seen or heard anything. None of them replied with anything suspicious so he moved back to the water.

Once he was there he stood on the pier and used it as a vantage point. He looked around to see if anyone or thing was there but saw nothing. He pulled his radio out and tuned it in, attempting to report back to Jin.* - Sun Sep 13 22:23:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) would come to the waterfall area to begin a new training regime of his. Since his village was now at war he needed to up his training drastically since quite frankly, he felt like fodder in comparison to others. He would be training everything and anything he could, whenever he could. He would begin with shunshin, placing his hands together and building up chakra, when he was ready he formed the ram handseal and pushed off, landing a few meters infront of himself in the blink of an eye.

When he landed back down he nearly slipped under water since he liked training while practising suimen too. Once he regained his balance he turned around and placed his hands together, building up chakra to try again. When he was ready he formed the ram hand seal and burst his chakra through his body to saturate his muscles. He moved forward quickly again, once again making it a few meters very quickly.

His balance was off a little again but since he awas quite adept at using suimen, he was quickly catching on to keeping himself balanced while using shunshin. He placed his hands together again and built up chakra as fast as he could. When he was once again ready he formed the handseal needed and burst his built up chakra through his body to saturate it. With the sudden burst of energy he moved forward a few meters on the water again within a second, managing to keep his balance this time.

He was starting to feel the effects of shunshin kick in since overuse did make the body hurt and ache but he continued on for the sake of training. He placed his hands together again and build up his chakra, bareing through the pain. When he was done he formed a handseal and burst his chakra all through his body, setting off immediately after. He once again made it a few meters before stopping, once again coming off balance because of the pain he was now feeling.

He went down to a knee from the pain and had to take a few minutes rest before standing back up to practise one last time. He placed his hands together slowly, building up chakra slowly too. He had to build it up slowly because of the pain he was feeling. He turned himself to face the closest bit of land and formed the ram handseal, bursting his chakra through his body and just making to land. He collapsed in pain from muscles spasms, perhaps over using Shunshin wasn't the best idea...* - Mon Sep 14 13:52:12 2015
