<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) went to the training field, going there to begin training mud silhouette some more. This time he wanted to train something a little more important, increasing the effective range of mud he could make. He picked a good spot and began building his chakra up as quickly as he could. Once his chakra was built up he began kneading it into the ground through his feet. He concentrated on extending his chakra out to a medium range infront of himself, pushing it as far as he could go. Once he had done that he clapped his hands and turned what he could of the ground into mud, having around half of it change into mud with the other half being patchy.

He moved to a different spot and refocused himself, begining building up chakra again shortly after. Once his chakra was ready he began dispersing it into the ground through his feet again. He continued his efforts on stretching his chakra to a medium range. Once he had successfully kneaded his chakra through the ground he clapped his hands and began to change the ground into mud. He concentrated on the chakra he had in the ground, trying make sure he had full control over his chakra at such a length. This time he managed to change roughly 80% of the earth into mud, still having patchy and dry areas here and around.

He spared no time in moving to a new area and begining building up more chakra in preparation to use the technique again. When his chakra was fully prepared he began funneling it into earth once more, focusing his efforts on stretching it to a medium sized range which seemed to be quite easy now. When that was done he simply clapped his hands like before and began focusing his efforts on changing the the earth into mud. It seemed to be getting easier now, changing more and more faster and faster. Once he was done he had managed to change most of the ground into mud, now for his next target.

He could now change the ground into mud at short and medium distances, next he would focus on doing it at long range.  With that he would again move into a new area, a little ways away from before to give himself room. Next he would build up his chakra, taking a little more time than before to build more than usual up. When that was done he began pushing his chakra into the ground, pushing it as far as his ability to control his chakra would allow. With his chakra now spreading out to long range he repeated as before, clapping his hands and converting the ground into mud, being sure to focus on his chakra as best he could over a long distance. He managed to change quite a large distance into mud, though some of it was being left out.

With that last practise done he went over to a new area and started building up his chakra as quickly as he could, finishing within a few seconds. With that done he pushed his chakra down through his legs and began kneading it into the ground, spreading it as far out as he could. Once his chakra was distributed out infront of himself he focused on it and clapped his hands, begining to change the earth into mud once more. He kept his concentration up as he changed more and more of the ground into mud. He was now getting a firm grasp on the technique, having changed most of the large area he put his chakra into, into the mud he desired.

He figured he'd practise one last time, just to make sure he had this part of the technique down. With that decided he moved to a new spot and and quickly built up his chakra, taking little to no time to do so. With that he began pushing his chakra into the ground, focusing to both increase how fast he did this and to refine the range he was capable of. After spending some time on that he clapped his hands and began changing the the ground into a large portion of mud, focusing as much as he could on refining how he did so. Once that was done and over with he walked off, going to rest a while.* - Sun Oct 11 23:55:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: The reason why I use the low kick first is because traditionally, the Leaf Whirlwind is common. - Mon Oct 12 00:05:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) thinks: Shit, so close. - Mon Oct 12 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) shuts his eyes, thinking back to Shinjins initial stance. He opens his eyes and transitions his body to mimic that stance as best he could. With that he then thought about how Shinjin moved his body down for the low kick, following suit. As he did so he prepared himself for the low kick, making sure to bring his body down far enough for him to perform said low kick. He starts to sweep his leg across the ground, placing his hand on the ground for balance as he did. As he sweeped his leg down in thw whirlwind fashion his hand slips, causing him to fall flat on his face.

He quickly gets up and dusts himself off, getting into the same stance before and steadying his breathing. Within a few seconds he would bend his head and his waist down as he moved forward, bringing his leg out in an attempt to sweep it close to the ground in a low-kick fashion. As he did this he placed a hand down onto the ground to balance himself and provide leverage. He successfully managed to perform the low-kick this time but as he starts to push himself up and transition into the high-kick he again finds himself losing balance and falling onto his back.

With an annoyed huff he gets up off the floor again and returns to the stance he was in before, once again steadying his breath. When ready he begins, first getting low, then bringing his leg out to sweep it across the ground while he used his hand for balance. Once the first kick was complete he pushed himself up, doing his best to keep himself steady. He then brings his leg up, spinning it in a whirlwind fashion and pulling off the high-kick to what would be the head of the opponent. As he was pulled that last kick off though he once again slipped with his hand due to the distribution of weight, knocing him over once more.

He nearly had this, all he needed to do was land it. He was getting a little annoyed but got up and calmed himself, taking his stance and inhaling deep breaths of air. He then exhaled deeply and brought his body down, motioning for the low-kick and placing his hand down for support. When the low kick was down he kept on bringing his leg around, pushing himself up with his hand and bringing his leg all the way around to perform the high-kick. As his leg came around again he would use this, pushing off as hard as he could with his hand and pushing his body up and over, landing on his feet...though he didn't land in the most steady of ways he had landed...finally completing the technique.* - Mon Oct 12 00:22:36 2015
