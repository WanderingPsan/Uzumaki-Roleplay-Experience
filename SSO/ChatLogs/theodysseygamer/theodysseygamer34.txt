<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) looks down as he said this, a little embarrased that he asked such a thing since most children would be happy to be adopted by someone as caring as Hana...yet the question had really been bugging him.* - Tue Oct 20 22:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Mmm? Why? Oohhhh, because I saw you as my own. - Tue Oct 20 22:32:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) looked up and back at Hana again, now feeling less embarrased than before, Hanas words to him seemed to sway him like that a lot. "Mmmm...Well if you say so..." he said, pausing for a short while as he looked down again. He would look back up after a few seconds, his mood seemingly being lighter than before now. "Well...do you want to go train now?"* - Tue Oct 20 22:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Yes! Off we go, son. - Tue Oct 20 22:38:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) whispers: I use every element. - Tue Oct 20 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) thinks: I really don't want to get grounded...she'll make me spend time with Shinjin or do paperwork... - Tue Oct 20 22:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: That doesn't answer what you're capable of.  - Tue Oct 20 22:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: How do you fight? Binding? Striking? Hit and run? - Tue Oct 20 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) whispers: Mid-long range fighting. - Tue Oct 20 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: ...Widespread covering attacks?  - Tue Oct 20 22:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: There's not much information here.  - Tue Oct 20 22:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) whispers: Pretty much, But I can also do concentrated attacks too. - Tue Oct 20 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) whispers: I'm quite a versatile fighter, but I'm useless at hand to hand. - Tue Oct 20 22:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Two more minutes. - Tue Oct 20 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: Okay. I've got a plan. - Tue Oct 20 22:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) whispers: I'm all ears. - Tue Oct 20 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: I'll run up and attack her from all sides. Stay out of sight. - Tue Oct 20 22:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: I'll be the distraction. Just focus on getting that final hit. - Tue Oct 20 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) whispers: Understood. - Tue Oct 20 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Time's up! - Tue Oct 20 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: COME GET IT! - Tue Oct 20 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) darts to the left as Heiwa rushses past him. While he himself wasn't that fast as he had never really worked on his speed, he would continue making his way to the left and around as quickly as he could. While he was doing this he would divert most of his concentration into building up chakra, simply in preperation. For now he would just be moving to the left as quickly as he could, following his part of the plan.* - Tue Oct 20 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) blinks as he sees Hana disappear, he forgot how fast she truly was at times. He turns around to where he guessed she would be headed, directly for Heiwa. His eyes lock on Hana as she is now within mid range of him, the perfect time for him to shine. He would raise his hands and form a few handseals as he ran forward, kneading chakra into his stomach and producing water.

He would then inhale a deep breath and arch himself back before pivoting his body forward and spitting the water out in the form of a stream at a high velocity towards Hana, aiming to try and knock her either back or over...although he would be holding back on the power of the jutsu, still fearing he could hurt his mother.* - Tue Oct 20 23:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) would simply cut off the stream of water as fast as he could react as Hana ran across it. He would then try and pull his arms up to protect his face and body as best he could, predicting she might attack those regions of his body. Should Hana somehow avoid the trap laid by Heiwa he would of course have his legs swept from under him, causing him to crash to the ground. In the event that the trap set by Heiwa should succeed in stopping her from sweeping at his legs, he would simply jump back to give himself some distance between her and him.* - Wed Oct 21 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Uh...Go us I guess. - Wed Oct 21 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) was glad that Hana had been stopped in her tracks, letting out a small sigh. He watched from medium distance as Heiwa seemed to spit out some kind of liquid which he guessed was a water technique, though he didn't know the jutsu he could tell that the water wasn't exactly ordinary. It did give him an idea though and with that he pushed off forward, quickly building up chakra within himself.

As he got close to the sticky water he stopped dead in his tracks and took a knee, clapping his hands together once before placing both of them on the ground. He would quickly knead his chakra into the ground as within a few seconds, the rigid earth would start to turn into a large muddy mess which sloshed about at his command. He would then push the mud forward in a small wave, hoping to combine it with the water Heiwa had made and then have it crash into Hana, resulting in her being tangled in the mixture of the two jutsu...or so he hoped.* - Wed Oct 21 01:40:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Nah, on't worry. - Wed Oct 21 02:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Do you need help getting out of that mess..? - Wed Oct 21 02:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: That would be nice, yes. - Wed Oct 21 02:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Mmmm... - Wed Oct 21 02:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) focuses chakra to his feet, utilizing suimen to try and keep his balance. Luckily the mud had been infused with his chakra so walking across the river of it wasn't too difficult, though he would occasionally stumble a little as he made his way over to Hana. He would form a few handseals, kneading chakra into his stomach again just like before. Again he would spit water in the form of a stream, albeit a lot weaker than before. He would use this water to wash away the mud and sticky water clinging to her before proceeding to try and pull her out.* - Wed Oct 21 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: To the mansion! - Wed Oct 21 02:28:28 2015

He sighed as he did, while it was true he and Hana did spend a lot of time together there were usually other people around so they couldn't really act like mother and son...at least not in the way he always wanted.

"I wish it was like this more often..." he said, still holding onto her arm and leaning against her to rest.* - Wed Oct 21 23:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: It can be, honey you just have to accept it in public!~ - Wed Oct 21 23:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: But...Then people like Sado and Gojiro would know... - Wed Oct 21 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I just...don't want this to be used against us...I'd hate myself if you were hurt because someone used me against you... - Wed Oct 21 23:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Ugh, you seriously need to stop protecting me. - Wed Oct 21 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: That's -my- job. - Wed Oct 21 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) grips onto her arm tighter after he said that, seemingly being a subject that distressed him somewhat.* - Wed Oct 21 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: But...I have to protect you too. - Wed Oct 21 23:10:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Yeah but... - Wed Oct 21 23:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: You're finally something I want to protect...I lost my friends because I couldn't protect them and i'm not going to let that stop me from protecting you! - Wed Oct 21 23:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Awww.~ You know, you seriously are the best son! But fine.... but when theres trouble and I say go.. - Wed Oct 21 23:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: You go. - Wed Oct 21 23:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Mmmm...Fine... - Wed Oct 21 23:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) thinks: I won't do that...ever. - Wed Oct 21 23:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Do you really think it would be ok if we were like this around others..? - Wed Oct 21 23:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Duh. - Wed Oct 21 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Almost some people know I am your mother. - Wed Oct 21 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Mmm...well... - Wed Oct 21 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Do you mind if I call you mum instead of Hana then..? - Wed Oct 21 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I know I said it would be weird before but...I think i'm more comfortable with it now... - Wed Oct 21 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Yes! Call me that, I don't care Takeda. I'm your mother, I adopted you. - Wed Oct 21 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: And whatever happens, we will face together!~ - Wed Oct 21 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) continued to hug onto Hanas arm, though it would be a lighter hug than before since he had calmed down and felt more relaxed now. After hearing what his mother just said to him though, it continued to help relax him around her, truly feeling safe with her. He would pull one of his arms away from his mothers, using his now free hand to pull down the facemask he usually wore, it was uncomfortable at times but he didn't mind since it hid his face. Now that he was with his mother though, he saw no reason to hide his face around her.

Once he had pulled his mask down and adjusted it to where it sat comfortably he snaked his arms around his mothers again and cuddled up close to her. "Thank you mum...thank you." he would say, his tone being a lot softer and child-like that usual.* - Wed Oct 21 23:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) 's eyes wided as he felt a kiss being planted onto his head, then a finger being pressed to his nose, it felt weird to him, he had never really had interaction like this before and he wasn't quite sure how to react. He listened to what his mother was saying, understanding why she was worried about Heiwa and the village. Afterall, he knew how much of a kind-hearted person she was.

"Hideki was Heiwas career I think...and he just abandoned him here when he left...Heiwa probably has trust issues with everyone right now, he just needs time. As for the village...well, we're just healing right now...more people will come i'm sure of it...we just need time to get back on out feet is all." he responded as best he could, hoping what he said would help reassure* - Thu Oct 22 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Yeah yeah, we'll just wait then. - Thu Oct 22 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Mhm...Shinjin could be a little more active too... - Thu Oct 22 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I still don't understand Shinjin...He confuses me so much at times... - Thu Oct 22 00:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I'm not sure whether he hates me or not... - Thu Oct 22 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: When I said sorry to him he barely took notice and didn't say anything back...yet just days later he lets me look over important documents from the Kazekage... - Thu Oct 22 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: He just... isn't the type to show affection in public. - Thu Oct 22 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: But it was just us when I said sorry to him... - Thu Oct 22 00:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Maybe he does just hate me... - Thu Oct 22 00:24:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) pulls the box closer to him, staring at it and wondering whats inside. He couldn;t wait any longer, his curiosity getting the better of him. Popping the box open it reveals a kunai inside which puzzled him a little, slowly he picks it up and inspects it, looking to Shinjin after he did. "Uh well...Thanks I guess..." Was all he could say, while it was nice to receive a gift...A kunai wasn't something he expected to be given.* - Thu Oct 22 23:06:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: You'd have to deny the bank as a whole. If you accepted the terms and still tried to maintain your own currency, i'm sure it would be an issue. It wouldn't really mean anything to be under the same bank. - Fri Oct 23 00:45:13 2015
