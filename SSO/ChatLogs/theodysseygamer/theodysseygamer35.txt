<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) didn't really understand what was happening for the first few seconds, He just saw Shinjin crouch down and stay in that position. It only occured to him that he was preparing for his technique when bright yellow flashes of lightning crackled around, the lightning even being hard to look at because it was so bright. While this form impressed him, he was more amazed with Shinjins speed, not even being able to see him move from one side of the room and back.

"Thats...quite impressive...Shinjin..." He said, blinking his eyes both out of amazement and because of the light he was giving off.* - Fri Oct 23 02:34:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) sort of just, opens his eyes real slow. He looks straight at Nori, who looked only his age if not younger...he wished Hana had not gone to bed right now. <I'm too young to deal with...any of this...why are Shinjin and Hana never around...> he thought to himself as he continued to stare at Nori.

He placed a hand over his face, rubbing his face, then moving to ruffle his hair. He was about to say something when he was told to close his eyes again, he reluctantly did so, giving a nod to Nori.* - Sat Oct 24 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) slowly sighs as he opens his eyes, aiming his vision straight at Nori. He felt sorry for her, a young girl having to sit through that all because she didn't really know what was going on. He was angry that two consenting adults would do such a thing...in such a place. He tried to control his anger as best he could, he wanted to question her, ask what these people looked like...then again he was also afraid of scaring her off or upseting her.

"I-...I'm so sorry you had to go through that Nori...why don't you come sit down next to me so we can talk about this for a little, just you and me yeah?" he said, turning his chair around and pulling it back slightly so he faced the empty chair. He hoped she would sit down.* - Sat Oct 24 03:32:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) slowly walks forward, now standing quite close to his mother. He would attempt to slip his arms around her to pull her in for a tight hug, burying his face into her shoulder. If the hug had been accepted he would hold there for a little while before turning his head to the side, now resting it on her shoulder. "Why are people like that mum..? I mean...Nori is only ten and she had to see all that..." He would say, his tone showing a hint of distress, showing he had been noticably upset by this.* - Sat Oct 24 18:47:40 2015

He looked over at the origami display, not taking much notice as he had seen the paper manipulation trick before.
