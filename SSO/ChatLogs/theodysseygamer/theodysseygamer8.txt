<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: And I can't just abandon this village. - Sun Sep 20 09:38:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: But how do you expect to get out, this is your problem. You suggest what we should do, but not the after thought of what happens  or how you'll accomplish it. Outside the most best of conditions. - Sun Sep 20 09:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Right now the best thing is to take advantage before their forces reach to surround here, and really make it impossible. - Sun Sep 20 09:43:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) watched as the situation was getting a little bit more intense as it went on, Erebus was getting ready to start swinging that Scythe around and Jin just set an arrest warrant. With a sigh and a bit of an eye twitch he walked up beside Erebus, putting a hand on his shoulder. He even got a better looked at the demonic form he was now taking.

Shocked by the change Erebus was undergoing he paused for a second before leaning in close to him to whisper into his ear. "Jin is just uptight and being an idiot at the moment, he'll calm down soon, just walk away Erebus...just walk away."
He then leaned back and turned his sights to Jin, Staring him straight in the eye and shaking his head slightly at him.

He had never seen Erebus fight...but something about him just wasn't right.* - Sun Sep 20 10:16:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Himura, I'm not changing my opinion. I won't let a guy who pulled his weapon out in a disagreement, out of my sight. I'm not Tethys, I have no mercy for those who break the laws of this village. - Sun Sep 20 10:34:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Let him go now and he'll never be a problem again. - Sun Sep 20 10:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: He can go the moment he drops the scythe, or when the shinobi arrest him. Then he serves his due time. - Sun Sep 20 10:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) watched as the confrontation escalated into a full fight, knowing the kind of person Erebus is he knew that there would only be one outcome if he didn't intervene. He looked over at Jin, shouting at him, "Jin, move!" while he began building up chakra within his body.

He then quickly formed a set of handseals and pivoted his upper body forward, exhaling. A volley of fireballs would then exit the mouth of Himura, aiming directly at and around Erebus to try and block his escape, hopefully damaging him in the process. He hoped Jin would be smart enough to move out of the way in time.* - Sun Sep 20 11:04:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Stand down Lera. - Sun Sep 20 11:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) couldn't believe what had just happened...he knew that Erebus was mad...but he didn't think he would go this far. He watched Jin, His fellow shinobi of Kirihakure just be cut down...a fellow shinobi he pladged to protect. Without anymore thought process something had snapped inside of him...like all the pressure that had been building up inside of him had finally broken through.

His facial expression just dropped, showing no signs of grief, sorrow or anger for the loss of his friend, his comrade. His hands lifted up out of nowhere, forming a set of handseals in quick succession. His body pivoted forward again as he exhaled, a large fireball growing infront of his face, around twice his size it reached. It would be shot forth towards Erebus.* - Sun Sep 20 11:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) couldn't believe that Erebus had just tanked two of his strongest attacks like they were nothing. He then watched the sick ritual take place, watching his body transition into a demonic being...stabbing himself with his scythe and seemingly gaining pleasure from it...

His attention then turned to Lera, who attempted to combined two technique together to produce a stronger jutsu to harm Erebus. Again he formed the handseals for fireball jutsu and fired it towards Erebus, aiming to add his attacks with Leras in the hopes they could harm him...* - Sun Sep 20 12:08:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) stood there in disbelief, not quite sure what was happening. Jin had been killed in seconds, all their attacks had been shrugged off like they were nothing and this man wasn't even phased by anything...His gut feeling was right...this guy was incredibly strong...and no where near being a normal human...maybe he wasn't lying when he said he was no mortal.

It seemed like the fighting had stopped now, it was all just a blur to him...as was his world at the moment. He couldn't quite process what was happening, not just this fight but everything was just looking so wrong right now...and he didn't have the answers to it.* - Sun Sep 20 13:01:52 2015

He wears a black cloak and wields a large three bladed crimson scythe...that will be all..."* - Sun Sep 20 13:20:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) simply walked by, moving over to the corpse of Jin. As he walked by he stopped when he was in-line with Lera, turning his head to speak to her he'd say. "I'm sorry you had to see that, Lera. You did all that you could and more, don't feel bad." before moving over to Jins body. He would pick up his body and disappear from sight, taking it to the hospital so they could put him in a morgue.

He'd come back a couple of minutes later, mixed expression painted all over his face.* - Sun Sep 20 13:32:35 2015
