<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Ambro should know that already. Guess it's for those two? - Tue Oct 13 00:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ....Seems I'll have more incentive to pursue Kenjutsu instead, then, if these two already are an elementalist and a Genjutsu user.. - Tue Oct 13 00:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: So we have an Elementalist, a Genjutsu user, and a Kenjutsu user. - Tue Oct 13 00:18:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You already know who I am, Ambrocio. Why do I have to answer this? - Tue Oct 13 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: I know who you are. That doesn't mean I know what kind of Shinobi you are. - Tue Oct 13 00:25:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Our professional lives become our personal lives with how terrible all of these villages are. Who we are is who we are as a shinobi. It's required. - Tue Oct 13 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Okay then. - Tue Oct 13 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: First, I'll be testing each of you individually. - Tue Oct 13 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Understood, Sir. - Tue Oct 13 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Starting with Takeda. Follow me over here. - Tue Oct 13 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Show me what you've learned from those silent lessons of yours, towards the left of you. - Tue Oct 13 00:29:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: I don't care what it is. Show me. - Tue Oct 13 00:29:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Fine fine. - Tue Oct 13 00:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) turns to the left, begining to build up his chakra within his body, kneading it into his stomach to produce a large quantity of water. As he was doing that he would raise his hands up and go through three handseals as fast as he could. Once the handseals were done he would breath in and pucker his lips, pushing forth the water he had kneading from his body and spiting it out into a stream of water, splashing water all over the ground.

As soon as he did that he brought his hands back and began building up chakra within his body again, adding vibration to it to give his chakra the lightning nature change. Once his chakra was built up he formed five handseals and held a hand out, gathering his chakra to his hand. Lightning would then crackle around his hand as he placed it onto the ground, surging his chakra through the earth he had moistened previously.

He would then stand up and begin kneading chakra for a final time, this time heating it within his body to add the fire nature change to it. Again he would form five handseals for the jutsu, inhaling after he did. He pucked his lips and pushed his chakra to his chest as he exhaled, beathing forth a wide burst of fire that completely engulfed the air infront and to the sides of himself. After that was done he turned back around and faced Ambrocio. "Raging water, Earth Flash, Fireball. I chose these as they are my most powerful and most mastered jutsu."* - Tue Oct 13 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) gets smacked in the head, probably around the time he was preparing to do his second jutsu. The hit is hard enough that it knocks him over, his body hitting the ground and his mind jiggling around a bit, mostly from being confused about what this was all about. He then heard Ambrocio shout at him about never letting his guard down which only further confused him.

He got to his feet after a few seconds and looked Ambrocio straight in the eye, annoyance and confusion plain on his face. "I'm supposed to expect my fellow shinobi to smash me over the head..?"* - Tue Oct 13 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Expect the unexpected and you'll never be dissapointed. - Tue Oct 13 00:52:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I would be able to tell. - Tue Oct 13 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Then you should always have your guard up.  - Tue Oct 13 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Atleast to some degree. At all times. - Tue Oct 13 00:52:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) thinks: He is telling his team of what is to come. Atleast he isn't so much of an ass not to give them a heads up. - Tue Oct 13 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: The lesson is to keep our guard up - if anything he'll try to use how paranoid we are against us. - Tue Oct 13 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It's valid. At least he seemed to pull his punch- which is more than you'd get from a foe. I volunteer to go next. - Tue Oct 13 00:55:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Oh, can I go with him? - Tue Oct 13 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: She can if she wants. - Tue Oct 13 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) says: Sure, Hana. - Tue Oct 13 22:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Yay. - Tue Oct 13 22:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: We should leave as soon as possible Hana. - Tue Oct 13 22:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Alright. - Tue Oct 13 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Where are we going? - Tue Oct 13 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: We're escorting an injured nin to Kiri. - Tue Oct 13 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Ah, alright. - Tue Oct 13 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) came to a place just outside of Konoha, an arranged point described in the scroll. Sure enough he came to greet two Konoha shinobi keeping watch over the assigned escort target. The two shinobi watching over him made their leave as he approached, giving a nod to each of them. He introduced himself and the target confirmed his name to be Tenryuu, a guard of the water Daimyo apparently. He looked a little beaten up and it was obvious why they needed to guard him. He turned around to face Hana, "Ready to leave when you are." He said, turning back to give a nod to Tenryuu.* - Wed Oct 14 00:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) looks at Hana again as she gave the go ahead to get going. "You take the rear, I'll take the front..." He said, turning to Tenryuu. "Stay in the middle, we'll protect you from either side." He would then turn back to Hana, "We are to expect potential bandits, be on guard. Lets get moving." He would say, turning to take his position up front and begining to walk towards kiri, the sooner the better after all. They would first probably hit the wooded area just past konoha, nothing too threatening and it would provide good cover while they were on their journey.* - Wed Oct 14 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) continued on through the forest area, moving at a mderate pace to both keep up with time and make sure they weren't moving at too fast a pace for their travel companion. He would look back to make sure both Hana and Tenryuu were ok as they continued on foot, it would be like this for a while. Since he didn't want the whole trip to be utter silence he would speak up, "You two doing fine back there?" he would ask, mostly to make small talk rather than actual concern from trouble.* - Wed Oct 14 00:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) turned his head back, facing forward once more. He would pick up speed a little, just enough for him to move a little further away from Hana and Tenryuu. He tried to ignore the 'kid' comment as much as he could, he hated being how old he was and comments like that really got to him in some odd way, though he wouldn't make an issue of it, he was on a mission afterall. Soon they would hit the tree line, emerging from the heavy forest area into a more flatlands type pf plain. He made sure to follow the road while keeping distance from it, not wanting to travel too close to the road.* - Wed Oct 14 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What does the alliance entail?  - Wed Oct 14 04:53:07 2015
