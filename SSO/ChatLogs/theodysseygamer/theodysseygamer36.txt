<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Then I want you to try it yourself. - Sun Oct 25 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Create a ring of lightning. - Sun Oct 25 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: That's what you have to do first. - Sun Oct 25 00:23:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Can I learn whenever you are done with him, Shinjin? - Sun Oct 25 00:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) had already started building up chakra but now he was fully concentrated on doing so. He held a hand out and began concentrating his chakra to it, focusing it as best he could to his palm. With his chakra now focused he would begin vibrating it as irractically as he could, causing his chakra to move faster and faster. Lightning would begin crackling around his hand fiercely, once it had he would then use his control over his chakra to try and round the bolts of lightning off, trying to form a circle.

He stood there for a good few moments and while he had made good progress, he simply couldn't get it right and he was getting a little annoyed with it. He shook his head and stopped the flow of chakra, shaking his hand off too. He took a deep breath and calmed himself before attempting it again holding his hand out and beginning concentrating chakra to it once more, Once lightning had formed around his hand he would begin the process of trying to round the lightning off. After a few more intense moments he would finally have made a ring of lightning, though it was unsteady he thought it would do.

Looking up but still keeping focused on the ring of lightning he would say, "Next..?"* - Sun Oct 25 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Sure, Hana. - Sun Oct 25 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Of course. - Sun Oct 25 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Now that you have the ring formed. - Sun Oct 25 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I want you to jump into the sky, while still maintaining the ring. - Sun Oct 25 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: It's a test of chakra control. - Sun Oct 25 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) thinks: Oh shit, people. - Sun Oct 25 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: ... - Sun Oct 25 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Right... - Sun Oct 25 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) thinks: I feel like i'm being played with here... - Sun Oct 25 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) was a little reluctant at first, he didn't see what any of this had to do with a jutsu and he honestly felt like he was being messed with...though he hoped he wasn't. He kept his focus on the ring as he parted his legs a little, preparing himself to jump. He bent his knees a little and finally would lift himself off the ground, jumping a few inches into the air and landing back down. As he landed he got that small 'jolt' you get when you jump or hit something hard, knocking his concentration off of the lightning and dispersing it.

"...Give me a second..." He would say as he held his hand out again, gathering his chakra to it. Again he would vibrate the chakra, transitioning it into a form of lightning. Once the lightning was spinning around his hand he would focus on it, trying to round it into a circle. It was a little easier that time and the circle of lightning looked a little better too. Now once again ready he would keep as focused on the lightning as possible, proceeding to jump second later. He landed back down and as he did, the lightning went a little irratic but he kept it under control.

Once more he would look towards Shinjin for guidence, giving a nod to show he was ready for the next phase.* - Sun Oct 25 01:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: Excuse me, sir. - Sun Oct 25 01:07:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: When you jump into the air at this point. - Sun Oct 25 01:09:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) thinks: Notice me. - Sun Oct 25 01:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Right...I'll try. - Sun Oct 25 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) thinks: Well then. This was kind of uh, pointless.. - Sun Oct 25 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) thinks: I'm just going to.....Go away. - Sun Oct 25 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) kept focusing on the current ring of lighting he had, wondering how he was going to do this. He knew what a senbon was but creating one out of lightning and shooting it through a ring of lightning..? In any case he would get ready to try, positioning himself to jump. As he jumped up he held his hand out to face the ground, away from everyone. Once he did he would then try and force more lightning through the ring and shoot it out...although this only had the effect of him shooting out a large bolt of lightning towards the floor...then again he didn't expect to get this first time.

Once he had plopped back down to the ground he would hold his hand out and begin again, focusing chakra to his hand and then vibrating it. Once lightning had appeared he would form it into a ring, seemingly getting better and better at doing so. With the ring now formed he would turn so he wasn't facing anyone, jump and hold his hand towards the ground. Once he held his hand out he would then try and force lightning through the ring, trying to refine it into small senbons. While the lightning did come out in various streaks, it still wasn't what was desired...though he did manage to get a few senbon looking structures out.

He wasn't getting frustrated, infact he was happy to finally be facing a bit of a challenge with a jutsu. Instead he would begin once more, holding his hand out and gathering his chakra to it, converting it into lightning. Once the lightning was formed he quickly formed the ring of lightning. With everything set he jumped up, held his hand out and surged more lightning through the ring, refining the chakra down into small, thin streaks that would resemble senbon. Much to his delight, many senbon looking projectiles would exit the ring and began digging into the ground, stopping after he had landed back down.

He noticed how far the senbons had dug into the ground, much further that what you would expect from a normal senbon. He would turn to Shinjin, looking him in the eyes. "I think I understand...the senbons have more cutting power because of their vibrations...I think."* - Sun Oct 25 01:24:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Hmm...While you guys do that i'll go...sit by that tree and read for a bit. - Sun Oct 25 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) sits down against the tree, reaching behind himself and into his backpouch, pulling out a jutsu scroll. He set the scroll down infront of himself and unrolled it, beginning to read it from start to finish. The technique would be of a chakra flow, fire to be specific. First bit he came across was an explanation of metals and how all of them mostly received chakra in the same way, simply by having it pushed into the metal for it to store it until it was used.

Next section he came across was the actually technique...or at least half of it. It explained that like when using a sword or a kunai, you had to think of your weapon as like an extension of not only yourself, but your chakra network. The kunai would be a storage point for your chakra, sort of like what you would envision your stomach to be. All you had to do was fill that container up with your chakra.

Next was about how a chakra flow worked. You could use your chakra to augment a eapon either in a physical or elemental way. It didn't specify how you could physically augment it but it did state how you could apply nature changed chakra to the weapon, rather than just normal chakra. By doing this you could form a type of fire shroud around the weapon, enabling it to both cut and burn when you attacked with it.

It then went on to describe how this worked. It seemed simple really. You didn't need to supply a large, constant supply of chakra to the weapon as it seemed to store chakra rather than burn it off. This meant that you could conserve chakra like this rather than have a constant drain and you could apply a chakra flow to a throwing weapon without the chakra flow dying out when you threw it.

The last bit he read was about the way the fire shroud worked. It would simply shroud the blade, meaning it wouldn't hamper cutting ability nor would it compromise the weapon. It would burn whatever the blade touched, adding to the damage. The downside to this was that if you wanted to inflict a bleed on the opponent, you probably would be able to do so because the wound would most likely cauterize. Once he had read all that he closed the scroll, put it away and stood up, walking back to Hana and Shinjin. There was more to read but he could get to that later.* - Sun Oct 25 02:05:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: My mother is also a Chuunin here, She helps the Hokage more than me so if you have any problems and the Hokage isn't around, talk to her. - Sun Oct 25 18:03:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: You're pretty lucky though, The Hokage is like you. - Sun Oct 25 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: You should try and get training off him if you can. - Sun Oct 25 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) says: Hmm, not a bad  idea. - Sun Oct 25 19:23:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: ... - Sun Oct 25 19:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) moved further into the mansion to find his mother, he hadn't seen her all day and he was worried about her. As he walked into the council area of the mansion he would come across a sight he thought he would only see in his very worst nightmares...his mother had blood all over her, her eyes closed and her body devoid of any movement, even breathing. He stopped in his tracks immediately, completely stunned by the sight he was seeing. He didn't get upset, not at first. He thought it was just a nightmare, a dream he wanted to wake from as soon as possible.

He slapped himself around the face, hoping to wake himself but it didn't work. He did it twice more before stopping, finally realising this was real. What was seeing was real...no...it couldn't be...it can't be real, it just couldn't. Quickly he rushed over to his mothers side, knocking all the chairs out of the way as he did. He grabbed her and started shaking her violently, trying to wake her up. "Mum...Mum! MUM! MUM!" He would shout over and over in a crazed voice, still not accepting that she had truly gone from this world.

He would try everything, hitting her, shaking her, checking her pulse and even performing CPR but it was no use, the blood wasn't fresh and her body was cold, she was long dead by now. In the end he just held her up, staring at her limp body. He would burst out into tears, hugging her and holding onto her tightly. He would rock back and forth with her, continuing to cry while he shouted 'mum' and 'hana' over and over, even past his voice running dry and croaky.

He held her close to himself for a long while, getting blood all over himself in the process. His mind was in a state of confusion, she told him she would never let him go, never leave her yet here she was dead. There was a mixture of anger, sadness and distraught as he shouted. "Why mum...why did you leave me...WHY DID YOU HAVE TO DIE?!? I COULDN'T PROTECT YOU!" before he fell silent, his body being as still and as cold as the dead body of his mother. He held onto her fiercely before loosening his grip.

He let her slide from his grasp, properly positioning her back in the chair he had found her in all those incredibly long and hurtful moments ago. His face would now be one of anger and fury, coupled with a distinct lack of any other emotion, like he wasn't even sad any more. Everyone he had ever gotten close to had either died or left him, including his mother. There was a change inside of him, something that wasn't physical but mental. In that moment his entire look on the world would have been thrown out of the metaphorical window, quickly being replaced and filled with pure anger.

Slowly he would turn away from his mother, no longer wanting to see the sight before himself. He would walk away, covered in the blood of his mother. Once he had exited the room he would walk around the mansion for a long while, his face showing no sign of sadness or emotion, pure neutrality would be the way to refine it. His eyes would have a thousand yard stare, his sight fixed on nothing as he continued to walk forward. Eventually he would have moved back to the Kage room, hitting a wall and sliding down it until he was sitting down. He would place his head within his knees and then hug them, cradling himself. He sat there not moving and barely breathing, not knowing what else to do.* - Sun Oct 25 20:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Yo? - Sun Oct 25 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) || Note, Takeda has blood all over his arms, body and the top half of his legs. His head is buried in between his knees and he has both arms wrapped around them, effectively hugging them. He does not respond to Ai.* - Sun Oct 25 21:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) continued to stay silent and still for a while after he had been spoke to once more. Suddenly his arms would drop from hugging his legs, hitting the floor rather roughly. Slowly his head would rise up and turn to look at Ai, his eyes meeting hers. She would note that even as their gaze met, his eyes had a pseudo thousand yard stare in them, like he wasn't looking at her, merely through her. His face would have a neutral emotion on it, no sadness or anger could be seen, just pure unreadable neutrality.

He would reach for his backpouch slowly, pulling a kunai out and holding it up to Ai. Finally he would speak, "What happened here..? None of your business is what. I want you to leave...right now...and tell everyone you see to stay out of here too...or I will kill everyone and anyone that does...do you understand me..?" He said, his speech was low and slowed. It had a tone to it that you wouldn't expect from a child of his age, one you would regard as the exact opposite of happy or cheerful...* - Sun Oct 25 21:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) would lash out at Misa, swining both his fist and a Kunai around to keep her away from him. It was clear he didn't intentionally want to harm her, more just trying to keep her away like a frightened animal. "GET AWAY!" He would shout at her as he did this. If she did indeed back off he would follow up with, "...Just...leave me alone...Get out of here before I kill you...no one can be here...no one..." he would say this in a hollow tone, not one you would expect from a child of his age. His eyes not even looking at her, they were merely glued to the ground and in any case, they themselves would look hollow too. Eventually he would pull his arms back to cuddling his knees, he head rested just atop his knees too. His face would show no emotion, just a blank expression, like he wasn't registering anything but his own thoughts.* - Sun Oct 25 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) thought everything was fine as he saw Misa step back a few feet, he was hoping she would turn and run. Instead however she continued to question him, even summoning some snakes and sending them towards him. While his face may show no sign of emotion, inside he was hurting a lot, full of anger, torment and sadness. <Why couldn't she just leave..?> He thought to himself as he saw the snakes coming towards him. In reaction he would jump up and to the side to move away from them, he had seen summoned snakes before and he knew they were nothing good for him...not that he really cared at this point.

Now on his feet he would throw his kunai just infront of one of the three snakes coming towards him, hoping either they or their master would stop them. He finally looked at Misa with his cold eyes and blank expression, though his face had started to show anger. "I told you...to leave...you have one more chance...BEFORE I FUCKING BURN THIS PLACE DOWN AND TAKE YOU WITH ME!" He screamed at her at the top of his childish voice, his general tone and expression instantly turning to one of pure fury within the matter of a second. Already he was moulding up chakra within himself, ready to really go to the extreme.* - Sun Oct 25 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) slowly made his way back to his original position, keeping a watchful eye on the movements of Misa. Once he was back he would return to his original seated position, pushing his knees together and resting his head on them while he hugged his legs tightly, Kunai still in hand. His facial expression would again go bi-polar, instantly returning to a face of pure blank expression, like him getting angry had never happened. His eyes would stay open, barely blinking. He would be staring forward yet at the same time, no where in perticular.* - Mon Oct 26 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm..? - Mon Oct 26 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...Takeda... - Mon Oct 26 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: You alright? - Mon Oct 26 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) would still be in the same position from before, except his head would be resting upon his knees instead of inbetween them. His kunai would also be gone from his head, dug into the ground a few feet from him at an angle that would suggest it was thrown. He would be looking directly at the wall, though one probably couldn't tell from the way his eyes seemed to just look off into the distance, like he wasn't all there. Without even turning his head he would respond to Ketsuki and Ai. "I told you...not to come in here...I will say this again...leave now before I fucking end your lives..." he would state in a cold and emotionless tone, still not looking at either of them

As a note for Ketsuki, She would see that his arms, body and legs were covered in blood, though by this point the blood would be old, dark and dry, it would still be prominent that he was covered in blood in any case.* - Mon Oct 26 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) would finally turn his head, along with his gaze, over to Ketsuki. His eyes however would not be looking at her, more through her with the look he gave off. His expression would remain the same, totally blank, devoid of all emotion. "This is you last warning...we're not comrades...or friends...this is none of your business...SO GET THE FUCK OUT BEFORE I BURN THIS PLACE DOWN AND TAKE EVERYONE WITH ME." he would scream at her, like he screamed at the blonde lady before. His tone and expression would have gone totally bi-polar, his voice warped with anger and emotion, his facial expression matching one of pure hate...maybe even a hint of what you would call 'evil'.

If one could sense such a thing, he would be building up chakra at this very moment, getting both physically and mentally ready to back up his words about burning the mansion down.* - Mon Oct 26 03:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) started to finally focus on Ketsuki, his eyes now looking at her rather than just into the distance. He seriously considered going through with what he said...he wanted to burn this place down and go with it...but he didn't want to hurt Ketsuki and Ai...yet at the same time he wanted to hurt them too...he wanted them all to hurt like he did. In the end he just wanted to be alone, he didn't want to talk to anyone or be 'comforted' he just...simply wanted to be alone. "Hana is dead...Her blood stains my clothes...I found her in the council chamber. Happy? Now fuck off and leave me alone, I don't want your fucking comfort...I just want to be left the fuck alone." he said in a cold manner again, it really hurt him to say such a thing but then again...he just wanted solitude.* - Mon Oct 26 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) shoots up to his feet as Ketsuki gets close to him, instinctively he would pull a kunai out and walk backward, holding the kunai out towards her as he distanced himself from her. "I said...I DON'T WANT YOUR HELP!" He would shout at he again, taking in a deep breath as he calmed himself. "E-Everyone...I have ever gotten close to has died or left me...Suitengu...Sabo...Ortho...Hideki...Hana...EVERYONE...THEY ALL LEFT ME ALONE AND I HATE THEM...I HATE YOU...I HATE EVERYONE!" He would continue to shout as he burst into tears mid-sentence, his anger and emotion finally bubbling over what he could control, all of it just pouring out before Ai and Ketsuki now.

He would start slashing his kunai about irractically infront of himself, both out of anger and to keep ketsuki away from him. "I'll...I'll kill everyone...everyone...I'll kill everyone..." he would say over and over in an emotion-less tone, his eyes having gone back to just staring into the distance as he continued to slash away at nothing.* - Mon Oct 26 04:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) stopped slashing as he saw ketsuki no longer advancing towards him. Her words fell on deaf ears, everything she was saying only applied to him while Hana was alive, she was the way that kept him the happy little boy he was. But now it was all gone, she was gone and with it, so was his outlook on life. "You don't know me...or understand me...I've lost everything...I have no family or friends left in this world...all I have is my hate...my pain...I don't care about anything or anyone any more...I just want to be alone" he would say before pointing the kunai directly at Ketsuki again. "And if anyone gets in the way of that...i'll kill them..."* - Mon Oct 26 04:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Sad enough..He's taking another path.. - Mon Oct 26 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) starts to slash about again as leaves fall all around him, not quite understanding what was happening while he is not in his right mind. His arm would soon stop flailing around and flop to his side as soon as the genjutsu started to work however. His gaze would be met with what he saw mere hours ago, the bloodied body of his mother, lifeless and devoid of movement. The kunai would slowly drop from his grip, hitting the floor with a clang. He holds an arm out towards his mother, as if to try and hold onto her one last time "Mum..?" he would ask softly.

After a few seconds he would pull his hand away and bring both of them up to his eyes as he tries to block out the image, tears now streaming down his face again. It was impossible though, he could not unsee what he had seeing, the scene playing over and over in his mind. He would slowly bend his knees until he was in a squatting position, still crying away as his hands shielded his eyes as best they could.

Eventually both him and his arms would hit the floor, now being in a seated position. He would simply stare at the floor as he continued to cry over and over. "You said...you said you would never leave me mum...you said you'd love me forever...and we'd be a family...but you left me alone...you wanted Shinjin to be my father but he doesn't want that...you left me all alone..." He would say, bursting into an even deeper cry, stopping him from continuing.

After a few seconds he would have calmed enough to continue, "I don't want to hurt anyone mum...I never did...I just wanted to be with you...I wanted to be your son...you child...but now I have nothing...no one...what do I do mum..? What do I..." he would trail of again into tears as he looked up towards his dead mother, asking her that question. He really meant it, he didn't know how he could continue like this...all alone...yet at the same time wanting to be left alone.

After a few more moments he would shift position again, now laying on his side on the floor while cradling his legs, still continuing to cry as his sadness continued to pour out of him like the tears that left his eyes and ran down his face.* - Mon Oct 26 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Ketsuki...You know...I can..You know..Bind him, right? - Mon Oct 26 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I am /not/ risking a Fire Jutsu to the face. - Mon Oct 26 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: He won't be able to move at all. - Mon Oct 26 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Unless he can use his jutsu without his handseal. - Mon Oct 26 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) started to contort his face and struggle as he felt someone or something start to grab him and pin his arms down. He would kick his feet up and attempt to push her off just as she got close and whispered into his ear. This time her words did get through, he would resume crying as she tried to comfort him through her whisper. Eventually his body went limp and he stopped struggling, his body falling limp as the genjutsu faded and he realised Ketsuki was pinning him down, his eyes widening as he realised she was hugging him.

"I just wanted to have a family...to be a kid...to have a mother...Hana was so kind to me and I don't even think I told her I loved her...and now i'll never get the chance. I just-" was all he would say before he continued to cry, unintentionally burying his face into the shoulder of Ketsuki for comfort. He would simply stay like that, continuing to cry into her shoulder as he was pinned to the ground and hugged.* - Mon Oct 26 04:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: That's depressing.... - Mon Oct 26 04:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) continued to cry as she continued to talk to and comfort him. It was just what he needed to bring him down to earth, a simply love and some comfort. He understood what she was trying to get through to him, he really did. The only problem was he felt he simply couldn't move on from this, not from losing his last bit of happyness. He would calm himself again, still crying but at a much more passive rate. Pulling his head back he laid it against the floor, resting it. "Hana adopted me...she didn't have to...my real mother died four years ago and I don't even know what happened to my father...i've lost three parents in twelve years...and close friends. I couldn't protect them...and because of it...i'm alone...how can I ever call someone family or friend again..?"* - Mon Oct 26 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) started to genuinely feel better, even through all his pain. The way Ketsuki spoke to him and hugged him, it reminded him of how Hana was...how she loved him...truly loved him. When Ketsuki had finished speaking he would bring his free arm around her, hugging her close to him in return. "Thank you Ketsuki...I still hurt a lot but...you're right...as much as it hurts, you're right. "With that he would swivel his wrist around, it was getting quite uncomfortable being pinned like that.

"You can let go now Ketsuki...I'm not going to hurt anyone...least of all you." he would say in a soft tone, looking down at his trapped arm.* - Mon Oct 26 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: It starts with pain..Follow by hate..Fuel by the endless questions....No one can answer...*Sigh* I already know how this will go.. - Mon Oct 26 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) twists his now free hand around, stretching it out. He would then slide himself up into a sitting position, turning and resting his back against the wall. At the mention of the hokage he would seem to get visibly upset, knowing that he being her boyfriend would complicate things even more. He would look up to Ketsuki with sore, red and sad eyes. "I-I'll tell the Hokage...If you didn't know...Hana and the Hokage were dating...which also technically makes him my dad...but we're not really like that I guess. Still...It's my job to do this, don't worry about it...just tell him I need to speak with him as soon as possible if you see him."

As for Ketsuki saying they would find her killer, he would completely ignore that part. He had seen her body and knew deep down how she died...which is why he hurt even more inside but he wouldn't say so...not to Ketsuki. Instead he just moved past it and would keep it between himself and Shinjin...no one else needed to know that detail about her death...* - Mon Oct 26 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ....Right then. - Mon Oct 26 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I'll stick 'round as long as you need, yeah? Is there anything else I can do to help...? - Mon Oct 26 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I...need you cloak... - Mon Oct 26 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) stands up, accepting the cloak and folding it under his arm. "Yeah I know...I'll be back in a second." He said, before moving past her and out of the room, moving deeper into the mansion. He would go to the council chamber, where his mothers body rested. He started to cry again as he laid eyes on her but quickly wiped the tears away, not wanting to cry infront of his mother. He would walk over to her and wrap the cloak around her, making sure it hid pretty much all of her besides probably the bottom half of her legs.

Once she was hidden from sight he would pick her up in both arms, her limp body was heavy on his arms but he was determined to do this for his mother, he had to do it. He entered back into the kage room his his mother cloaked in his arms, he did this so Ketsuki didn't have to see the state she was in. He would turn his head to her and say, "I'll just be outside...I can't leave her like this...not any longer." before making his way outside to bury her...unless he would be stopped by ketsuki first.* - Mon Oct 26 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But one day, he'll go apeshit and kill literally everyone. - Mon Oct 26 05:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: No...I need to do this alone...for Hana...for mum... - Mon Oct 26 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I'll be back in a few minutes...it won't take long... - Mon Oct 26 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ..Alright then. - Mon Oct 26 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) continued on outside with his mother in his arms. He would go right, moving around the side of the kage mansion until he found a nice spot to lay het to rest in, she did like the mansion after all so it was only right she would be buried near here. He laid her down gently and stepped to the side of her, clapping his hands together and placing them on the ground, utilising mud silhouette to shift around five feet of dirt out of the way, forming a grave for her. He would again pick her up, tighten the cloak around her and then lower her in feet first. He would then carefully move down into the grave and lower the rest of her in, making sure she was nice and comfortable in her eternal slumber.

He would then struggle his way out of the grave, slowly pulling himself out of the deep hole. Once he was out he would stand over her resting place, she looked peaceful in there, cozy. A few tears would start to drip down his face as he clapped his hands and utilised mud silhouette again to fill the hole with the dirt he previously took out, doing so slowly and respectfully. It took a little while but finally all the dirt had been laid to rest, just like his mother. He then stood up and looked over the grave, staring at it. "I love you mum...I'm sorry I never got to tell you before but at least I can tell you now...sleep well, I'll see you again one day."

Before he left he would pick a few flowers and place them around her grave in a ring formation, nothing special, just a little thing he wanted to do for her. Once the deed was finally done he would leave her resting place, heading back to the mansion. He was hurt, but doing that at least laid both her and some of his pain to rest...* - Mon Oct 26 06:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) slowly walked back into the mansion, his hands a little soiled with mud. He would pull his face mask down, it was wet and cold from his constant crying. He wouldn't usually reveal his face but at this point, he didn't care. He would look towards Ketsuki with sad eyes, the occasional tear running down his face. "It's...It's done...she's finally at peace. I buried her near the mansion because she liked it here...I hope that's what she would have liked..."* - Mon Oct 26 06:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) enjoyed the comforting smile and words given but Ketsuki...yet at the same time they upset him again, bursting out in tears once more. He would move quickly towards Ketsuki, arms sprawled out and attempting to wrap around and hug her tightly, he just needed that right now. "Mum was one of the truly goods ones...why do those people have to die while the evil people like me live on..?"* - Mon Oct 26 06:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: It sounds good...I just wish mum could have seen me grow up to do that... - Mon Oct 26 06:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... Yeah. - Mon Oct 26 06:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Still.. it's something to strive for.. - Mon Oct 26 06:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: A reason for this poor bastard to live that /wont/ hurt others.. - Mon Oct 26 06:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I don't know who or what to protect anymore either...Mum was the only thing that kept me good. - Mon Oct 26 06:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I wanted to keep her safe because she pulled me out of darkness but now... - Mon Oct 26 06:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: .... Hey. - Mon Oct 26 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Isn't the answer simple..? There are good things in this world still, even if none of them are yours anymore. There are good people, in this world still. - Mon Oct 26 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Is not stopping others from suffering something worth fighting for..? Is not the protection of what light can be found in this world worthwhile? - Mon Oct 26 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I guess i'll just have to find those people...and not lose myself again. - Mon Oct 26 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: You don't know this but before I was with mum...I wasn't a good person. - Mon Oct 26 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I got into the wrong crowd of people and they changed me for the worse...I just hope that doesn't happen again. - Mon Oct 26 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... You just need to keep your eyes set on the horizon, and on yourself. - Mon Oct 26 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: And make sure you don't lose who you are, or what it is you /really/ want. - Mon Oct 26 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Y'know? - Mon Oct 26 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It's harder than it sounds, but.. - Mon Oct 26 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It's worth it. - Mon Oct 26 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I hope so... - Mon Oct 26 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: After today...I don't think I ever want to see another person die... - Mon Oct 26 06:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... Yeah. Death is.. - Mon Oct 26 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...Something that's too sad, usually. - Mon Oct 26 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Still- sometimes it's required to take life to save life.. - Mon Oct 26 06:30:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ....Good. That means... you still have a heart, a good one, y'know..? - Mon Oct 26 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I helped caused her death and it felt good...real good. - Mon Oct 26 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... But you regreted it in the end, huh? - Mon Oct 26 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: But then I met Hana and all that changed...she showed me a different way. - Mon Oct 26 06:32:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) pulls away from Ketsuki, realising he was still hugging onto her tightly. "I uh...Sorry about that..." He said, quickly following up with, "Guess i've got no where to live again...I can't go back to Hanas house...it'll hurt too much...I'll just have to stay at an inn like before..."* - Mon Oct 26 06:36:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: You're welcome to stay at my house...I won't be using it. - Mon Oct 26 06:38:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) rests his head on the desk, placing his arms around his head to comfort it and block out the light.
