<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) Came to the training field to continue his training with great breakthrough. He stretched his body out a bit before forming the confrontation hand seal to begin building up and focusing his chakra. It was sort of his training tradition by now to practise the jutsu first before properly focusing on training it. With that he would form a few hand seals and gather his chakra to his hand. With his chakra at his hand he would then start applying the wind nature change to it, sharpening he chakra as best as he could. With his chakra fully prepared he would thrust his hand forward, releasing all his chakra at once like he had been practising before.

With that preliminary practise out of the way he would hold up the seal of confrontation again as he began building up more chakra. Now that he was pushing out all the chakra he could it was time to work on the timing of the jutsu so that he was releasing all his chakra as soon as his arm was fully extended, this would help focus the power of the jutsu and cut some time off of it. With that in mind he would form a few hand seals and hold his hand out as he gathered chakra to his palm, sharpening it as he did. Once his chakra was focused he would thrust his hand forward and attempt to release all of his chakra at the exact moment his arm was fully extended, pushing forth a mass of wind as he did.

He noticed that while the timing was pretty good, it could be better. He also noticed that because his timing was off, some of the wind was being misguided which was bringing the effective power of the jutsu down. Now he knew what he specifically needed to work on he began building chakra up to prepare. Once his chakra was built up he would form the hand seals for the jutsu and gather his chakra to his hand. Once his chakra was concentrated to his palm he would begin pushing his chakra over itself, sharpening it. With his chakra fully prepared he would then thrust his hand forward and attempt to release his chakra like before, trying his best to get the timing right. A gust of wind would signify the success of the jutsu.

He knew his timing was getting better, he just needed to keep working at it…he needed to work at it if he was to survive what he had to soon face. With his upcoming exam in mind it spurred him to continue on, building up chakra as quickly as he possibly could. With his chakra being adequate for the jutsu he would form the hand seals as quickly as he could and hold his hand out, concentrating his chakra to his palm. As he did this he would start applying the wind nature change to his chakra, sharpening it as much as he possibly could. With everything prepared he would push his hand forward and try to release his chakra just as his arm fully extended, sending a large burst of wind with it as he did.

He felt he nearly had this down, just a little more and the timing would be perfect. He continued on, straightening up and beginning to build up chakra again. Once his chakra had been adequately prepared for the jutsu he would bring his hands together and form a few handseals, they were pretty much second nature to him by this point. With the hand seals done he would hold his hand out and gather chakra to his palm, applying the wind nature change to it as he did. He would then thrust his hand forward and like before, try to release his chakra at the perfect moment. The large burst of wind would once again explode from him, shooting forward.

That time he felt like he had managed to get the timing perfect but to make sure, he would practise one last time. Again he would build up chakra like he had done five times before, doing so as quickly as he could. With his chakra built up he would bring his hands together and form the hand seals for the jutsu. Once the hand seals had been completed he would hold his hand out and gather his chakra to his palm. Once there he would then begin applying the wind nature change to it. With all that done he would then focus all his concentration on his chakra as he thrust his arm forward and release the chakra all at once with perfect timing, letting out a large blast of wind.* - Fri Oct 30 22:44:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) Took a short rest before continuing on with practising great breakthrough, he had just a few more things to practise before he was totally confident in his ability with it. First off though he would get his preliminary practise in, like always. Building his chakra up he would form the hand seals and then guide the chakra down his arm and into his palm. With his chakra in place he would then begin sharpening it over itself to apply the wind nature change. Once that was done he would then thrust his arm forward and release his chakra all at once with the correct timing, trying to practise what he had before just to get it to sink in. With that a powerful blast of wind would follow his hand, extending outwards.

He would do something odd next, something he had read about before. He knew that with this jutsu, you could potentially knock a tree over if you were good enough and he wanted to do that as his final bit of training. Picking a stray tree that was close to the fences, he would jump the fence and position himself in front of it. Now in position he began building up chakra once more, forming the hand seals of the jutsu as he did. He would then concentrate his chakra to one of his palms and apply the wind nature change to it. With everything all set he would thrust his hand forward and fire off a burst of wind towards the tree, attempting to knock it over. He would have taken a lot of leaves off of the tree but it didn't seem to budge.

He would try again, determined not to be defeated by a mere tree. As he built his chakra up he figured he would just have to try and put more effort into the jutsu, clearly he was lacking something. In any case he would string together a few hand seals and hold his hand out again, gathering his chakra to it and applying the wind nature change to it. Once he was done with that he looked to the tree and focused on his chakra, thrusting his hand forward and sending a powerful blast of wind towards it, trying to put his all into it. The tree did seem to move slightly and it had the rest of its leaves blown off but other than that, no change.

He felt he was at least on the right track somewhat, he just needed to refine the jutsu a bit more and tweak the power of it some more, or at least that's what he thought anyway. He would have been building up chakra either way. Once his chakra had been adequately built up he would bring his hands together and form the hand seals for the jutsu, holding a hand out and gathering his chakra to his palm after he did. Whilst he was gathering chakra to his hand he would be sharpening it, applying the wind nature change to it. With everything properly prepared he would thrust his hand towards the direction of the tree again, making sure the timing was right while trying to push out as much chakra as possible. He would also have been trying to further refine the area of effect the jutsu had, making sure the wind was concentrated on the tree. This time he would have rocked the tree quite a bit, but still it stood tall.

Seeing the tree move however only served to further his ambition to try and knock the tree over, he knew he was close to doing so, he could feel it. Building up chakra as quickly as he could he would form the hand seals for the jutsu and hold out his hand again, gathering his chakra to it once more. Once his chakra was at his hand he would again repeat the process of sharpening the chakra down to fine edges. Once he was finished with that he would position himself towards the tree and thrust his hand forward, releasing as much chakra as he could with the correct timing while also focusing as much as he could on concentrating the wind towards the tree. He would release another burst of wind, rocking the tree hard. He would even hear a few branches and roots snap.

He knew that with one more push, he would knock the tree over and so he would begin moulding chakra within his body one more time to finally knock over the tree. Once he had built up enough chakra his hands would meet each other, forming the hand seals for the jutsu as fast as he could. Then he would hold his hand out, focusing his chakra to his palm just as before. With one more thrust of his arm he would let out a massive burst of air, firing it off towards the tree. The tree would be hit by the wind one last time, finally snapping from its roots and falling to its side. With a deep exhale he would turn and jump the fence again, sitting down in the training field to rest a while.* - Sat Oct 31 00:30:43 2015

He would say, dissipating the chakra in his hand as he did.* - Sat Oct 31 01:33:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) sits down, crossing his legs like Ketsuki. He didn't really want to give a lesson right now, he had far too much to focus on...the Hokage...the exam...training and preparing...and now this...

He simply stared off into space for a bit, not really focused on the task at hand.* - Sat Oct 31 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) is still staring off into space.* - Sat Oct 31 01:44:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Though I.. don't have much of a good weapon, admitably. - Sat Oct 31 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Uhm, can I borrow a kunai? - Sat Oct 31 01:44:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm.. I didn't really use my usual opening move there, or things mighta gone different; I wanted to restrict myself to physical combat to make this fun. But that Shadow Jutsu- pretty good. - Sat Oct 31 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Thanks. - Sat Oct 31 02:25:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) walks up to the gate, knowing better than to just stroll in he stands far enough away as to not look threatening. "Hello, I am Takeda. I've come to ask the Mizukage to let me stay here a while."* - Sat Oct 31 02:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asso, Zaen(Wynokx) says: We aren't letting insiders in. Away with you. - Sat Oct 31 02:39:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Ketsuki. - Sat Oct 31 02:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah? - Sat Oct 31 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Come over here a sec. - Sat Oct 31 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) would attempt to put his arms around Ketsuki, hugging her. He wouldn't mean anything by it, just a simple hug from one friend to another...that is of course if she would allow such an action.* - Sat Oct 31 02:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) appreciated the comfort deep down, even letting out a small smile as she hugged him back. "You're my friend Ketsuki...remember that...remember it when i'm gone." he would say in a slightly worried tone, still hugging onto her as he spoke, probably resting the side of his head against her as he clung to her for comfort.* - Sat Oct 31 03:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) chuckled at that, Ketsuki did have a way with words at times. He would soon change back to a serious tone though, "Things are going to change soon Ketsuki...and not for the better. I have to take an exam soon...and I fear I will probably die taking it. I've made myself a will, it's only half finished but once I finish it...i'm giving it to you to sort out if I die...can you do that for me?"* - Sat Oct 31 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) clung onto her tightly, keeping quiet for a few seconds as he thought to himself...she had already guessed it so there was no point lying to her. "I'm taking the private exam...if I don't take it the village will suffer..." he trailed off, almost like he had something more to say but couldn't quite say it...at least not yet.* - Sat Oct 31 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) turn the position of his head, resting his chin on her lightly as he looked up to her face, looking directly into his eyes as best he could from this angle. "I'm going to tell you something Ketsuki...but you cannot tell a soul...not even Ai, do you understand?" he stated, pausing to wait for her response.* - Sat Oct 31 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) paused briefly, looking down as he was unsure whether he should really be telling her this or not. In the end he would sigh and look back up and at her. "Zeus is leaving the village soon..."* - Sat Oct 31 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) pulls his head back, along with his body, no longer hugging her. He needed to be serious from this point on to get the message across. "He's leaving to do something important, I suspect it's Gezo related. He's abdicating his position as Hokage..." was all he would say again, trying to lead into something he hoped Ketsuki would work out for herself.* - Sat Oct 31 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...So you're taking the exams to be qualifiable as a legal Kage in his absence. - Sat Oct 31 03:21:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: And because of that...i'm being forced to take this exam... - Sat Oct 31 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ..I.. see. - Sat Oct 31 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: .....I can only hope you are ready, Takeda. - Sat Oct 31 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I don't know if I am...Zeus says I am but...I don't know if I can pass the exam. - Sat Oct 31 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I have to fight ten others in a battle to the death...ten versus one... - Sat Oct 31 03:23:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...Well, at least your Ninjutsu speciality is very well suited to multiple foes, yeah..? - Sat Oct 31 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Yeah but...ten people... - Sat Oct 31 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: What kind of an exam is that?! - Sat Oct 31 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I think Zeus is overestimating me...i'm not even a Chuunin yet... - Sat Oct 31 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... If you die, I blame Zeus... but more than him, the Gezo. - Sat Oct 31 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... Not that the Gezo care. - Sat Oct 31 03:27:21 2015
