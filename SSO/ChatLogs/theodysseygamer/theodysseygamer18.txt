<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) didn't really understand how one so young was so confident around utter strangers...especially when he wasn't, and he was older. He could sense the tension coming from the boy, it was rather strange, what had annoyed him so? "I don't even know you...or her...why are you being like this..?" he asked again, a little more timid than before now.* - Fri Oct  2 00:49:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Whatever, I'm going. - Fri Oct  2 01:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) turned and began walking off, wanting no more part in that convosation. How can one talk about manners when they in turn tell someone they don't know how to live their life and talk to others? That's just rude and hypocritical in his mind, and he wanted none of that. He didn't feel like escalating the situation anymore so decided to remove himself from it and do something else.

If he had been allowed to leave of course.* - Fri Oct  2 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) left the previous situation he was in as quickly as possible, making his way over to the taining field. He still had his fireball jutsu to work on so that's what he'd be doing. Now that he could form a fireball it was time to increase its size and power. He had already been building up chakra so was ready to begin the technique. He formed each handseal and pushed his chakra to his chest. He exhaled and release all his chakra, pushing it out and trying to form it into a fireball. He increased the size of the fireball he made but expended a lot of chakra.

he began again, holding up a halfseal with one hand as he focused on building up chakra within himself. After a few seconds he was ready and began once more. He formed each handseal for the jutsu and pushed his chakra up to his chest. He released all his chakra at once in one big exhale, focusing on it to mould it into a fireball. Again he increased the size of the fireball, still expending a lot of chakra to do so.

Once the fireball had died out he began working on focusing and building up his chakra in preperation once again. Now that he had done this twice it took him only a few seconds to prepare before he found himself executing the handseals to the jutsu. Again he pushed all of the chakra he had built up and out, concentrating hard on moulding it into a large fireball. This time the fireball was muh larger but was looking more and more unstable.

He kept going once that fireball had died down, not wanting to stop until he needed a proper rest. He built up chakra as quickly as he could and found himself zipping through each handseal again. He pushed his chakra up and out all at once as he exhaled, focusing on it to mould it into a fireball. The resulting fireball came out just a bit bigger than he was before dissipating from his lack of control.

He began again, now feeling tired but no where near as tired as when he first started using this jutsu, his training clearly paying off. Once again he repeated the process of building up his chakra and forming each handseal quickly. He then gathered all his chakra to his chest and released it in one burst as he exhaled, concentrating on it to mould the shape into a fireball. This time he made one that was twice his size but it quickly burned out from his lack of control, that would be his next thing to practise.* - Fri Oct  2 10:59:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) started by kneading chakra within his stomach as best he could, he couldn't do this jutsu that well yet but this would be good practise for him. Once he was done kneading chakra, which did take a little longer than usual. He formed a few handseals and arched himself forward, pushing his chakra up and out, spitting a weak water spout from his mouth all over the fire that was still burning on Erebus. It would be weak since he was new to this jutsu, but hopefully it'd be enough.* - Fri Oct  2 16:36:16 2015

Cautiously he fiddled with his fingers for a few seconds before returning his attention to Kohaku, "B-B...Boyfriend..?" he asked shyly, never really having asked anyone that before coupled with the fact he was only twelve years old made him instantly regret ever even thinking asking that, let alone actually asking it.* - Fri Oct  2 20:03:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) turns and walks to a more spacious area so he wouldn't be disturbed.* - Fri Oct  2 20:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) began building up chakra in preperation to begin practising his fireball jutsu again. He had many other things to train and really wanted to get this down so he could start training his other jutsu as soon as possible. When he was ready he formed each handseal for the jutsu, pushing his built up chakra up and out all at once. He focused on his chakra, moulding it into a fireball shape as best he could which was difficult since he was uping the power of it. Eventually the fireball burned out but he got a decent feel of how it should be.

Again he would be building up chakra to practise the jutsu once more, he had more of an idea on how he could better form the fireball at full power now he got a practise in. When he was once again ready he formed each handseal and pushed his chakra up to his chest as he inhaled, releasing all his built up chakra as he exhaled. He focused on that chakra, moulding it into a fireball, he concentrated, trying to refine his control over his chakra. The resulting fireball looked a little more stable than before, though it was still wonky and all over the place.

Once that fireball had burned out he began building up chakra again straight away, wanting to get this down as soon as possible. Once he was done building his chakra up he went through each handseal for the jutsu quickly and breathed in. As he did he pushed all his built up chakra to his chest and released it as he breathed out. He concentrated on his chakra as he released it, quickly forming another fireball, he focused on the fireball, trying to control the chakra inside it to refine it and keep it at bay. The fireball had it's own little mini flares like the sun from his lack of control which quickly decreased it's size and burnt it out, though he was getting better.

Again once the fireball had burned out he was at it again, building up his chakra and quickly zipping through each handseal the jutsu had, he had gotten quite good with the handseals now. Once more he pushed his chakra out, releasing it as he breathed out. Focusing on the chakra he was expelling he moulded it into a fireball, trying to retain it's shape and not expend the chakra within it. This time the fireball came out looking a little better, it seemed to not be so irratic and lasted a little longer than before.

Eventually said fireball died out and he wasted no time in getting ready to build up his chakra, taking only seconds to do so. Once he had gone through the handseals with ease he again pushed his chakra up and out of his body, concentrating on it as he formed a fireball with it. He made sure to keep his chakra in check, not wanting to waste or expend any more chakra than he had to. Again the fireball came out a little better, it was much more rounded and controled like it should look.

He pressed on, knowing he could improve his control over this jutsu even further. Quickly he kneaded chakra within his body, finishing doing so within a few seconds. Once he had done that he deftly went through each handseal the jutsu required, inhaling shortly after and releasing all his chakra at once. He focused on making the fireball as he released his chakra, concentrating on refining it's shape and keeping it's chakra volume at bay. Slowly but surely he was increasing how well the fireball was maintained, a few more practises and he knew he would have it down.

The continued use of of the jutsu had started to take it's toll on his body but he wasn't going to give in now. Once more he began kneading chakra into his stomach, slowly but surely building it up to the point he could use it. Once he was done he motioned through the handseals of the jutsu as quickly as he could and inhaled, gathered his chakra to his chest and exhaled. As he did a fireball would start to amass and grow infront of himself. Carefully he controled his chakra, refining his use of it little by little. The fireball he made this time was of a considerable difference to the first he made, being much more round and looking much more stable.

Now he had finally started to tire out, feeling fatigued and hungry he knew he'd needed to rest soon but he wanted to squeeze one more little practise out before he went to rest a while. He started up building chakra again, finishing quickly after he started. He then rushed through each handseal at a moderate speed, pushing his chakra up to his chest as he inhaled. He would then exhale and push his chakra out with it, forming the usual fireball just infront of his face. He made sure to concentrate on keeping it as stable, refined and controled as he possibly could, the end result being a fireball twice his size that was almost perfectly round and controled. It still needed some tiny tweaks, but that could wait, for now he needed to rest a while.* - Fri Oct  2 20:32:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) took a long rest, making sure to eat a fair bit when he did. Once he was done with said rest he got right back to the training field to begin again. This time he would be training his accuracy with the fireball, setting up a few targets...or rocks to aim and shoot at. He positioned himself in a good place to shoot at all the rocks and built up his chakra. He then did each handseal and formed the fireball, easing back on it's power by about half so he didn't cause too much damage, he then shot it off as best he could, over shooting the rock entirely.

A little less than impressed with himself he began building up chakra to try again, partially thinking he knew what he did wrong. Again he formed each handseal and repeated the cycle of inhaling, pushing his chakra up and exhaling to form the fireball. Once it was fully formed he shot it off again, undershooting the rock and causing some damage to the floor. He confirmed in his head that he simply needed to adjust his chakra control in order to fire it correctly.

Now that he confirmed his theory he began building up chakra to try again, a little more determined and driven than before. Once he was ready he formed the handseals to the jutsu one after the other. He then inhaled, gathered his chakra to his chest and exhaled, blowing out and slowly forming a fireball just infront of himself. He remembered to ease back on the power so it was formed within a second, once it was he then fired it off, using chakra to propell the fireball. He used too much chakra and overshot the rock again, but only by a little.

Once the jutsu hit the ground and dissiptated he began building up his chakra again, doing so rather quickly. As soon as he was again ready he formed the handseals for the jutsu with ease and inhaled. He pushed his chakra up and out with his breath and focused on creating the fireball with it. Once the fireball had been formed he again used his chakra to propell it, easing back a little this time. Again he missed, falling just short of the rock he head placed down as a target.

He was getting a little annoyed with himself but closed his eyes to focus his mind, trying to clam himself and not get too ratty with the training. He knew what he had to do, he just needed to keep working on it. Once he had built his chakra up he powered through each of the handseals, inhaling shortly after. He then did the usual as he exhaled, pushing his chakra up and out. He formed the fireball and kept it in place, focusing on his chakra. With his chakra he then pushed the fireball forward, shooting it directly at the rock. The rock was hit and destroyed and with that, his training of this jutsu was complete.* - Fri Oct  2 21:45:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) intently watched the first few exchanges Between Erebus and Jideki, watching and analysing each of their movements. He didn't realise Erebus could use a bow, Up until now he had only seen him with a scythe occasionally. Hideki seemed to have very fast reflexes, easily dodging out of the way of the arrows shot towards him. He also noticed a perticular glow from Hidekis' eyes as he watched him perform the fireball jutsu, a strange crimson that looked quite unnatural...

He would have had more time to think on what that glow was had it not been for the fact his attention was torn away by Erebus literally catching the fireball thrown his way, then launching it back, one could say the power of the sun was in the palm of his hands. In anycase another ability peaked his interest, How fast Hideki managed to move as the fireball was sent back at him, another interesting quirk. * - Sat Oct  3 18:05:26 2015
