<br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) stopped by the nearby lake, looking down at the ground and seeing how muddy and moist it was from being so close to water. He didn't plan on it but he figured now was as good a time as any to restart and refocus himself on his training after his little break. The muddy ground would probably prove easier to control, at least that's what he believed in his mind. He hadn't been completely neglecting his doton training but he figured he hadn't progressed much since he last properly trained. He began moulding his chakra up and took his gloves off before placing his hands on the ground, to help knead the chakra into the ground easier. He tried his best to knead his chakra into the ground but seeing as he was out of practise, it wasn't all that efficient.

He pulled his hands back and began moulding up chakra, sitting on his knees before he did to allow quick access to the floor. He moulded his chakra up easy enough, that was the easy part afterall, Next came the difficult part. He clapped his hands together and placed his palms flat on the floor. He pushed his chakra through his body and down each arm, into each hand. From then he'd concentrate on trying to knead and mould his chakra into the ground and give it the doton nature change, something quite difficult for a shinobi that mainly uses the Katon nature change. In the end, he was only a little more successful than before but he pressed on.

Once again he repeated the process, cutting the flow of chakra off, pulling his arms back and moulding up a sufficient amount of chakra to knead into the ground. As he did, he decided to envision what chakra with the doton nature change would look like if it were physical, to help him with his training. He imagined it would be something hard and lumpy, like a bit of hardened dirt or clay dug out of the ground. With that in mind he placed his hands to the ground and began kneading his chakra into the ground, trying to change it in a way that would best suit the muddy and clumpy ground. He felt better results this time, noticing that his chakra had indeed gone into the ground more smoothly than before.

With his new found method seeingly working he kept fixated on his mental image of 'Doton Chakra'. He supposed it was because he was more used to and attuned to heating chakra rather than simply moulding it into the ground but he figured he'd get better with practise, that was the point of this afterall. He clapped his hands together again and focused his chakra down his arms and into the ground once he placed his hands to the ground, he was finding it much easier again now, having gotten back into his groove. His image of the doton nature change and his general chakra control helped a lot with this kind of training. When he was done he walked over to the water to clean his hands off, waved them a bit to flick the water off them and placed his gloves back on. He wanted to spend more time training on this but he simply didn't have time right now, there was always time later.* - Thu Sep 03 14:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) stood just where the water couldn't reach, gazing over at the sizable yet still small lake before him, it occured to him that this could be his new go to training spot considering he could practise the Doton nature change here easier and practising and Katon jutsu over water would cause no damage. He took in a deep breath and began moulding chakra up within himself, it had been a while since he had used any Katon jutsu but it was all quite natural to him. He began heating his chakra to give it the katon nature change before forming the tiger handseal and exhaling, producing a jet of flames that extended to a little over 1/3rd the length of the lake.

He wasn't all that impressed but he guessed it was because of his lack of training lately, time to sort that out and get back into the groove. In no time at all he had already began moulding up chakra, building it up first and then heating it, spending a little more time than usual. He formed the tiger handseal and inhaled, pushing his chakra up as he exhaled and puckering his lips he produced a jet of flames once again, having them extend out over the lake further this time. The jet of flames subsided and he would begin again.

Like before he would already be moulding chakra up, the only difference this time being he was both building up and heating his chakra at the same time to save time, most handy in battle as it allowed quick uses of jutsu and only relied on your handseal speed really. He figured he'd make an aim for himself as he formed the tiger handseal, he'd stop when he could shoot the jet of flames to around half the length of the small lake. He inhaled and sent his chakra upwards and out with his breath, shooting a jet of flames that neared the half way mark he was aiming for. He figured one or twice more would do it.

Once again he would be moulding up his chakra and heating it, making sure to concentrate to make it the best quality he could. It took him no time at all to build up and heat his chakra. He quickly formed the tiger handseal and inhaled a deep breath, pushing his chakra up as he exhaled to breath a jet of fire out, the jet managing to to get to the half way goal he had made in his mind. He kept the jet of fire going for a while to get used to the feel of it again before cutting it off and stepping back. This technique was quite easy to him now, he'd have to ask Noriko for some more advanced Katon jutsu later.* - Fri Sep 04 01:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) came back to the lake area he had been coming to regularly, he stood there today with a determined look on his face, his eyes beaming towards the centre of the water. He stepped foot into the water and began walking to where he aimed to stand, luckily he had been taught how to do these kind of exercises and was standing surrounded by water on all sides in no time. It was time to restart and re-vamp his training today and kick it into overdrive, he had been slacking off way too much. He figured that if he both practised jutsu and used the walking on water technique at the same time, it would increase his use of chakra and inturn would increase his use of the jutsu.

He would start by readying to use the flamethrower jutsu, he felt he was close to mastering this and wanted to knock it out as fast as possible. Moulding up chakra was harder than usual as he had to concentrate on keeping a steady supply of chakra to his feet in order to keep him upright. Once he was ready he formed the tiger handseal and inhaled, pushing his chakra up as he exhaled, fire shooting out from his mouth in a line that expanded outwards. He found the jutsu to be weaker than before because of the added concentration...but he felt training like this would pay off.* - Fri Sep 04 12:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) turns on the spot and starts to walk off.* - Fri Sep 04 14:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) came back a little later after taking a small rest, he wanted to start off small before he got into his real training regime. He focused chakra to his feet at a steady rate and stepped onto the water surface, walking to where he was standing before. He began moulding chakra up, once again taking a while to do so because of the concentration and chakra he had to use to stay on the water surface. He formed the tiger handseal, inhaling and exhaling a jet of flames. The flames looked weaker than before and didn't shoot as far as before, most likely due to him having to concentrate on the chakra flow to his feet to keep him upright.

After the flames died out he would be at it again, already moulding up chakra. He found it to be a little faster and easier this time as he was getting used to channeling chakra to his feet which was the whole point of this training, to improve his chakra control. He quickly and deftly formed his most practised handseal, tiger, inhaling and exhaling as he pushed his chakra up to breath out a jet of flames. He took note that it looked better this time as he was getting more used to using his chakra like this.

He wasted no time in building up and heating his chakra to apply the Katon nature change to it, it was afterall quite natural to him now and even though he had to focus chakra to his feet at a constant rate, it was still quite faster. Within a few seconds he was already forming the tiger handseal and inhaling, stopping for a split second as he pushed his chakra up and out with his breath, producing a flamethrower het from his mouth that extended forward a few meters. The flames dissipated after a few seconds and he returned to an upright position to think about whether he should train this jutsu some more.* - Fri Sep 04 15:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) came running up towards the mansion as even he heard a loud noise from a far and could see all sorts of people running in and out of the mansion area. As he came close he saw what looked like Tethys wearing kage clothing, "What..?" Would be his only response.* - Fri Sep 04 15:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) had a sudden attitude change, it looked as if he wasn't worried at all. He steps forward and looks at the two women hugging Tethys, his face seemingly being hard to read if one were to try and guess his current mood or emotions. "Come on now you two, It can't all be that bad. If the Mizukage is sick i'm sure we have the best of the best looking after her. It's standard procedure that Tethys takes over in the absence of the Lady Mizukage."

He shakes his head a little, "And here I was thinking I was getting all worried, look at you two. I'm more than sure the Mizukage is in good hands."* - Fri Sep 04 16:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mikami(Bagholic) whispers: This is unfortunate... - Fri Sep 04 16:31:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) stared Tethys in the eyes, He knew now wasn't the best time to ask questions and he'd probably find out later. "Understood, Lord Tethys. Be safe."* - Fri Sep 04 17:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) turns around to face everyone and takes a step back. He looks at everyone present, his face still being hard to read in the fact that one couldn't really guess his current emotions. "I know things don't look great right now with the Mizukage being ill and Tethys having to leave quickly but let me just say this...I expect you all to just continue on like normal and be on guard"

He pauses for a moment, looking back around at everyone, "As shinobi we bare hardship naturally and this current situation is one we will bare like normal."* - Fri Sep 04 17:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) After standing around thinking for a bit, he decided against practising the flamethrower jutsu any more, knowing to himself that he had indeed truly mastered the technique by now, even if he was a little rusty. He decided instead to practise the Katon jutsu he was least proficient in, Fireball jutsu. He decided to practise the flamethrower version of fireball jutsu first, then move onto making it into an actual fireball. Moulding up chakra as fast as he could, taking longer than before since it needed more chakra. Once he felt he was good he strung together a few hand seals and breathed out a massive arc of flames.

Happy with the results he continued on as planned. He began building chakra up again, feeling himself slip a little into the water as he was losing focus trying to mould so much chakra up and keep a steady supply going. Once he was done he imagined a ball shape in his head like always, did the handseals in quick succession and inhaled. As he exhaled a small ball of fire would begin to grow, looking almost like a close up of the sun. It grew to an ok size and as he fired it forward it plopped into the water with a splash.

He decided to try again one last time before heading back to see if there was any update on Tethys or Noriko. He began moulding up chakra, a little better than last time. He made sure to build a lot up and took his time doing so. Once he felt ready he weaved the hand seals and inhaled, exhaling a forming a much bigger ball of fire than before. He shot it off and it made almost like a landmine explosion as it dipped into the water. He slipped into the water a little but managed to regain balance. He walked off happy with how his training was progressing.* - Fri Sep 04 18:59:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) walked to the water and looked at the hand he cut, blood dripping from the wound. He knelt down to the water and placed his hand in, washing blood away. He pulled a bandage out and wrapped his hand in it, making sure it was nice and tight to prevent further blood loss. "I hate...fucking everyone..." he muttered to himself as he stared into his reflection, "And everyone...fucking hates me...".* - Tue Sep 08 17:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) didn't have anything better to do and he was still upset so he figured he might as well train while he was on his own. He had some things to try and wrap up and a new jutsu to begin training anyway. He decided to start while what he was most familiar with to warm up to training with his newest jutsu. He began by building up his chakra and applying the Katon nature change to it by heating it. He strung together a series of handseals while breathing in and exhaled, a small fire ball forming just infront of him. He didn't even bother firing it as it was so small, letting it dissipate instead.

He figured since he was upset his chakra control was all out of wack. He stood there for a moment as he calmed himself before begining to build up chakra in anticipation to try again. Once he was done molding his chakra he formed the very familiar handseals to the jutsu in quick succession and he breathed in and out, expelling his chakra in the form of fireball. The fireball looked a lot bigger and a lot more stable than the last. He fired it off into the water and it made a small splash before dissipating quickly underwater.

Once again he would begin quickly by building up his chakra as fast as he could, he did afterall have a large reserve of chakra to drag chakra from. Once he was done with that he spared no time in weaving together the handseals needed for the jutsu and he breathed in and out, pushing his chakra up and out with his breath as he did to expell it in the form of a fireball. The ball of fire would grow larger and larger until he could barely contain it before being fired off into the water. The water splashed up into the air at the fireball made a condensed explosion underwater.* - Tue Sep 08 18:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) walks back into the courtyard area, blood dripping occasionally from a hand with a bloodsoaked bandage around it. He kept his eyes to the ground, not bothering to take notice of anyone as he frankly didn't care. He picked a spot and stood in it, hand still dripping and probably forming a very small puddle in-line below where his arm rested.* - Tue Sep 08 19:03:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) waited for the pair to catch up and settle before he began any kind of explanation. He cleared his throat a little before begining, "To walk on water you must first master the tree climbing exercise. You will your chakra to climb the tree to the right of me. This exercise is meant to help improve your chakra control and even if you're more taijutsu based, it is still a very useful skill and a very valuable piece of knowledge."

"To climb the tree, one must apply chakra to quite possibly the hardest part of your body, your feet. I will not explain how you accomplish this, you ust learn that yourself. I will demonstrate momentarily and then you will begin." He paused with the talking and walked over to the tree, throwing up a half seal with his good arm.

He would then proceed to defy gravity one step at a time, walking up about half of the tree. "See? Simple. Your turn." He would say as he descended, "Make it to the top and we'll move to water."* - Wed Sep 09 21:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) stepped forward to move away from the other two since they had already heard his explanation. "As I just told those two over there you must first learn to scale a tree before you can traverse water. You must apply chakra to one of the most difficult places, your feet." He paused and looked back at the tree behind him.

"I want you to reach the top of that tree before we move onto water, Simply channel chakra to your feet and attempt to walk or run up the tree. There is a trick to this but as I said to those other two, I'll let you figure it out on your own...Oh and don't fall from too high."* - Wed Sep 09 21:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) notices Baen walking up and down the tree. "Keep practising while the other two catch up Baen"* - Wed Sep 09 21:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) walked over to the very edge of the water and turned around to face the three again. "Let's make this quick so we can get to some missions." He held up another half seal again with the arm he could move, focusing himself and his chakra. He then proceeded to defy physics by stepping onto and keeping ontop of the water. "Now, You all by now know that to keep upright on a tree you need to apply the right amount of chakra to stick your foot to the tree, not too much and not too little."

"Water is different, it is a liquid and is constantly flowing, keep this in mind when practising this. Walking on water also has a trick to it, different from moving up and down a tree..but once again I cannot tell you or else you won't get the full benefit from this training."

He stepped off the water and back onto land. "Begin, Once you master this you'll have much better Chakra control. I'll give you guys one more small bit of advice once you're all done and then we'll head back...try not to drown."* - Wed Sep 09 21:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) looked at each one as they all finished at their own paces, waiting for the last to finish up before he said his last piece. "Good work everyone, You did better than me when I learned. If you practise this more and more you won't even tell the difference and will pretty much do this subconciously. As for what I have to say, This training leads to a third exercise which involes climbing a rock face with just your hands by applying what you've learnt here...but that's more personal training and can be done in your own time."

He would start to walk forward and back towards the courtyard. "You did good guys, This knowledge is pretty valuable and could give you the edge against another shinobi in battle, Let's head back."* - Wed Sep 09 22:19:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) left the courtyard to find himself a store. He had to search around for a bit since he had never even considered buying an axe before. He went into a few weapons stores but didn't find what he needed until he came across a gardening utensils store. He found a hand axe, one that was appropriate size to use both one and two handed since that would be neccessary while not having the use of one arm. As he paid for the axe he remembered to tell the clerk to put the cost onto Tethys tab which she did without question, it was Lord Tethys afterall.

He placed the hatchet into a rucksack he bought, along with a few other supplies he bought too. He made his way out of the store and headed north since he knew there were trees past the north gate. Once past the gate he would begin his tree hunt, looking for one that was appropriately sized and shaped to cut down. He made his way to a more wooded area since he knew he would get a better pick of trees around an area like this. He pulled his wood axe out and would tap on some of the trees, making sure they weren't dead or infected with bugs. He eventually found a quite slender tree which he knew would be perfect to use, not too fat but long enough to cut into three to five segments.

He made a small chop into the base of the tree to mark where he would do the majority of his chopping before pulling the hand-axe back and taking a large swing at the tree, half burying the axe into the wood of the tree. He placed a foot on the tree to help pull his axe out before proceeding to do the same again. He found it difficult to hit the same place over and over but after a minute or two of chopping, he was pretty much inline with each of his swings. He kept hacking away at it faster and faster but he felt he was barely making a dent in the wood for the amount of effort he was putting in.

He hacked and hacked away as fast as he could but only accomplished in reducing his stamina. He had to stop cutting and take a short rest, just to catch his breath and rest his arm and injured shoulder. Once he got back to cutting he figured he needed to take long, hard and slow swings. He pulled his hand axe back and swung in down and around, digging it into the wood. He pulled it out and swung down again, digging into the wood once more. He continued taking chops at the tree, getting into a rythme which helped somewhat with the long process.

It took him a while since he only had the use of one arm but after an hour of chipping away at the base of the tree he heard a few wood snapping noises and moved out of the way as the tree hit the ground, causing it to shake a little. Now the he could size the length of the tree up properly he estimated he could cut the tree into around four or five usable logs. He'd begin by marking out each place to cut before starting the task of cutting the tree into five. After another hour and a half he had managed to cut one log off but decided to call it quits as it was getting dark.

The next day he spoke to a caravan service, telling them he needed to get to a village in the south area of fire country. He of course placed all the expense on Tethys tab like Tethys had told him too and the caravan driver even offered to help mount the logs onto a wagon seeing as he only had the use of one arm currently. He also bought a saw to help him cut the wood since using an axe to cut a tree one it was felled wasn't the most efficient thing. It took him around three to four hours to cut the wood into five and he was sore all over one it was done but he wanted to complete this mission quickly. Once he was done he talked to the caravan driver, telling him where the logs were and then packed some food for the journey.

He met the driver in the woods and helped him secure the last three logs of wood. Once they were done they met up with the rest of the caravan group and headed off. He was quite tired and wanted to sleep but he knew they would be near the sea soon as he would need to move by boat to get to the southern area of fire country. They moved through a lot of wooded areas before emerging onto a well kept road. Within a few hours you could smell the sea and not long after that they would be pulling upto the caravans hired boat just as he was drifting off to sleep. He woke himself up to help pull the logs and other merchandise on board however.

He sat back once they had set sail and it occurred to him that this was the first time he had been on a boat and it was the first time he had been at sea. It felt strange to him, he wasn't used to the rocking of the ship which made him feel slightly unwell. By now he was quite tired but he kept himself awake to do some stretches with his bad shoulder before putting his head down to rest. His quarters were basic since the ship itself was basic. He laid there and listened to the waves splash about and rock the boat. Eventually he became quite used to the movement of the ship and before he realised it, he was sound asleep.

One of the crew members woke him up when they were close to land since he would be departing soon too. He dressed himself and stepped outside, being blinded by the sun slightly as he did. He spotted the caravan driver and began helping him ready the cargo for departure. Once they were on land they set their wagons and caravans up and began to off load the cargo, the logs coming last since they were the heaviest. Once all the cargo was tied down they departed, heading north-west and straight for the village. He took advantage of this time to take out the food he had prepared and ate it.

It wasn't long before they had come off the road and started going down a much more beaten path. The caravan driver said they were using a less known road to avoid any trouble since he had ran into some before. While he was a little cautious about going down a beaten path, he guessed he should just trust the caravan driver since he knew the roads better. Himura took the time to look around since the scenery was different from back home, he felt that this land was more green and fertile than his home country but in some weird way, it lacked charm.

They finally returned to a proper road and the driver pointed out the village on the horizon. Within the hour they were moving into the village and the caravan was setting up to sell and trade some of it's cargo. Himura spoke to the village leader and explained he was from Kiri and he had brought the wood they had requested. The leader smiled and had Himura take him to the logs, thanking him and his village of it's fine work. The leader gave Himura a scroll, money for the job and told him he was welcome to stay at the village to rest should he desire. Himura thanked him but said he would be leaving after he had eaten.

He found a food bar and sat down to rest a bit, ordered and meal and proceeded to consume it. Once he got payed up he caught up caravan driver that took him here and shook his hand, thinking him for taking him. The driver pointed him to another caravan that was leaving for kiri soon to which Himura also thanked him for. He met up with the new caravan driver and explained to him that if he took him to kiri, they would be payed for accomodating him on arrival. The driver agreed and Himura began his trip back home.

This time the caravan stayed on a known road which Himura enjoyed since he got to see some different sights this time. The caravan driver explained he wasn't fearful of highway robbers since he had his own escort to protect him and Himura who he recognised as a Shinobi. Himura didn't tell him about the fact he probably couldn't fight due to injury since he didn't want the shake the drivers faith in him and the shinobi of Kiri. By nightfall they had already made it to the docks and Himura began helping them load cargo onto a boat. They had set sail within the hour.

He sat and watched the waves move about under the moonlight, thinking about how he still wasn't that happy at his village. He worried that Tethys faith in him was shaken and that no one truly liked him which made him feel like a bad person deep down...He tried to shake the thoughts from his mind and began exercising his shoulder again which was feeling better as of late. He practised a few handseals, starting off slow at first but picking up the pace after a minute or two. He hit a point where his shoulder started hurting a little and decided that was a sign for him to return to his cabin and sleep. Once again he listened to the waves and focused on the motion of the boat before drifting off.

By the time he woke up and walked out of his cabin the ship was moving into the dock yard. Once they were tied down he decided to stay and help the caravan unload and set up to travel to Kiri, he could have made it back to the village on his own from here but he thought it was polite to help since they got him this far. In exchange for staying and helping he didn't have to go on foot which meant he would probably get their faster anyway. After they had been on the road for a while he started to recognise the landscape as home. It was dark by the time they had got to the village gates. He showed the guards his papers and told them to pay the caravan for his transport, once again putting it on Tethys tab. He went home and slept an hour or so before walking up to the courtyard to hand his mission in...* - Thu Sep 10 16:18:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: You too. - Fri Sep 11 05:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) sat down on the ground almost out of the blue.He placed his hands together in a handseal kind of position and closed his eyes, almost looking like he had gone to sleep or was meditating. He didn't usually practise out in the open but then again he also didn't feel like going all the way to the waterfall area to train. What he was really doing on the ground was slowly building up his chakra. When he was done his eyes shot open and he leaned forward, putting both his hands on the ground. He would start to channel the chakra he build up through his body, down his arms and into the ground. He stayed like this for a minute before pulling his arms back.

"Hm...I still can't efficiently place my chakra into the ground..." He thought to himself as he returned to his meditation position. He started building up chakra again in preperation for his next attempt. He remembered to keep focused on channeling his chakra through his palms as this kept his chakra more controled. When he was ready he placed his hands on the ground again and began channeling his chakra through his body and down into the ground. As he sat there he could feel that his chakra, while spreading throughout the ground, was not getting into the ground in an effective or efficient way.

He pulled his hands back after a minute or two again and began thinking once more while he built up chakra again. He remembered back to his last doton training session when he learned to change his chakra nature into something more solid and earth like, allowing him to move chakra into the ground easier. As he sat there he envisioned all different kinds of earth, soft, hard, muddy. As he finished building up chakra he tried to augment it in a way that made it feel more like the earth. Once he was done he placed his hands on the ground and started pushing his chakra into the earth, noticing it was being accepted easier but he still had a lot of room to improve.

He pulled his hands back once more and began building up chakra, this time trying to apply an earth like nature to it, making it more rigid and earth-like. All the while he did this he kept pictures of the earth in his head, he usually did this during training as it helped him picture how certain things worked. Once again he placed his hands on the ground and began feeding it his chakra. He noticed once again his chakra was being accepted into the ground much easier and quicker than before. He stayed like this for as long as he could before pulling his arms back, pushing chakra into the ground was tiring afterall.

He decided to try one last time before resting for a bit and going to do something else. He kept quiet as he took deep breaths in and out. He would build his chakra up and try to apply the doton nature change to the best of his ability. He placed his hands on the ground and exhaled slowly as he began forcing all the chakra he had built up into the ground. He was really determined this time as he began filling a large area around him with his chakra which any sensor type would notice. After a few minutes he would take his hands off the ground and breath in and out heavily while also looking noticably tired...maybe he shouldn't have pushed that hard?* - Fri Sep 11 09:23:50 2015

He memorized the ram handseal and took in every word Tethys was saying. He stood back up and read through the scroll one more time before putting it away. He then formed the ram handseal and began to focus and build up his chakra. Once he felt like he was ready he burst his chakra through his body and tried to run forward...but nothing happened. He looked around himself and realized he had only taken a few steps.

"Uh...Ok..." He thought to himself as he began building up chakra again. He formed the ram handseal and slowed his breathing down to focus his mind and his body. He pushed the built up chakra throughout his body and into all his muscles. He took in a deep breath, exhaling just as deep. As he exhaled he pushed off and found the world around himself become a blur. By the time everything had caught up to him he realized he was on the ground and behind Tethys.

"Uh...That wasn't quite right..." He said as he picked himself off the world and dusted himself off. He steadied his breathing and focused himself while building up chakra again. As he formed the ram handseal he slowly spread his built up chakra through his body and into his muscles. He took his time making sure his chakra was in sync with his body and breathing. Once he felt ready he pulled his body back a little and shot off. The world was kind of a blur again but it wasn't too bad this time. Once his vision returned to normal he saw himself facing Mizumi and the others...this time standing upright. "Huh...I did it..."* - Fri Sep 11 16:33:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm...Lera. - Fri Sep 11 16:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm? - Fri Sep 11 16:41:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Mind teaching me a jutsu or two? - Fri Sep 11 16:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure~ Which one do you want to know? - Fri Sep 11 16:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Uh, Tell me which ones you know. - Fri Sep 11 16:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can make clones, travel underground, trap people underground and summon a river of mud. - Fri Sep 11 16:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: How about teaching me all of them? - Fri Sep 11 16:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Yeah...Could you do that actually? - Fri Sep 11 16:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) thinks: Someone's thirsty. - Fri Sep 11 16:44:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I don't mind at all. - Fri Sep 11 16:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I know how to do the river of mud one already. - Fri Sep 11 16:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Which one first? - Fri Sep 11 16:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Uh Setsuna, Which do you want to learn first? - Fri Sep 11 16:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Doesn't matter, as long as I end up with all of them. - Fri Sep 11 16:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Just giving me a preview of them should suffice. - Fri Sep 11 16:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Ok then, Let's start with the underground one. - Fri Sep 11 16:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alrighty~ - Fri Sep 11 16:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Follow me. - Fri Sep 11 16:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh~ Kirie? - Fri Sep 11 16:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Hmm? - Fri Sep 11 16:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm teaching these two some Doton jutsu, you wanted to learn some Katon right? - Fri Sep 11 16:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Yeah. - Fri Sep 11 16:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: That would be nice. - Fri Sep 11 16:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can teach you now if you want. - Fri Sep 11 16:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Mind making a scroll or two for me? - Fri Sep 11 16:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: I have to go do a mission. - Fri Sep 11 16:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ahh, okay~ sure. - Fri Sep 11 16:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Thanks. - Fri Sep 11 16:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its okay~ I like teaching people. - Fri Sep 11 16:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm, you're welcome~ - Fri Sep 11 16:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Practice and you'll get it down quick~ But still, you got that pretty fast. - Fri Sep 11 16:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Wasn't good enough. Fast doesn't mean it's perfected. - Fri Sep 11 16:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No, but thats why you practice. - Fri Sep 11 16:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Of course. - Fri Sep 11 17:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You'll have to practice that one alot before I can teach you how to trap people underground. - Fri Sep 11 17:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: No point in doing that. I simply asked for the point of remaining alive in a battle. - Fri Sep 11 17:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I simply have to keep the mindset of knowing that if I go down my squad'll be considered down without me to support them. - Fri Sep 11 17:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm. - Fri Sep 11 17:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: At the same time, I need to know how to defend myself. That's my reason for wanting to take advantage of the affinities that I possess. - Fri Sep 11 17:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Not sure how to take her... - Fri Sep 11 17:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) thought he would be pretty good at this since he was able to do the suimen exercise. He placed his hands together and began by focusing and building up his chakra. Once he felt he was ready he pushed his chakra down through his legs and into the ground. He felt his chakra disperse into the ground but he didn't feel like he was sinking. He looked down and saw his feet stay exactly where they were. "Uh...That's not right..." He thought to himself as he stopped pushing chakra into the ground.

He placed his hands together and began building up chakra again. As he was building his chakra up he remembered that he needed to use his chakra to break the ground up into a fine sand and then move through it. Once he thought of that he felt he was ready to try again. He began pushing chakra through his legs and into the ground, trying to break it into a fine sand. He felt himself go down a foot or two but stopped after a few seconds...he then realized he was stuck...

"Ah shit...Dammit." He said outloud as he pulled himself out of the ground slowly. He got back to his feet and tried again, knowing what he did wrong this time. He placed his hands together and began building his chakra up one last time. Once he felt he was ready he first used his chakra to break the ground below him into a fine sand, then dispersed it through his body as he began sinking. He fully submerged and then popped up a few seconds later in the same spot. "Hm...Seems I understand the trick to it now..."* - Fri Sep 11 17:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its the same for me. I wanted to learn a jutsu for all of my affinities, so I did. - Fri Sep 11 17:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I'm not too keen on wanting to die either. It'd be cruel of me to abandon Violet. And I know for a fact that I wouldn't do that. It seems this relationship I'm in with her has affected me. For the better, obviously. - Fri Sep 11 17:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah...Violets Nice. I like her a lot too. - Fri Sep 11 17:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Like her a lot? That's an understatement for my feelings about her. I don't date people unless I love them deeply. - Fri Sep 11 17:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I uh...don't really understand all that stuff. - Fri Sep 11 17:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Hm? - Fri Sep 11 17:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Violets my first friend though. - Fri Sep 11 17:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: She's -was- my first friend. Now she's my first, and perhaps my last girlfriend. Forever. - Fri Sep 11 17:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see... - Fri Sep 11 17:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Maybe I'll have something like that one day... - Fri Sep 11 17:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: It's not normal for girls to like other girls. That's what I've been told. - Fri Sep 11 17:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Why not? - Fri Sep 11 17:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: First relationships lasting are rare, if you are able to pick that good a partner I be surpsied. - Fri Sep 11 17:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I don't know why. I don't agree with it either. Love is love. - Fri Sep 11 17:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yup...even if I don't really get it. It shouldn't matter. - Fri Sep 11 17:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I don't care whether someone likes men or women honestly. - Fri Sep 11 17:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I don't see what the big deal about love is. - Fri Sep 11 17:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Uhm...what I think...is its probably really nice. - Fri Sep 11 17:11:28 2015
