<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) went to the waterfall area to do some mre training since he couldn't leave just yet...annyoing as it was. He went close to the muddy shore of the water since he was going to be training Mud Silhouette some more. He picked an appropriate spot and began building chakra up, focusing his chakra on the Doton nature change. When he was ready he clapped his hands and placed them against the floor, channeling his chakra into the ground and forcing it to become muddy and liquified.

He moved to a different spot and began building up chakra again, making sure to keep his focus on the doton nature type which was getting easier because of his proficiency and continued practise with it. Once he was again ready he clapped his hands together once and placed them onto the ground, kneading his chakra into a focused area and turning into a muddy substance that was of medium size infront of himself.

Like before he would move to a different spot since this one was now muddy. Once he found a new spot he began repeating the process of focusing his chakra while building it up. Once done, he placed his hands on the ground, channeled his chakra up and through his arms then into the ground. He kept his focus on a large-ish area infront of himself, using his chakra to turn the ground into a muddy, slushy substance.

Once again he moved to a new position and began focusing himself again in preperation to build his chakra up, once he had regained focus he built his chakra up quickly, getting into a training 'groove' now. Now that he was ready again he placed his hands on the ground and pushed his chakra through his system and down his arms, kneading it into the ground. Once he was done he used the chakra he placed into the ground to change the ground into a muddy, wet texture.

He moved to one last place and started building up his chakra once more, he figured he'd practise one last time before seeing if Koeki was about, he did want to get going soon afterall. Once he was ready he clapped his hands and placed them against the ground, pouring his chakra into the ground through his palms. He focused his chakra into a large area infront of him like usual and when he was ready, used the chakra he had kneaded into the ground to change it into a wet and muddy substance which one could call a 'mud river'. With that he pulled his hands back and washed them off in the water, walking off afterwards.* - Wed Sep 23 16:53:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) walks off in search of Koeki.* - Wed Sep 23 17:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) sighed as he stood before the waterfall once more, noting being able to find Koeki again. He figured since he was training Mud Silhouette before, he might as well again. He picked a spot to practise in and got started with building up his chakra. Once he was ready he would clap his hands and start feeding chakra through his legs and into the ground. When he was done he used the chakra in the ground to change the earth into a muddy texture, it coming up patchy and quite dry.

He would be practising refining the quality when he sent the chakra through his legs, seeing as this was quite a hard thing to do while maintaining quality. He stayed in the same spot this time since it was still usable, immediately begining again by building up his chakra. Once he was ready he clapped his hands and began feeding his chakra into the ground through his legs. Again he used the chakra kneaded into the ground to change it into mud, still resulting in patchy parts.

Slowly he was learning how to refine the quality and quantity of chakra he was able to get into the ground, figuring it was much like suimen in that he needed to keep a steady supply of chakra going rather than forcing a huge chunk of chakra into the ground. Once he was done building chakra up he clapped his hands once and began feeding chakra into the ground slowly through his legs, keeping it at a constant supply as best he could. Once he was ready he used the kneaded chakra to change the earth into mud, giving a much better result this time.

Now that he had found a trick to this he kept on going, moving to a different spot to try again since the last one he was using was now quite muddy. Slowly he built up chakra as he focused on his surroundings. Once he was ready he clapped his hands once and began flowing chakra through his body, down his legs, through his feet and into the ground once more, keeping it at a steady supply. Once that was done he used the chakra he had placed into the ground to influence the earth, turning it into a watery, muddy substance all around himself.

He moved to one last area again to practise one more time before either taking a short rest or going to search for Koeki again. His last attempt was close to what he'd be able to produce with his hands so he kept his focus as much as he could, really wanting to get this done. When he was done building chakra up he clapped his hands once and began feeding his chakra into the ground as best he could, keeping absolute concentration. When he was ready he used said chakra to change the earth into a wet and muddy substance, forming a large-ish river of mud around himself.* - Wed Sep 23 18:12:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) didn't have much to do while he continued to wait for Koeki, deciding just to keep training until he could get the chance to talk to Koeki and finally leave. He would be practising increasing the strength of Mud Silhouette now, building up chakra as he stood in no place in particular. When he was ready he began pouring his chakra into the ground as much he could and when he was ready, turned the ground into a mud 'river' which was fairly large, though not the largest.

While he managed to produce a larger radius of mud than usual, it was still smaller than what he had seen others do. He would move to a new spot and begin building up his chakra again in preperation. Once done he bagan funneling his chakra into the ground once more, filling as large of an area as he could. With his chakra now in the ground he would use it to change the earth into a muddy substance, changing a slightly larger area than before.

He took off to a different spot and began building up more chakra, spending more time and concentration this time as he really wanted to increase the size of the jutsu to something that was usuable and versatile in combat. When he was ready he began kneading his chakra into the ground once again, filling a wide-ish area. Once done with that he repeated the process of changing the ground into a viscous mud, having patchy and dry areas near the edge of his influence.

Now that he was making good progress his jumped off to a new area and started building up chakra once more, making sure to take his time with building up said chakra. When he was once again ready he clapped his hands and began focusing his chakra through his legs and into the ground, focusing on filling a large portion of the ground with it. Now he was ready he used that chakra to change the ground into a mud again, converting a large part of the ground into mud but having patchy areas all around it.

He was getting a little tired but he pushed off into a new spot to try for one more, concentrating hard on building up a lot of chakra to influence a large area. Once he was done with that he pushed his chakra through his legs and feet, into the ground. When he was done filling a quite large area with his chakra he used that chakra to turn the ground into a slushy mud. He managed to change a large part of the ground into said mud but it was quite partchy and dry in some areas due to his lack of practise.* - Thu Sep 24 22:16:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) couldn't find Koeki once again so he'd just stand around the waterfall and train somemore, he felt he was close to mastering Mud Silhouette anyway. This time he would be refining his control over the jutsu even further now he could extend the range of the jutsu. He had already begun building chakra up and was ready by now. He clapped his hands together and pushed his chakra into the ground, filling a large area infront of himself. He kept all his concentration on changing the large part of earth into a river of mud, changing around 60% of it successfully.

He continued on, moving to a new place since the spot he was just at would have a mud all around it now. Again he would build up an adequate amount of chakra to perform the jutsu with. Once ready he focused himself and poured his chakra into the ground, making sure he filled a sizable area with it. When ready he concentrated as much as he could on using the chakra he distributed in the ground to change it into a muddy, wet texture, changing a little more than before.

Now that he was getting the hang of this he moved to another area quickly and started building up chakra again. Once he was done with that he clapped his hands and flowed chakra through his feet and into the ground, filling a focused area with it. Again he would give his chakra his undivided attention, keeping focused on it solely. He would change the ground into a muddy substance that flowed quite freely, sloshing about before starting to harden as he stopped concentrating on it.

He was getting better and better, managing to convert a very large area into mud now. He kept on going because he knew he could do better, moving to a new area. Once he had built up the chakra he needed to perform this jutsu he clapped his hands and began sending his chakra into the ground again, filling as large of an area as he could. Once that area was filled with his chakra he used it to change the earth into mud as always, keeping his concentration to the max to produce the best results.

He was getting a little tired but wanted to practise one more time, his mind being more on training than leaving or finding Koeki at the moment. He moved off to a new and dry area to practise one last time, building up his chakra as he found a good spot to stand in. Once he was again ready he would pour his chakra into the ground and fill a very large area with it, maintaining concentration. With that same concentration he used his chakra to convert the ground into a viscous muddy substance, creating a very large area of mud that one could regard as a 'river'.* - Fri Sep 25 00:09:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) stepped onto the water and pulled his tanto out, having the blade face away from him. He got to near or around the center of the water and gripped the hilt of his tanto with both hands. He began building up chakra within himself and when ready, pushed it down his arms and into the tanto, specifically the blade, as best he could. The blade seemed to get hot and had the occasional ember burn on it before dying out.

Again he would build up his chakra in preperation for practise, making sure to focus his chakra on the Katon nature change. When he was ready he flowed his chakra down through his arms and into the sword, pushing his chakra into the blade. The blade once again began to get hot and sparked with flames of life before summarily dying out.

While the chakra flow was working...it wasn't working that great, only producing embers rather than full on flames. He began building up more chakra as he thought on what he could do to try and improve his use of this technique. As he continued to think he would try it again, pushing chakra through his arms and into the sword and blade, causing the blade to become hotter and spark with small flames every so often.

As he began building chakra up again he had a thought spring to mind, instead of focusing chakra throught the entire sword, just focus solely on the blade. With that in mind he quickly finished up with moulding his chakra and began feeding his chakra into the blade of the sword as best he could. The sword would seem to get hotter again and the flames would seem more potent than before.

Once the flames had dissipated he began building up chakra to try again, happy with the result from before. When ready he began feeding the blade of his tanto his chakra, focusing as best he could on distributing it through the blade. The blade began to heat up and burst into life with small flames, staying lit for a few seconds before fizzling away. The blade would continue to act lively like this before dissipating once and for all, the tanto being placed back into it's sheath just after.* - Fri Sep 25 01:27:53 2015
