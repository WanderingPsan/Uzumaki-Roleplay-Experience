<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) took his tanto out and began building up his chakra once more. Last time he practised chakra flow he was trying to increase it's power, now he had done that he could work on refining it some more. Once his chakra was built up he started flowing his chakra into the blade, forming the shroud of flames around it. He focused on his chakra, trying to keep it controled so it wouldn't burn itself out.

Once it had burned out he began building up his chakra again for his next try. Once he was ready he began pushing his chakra through his body and into his weapon, pushing it out of the weapon to form the fire shroud around it. Again he kept his focus on his chakra, concentrating on reserving and refining the use of his chakra to extend the life of the chakra flow. He had managed to refine it a little, but it was still dying out quick.

He re-adjusted his grip on the hilt and began building up chakra once more. When he was ready he began flowing said chakra through his body, down his arms and through his hands, into the tanto. He concentrated on the chakra and formed the shroud with it, easing back on the chakra consumption while making sure it still retained power for a decent amount of time. Again it would burn out, but it was taking longer and longer to do so as he trained.

Now that progress was being made and he had practised for a bit he started to speed up how fast he was doing this, building his chakra up quickly and using the chakra flow quickly too. He made sure not to go to quickly with the chakra flow as he wanted to keep focused on it, making sure he wasn't expending chakra too quickly so that he could hold it's power for a while. This time the chakra flow too a while to die out but it still eventually did.

Again he re-adjusted his grip on the hilt and began building chakra up, quickly finishing doing so. Once he was done building his chakra up he focused on the blade and his chakra, sending his chakra into the blade slowly to make sure he wasn't wasting any chakra. Once he formed the shroud of fire around the blade he made sure to reserve the chakra implanted in the weapon, trying to make it last longer. THis time the chakra flow seemed to hold indefinately...at least it would while being unused.* - Sat Sep 26 14:51:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) didn't understand why Hideki had started to do that strange change that he had done before. He then watched him jump back a few feet from himself, "Hideki...Why..?" He would say, before noticing a mist starting to form around him. He too would jump forward and turn around, expecting an attack from the rear.

He then turned his head to speak to Hideki, "Hideki don't get any ideas, We came here alone. Someone is attacking the both of us." He said, trying to reassure Hideki that nothing was happening before turning his head back around to look for the enemy, getting ready to weave handseals at a moments notice.* - Sat Sep 26 17:46:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) skids across the ground as he looks over the condition of Kohaku, he sees her arm and knows it isn't good...the likely hood of survival diminishing every second. "You'll be ok Kohaku...Everythings going to be fine..." He'd say to try and comfort her.

He would then proceed to take his hoodie off, wrapping the arms of the hoodie around the top part of her mangled arm in an attempt to cut off blood circulation. He used the rest of the hoodie to slightly wrap the affect arm up, covering it from view. He picked her up as quickly and gently as he is able, moving as fast as he could to the hospital without injuring her further.* - Sat Sep 26 19:06:27 2015

"It's fine Kohaku...You're going to be fine...Just stay with me we're almost there." He'd say, coming up to the hospital shortly after, luckily it wasn't that far from the courtyard. The hospital itself would have doctors moving in and out of it quickly, obviously to tend to the wounded on and around the bridges.

He rushed in past everyone, shouting for someone to get him help. Eventually a nurse would run up to him and quickly check the woman he had in his arms, the nurses face turning white. She had him come with her and immediately they saw a doctor. Kohaku was taken out of his arms and onto a bed,his hoodie would be given back to him as the examined her. Before they took Kohaku off to the intensive care unit he would be asked to leave, he'd watch as they took her off before leaving the hospital, a blood soaked hoodie in hand.* - Sat Sep 26 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) was mulling over what had just happened in his mind, what he had just seen. He looked down at his white hoodie, now soaked in blood. He threw it to the ground in temper before sitting down next to it, just staring at it. A hand came up to his face, his hand, rubbing his eyes, nose and temple for a few seconds. His hand then stayed on his forehead, head resting on it.

He felt like crying as he looked down at the now crimson hoodie, he couldn't believe what his eyes had seen, the injury to Kohakus arm and her screams of pain now haunting his mind. Not hours ago they were conversing, general friendly chit-chat between the two of them. Why was it that everyone he tried to talk with, be friendly to or was friends with had to die or get hurt in some way...

In that moment a single tear ran down his face, sometimes the pressure just gets too much, even for a shinobi.* - Sat Sep 26 19:32:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) didn't have much to do while he waited for koeki so decided to continue his chakra flow practise. He took his tanto out and built up his chakra before begining the chakra flow, causing flames to burn all around the blade. He took up position infront of a tree near the waterfall, gripping the tanto in each hand. He pointed the tanto at the tree and slashed once at it, burning the tree as he cut through it slightly. The chakra flow would then dissipate...

He looked over the tree and saw that it's bark was blackened and charred which he was happy with. What he was not happy with was the fact that he lost the chakra flow as soon as he used the weapon once. Again he built his chakra up and flowed it into the blade, forming the flames around it. This time he held back on the chakra as he slashed the tree. Once again the chakra flow died, the tree being barely burned.

He knew he needed to find a balance between this, he couldn't have this just stopping working in battle after one slash. Again he built up his chakra and pushed it into the blade, forming the shroud of flames around it. As he slashed at the tree again he boosted up the power of the chakra flow like the first time but held back a little. The tree was burned but the chakra flow again burned out.

Reforming his stance he began building up chakra to try again. Once ready he flowed his chakra down his arms and into the blade, forming the shroud around it. When that was done he slashed at the tree, holding back on the power this time but still pushing a lot of chakra into it. The blade hit the tree and cut it a little, burning it a little too. The chakra flow then seemed to flicker for a bit before dying out due to him holding back on the chakra.

He re-adjusted his grip on the blade and reformed his stance, getting ready to slash again. Once he had built up the chakra he needed for the chakra flow he pushed said chakra into the blade and slashed at the tree, focusing on keeping a strict balance between the chakra used and the chakra reserved. The tree was cut and burned within reason to what he was doing and on the plus side the chakra flow didn't die out, but it looked weaker...he'd need more practise is all.* - Sat Sep 26 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) took out his tanto, gripping it in both hands and taking up his usual stance when fighting with his Tanto. He began by building chakra and pushing it into his tanto, forming the chakra flow of fire around it. Before his short break he practised balancing the chakra he used when attacking while his chakra flow was active, now he'd be practising to refine that balance. He slashed at the tree, doing what he did before to keep the chakra flow active, then he slashed again and the chakra flow died out, not even burning the tree.

He bit his lip a little in frustration before reforming his stance and trying again, building up chakra quickly and pushing it into his weapon just as quick. Once that was done he slashed at the tree, maintaining the balance he had kept before. When he went in for the next slash the same thing as before happened, the chakra flow died as soon as his sword hit the tree, not even burning it.

He thought he was onto something so reformed and re-built up his chakra once more. As he formed the chakra flow to his tanto he slashed at the tree, cutting and burning it. He then slashed again and just like before, the chakra flow died as his blade made contact with the tree. He took his sword out and nodded his head a little, his theory was correct, there wasn't enough chakra to hold the chakra flow.

Re-adjusting his grip on the blade he pointed it towards the tree as he got into a readied stance. He built up his chakra, taking a little longer to do so. As he flowed his chakra into the blade he kept the connection between his chakra and his blade open, very slowly feeding it chakra. As he went in for the first slash he maintained the balance of chakra, cutting and burning the tree. When he went in for the next one he rushed more chakra into the blade to maintain the flow, successfully cutting and burning the tree again. As he went for the thrid strike control became difficult and the chakra flow died out, but he was making progress.

He repeated the process of building up his chakra and flowing it into into his tanto, remembering to keep the channel between him and his blade open. He slashed at the tree once successfully, then a second time and as he went in for the third he kept up with feeding the blade chakra, focusing on maintaining the balance of the chakra flow. The tree was struck five times successfully in total before the chakra flow died

He tried again, determined to get this down with the good progress he was making. He built his chakra up quickly and flowed it to the blade, keeping the connection between his chakra and his weapon open. When flames shrouded the blade he performed a flurry of slashes onto the tree, hitting it ten times successfully in total. He made sure to focus on each slash, maintaining the balance as he fed it more and more chakra.

He figured he'd practise one more time before he was truly happy that he had this down to near perfection. He built up his chakra and formed the chakra flow one last time, flames encircling and dancing around the blade. He did another flurry of attacks onto the tree, hitting it successfully a number of times before stopping. He felt he could now use this in battle without worry of it faultering. Happy with his training he placed his tanto in it's sheath and walked off to rest a while.* - Sat Sep 26 21:18:43 2015

With a hesitant nod the desk worker called for a nurse to examine each of them, all under the watch of Himura.

Once that was done a doctor would come to give treatment to the ones that needed it the most first and the ones that didn't last. The doctor would clean, bandage and stitch anything he could, anything that was beyond his ability would need someone with higher levels of medical ninjutsu knowledge to fix but for now each of them would probably be not bleeding to death.* - Sat Sep 26 21:58:49 2015
