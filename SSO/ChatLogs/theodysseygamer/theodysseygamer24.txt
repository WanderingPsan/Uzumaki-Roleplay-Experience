<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) rolled up the scroll he was previously looking and placed it away, standing up just after. He didn't really feel like learning anymore about that and decided to practise ninjutsu instead, that's what he was good at anyway. With that he thought on what to practise, deciding to practise Mud Silhouette since he didn't have many doton techniques at his disposal, if any. With that he built his chakra up and clapped his hands together, bending down and placing them onto the ground, pushing his chakra through his hands and into the ground. With his chakra now kneaded into the ground he used it to turn the earth into a muddy substance, chaning only a little of it into what he desired.

With his usual first practise out of the way he began building up chakra up to perform the jutsu again, luckily this jutsu didn't require handseals so it was quick and easy to prepare and perform. With his chakra built up he clapped his hands together and croutched down, placing his hands on the ground. With that he would begin pushing chakra down his arms, kneading it into the ground. With his chakra in the ground he concentrates and uses it to convert the ground into a more liquified state, turning the rigid earth into a more malleable mud. This however didn't work as well as planned, having only made patches of the ground into proper mud.

After his second attempt he knew what he needed to work on, simply refining pushing his chakra into the ground. With that in mind he got to work on building up his chakra again, doing so quicker and quicker as he did. Once that was done he clapped his hands together and placed them onto the ground, sending his chakra through his body and down his arms, kneading it into the ground. As he did he focused on his chakra, trying to make sure he was getting in as much as he could. He knew he was getting a fair bit into the ground, but it needed work. He would then repeat what he did before, using his chakra to change the ground into mud.

With that done he moved to a new spot and began again, building up his chakra as quickly as he could. When he was again ready he clapped his hands together and bent down to the ground, placing his palms against it. With his hands now on the ground he would begin kneading his chakra into the ground once more, concentrating solely on the chakra he was feeding into the earth. He focused on how he transitioned it from his hand to the earth, making sure none was being lost in the process. By the time he was done a lot of his chakra was in the ground and he would be again converting the earth into a muddy state, producing a much better result.

Now that he had a few practises in and he was making good progress, he was becoming more and more fluent with the jutsu. As such when he began building his chakra up it took less and less time with each practise, becoming more and more familiar with the doton nature change. When ready he clapped his hands together and placed them onto the ground, once more going through the process of kneading his chakra into the ground as he concentrated on it, focusing all his efforts onto his chakra to make sure he was doing this efficiently and effectively. When that was done he simply did as before, using his chakra to turn the ground into mud.

Moving onto his next spot he thought about his last attempt, knowing his was getting most of his chakra into the ground by now. He stopped when he found a good spot to practise in and began building his chakra up, doing so in seconds. With that done and dusted he clapped his hands together, bent down and placed them to the ground, begining the process of kneading his chakra into the ground. He continued to focus on his chakra, making sure that he wasn't wasting or expending any chakra he was using. Once he was done he turned a small area into a small river of mud with his chakra, finally having the first part of his training down.* - Sun Oct 11 01:50:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: He learned his ABC's well. - Sun Oct 11 02:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) watched the handseals Shinjin made closely, starting to feel quite hot after he did, incredibly hot infact. He looked up as something other than the sun started shining in the sky, revealing a massive fireball at the command of Shinjin doing a fireball jutsu apparently. He heard shinjin tell him to surge his chakra through his body which he proceeded to do, getting hotter and hotter as he did. When he surged his chakra it seemed to do nothing for him, still being under the effect of the genjutsu.

With a confused look on his face he tried to calm himself as best he could, begining to build up chakra when he was a little more focused, well, as focused as one could be under the intense heat of a fireball. Once he had built his chakra he shook his hands off and formed the ram handseal again, bursting his built up chakra through his chakra network, he couldn't do this very well however as this was only his second time doing such an odd thing. It still wouldn't have worked for him however, the genjutsu plainly still being under effect.

By now his body was feeling quite hot, his mind starting to go a little haywire with the heat he was feeling. He started to figit a little bit as the heat started getting to him. He would do his best to keep himself together, trying to focus his best on building up his chakra. This time he would build more up than before, aiming to try and surge more chakra through his network. Once ready he pulsed his chakra network with a large supply of chakra again though like last time his inexperience would come into play, not being able to pull such a thing off to the best of his ability and as such, still did not have any effect.

He brought his hands up to his face and rubbed his forehead, trying to think of what he was doing wrong, he was told to surge his chakra so why wasn't it working? A little lightbulb went off in his head within that moment and he began building up chakra again to try out the idea that had come to him. As he went to surge more chakra through his network he stopped the flow of chakra around his body as best he could. Then as he surged chakra through himself he focused as much as he could on restarting his chakra network with a large supply of chakra and in doing so, finally broke the genjutsu.

The heat would immediately stop and the fireball would be gone. He would then put his hands down and look at Shinjin. "I did it...I think...The heat is gone now at least..."* - Sun Oct 11 02:31:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) came to the training field in Konoha once again to begin training mud silhouette once more. Last time he had working on kneading chakra through his hands but since he had recently learned Suimen, it gave him the idea to knead chakra into the ground through his feet. With that target in mind he started up with building his chakra, taking only moments to do so. once ready he clapped his hands together and pushed his chakra down to his feet, then began kneading it into the ground. He knew he wasn't getting expending and wasting a great deal of it as pushing chakra through your feet wasn't the easiest thing.

He decided to just start again, rubbing his hands together to limber his arms up a little. He then began building chakra up once more, taking his time in doing so to make sure the quality of his chakra was as good as ever. When he was again ready he clapped his hands and focused on his chakra as he sent it down through his body and into his legs and feet, then started kneading it into the ground. It was still as hard as before, it wasn't like suimen where he had to keep just a constant stream of chakra, he needed to keep a constant stream while also focusing on kneading it into the ground. He managed to get a little more than before into the ground, but not much. 

Restarting again he closed his eyes to focus on his chakra more, building it up quickly but effectively. When he was again ready he clapped his hands together and began funneling his chakra down to his feet, then into the ground. He tried to imagine his chakra being like water or some other free moving substance that would just glide through his body and into the ground. It helped a little as he seemed to be getting better reception now, finding it a little easier to place his chakra into the ground. He knew it couldn't be too difficult to do, after all practise makes perfect. With that done he finally decided to see how much of the ground he could now convert into mud, changing a very distributed and patchy area into a muddy mess.

With his practise seemingly helping he continued on, knowing he was just going to have to get more accustomed to sending chakra through his feet for this jutsu. Once that last practise was out of the way he began again with build up his chakra, doing so in a short period of time. Once his chakra was built up he began sending it to his feet and then into the ground, trying his best to keep focused on kneading the chakra into the ground. With each practise he was seemingly getting better and better, this time having a much bigger improvement over the first. When ready he clapped his hands together and converted what he could of the ground into a muddy substance, producing more and more as he went.

Now that he was making good progress it only helped spur his ambition to get this done, begining building up chakra as soon as he was done with his last practise. Taking only seconds to build his chakra up. Once he was prepared he began again with funneling his chakra into the ground through his feet, making sure to keep concentrated on the transition of his chakra from his feet to the ground, managing to push more and more in than he had been doing previously, seemingly becoming more adept at this. With his chakra now in the ground he clapped his hands and used his chakra to morph the earth into a muddy substance that he could use if he so desired.

With his last practise out of the way he looked around himself and found his current area to be quite muddy. He moved to a new spot in the beat up training area and shut his eyes, begining building up chakra once more. It took only seconds to do so and once he was done he would immediately begin kneading his chakra into the ground through his feet. With his chakra control through his feet now being at the same quality that he could do with his hands to clapped his hands together one last time and began turning a small area into a muddy mess, having it move and churn about as he did. He had accomplished his goal of using the same chakra control with his feet as he did his hands, next would be some real training.* - Sun Oct 11 14:52:35 2015
