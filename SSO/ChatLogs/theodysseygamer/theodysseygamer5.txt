He would usually train in a secluded place or at the waterfall but since he would be training Shunshin, it's best to train around others. He built his chakra up and formed the ram handseal, bursting his chakra through his body. He then took off and set down quite a few meters forward within a second. He would sit down since he was dizzy and started hearing some weird static talk on his radio, sounding like Tethys. After he started to come to his senses he heard others talking of Tethys not returning from a mission...* - Thu Sep 17 17:46:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Because he didn't ask me. - Thu Sep 17 17:56:41 2015

He lifted the radio up to his mouth and clicked the button in, slowly and quietly he would say, "Tethys...Report location...Tethys...Report location...Tethys...Report location" He would continue to say this over and over as he gave a thousand yard stare in no direction in perticular. He knew what had happened deep down...but he just couldn't accept it in his mind or his heart.

Eventually his throat would run dry, letting out only forced cracks and crackles. He dropped to his knees, mouth still mimicing him speaking, arm still holding his radio infront of his face...he didn't know what else to do...* - Fri Sep 18 08:00:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: ... - Fri Sep 18 14:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) still didn't know what to do with himself, he just decided to train...simply because he didn't know how to move forward. He simply stood up and placed his hands together slowly, building up chakra. He would practise the jutsu Tethys taught him, Shunshin. When he built up enough chakra he would form the Ram handseal and run forward quickly, clearing a great many meters. Even dizzy and disorientated his mind was still clearly focused on Tethys...

He rested for a bit before begining to build up chakra again. He still couldn't understand why others kept trying to fight and trying to persuade him...in his mind without Tethys everything was lost. He formed the Ram handseal and set off again, heading back to where he was just standing. His body would be feeling pain from overuse of Shunshin but he showed no emotion towards it, mind still fixated on what he needed to do.

Even as he rested he still thought of Tethys and the village, his options of staying or leaving. Where there really people here that needed him? If he left...where would he go? He stood up when he felt ready and built up chakra once more, forming the ram handseal and taking off once again. When he landed he sat down again to rest the effects off for a bit.

After a minute or two he stood up. He thought about Tethys some more and how much of an influential person he was to him, almost like a father...and now he was gone. He built up chakra as he thought and formed the ram handseal, moving quite the distance and landing again. When he landed he felt weird again, like someone had ripped his chest out, a pain that could not be soothed.

He didn't even bother to rest this time, powering through the overuse effects of Shunshin. He didn't care, he was just angry at this point. He built his chakra up fiercely, took off and landed back down hard. His body started to spasm and he had to lay down, nearly falling as he did. As he laid there he just felt like crying, why did Tethys die and not him? Why did Tethys not take him to fight against Zetsumo? Why...wasn't he there to save Tethys..?* - Fri Sep 18 15:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) laid there for a while until the effects were gone, once they were he got up and walked over the water and down the water fall, not wanting to see a large part of the village from up there.* - Fri Sep 18 15:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) walked off of the water and back onto the ground. His predicament and Tethys death still fresh in his mind. He still didn't know what to do with himself, deciding to train more again. This time he tried to focus more on the training so he could get more of a benefit from it. He placed his hands together and cleared his mind, building up chakra. When he was ready he formed the ram handseal and set off, making it a considerable distance in a fast pace.

Without even letting himself think of things he just stood there, building up chakra again while the disorientating effects wore off. Once he was again ready he formed the one handseal needed for Shunshin and spread his chakra through his body, giving it a boost. He then set off in the opposite direction from before and landed near or around where he was previously standing. He would have to sit as the effects of shunshin hit his body.

Once he was again fit for training he stood up and powered on. Again he would build his chakra up in preperation for his next attempt. When he was done he would form the ram handseal and set off. He made it quite the distance before stopping once more, landing near where he was last time again. He stayed standing and simply built his chakra up slowly as the dizziness effect wore off.

Once the effect wore off he focused on where he wanted to land and formed the ram handseal. He set off and tried to keep focused on where he was aiming to land, landing pretty near it. He needed to sit and rest because of the overuse effect Shunshin had but he now had a new objective to train towards, precise landing with Shunshin.

After around ten more minutes he stood up and turned around, building up chakra once more in preperation for his next set of practise. He focused on where he was standing before, making that his target landing zone. He formed the ram handseal, spreading his chakra throughout his body. He then formed the ram handseal and set off, landing close but not close enough to the spot he desired to land in.

Once he rested the dizziness off he picked up two sizable rocks and placed them quite the distance from eachother, this would help him aim for a place to land in. He stood over one rock and faced the other, building his chakra up. When he was ready he formed the single handseal needed for shunshin and set off, sights set on the rock he placed down. He landed closer to where he aimed for this time but once again, it was kinda far off from what would be needed in battle.

He had to sit down and rest his body since he was using Shunshin quite a bit. After another ten to fifteen minutes he stood back up and began building up chakra again. He focused himself on the rock and formed the ram handseal, setting off a second later. He kept his eyes on the rock as best he could, his tunnel vision while using shunshin getting less and less intense as he practised. After he stopped he noticed that the effects from using Shunshin were lessening too, his training seemed to be paying off.

He waited for around a minute before turning around and building up chakra again. Like before he focused himself on the rock he placed down, trying not to let anything else distract him. He formed the ram handseal and set off, landing closer and closer to the rocks he had placed down every time he practised now. His body felt ache-y and painful again so he sat down to rest, thinking some more on how to better master Shunshin.

Once another ten minutes had gone by he stood up and looked at the roock he had to Shunshin to, while he rested and thought on the Shunshin technique some more he came to the conclusion that continued practise, like he had been doing, was the only way to truly get over these effects. He placed his hands together and built his chakra up quickly, keeping focused on the rock. He formed the handseal needed and landed near the rock once more.

He turned around and focused on the rock he was just next to yet again, letting the dizziness effects he felt wear off before building up chakra again. When he had built up the chakra neccessary to use this technique he formed the handseal quick and kept all his conciousness on that rock. He took off and landed within a second, he looked next to himself and he was standing next to the rock, finally getting the precision needed to use shunshin down. He then half collapsed onto the floor, needing a good rest before he continued.* - Fri Sep 18 15:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) as he laid on the ground his mind wandered back to Tethys and Zetsumo. Maybe the others were right about being a disgrace to Tethys memory. He then thought about how much he hated Zetsumo and his gang...how they captured him...how they probably butchered Tethys body...How he was going to kill them...kill them all...

A fit of rage seemed to take him over as adrenaline took over his body, something snapping within him it seemed. He forcibly pushed his body up off the ground, getting back to his feet. People were right, he was being stupid over Tethys death. Tethys was a good friend of his yes, but he knew after all this thinking that he couldn't just sit on his ass and wait for Zetsumo to come...instead he would go to him and burn his body to ashes...but first he needed to keep on training.

He placed his hands together and began building up chakra, now more determined than ever to train his body to and beyond it's limit. Whether he died to Zetsumo or he killed him it mattered not, the only thing he had to be sure of now was meeting Zetsumo in battle, face to face.* - Fri Sep 18 16:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) was ready to use Shunshin again since he had been previously building up chakra. Now that he had the precision of Shunshin down there was only one more thing to do, working on mastering this technique so he could no longer get the dizzy after effects. He formed the ram handseal and rushed forward, making sure to keep his precision perfect while he moved. He landed and turned around, getting ready to Shunshin again.

Instead of resting the dizziness off he just decided to build up more chakra. His plan was to push his body while it felt these effects so he would become used to them eventually. Once he was done he formed the handseal needed and took off, trying to keep his precision as good as he could even while dizzy. He landed and nearly fell over, only just keeping his balance. His body hurt but he turned around to try again.

Even as his body hurt and pained he placed his hands together and built up his chakra, his muscles burning as he did. Once he was ready he formed the handseal and burst his chakra into his muscles, his whole body burning as he did. He moved forward and hit the floor as he stopped, his body now refusing to move even as he tried to stand. He would simply have to lay there and wait in pain, but it was the price he was willing to pay.

He had to wait a little over thirty minutes for the pain to stop. As he tried to stand his muscles would ache and hurt but atleast he could go on. He began building up chakra once more in preperation for his next Shunshin. When he was ready he formed the handseal and forced his chakra all over his body, saturating it. He took off and landed next to the rock he had placed down again, turning around again inpreperation.

He placed his hands together and built up chakra as best he could while disorientated. When he was done he formed the ram handseal and kept his concentration as best he could. He spread hsi chakra into his muscles and set off, landing quite close to the rock like usual now. He decided against going for a third time again, not wanting to tear his muscles from overuseof this technique, if he did that he wouldn't be able to train any more.* - Fri Sep 18 16:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) stood up and turned around and looked at the last rock he was just staring at, finding new determination in himself. He had rested for awhile but that would be his last big break, this time he would master this technique, no holding back. He built up his chakra and formed the ram handseal, taking off and landing next to the rock within an instant. He then turned around and focused on the last rock he was just at, dizziness overcoming him.

Again while he was dizzy he would build up chakra straight away as best he could. By the time he was done he had already formed the ram handseal and set off a second later, landing really close to the rock but his head and body spinning like the worlds rotation had increased. He sat down for around five minutes and gathered himself before standing up and turning to face the rock again.

He would rest his body for ten minutes to ensure that he wasn't going to overwork it. Once he felt better he would place his hands together, focus himself on the rock and built his chakra up. He kept thinking of Zetsumos face, it motivating him to keep pushing forward even as he tired. He formed the handseal needed for Shunshin and set off, standing just over the rock within a second of setting off. He turned and focused himself as best as he could as dizziness overcame him. He pulled his hands up and placed them together once more.

Even while dizzy he was still building up chakra. He found it hard to mix up chakra in such a disfocused state but with practise he was working off this dizziness more and more. Once he was again ready he would pull back his hands and form the ram handseal, moving fast as he could a second later and landing next to one of the rocks he had set down. He had to rest again for a short while, he didn't want his body burning out.

He rested for a little less than before, feeling like he was finally getting used to the adverse effects Shunshin puts on the body and mind. He stood back up and turned around, placing his hands together as he did. He built his chakra up as quick as he could like usual before forming the handseal needed for Shunshin. He set off and landed standing over the rock he was facing. He noticed that while still dizzy, it wasn't as affected as it used to be on him.

While he was still dizzy he would pivot his body on the spot and faced the rock he was just at again. He began building up chakra again, always taking longer on the second time he did this because of the lack of focus his Dizziness gave. Once he was finally done again he would form the handseal like he had done many times before, taking off a second later. He landed near the rock like always now thanks to him training his precise use of Shunshin.

He had to wait and rest again for a short while, taking even less time to rest now since his body was both pumped full of adrenaline and getting used to the effects of Shunshin, He would also be powering through the pain with will power and determination. He stood back up, turned around and built up his chakra again. He formed the ram handseal and took off, landing near the rock as intended.

He was most certainly getting used to the effects from Shunshin as the dizziness seemed to lessen each time he practised now. He was even having an easier time building up his chakra now.Turning to the rock behind him he quickly built up his chakra and formed the ram handseal. He focused on the rock and set off, standing next to it within a second. He turned around and sat down again, having to rest once more.

He'd wait an even shorter time to recover once again, clearly now having a much better grasp on this technique now. He stood up and figured he'd do this once or twice more before resting to think a while. He built his chakra up as quickly as he could in preperation, focusing on the rock infront of him as he formed the ram handseal. He set off and stopped within a very short time, standing over the rock.

The dizziness he usually got was now no longer effecting him that much, his mind and body seemingly getting used to it to the point where he could still focus on what he was doing. He turned around and built his chakra up again, taking only a little longer than before. He focused as best he could on the rock facing him. When he was done he formed the ram hanseal one last time and moved, staniding just over the rock he was facing one last time. He had to sit and rest since using it twice did fatigue and disorientate him. His limit was one use of Shunshin, two if he needed to push himself but atleast he wouldn't get dizzy after it's first use now.* - Fri Sep 18 17:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) he went and sat by the water after he rested a bit, it reminded him of Tethys and calmed him. In a way he wished he could use Suiton jutsu...something about water was so calming. He thought more on Zetsumo as he sat and stared at the water, he knew he couldn't defeat him on his own...he'd need the village backing him up to do that...and he had been pretty rude to quiet a few people before...

He sat there and in that moment a plan sparked in his head, if there were a lightbulb above his head it would be glowing brightly right now. He had come up with a plan...a mission to take Zetsumo down...but he would need the others to do it. Pulling himself closer to the water he'd wash his face and arms off quickly as he worked a sweat up with all that training. He would sit there for a few more minutes as his body started to ache now he had rested for a while.

Once he felt a little better he stood up and walked away from the waterfall, heading to the courtyard...* - Fri Sep 18 17:14:27 2015
