<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) took a step forward so he was closer to the mud. He placed his hands together and began building his chakra up, applying the doton nature change to it to the best of his ability. When he felt he was ready he formed a handseal and pushed his chakra through his body, down his legs and into the ground. He focused on sending his chakra to the mud and as he did, tried to use it to mould the mud into himself. All his control amounted to was a lump of mud that stuck out of the ground. He looked down at and didn't even comment...he was too embarrassed.

He placed his hands back together again and focused on building up his chakra again, making sure to do it slowly so that the quality of chakra was good enough to use, afterall he wasn't that great at using Doton style chakra yet. When he was ready he formed the handseal needed and focused his chakra down his legs and into the ground. He focused his chakra on the lump of mud he made before and started refining it into a more humanoid shape. Once it was done it did look human...but it just fell to peices within a few seconds.

"Damn...Ok I got this..." he would whisper to himself before returning his hands back to their usual position when he focused on building chakra up. Once again he took his time so that the quality of his chakra was up to par. When he felt he was ready he formed the handseal and pushed his chakra down his legs once more and into the ground. He focused on the mud and began building it up one step at a time, first the legs, then the torso, then the arms and finally the head. He took his time refining it and eventually it took his shape and mimiced him. It was a little shakey but he did it. "Huh...That pretty cool..."* - Fri Sep 11 17:38:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) stopped when he arrived at the waterfall area. This was the place the he and many others decided to train at. He had to train here when practising his fire jutsu since he didn't want to burn the courtyard down and it's buildings down. The waterfall was the best place for training fire jutsu anyway since he could hardly damage water. He stood over the water for a moment as he built up his chakra, heating it to apply the Katon nature change to it. He then performed a string of hand seals and breathed in deeply. As he exhaled he envisioned a ball in his mind and as he did, a fireball would start to grow just infront of him. Once it grew to a decent size he would fire it off into the water and let it dissipate.

Now that his little warm up was done he'd begin to test himself, his aim today would be to apply more power into the fireball so it packed more of a punch, he felt he was pretty much a master at the fireball technique but he wanted to truly master it before he started training his next jutsu. He began building up his chakra and heating it as fast as he could to save time. Within a few seconds he was performing all the neccesary handseals for the jutsu, also as fast as he could. He took in a deep breath and pivoted forward as he exhaled, a fireball would begin to grow infront of himself, growing into a large size. He fired it off as he felt himself losing control and once again watched it dip into the water and extinguish.

He would already be building up chakra soon after the fireball had completely gone out, getting ready to practise the jutsu again. He needed to refine it some more and improve his control over the technique to achieve the results he desired. When he was done building up his chakra he performed the neccesary handseals and breathed in a deep breath. He pivoted forward as he exhaled and a small fireball would appear infront of himself which would grow larger and larger within a few seconds. He fired it off when he felt he could no longer keep the shape of the ball and once again watched it extinguish in the water.

Placing his hands together and shutting his eyes he tried to drown out all outside noise and focus himself. Now he was more focused he concentrated on building up and heating his chakra. He went over each hand seal in his head and quickly formed each one in quick succession. Once he had done that he took a deep breath in and pivoted forward as he exhaled, forming a small firebal infront of himself. He kept pushing as much chakra into the fireball as he could to up it's power to as much as he could get it. In the end the fireball grew to just under half it's size before he fired it off and extinguished it in the water.* - Fri Sep 11 18:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) // he deicded to practise it one more time before going to see Tethys for a bit. He placed his hands together and began building his chakra up one last time. When he had built up and heated his chakra he formed the neccesary handseals when he was ready and inhaled. He pivoted his body forward as he exhaled and a large fireball would grow and grow infront of him. Once again it grew to quite a large size before he felt he was losing control and had to fire it off. He watched it extinguish in the water before turning around to walk back to the courtyard.* - Fri Sep 11 18:22:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) placed his hands together in the usual position when he was building up chakra. He was going to be practising shunshin since he felt that mastering this quickly would be a real boon to him in battle. It was a nice change of pace when he only had to build chakra up and not apply a nature change to it. When he felt he was ready he formed the ram handseal and spread his chakra all through his body. He pulled his hands back and would push off, his speed increasing momentarily. His vision would blur as he was only very new at the technique but he was becoming more and more accustomed to it.

Now standing opposite to where he was before, he placed his hands together and began focusing on building his chakra up once more. He kept focused on a spot he aimed to land in and would focus himself in an attempt to see easier as he moved faster. Once he felt ready he formed the ram heandseal and spread his chakra through his body and into his muscles. He stepped forward and moved incredibly faster, his vision barely keeping up with him. By the time his surroundings became clear to him he had overshot his aimed stopping destination.

He turned around and aiming for where he was standing before again. He was really determined to get this down since Shunshin was quite a valuable skill and mastering it could mean the difference between life and death in some situations. He placed his hands together and began building up chakra again. Once he was ready he formed the ram handseal and slowly spread chakra all throuhgout his body to in a sense 'supercharge' it. When he was ready he took off, still not quite being able to see where he was going. He didn't land in the spot he intended...not even that close but he was getting better in his mind.

Once again he aimed for the spot he was standing in before and focused himself. He placed his hands together like usual when building up chakra. When he felt he was ready he formed the ram handseal and burst his chakra throughout his body. He moved forward very fast and once again overshot his intended destination. He felt his vision was finally catching up a little but he still had a lot to practise. He turned around to try again before hitting the floor as massive spikes of pain hit his body. "Ugh...Shit...I shouldn't have used that...So much..."* - Sat Sep 12 12:34:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) stood back up after resting for a while and after his muscles stopped spasming. "Think I can train some more now..." he said quietly to himself. He placed his hands together once more and began building up chakra. Once he was ready to try again he formed the ram handseal and slowly spread his chakra through his body and into his muscles. He zoomed forward at a fast pace and could barely see anything. He stopped around ten meters from where he was standing just a moment ago.

He placed his hands together once more and began building chakra up. It was nice not having to apply a nature change to your chakra since it meant you could build it up faster. He would be done with building his chakra up quickly and when he was, he would form the Ram handseal and pushed his chakra all through his body, soothing his muscles in it. He took off and once again got around ten meters within the blink of an eye. His vision was starting to adjust to the speed he was going at but the world was still quite blurry. He could feel pain moving through his muscles again but he decided to press on.

He placed his hands in the usual position and began building up once more, taking time to do so since he was experiancing some pain. When he was once again ready he formed the ram handseal and burst his chakra through his body. He set off and zoomed forward quickly once more. When he stopped he dropped to his knees in pain from the overuse of Shunshin. "Damnit...I can't keep this up..." He said outloud between laboured breaths. He would move himself to lay down on the ground so that he could rest his body...* - Sat Sep 12 16:55:40 2015

He couldn't decided on if staying or leaving was the best idea...all he had worked for he had given up just for some arguement over that prince...yet he knew he was right in his words and that having his own opinion wasn't wrong. He finally crossed what seemed to be the last bridge and found himself in a like woodlands area.* - Sun Sep 13 00:11:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) would suddenly start to feel very hot for some odd reason. He would feel wrong, something wasn't right whatever it was. As if on cue he would start seeing fires burn all around him. First his clothing would start to burn...then his flesh. He would look at the fires setting upon himself and would try to wriggle and blow at the fires to put them out. The pain would start to take over as he was experiencing what burning alive was.

He would shout out in pain, wriggling and writhing in pain also. He body would jump up and he would hit his face on the ground. His body now being parallel with the floor he would start to roll himself across the floor in an attempt to put the flames out, all the while being quite verbal with how much pain he thought he was in.* - Sun Sep 13 01:44:44 2015
