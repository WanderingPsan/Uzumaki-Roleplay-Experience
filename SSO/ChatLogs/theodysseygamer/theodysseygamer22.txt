<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) rubbed his hands together and loosened his shoulders, making sure his arms and hands were totally limber. He looked Ortho in the eye and opened his mouth, preparing to speak. "This jutsu had two uses, one is a very large flamethrower and the other is an actual fireball, both have there uses. The handseals are as followed, Tiger, Ram, Monkey, Boar, Horse and Tiger in that order exactly. The way you prepare your chakra is simple, you build it up in your stomach and heat it, then take a deep breath and push it to your lungs, breathing it out in the way you wish, watch closely."

He then proceeded to raise his hands up and go through the five handseals as he built his chakra up, taking in a deep breath and pushing his chakra to his chest. He then pivoted forward and breathed out, sending his chakra out and combusting it into a very large arc of fire. Once that was done he straightened up and looked at Ortho again, "That was the first way..." he said, begining to build his chakra up again. Once more he went through the handseals, doing them slowly for Ortho to observe. He then turned and pivoted forward as he breathed in and pushed his chakra up. As he breathed out he release the fire in a rounded fireball like form, shooting it off into the air before once again looking at Ortho, "Simply right? You try."* - Fri Oct  9 15:00:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) watched the demonstration, not hearing much from Hideki apart from the obvious, he didn't strike him as a natural born teacher. Either way he gave a demonstration and that was enough for Takeda. He stepped forward, standing just out of reach of the water. He focused on his chakra, held a half seal up with his hand and concentrated chakra to the soles of his feet. He took a 'leap' of faith forward, stepping onto the water. His foot seemed to stay a float, until he put the other one on, he then immediately sank, him jumping out of the water seconds later.

"Damn...Thought I had that." he coughed out, spitting a bit of water out. He stood up and began focusing on building up his chakra again, staring at the water as he did. He noticed how it moved and flowed, giving him an idea. Again he would focus his chakra to the soles of his feet as best he could and stepped forward, no fear of getting wet. His first foot stayed afloat again, then he moved his next foot onto the water, stumbling a little but mostly having his balance. He walked around a little, stumbling once every few steps until he could walk pretty balance. He looks up at Hideki, "Think I got it now."* - Fri Oct  9 16:11:05 2015
