<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) came to the arena in Kumogakure, fresh to start another session of training. He had been practising Raging Waves before so he would be doing so again today. Last time he focused on bringing the power of the water up, now he would focus on it's distance. The jutsu was only close-medium range but he felt he wasn't getting as far as he could with it. He started by building his chakra up, then kneading it into water in his stomach. He then formed the handseals for the jutsu and puckered his lips, spitting water out seconds later. He was using his chakra to control the pace of the water, trying to shoot it out as fast as he could to get it as far as he could.

Once the jutsu was completed he looked at how far he had managed to shoot the water, it was a decent range. He noticed that the water had quite a large spread over the ground however, meaning some of it wasn't being fully concentrated forward. With this in mind he begasn building up his chakra again, kneading it into water. He then performed the handseals at a fast pace and forced the water up and out with his chakra, using it to both shoot the water out at a fast pace and now trying to concentrate it into one direction to increase its range.

He checked his progress, seeing only a small difference in the range but a difference none the less. To him it meant his plan of practise was working and with that, he began again. Once his chakra was built up and he kneaded it into water within his stomach he quickly went through the three handseals the jutsu required and shot more water from his mouth, Concentrating on the chakra he was using. As he concentrated on his chakra he continued to try his best to improve the velocity of the water while also keeping it condensed into a stream, not the easiest thing in the world.

Once more he checked his progress, he would be doing this everytime he practised the jutsu to check his progress now. When he had done that he returned to his original spot and began building up chakra again for his next attempt. When his preperations were done he formed the handseals and puckered his lips, pushing the water in his stomach up and out as usual. He focused intently on the chakra he was using to manipulate the water, concentrating hard on refining his chakra usage while also pushing the water out as far and as fast as he could.

When the water had stopped shooting from his mouth he again checked his progress, seeing that he had a noticable difference from when he first started today. It was always nice to check ones progress, it always fueled his determination to do so, whether he was succeeding or not. Now that he knew for sure he was progressing in the right direction he built his chakra up quickly, kneading it into water. With that done he motioned through the handseals quickly and began firing off the water in his stomach again in the form of a stream. He continued to focus on how he controled his chakra to get the results he desired, trying to achieve his set goal for now.

With that last one done he felt it was about time for him to take a quick break to rest himself and his chakra reserves, though not before he got one last practise in, quickly building his chakra up and turning it to water. Once the water was prepared he went through the handseals with ease and puckered his lips, water shooting forth from his mouth as he forced it out with his chakra. He again would focus on his chakra, trying to reinforce his control over the speed the water came out and how concentrated it was. This last stream he produced seemed to be of much better quality than the first he started with today, though he knew he still had a ways to go yet.* - Wed Oct  7 23:36:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) took a little longer rest than he expected, mostly because he didn't realise the time and got caught up with things. Either way he was back now and ready to practise Raging waves somemore. He of course started out by building up his chakra, like always. He would then knead his chakra into water in his stomach, ready to be shot out as a projectile stream. He would then zip through each of the three handseals and began to spit the water out at a high velocity, focusing on his chakra as he did to make sure everything was going smoothly.

With his usual first practise that he did when starting now out of the way, it was time for the real training to begin. He focused on his chakra as he built it up, making sure he wasn't using excess chakra to the best of his ability. When he kneaded his chakra into water he performed the handseals for the jutsu and pushed the water up and out with his chakra, water spurting from his mouth at great speed. He had to focus on pushing the water out as fast as possible while keeping it all centered, trying to increase the range at which the jutsu could reach.

Once the water had all but gone he took in a deep breath and began again, refocusing himself on his chakra as he kneaded it into water, trying not to waste his chakra. When he was again ready he once again formed the handseals and pushed the water up and out of his stomach, using his chakra as the trigger for this procees and using it to push it out at high speed. He focused his chakra around the water, concentrating on funneling the water into a straight line as much as he possible could while keeping the speed up. Doing this was enabling him to push the water the further and further lengths, increasing his effective range and use of it.

He didn't bother checking up until now but he noticed that he was managing to push the water quite far now, a decent number of meters. Happy with his progress he continued on, knowing he would only get better from here on out. Once his chakra was ready and he had kneaded water into his stomach he raised his hands up from his sides and began forming the handseals, finishing incredibly quickly. After that he simply used his chakra to propell the water out, making sure to repeat what he had been doing all a long which was refining his chakra use, increasing the speed at which he shot the water out and concentrating the stream of water.

The water quickly ran out and just as quickly as it did, he was back building up more chakra. When he was ready he kneaded the chakra into water and went through the handseals of the jutsu, almost like second nature by now. Also like second nature was him pushing the water up and out of his body, firing it as a projectile stream. The water came out faster and faster, also looking almost completely like a stream now. He managed to fire it quite far, guessing he was reaching as far as you could possibly fire the water. He made sure to keep up his chakra concentration, always looking to refine something.

When the water had again finally stopped he figured he'd practise one more time before going on another walk. He wasn't perticularly fatigued this time as his practise with the jutsu meant it was consuming less chakra. Within a few moments he had built up his chakra and water and was forming the handseals, firing water out of his mouth at a fast pace just after. The water traveled through the air for a decent length before finally dipping down and hitting the ground. He felt like this was the maximum length he could get it, which he was pretty happy with. He had noticed however that the jutsu was now running out very quickly, almost dying out in second from how fast he was having the water go, that would be his next thing to work on.* - Thu Oct  8 02:44:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) went with Ortho and Nina to the Arena in Kumo, or the training ground, which ever it was refered to as he would be training there again. He felt a little uncomfortable with training infront of others but then again, it was also nice to have company. He got his mind off that though and refocused on his training, starting to build chakra up. He then kneaded this chakra into water within his stomach, preperations now being complete. He went through each handseal and puckered his lips as he used his chakra to pushed the water up and out of his body at a high velocity, the water quickly escaping his lips and his reserve quickly drying out.

Now that his usual first practise was out of the way he remembered what he was going to be working on today, increasing the amount of water he was producing. The water was simply running out too fast and he knew it. With this in mind he had his goal and began working towards it immediately by building his chakra up and kneading it into water, taking longer to do so as he focused on refining it and building more up. When he felt ready he formed the three handseals for the jutsu and puckered his lips, water shooting out seconds after he did so. He managed to prolong how long he could hold the jutsu, but only by a little.

Once he knew what he was doing it was simple from here on out, all he needed was time and practise, these things came natural to him these days apparently. He began again with building his chakra up, too focused on his own training to notice the others also training around him. When his chakra was ready he began kneading it into water, taking slightly longer to do so again as he built up more than usual. Once that was done he went through the handseals as fast as he could and puckered his lips, spitting out water from between them. He made sure to refine his chakra as usual, making absolutely sure he wasn't using excess chakra to the best of his ability.

The water lasted for a while longer again but ultimately died out pretty quickly, it was getting better though. Without wasting any more time he began building up his chakra again, kneading it into water when he was ready. He seemed to take a little less time to build more water up now, though only a little. Once that was done it was a simple matter of going through the handseals and puckering his lips, pivoting his body forward a little as he did. He used his chakra to force the water up and out at high speed, concentrating on refining the chakra he was using to both keep chakra consumption down and trying to prolong the stream of water. The water seemed to be holding for a little longer than when he started now, clearly his practise was paying off, if only a little.

It didn't matter to him whether it payed off a lot or a little though, progress was progress and either way it drove him, just like it was driving him now. Again he wasted no time he reforming his stance and building his chakra up, preparing the water within a few seconds of kneading his chakra in his stomach. With those preperations done he lifted his hands up and zipped through the three handseals within a second. With the handseals now done he puckered his lips and began spitting a stream of water at a fast pace, focusing on the chakra he was using like always. Again he managed to improve how long the jutsu was lasting, bringing the time up more and more with each practise.

Like usual he would start preparing for his sixth practise before taking a short rest, resting was just as important as working hard when training afterall. He quickly prepared his chakra and began kneading it into a large quantity of water, filling his stomach up with it. Now with that done he went through each handseal, going through them as quick as he possibly could. Once they were done he simply used his chakra to push the water up and out, puckering his lips and firing it out in a projectile stream. The stream continued on for a good while but ultimately died out a little too fast for his liking, after he had rested a while he would continue to work on this, determination driving him to get it perfect.* - Thu Oct  8 18:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: So should I keep going?~ - Thu Oct  8 18:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) turned around to face the same direction as everyone else, turning his head to the right to look at the both of them. "How are you guys getting a long?" He asked, his breath a little shaken from chakra consumption. Before they would probably even have a chance to reply he would have taken some food out, most likely chocolate, and gobbled it down.* - Thu Oct  8 18:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) got back to training as soon as he felt ready, focusing himself on his chakra as he built it up. As he built his chakra up he began to knead it into his stomach, turning his chakra into water. As he built up a large supply he performed the handseals for the jutsu and puckered his lips, spitting the water out at high speed moments after. He focused on his chakra, refining it so that he could push the water out at a fast pace, while also keeping it reserved enough for it to not burn out too quickly. The stream lasted for a decent amount of time before slowly trickling off.

With his preliminary practise out of the way he got down to business, wasting no time in building up his chakra and kneading it into water in his stomach. He formed the handseals and puckered his lips, using his chakra to push the built up water supply out of his body. He focused on the chakra he was using, regulating the water he had built up with the speed at which he was spitting the water out. He knew that simply making more water wouldn't cut it as there was a limit to how much he could contain, he needed to built up his experience with using his chakra to refine the water he was spitting out, all quite simple really.

With his target still the same, just slightly augmented to suit what he needed he simply continued on without wasting anytime, building up his chakra as quickly as he could and kneading it into water all the same. The handseals were easily performed as he was more than an expert at using them now, practically ingrained into his head from all the training. Once those steps were done he puckered his lips, pivoted forward slightly and pushed the water up and out at high speed like usual. He continued to focus on the chakra he was making use of, trying his best to keep the stream going for as long as possible.

When the water had finally run out he simply re-focused his stance and mind and began again with building his chakra up. He continued to push for how much chakra he could knead into water, refining it as he did so he had to use less and less chakra. Once a large supply of water was made he motioned through the handseals and puckered his lips, spitting water from his maw at a high velocity. He simply continued to keep refining the use of his chakra, trying to stretch as much out of it as he could to keep the jutsu going for a long while.

The stream of water was now lasting for a good long while, he knew that with a little more practise and refinement he could get it to suit his needs in combat. With that in mind and his determination as solid as ever he built his chakra up and kneaded it into as much water as he could, pretty much reaching his max at this point. He then quickly zoomed through the three simple handseals and puckered his lips, using his chakra to force the water out at high speed. Again he concentrated on his chakra, making sure to refine it to the best of his ability, he felt he was pretty much doing all he could at this point, the stream of water now lasting for a satisfying amount of time.

He figured he'd practise one last time just to make sure he was getting everything how he wanted, wasting no time in loitering about as he continued to build chakra up and knead it into a large supply of water. With the first step done he moved onto the next, quickly finishing up the three handseals for the jutsu. He then moved onto the third and final step, puckering his lips and forcing the water out at a high speed. He water came out in a long thin-ish stream, though one could tell there was power behind it. He kept it up for as long as he could before the water all but dried up, taking in a breath as he finished. He now had it lasting as long as he water, or at least needed. Now all that was left to practise was refining everything he could until it was all completely to his liking.* - Thu Oct  8 19:55:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: It's about time I strarted again. - Thu Oct  8 20:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) began quickly, wanting to get this last little training session out of the way so he could go and properly rest for a while. All he would be doing now if refining and revising everything he had trained before, easy enough. With his new training goal in mind he built chakra up and kneaded it into a large quanity of water. When that was done he formed the handseals of the jutsu and used his chakra to force the water out at high speed, concentrating on his chakra at all times to keep it in check as he used it to manipulate the speed and strength of the water.

Once that was done he began again just as quickly as he finished, building up his chakra to turn it into water. Once the water had been kneaded in his stomach he raised his hands up slightly and went through the three handseals of the jutsu as quickly as he could. With those two first steps done he puckered his lips and began to spit forth a torret of water at a fast pace as he manipulated it to come up and out through his mouth. He continued to refine his chakra control in areas he felt he could work on the most, concentrating the hardest on this at the time.

Again he spared no time in getting set up again, refocusing his mind and body in a way that best suited the jutsu. He prepared his hands as he built up his chakra and kneaded it into a large source of water within his stomach. With his hands he then performed the three handseals for the jutsu and puckered his lips and he pivoted his body forward, focusing on his chakra as he used to push the water from his body and mouth at as high as speed as he possibly could, also making sure to refine his control of his chakra to make sure it was lasting as long as he needed it to.

When his lastest practise of the jutsu had died down he began again for the fourth time, building his chakra up and kneading it into water like he had done so many times in the past now. He finished that as quickly as he could and when through the handseals just as fast, continuing to push himself in every aspect he could. Now ready to perform the jutsu he pivoted forward and puckered his lips, shooting the stream of water out just like before. Also like before he would have been focusing on his chakra, making sure he was using it in the most efficient and effective way possible.

As he began building up his chakra for the fifth time he felt this would be his last practise, usually he would do six just to be sure but since he had made such good progress with this jutsu, he really felt like he didn't need to. Even if he did it would be a simple task to practise it a few more times. With the thought of his incoming well earned rest in mind he built his chakra up as quickly as possible, kneading it into water just the same. With this done he quickly zipped through the handseals which finalised the deal. Now pivoting forward and puckering his lips he used his chakra to shoot his built up water from his mouth one last time, concentrating on his chakra control in all aspects. Once the jutsu was done he was confident he could move on from this jutsu now, having learned most if not all he could with it.* - Thu Oct  8 20:44:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) didn't quite understand what was happening right now, one moment he was casually talking to Misa, the next some crazed monster looking person...thing was attacking him out of the blue. What had he done to deserve that? In any case as he registered he was being attacked he turned and jumped back a few meters to gain some distance between himself and his apparent attacker. As he did he went through a few handseals, quick as he possible could. As he did that he moulded chakra up and when the handseals were done, held a hand out.

He then amassed his chakra to that hand, lightning starting to spark and crackle around it. He was in the process of bending down to place his hand to the ground, aiming to send the lightning through the ground towards Ambrocio and fry his ass...that was until Hideki had got between the two of them. He pulled back and held his chakra in his hand, awaiting the possibility to use his jutsu if he had to.* - Thu Oct  8 21:18:43 2015
