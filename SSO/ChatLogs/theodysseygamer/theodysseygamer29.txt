<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) was too busy eating to notice the smile from Hana, he did however turn his head to her after she spoke to him. "Pretty good I guess...I don't really eat like this often."* - Thu Oct 15 22:13:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) looks down at his ramen, then at his feet, staring at them for awhile. Finally he would turn his head back to Hana, looking into her eyes. "Why...why are you so friendly towards me..?"* - Thu Oct 15 22:18:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) drops his eating utensils into his ramen bowl, a little taken back by what she had just said to him. He wasn't too sure whether to be angry or grateful in all honesty. On the one hand it was an incredibly nice thing for someone to say to him but on the other hand...he didn't really want to let people get this close to him because how how many friends he had lost in just a short amount of time. He would go back to looking into his ramen bowl for a few seconds, trying to think of what to say.

Eventually he would look back, still not quite sure what to say but he had an idea. "I-If...thats what you think...then I guess you should know about my parents...I mean...if you want of course..."* - Thu Oct 15 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) took her hand off his shoulder, ignoring her currently happy and upbeat attitude and setting a little bit of a darker tone with his own experssions. "You don't understand Hana...My parents...are gone."* - Thu Oct 15 22:29:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: ...Wow... - Thu Oct 15 22:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: So, I do understand... and I know it is painful but to be honest. I never wanted to know my parents, for what they did to you. - Thu Oct 15 22:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: But your story is different. - Thu Oct 15 22:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: So, I understand Takeda. But you should know that your parents are still here with you. They are watching over you and they wouldn't want a kid like yourself, and excuse me for calling you a kid, that you shouldn't be so.... you know, lonewolf. - Thu Oct 15 22:39:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: And I promise, I won't leave you. - Thu Oct 15 22:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) turns his body to face Hana directly, he would suddenly move forward slowly, getting closer and closer to her. When he was close enough he would extend his arms out and move forward, attempting to give her a hug if she'd let him. No words were said, only movement would display his gratitude.* - Thu Oct 15 22:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) hugged her a little tighter as she did the same, staying this way for a couple of seconds before pulling back, coughing a little as he did to clear his throat. "How about them cookies then..." He would say, trying to move on from his little moment of weakness as quickly as he could, he was a shinobi afterall.* - Thu Oct 15 23:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) munched down a cookie or two, all the while dipping them into the milk they had been served. "It's going ok I guess...A little slow at the moment but i'm hoping to speed it back up again soon."* - Thu Oct 15 23:06:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Anyways. Before we talk any further, lets go outside. - Thu Oct 15 23:44:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Basically, you two restrict his movement and keep him focused on you as best you can, while I and Hana run for the bells. - Thu Oct 15 23:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: I agree, that is quite a simple plan and probably the most logical. - Thu Oct 15 23:49:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But the idea isn't so much to be winning a fight, as to stall and restrict his movement as much as possible. - Thu Oct 15 23:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: He'll most likely figure out our strategy quickly. - Thu Oct 15 23:50:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) Came to the training field to restart his training, lately he has been lax in his training but it was time to bring it but up to standard again. The last formal training session he had was training great breakthrough which he figured he would do again today. With that he began building his chakra up within his body, slowly at first as this was his first real practise of it in a while. Next he went through the handseals of the jutsu pretty fast but slow enough for it to be classed as 'starting up'. Then he held his hand out and gathered his chakra there, as he did he would begin sharpening his chakra over itself as best he could to give it the wind nature change. Then he would thrust his hand forward and release his chakra, producing a gust of wind.

With that first practise out of the way he had familiarised himself with the jutsu and could now start the real training. He remembered that he was simply practising to get better at the jutsu first before working on training other areas of it. After remembering all that he would begin building his chakra up like before, only this time he would be building it up much, much faster. With his chakra built up he would then go through the handseals of the jutsu and held his hand out as before, gathering his chakra to it. He would work on how he controled his chakra to add the wind nature to it, trying to refine how he did so. After that he would simply thrust his hand forward and release his chakra in the form of a blast of air.

He wasted no time in building up his chakra as quickly as he could again for the jutsu. Once an ample amount for the jutsu had been built up he formed the handseals the jutsu required and held his chakra out, concentrating his chakra to it. He focused on the chakra in his hand, doing his best to refine it into wind style chakra. With his chakra prepared he pushed his hand forward and released the chakra in his hand, producing a powerful gust of wind from his palm.

With that third practise down he noticed how much he was progressing with this jutsu already, it was fantastic progression but he noticed that the gust of wind he was producing was much better than when he first started training this jutsu a while back. With that in mind he refocused himself on his chakra and built it up as quickly as he could. Once his chakra was prepared he formed the handseals as quickly as he could and held his hand out, pushing his chakra to it. As he gathered his chakra in his hand he started sharpening it to apply the wind nature change to it and with that, he focused on his chakra, thrust his hand forward and let his chakra out, producing another blast of wind.

With that last blast of wind down he reformed his posture and refocused his mind on his chakra as he began quickly building it up. Once his chakra was built up it was a simple matter of forming the handseals and holding his hand out like before, all standard stuff by now. He then focused his chakra to his hand and began the process of refining his chakra, sharpening it into as fine a point as he could. Once his chakra was fully prepared he continued to focus on it as he pushed his hand forward and then when the time was right, released his chakra in a single blast of wind.

Despite his continued use of the jutsu and how familiar he was getting with it, it was still taking a large portion of his chakra to practise so many times. He figured this would be his last practise of the jutsu before he went to recover for a while and on that note, he began building his chakra up once more. With his chakra ready he formed the handseals for the jutsu and held his hand out, concentrating his chakra to it. As he fed his chakra to his hand he refined the chakra into fine points to apply the nature change to it and once that was accomplished, his preperations were complete. With everything done he simply pushed his hand forward and concentrated on his chakra, releasing it at the last moment which caused a decently powerful gust of wind to follow the direction of his hand.* - Fri Oct 16 15:30:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) walks off north.* - Fri Oct 16 20:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) came back to the training fround after he had rested up fully, ready to begin training great breakthrough for real. Now that he was familiar with the jutsu he thought it was time to begin training the different aspects of it, begining with the power of it. Currently the force of the wind was nothing to be marveled at...yet anyway. With his training goal in mind he began building up chakra for the jutsu. Once his chakra had been built up he gathered it to his hand hand started thinning it to apply the wind nature change it it. With his chakra now prepared he pushed his hand forward and with it, his chakra, releasing it in the form of an air current.

With his initial practise out of the way he began building up chakra to use again. Once his chakra had been built up he went through the handseals of the jutsu and held his hand out, gathering his chakra to it. As he began gathering his chakra to his hand he started focusing on the chakra he was using, trying to refine the quality of chakra as he applied the wind nature change to it. He would also focus on as much as he could on adding more and more chakra to his palm before pushing his hand forward and releasing his chakra in a blast of wind.

The blast of wind seemed to be a little stronger than before so he decided to continue on with what he was trying out. As be built his chakra up he thought about how he could best refine his chakra. He came up with a bit on an idea and refocused on building up his chakra, doing so quickly. Once his chakra was ready he formed the handseals with ease and began the first part of his plan. First he would gather all the chakra he could to his hand, trying to refine the quality of it while also building up more and more of it to his hand. The second and final part of his plan would be spending added time on refining his chakra into fine points to add the wind chakra nature change to it. With that he would then thrust his arm forward and release his built up chakra, producing a decently powered gust of wind.

With his plan seemingly having some effect on the power of the jutsu he would begin building up his chakra again to test his method once more. With his chakra built up he formed the handseals and began concentrating his chakra to his hand once more, forcing as much into his hand as he could. Once his chakra was concentrated to his hand he began refining it into finer points to apply the nature change to it. He spent extra time on both these things, adding more and more chakra to his hand and continuing to refine it all the time. Once he was ready he did as before, pushing his arm forth and releasing his chakra forward in a burst of air.

The bursts of air seemed to be getting stronger and he knew it, or at least he thought he did anyway. He at least knew that the method he was using was working to some degree which is why he continued on with working on it, building his chakra up to do so. Once his chakra as ready he did as before, concentrating a lot of chakra to his hand and once he had concentrated said chakra to his hand he began refining it. He refined his chakra into fine edges, sharpening it. Once the chakra in his hand was prepared he did as usual, thrusting his hand forward and releasing his built up chakra to produce the powerful blast of wind.

Practising the jutsu so much and refining his use of it was bringing the chakra toll down but it was still taking a large bit out of him to practise like this. Still, he could keep going with relative ease. He began building his chakra up, thinking about making this his last practise as he did. Once his chakra was prepared he held his hand out and gathered his chakra there, continuing to amass more and more to his hand in an attempt to power up the jutsu to the best of his ability. He would then beging to refine this large portion of chakra into finer edges. With the chakra in his hand fully prepared after taking his time with it he pushed his hand forward and release the built up chakra, firing off a large burst of wind.* - Fri Oct 16 20:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) came back to the training field after a short rest and got started again. He felt like he had the method he was using down by now, all he needed to do was keep refining his use of his chakra so that none of it was going to waste and all of it was of a high quality and standard. With that he began his preliminary practise of great breakthrough, start by of course building up his chakra. Once his chakra was built up he then went through the handseals of the jutsu and held a hand out, gathering a lot of chakra to it. Once he had gathered his chakra up he began refining it down to fine edges and with that, thrust his arm forward and release his chakra, pushing forth a burst of air with it.

Once he got his usual first practise in he got into his training groove, building up his chakra quickly for his second practise. He focused on his chakra as he built it up and once ready, formed the handseals required for the jutsu with ease. Once the handseals were done he continued to focus on his chakra as he poured it all to his hand, making sure to refine and concentrate it so that the quality of the chakra was as good as he could get it. Once the chakra was at his hand he began sharpening his chakra over itself, pushing it down into as fine a point as he could get it. He then release the chakra into a burst of air like normal, the jutsu getting stronger and stronger with each practise.

He was more than happy to keep progressing on because of the progress he was making, he was always happy to see how well he was progressing from start to finish, it's what helped drive him to go through all this training. With that in mind he would continue to build up chakra and once he had built up enough he pulled each hand up and went through the handseals of the jutsu as quick as ever. With the handseals completed he held a hand out and began amassing his chakra to it, keeping his concentrating on his chakra to try and make sure none was being wasted or lost. With that he then refined the chakra down into fine edges and release it in a burst of wind once more.

Wasting no time in taking a breather he just got right down to building his chakra up again, keeping his hands at the ready to form handseals. Once his chakra was ready he would then go through each handseal, just like he had done many a time before. With the handseals done he would once again start focusing his chakra to his hand, making sure to refine and focus all he could so that nothing was being wasted. He would then continue on to grind his chakra over itself, sharpening it to apply the wind nature change. With the nature change added he was now ready to perform the jutsu, holding his hand out and thrusting it forward, releasing his chakra with it and again causing a burst of wind to extend from his hand.

At this point he was starting to feel tired now, though he had rested from his previous session of practising this it was only a short rest and he barely ate, he was now feeling the effects of not resting enough. Even so he had a goal to acheive, one he was close to achieving. He built his chakra up as quickly as he could and went through the handseals the same way, wanting to get this done with as soon as possible. He would then gather his chakra to his hand as fast as he could without losing out on the quality and precision of his chakra. He would then apply the wind nature change to his chakra, sharpening it. With his chakra fully prepared he then pushed his hand forth and release it, a large and powerful burst of wind exiting his hand.

He was now really starting to feel fatigued but he pushed on for one more practise, training was about pushing yourself. Once more he would build his chakra up, doing so as quickly as he could in his fatigued and tired state. He would then form the handseals and push as much chakra as he could to his hand, making sure to refine it as much as possible to get the best out of his chakra. With his chakra now in his hand he focused on it and began sharpening it to add the wind nature type and once that he was done, it was time to use the jutsu. He concentrated as hard as he could on his chakra as he thrust his arm forward and pushed his chakra out as much as he could, releasing the biggest burst of wind he had done yet. With this achievement also came a price, he dropped to one knee and couldn't move for a while, his fatigue now more present than ever. He took in some heavy breaths and finally rose to his feet, turning around and walking off to rest a long while.* - Fri Oct 16 21:43:28 2015

He stayed standing for a few seconds but decided to sit down, looking visibly tired as well as breathing slightly heavily. He layed his back and head against the fence, looking up at the sky as he just generally tried to rest his body.* - Fri Oct 16 21:48:35 2015
