<br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) looks back as the voice of Nori hit his ears, he would shake his head. "No, I haven't." he would reply to her quickly before turning back around, he had felt a little awkward around Nori ever since their last conversation but he wasn't sure why. The architect would reply with a long-ish explanation of how he had been to many places to work in, this would probably be one of his many visits to the land of rice. Takeda would go back to his own thoughts, he had a lot to think about these days and not a lot of time to decide on things, especially with the Hokage being so distant all the time. In any case they would be making slow but decent progress towards their trip to the land of rice, the village now probably no longer in sight.* - Thu Nov  5 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) whispers:  [ are they just going to sit and watch us..? ] - Thu Nov  5 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) still wasn't too worried, even as they got further and further from Konoha. He had been on a B - ranked mission before and eventhing went smoothly so to him, he didn't see much reason to be too afraid. He turned to look back every once in a while to make sure both the architect and Nori were ok. He wanted to say something but he just couldn't find the words, due to both his recent awkwardness around Nori and the lack of a subject. He would notice that Nori looked tense and decided to speak up on it. "You ok back there Nori?" he would comment, still keeping his eyes on the path. By now they were probably making their way to the end of the forest.* - Thu Nov  5 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) turned around at her response, she still didn't strike him as very confident in herself. "Don't worry Nori, this mission will go without a hitch, it has the two most capable genin in our village on it afterall." he would say to her with a small smile, though he would also look at the architect as he said this to both impress and reassure him. He would then turn back just as they emerged from the forest and hit a crossroad, sign displayed just at the end of it. He would halt the party for a few seconds as he tried to figure out which way they needed to turn. "This way." he would say, turning back to see a reassuring nod from the architect to show they were going the right way. He would then begin walking off, getting their small party into motion once more.* - Thu Nov  5 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) shook his head as he kept his eyes on road before them, they were quite a ways away from the village now and while they were out of the forest and into a more flatlands like area, they were more prone to attack out here. "We've still got a little ways to go yet Nori. The land of rice is quite a ways away from here." he would reply back. He looked back and noticed the architect was looking a little worn out, they would probably need to stop in a little while. The silence of everyone was making him a little uncomfortable though. "So uh...Nori. How is your medical stuff going?" he would ask, both to take her mind off of the mission a little and to just make general conversation.* - Thu Nov  5 04:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) kept his head turned, looking at Nori as she gave her explanation on how things were going for her medical career. He was quite impressed, things seemed to be rogressing quickly for her. A few minutes after she had finished talking he came to an abrupt stop, turning around to face both Nori and the architect. "Alright, let's rest up her for a few minutes, we've got some time to kill we've been making good progress." He would say, going to sit down in the shade of a tree for a little while. He motioned Nori to come sit by him, he wasn't sure if it was the right move or not but he guessed he should at least attempt to break the awkwardness. Should she have sat by him he would attempt to speak once more, "Sorry if i've been a little quiet...i've just got a lot on my mind." other wise he would keep silent should she not sit down.* - Thu Nov  5 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) nodded his head in response, "Yeah...and a lot of other stuff too. But nows not the time for all that really." he would reply with, leaning back to rest his head against the bark of the tree. After a short but appreciated rest he would stand up, motioning the others to get up too. "Come on, not too far now, we're nearly at our destination." he would say as he shook his arms and legs off a little to prevent them from going to sleep. He would start walking off, going to retain his place at the front of the group. After they had continued to walk a while they would probably come across a few traders, showing signs they were near the intended village in the land of rice. He would stop again, turning to look around himself, then at Nori. "How about we switch places for a while, you take the front for the last little haul." he said, walking back to switch places. He was mostly doing this to help boost her confidence.* - Thu Nov  5 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) whispers: [ once we've each done 8 RPs lets just get a caravan back ] - Thu Nov  5 05:47:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) whispers: [ you know, eight paragraphs. we've each done  seven after your next RP. Then on the 8th RP we'll arrive at the destination and get a caravan back ] - Thu Nov  5 05:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) whispers: [ sound good? I just can't be bothered to do 8 more RPs about walking back lol ] - Thu Nov  5 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) whispers: (i was getting a bit annoyed doing them lol so yeah, i don't mind) - Thu Nov  5 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) whispers: (Also i have 7 already. so this will be my eighth one) - Thu Nov  5 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) whispers: [ missions are so boring sometimes :/ ] - Thu Nov  5 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) whispers:  [ Ah, ok. well anyway we'll jsut get a caravan next RP round ] - Thu Nov  5 05:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) took his time at the back of the group to sort of zone out a little, focusing on things he needed to think about in all honesty. It took a few seconds for him to register what Nori had said to him. His eyes would pitch up to look at the small village in the land of rice. "Good work Nori, stay here a sec." he would say to her, taking the architect with him into the village. He went through all the formalities, thanking the man for his time and business to which the architect would do the same. As they parted he found a caravan service which relieved him somewhat. He payed for a caravan and motioned for Nori to join him on their trip back, "I got us a caravan back Nori, figured you didn't want to walk that distance all the way back."

The caravan would take them all the way back, dropping them at the gates of Konoha. "Welp, we're home again." he would say with a stretch, trying to limber his body up. "Want to go do anything now that we're back?" he would ask, feeling a little bad because of how distant he had been during the mission.* - Thu Nov  5 06:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) nodded his head, "It doesn't really matter if the village is empty, just means it's more peaceful." He would say as he placed each hand into his hoodie pocket. "Let's go get some ramen, I'm starving." he would say, turning and flicking his head to motion her to walk with him.* - Thu Nov  5 06:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) sat down, ordering the usual ramen dish he gets, beef ramen. He would let her make her own choice of food. "So..." he would say awkwardly, a little stumped for words.* - Thu Nov  5 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) puts an elbow on the serving table, using it to hold his head up as he rested it in his hand. He would slowly tap the table, using a finger from his free hand. "I don't know, things are a little weird right now. Just trying to make conversation I guess..."* - Thu Nov  5 06:42:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: So if I was you, I wouldn't worry about his claims. - Thu Nov  5 06:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Thats probably because Ziare is an ass. - Thu Nov  5 06:50:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) wasn't paying much attention until Shinjin started to act unlike his usual self. The wicked smile brought across his face gave Takeda a chill, rather like one he had all those days ago when he met that dreadful person. It was a tense moment for him, he wasn't quite sure what Shinjin was saying at this point, all he knew was something very serious was happening, maybe Takeda had gone a step too far in his words..? 

As Takeda tensed up he would see Shinjin raise a hand up, he was half expecting to get a punch or a slap by now. It wasn't until he started to peel his own face off that Takedas heart sank. The man he had met before, that terrible man...Edge...he had been playing him for a fool all along. As he said those final words to him, Takeda would start to crack inside as he knew he caused not only Shinjins downfall...but now potentially his own...

He would take a step back, both in shock, fear and confusion. "E-" was all he could let out, the seal place on his tongue doing it's job in protecting his identity. "Why...why me...why have you taken...such an interest in me..?"* - Fri Nov  6 04:45:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) was not about to let this man do what ever he wanted to him, not again. Even through his fear he would force his hands up and together as he went through a few hand seals. He would build up as much chakra as he could before inhaling and pushing his chakra up to his chest. He would then exhale and start expelling his chakra, letting loose the biggest flamethrower varient of the fireball technique he would muster. He would first aim it at edge, then at the building to try and start a mighty fire. He was fully aware that he couldn't take Edge on...though maybe he could take his terrible self and Edge with him in a blazing glory, like he should have done those many moons ago.* - Fri Nov  6 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) probably wouldn't have even got through the first hand seal when a weapon would pop out from one of the seals. Just like that his hands would be stabbed through and before he knew it, he was being taken off his feet by a heavy kick to the chest. Just as Edge wanted it would send him flying up and through the air, having him land and skid across the ground. Takeda couldn't quite believe how outclassed he was, he thought that maybe, just maybe he could do one last thing.

Even so, he had to keep fighting, he at least had to do something...anything. He would hold a bloodied hand out as he tried to rise for his feet, grasping for breath. A small ember would appear at the centre of one of his bloodied hands. He would then attempt the throw and manipulate the ember towards Edge, aiming it as best he could towards a leg of his. Upon contact it would explode into a fiery explosion...that's if it hit.* - Fri Nov  6 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) brings his other hand up, showing another ember in the centre of it. As he pushed his hand forward to fire off another fireball towards Edge, his whole body would feel the sting of a senbon being shot into him. He would let out an audible moan from the pain but dispite that, he hand to keep going. He would continue to thrust his other bloodied hand forward, firing off another exploding shot towards Edge. Now he would start to jump back, a hand holding the area struck as Edge fired a Senbon into it.* - Fri Nov  6 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) was shot straight in the kneecap, effectively ending his run as he feel onto the cold floor. Still he would continue to try and crawl as fast as he could to move just a little more, all he needed was a little more. This had been his plan all along, ever since the kick sent him flying. He would turn his body to lay on his back, holding up both his hands and sparking embers in the both of them. Provided he be able to, he would fire both exploding shot off into the ceiling of where the corridor starts, his aim would be to make the ceiling cave into stop Edges advance towards him...* - Fri Nov  6 05:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) gets grabs by chains, pulling him into a mysterious object. He would close his eyes and try to wriggle free of the chain, only to open them again and find himself not where he previously was. <Am I...dead..?> he would think to himself. It wasn't till a few seconds later that he would still feel the shackles that bound him fiercely, his gaze would probably rest of Edge after a few moments. "What the fuck is this!" he shouted over to him, trying to pull and tear himself free as best he could.* - Fri Nov  6 05:30:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) felt a spike enter his face, his jew probably going limp and falling open, leaving his mouth agape. He would let out a loud, childish scream of pain as Edge began his evil execution of the young Takeda. As he screamed his voice would start to turn into an emotional mess, mixing between everything he was feeling right now into just a loud audible scream. Takedas head would be screaming, he couldn't believe this is how he would go out, being tortured to death in a sick chamber as he screamed and cried out from pain.* - Fri Nov  6 05:42:11 2015
