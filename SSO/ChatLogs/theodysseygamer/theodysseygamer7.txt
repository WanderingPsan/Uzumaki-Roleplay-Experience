<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) watched as Lera took her tanto out of it's sheath, the blade suddenly bursting into flames. "That was quiet impressive..." He would say. He then listened to her explanation of how it worked before taking his own tanto out of it's sheath. He held it in reverse, the blade facing towards him. He held it up infront of himself and began building up chakra. Once he was ready he tried to push his chakra through his hand and into the tanto...not having any effect on it.

"Damn...Hm...Extension of my arm." he would think as he began building up chakra once more. He held the blade up infront of himself, concentration on it and his chakra. He then pushed his chakra through his arm, imagining the blade was merely a longer part of his fore arm or something similar. Some of his chakra would pass through, heating the blade but nothing would be visual. With a sigh he stopped and decided to try again.

Holding up the blade once more he focused himself on his building up his chakra and only is chakra, just imagining the blade was simply his arm.When he was ready he began feeding his chakra through his arm and naturely, down the blade. He opened his eyes when the blade burst to life with very small fires on it popping up occasional. "Huh, I did it...Thanks Lera...You really are great." he'd say, sounding quite sincere in his words. He would then cut the chakra flow to his sword, leaving it in his hand to cool down for a bit before placing it back in it' Sheath.* - Sat Sep 19 03:02:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) stepped onto the water and walked about half the distance to the waterfall, stnding and facing it. He would be back here to finish up with his training for Phoenix flower jutsu. When he first learned the jutsu he read that you could control the trajectory of the shots you fired with your chakra, he would be testing that today. immediately he built his chakra up and formed the handseals for the jutsu. Once he inhaled and exhaled he shot forth a volley fireballs, trying to add spin or direction to them as he fired each individual once. The result was...quite messy...fireballs spinning off everywhere.

It seemed this would take some practise, but he had time afterall. Once again he would place his hands together and begin building up chakra. When he was ready he formed the handseals and concentrated on trying to atleast hit the waterfall each time. Once he fired off the volley off fireballs he watched each one hit a different location, some hitting the waterfall, some hitting the rock and some flying off into the sky, dissipating.

He guessed the fireballs seemed a little more controled, but they were still quite inaccurate and weren't really under his control. He would start building his chakra up to try this method one more time to test something. Once he was done he quickly formed each handseal for the jutsu and aimed for the water, firing off multiple fireballs as he exhaled and tried to direct them, each fireball spinning off into a different direction again.

It seemed his theory was correct, he could indeed control the direction of each fireball but he would need to be incredibly precise with his chakra, adding direction to it at the moment of exit from his body. With this in mind he built chakra up and formed the handseals the jutsu needed. Once again he aimed to hit the waterfall as he unleashed a volley of fireballs at it, the fireballs seemingly being a little more directed but still quite wild.

Happy with the progress he was making he began building up his chakra quickly, wanting to keep practising this as much as possible. He quickly formed each handseal which he easily had memorized now and aimed himself and his focus at the waterfall. He spat forth a massive volley of fireballs, each hitting either the waterfall or the rocks surrounding it, he was getting better. Just as he was about to practise again, he heard someone approach from the south...* - Sat Sep 19 10:43:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Your path is unknown until you form a logical goal. - Sat Sep 19 11:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: A path is nothing more than a trail to said goal. - Sat Sep 19 11:35:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: That is my problem right now I suppose, I do not see a way forward. - Sat Sep 19 11:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Then allow your eyes to open. - Sat Sep 19 11:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I try but all I have is tunnel vision. - Sat Sep 19 11:39:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Tunnel vision is preventing you from examining alternatives. - Sat Sep 19 11:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Zetsumo's death is a stepping stone, not a goal. - Sat Sep 19 11:43:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: But you must understand that I have to do this. - Sat Sep 19 11:45:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Hatred and revenge will be a downfall. Not for your life, but your sanity. If you use hatred as your blade and revenge as your shield, then you'll enter a battle of false serenity. - Sat Sep 19 11:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: It's why I don't plan on living. - Sat Sep 19 11:48:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Then death is your broad goal. - Sat Sep 19 11:48:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: My alliance is not with Kirigakure, but Baen and yourself. - Sat Sep 19 12:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Your village, Kirigakaure, is of no importance to me; fore I have seen and heard the logic you Mist Shinobi have. In all honesty, your people are stupid. - Sat Sep 19 12:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm, Strange times. - Sat Sep 19 12:18:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Is it a common thing for them to break under high stress.? - Sat Sep 19 12:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: It's more to do with the fact we have a lack of leadership. - Sat Sep 19 12:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Is there no one other than Koeki that is willing? - Sat Sep 19 12:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Well Hassan was supposed to take charge but Tethys said he wanted Koeki to be Mizukage in his will. - Sat Sep 19 12:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Hassan also has no interest in being the Mizukage. - Sat Sep 19 12:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: And you trust Koeki when it comes to her position? - Sat Sep 19 12:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I'm not sure. - Sat Sep 19 12:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Koeki and me aren't always the most friendly to eachother. - Sat Sep 19 12:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: And I don't see her as a leader honestly. - Sat Sep 19 12:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: But then again, I hope she doesn't pass the title down. - Sat Sep 19 12:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Since the third in line for Kage...well this village will suffer. - Sat Sep 19 12:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Does this mean you don't agree what Tethys placed in his will for her..? - Sat Sep 19 12:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: When it comes to her position as Mizukage? - Sat Sep 19 12:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Not totally no. - Sat Sep 19 12:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: But then again, there is no one else that could fulfill that position - Sat Sep 19 12:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Then you deem it a necessary evil..? - Sat Sep 19 12:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Indeed. - Sat Sep 19 12:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Do you consider her your true Mizukage then..? - Sat Sep 19 12:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: For now, But she is only temprorary after all. - Sat Sep 19 12:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: The real Mizukage is just too sick to fulfill her role at the moment. - Sat Sep 19 12:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Still, I hope Koeki doesn't die. - Sat Sep 19 12:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Or at least names her own successor before she does. - Sat Sep 19 12:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Because if you don't know, I'm next in line. - Sat Sep 19 12:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: And...I couldn't fulfill that role. - Sat Sep 19 12:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: If you are truly next in line to uphold that position, then you must allow your mind to reopen and accept the fact that your safe haven, Tethys, is no longer here. You, and only you, can be your safe haven from this point on. - Sat Sep 19 12:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: It's why i'm training so much. - Sat Sep 19 12:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: As I said before, so many things could change for me right now. - Sat Sep 19 12:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: It's difficult to know what direction i'm going in. - Sat Sep 19 12:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: So I guess i'm just training myself to be ready for what is to come, whatever it may be. - Sat Sep 19 12:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You're on a path, right? Despite you not knowing the broad goal, you acknowledge that you are on a path..? - Sat Sep 19 12:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I am on a path, As is everyone. - Sat Sep 19 12:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I guess in a way, my goal would be to find where this path leads. - Sat Sep 19 12:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Because right now I don't know. - Sat Sep 19 12:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: While you're on that path, at some points in your life you must stop walking, examine the situation at hand, learn from it and continue pacing forth. - Sat Sep 19 12:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I am trying. - Sat Sep 19 12:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: But every time I try, I just think of Zetsumo. - Sat Sep 19 12:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You're using your stepping stone, killing Zetsumo, is the wrong way. View him as just that, a stepping stone that's merely a little elevated than the rest. - Sat Sep 19 13:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: So you have to put in more efforts to pass over said stone. - Sat Sep 19 13:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I suppose you're right on that. - Sat Sep 19 13:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: But I just hurt inside, a hurt Zetsumo caused and I can't get rid of it. - Sat Sep 19 13:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I don't know what else to do but get revenge. - Sat Sep 19 13:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: There is an easy fix to that. - Sat Sep 19 13:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Simply let go. - Sat Sep 19 13:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Progress not your body right now, but your mind. - Sat Sep 19 13:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Center it with your soul and you'll be able to return to your original self. - Sat Sep 19 13:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Fore it's your original self that must fight Zetsumo, not this lost and injured animal that you are now. - Sat Sep 19 13:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: That's what people keep telling me...But I don't know if I can go back... - Sat Sep 19 13:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: To progress forward, you must be able to acknowledge what happened in the past. - Sat Sep 19 13:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: For it's the past that began molding your understanding of the future. - Sat Sep 19 13:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: That's hard to do when your best and only friend died though. - Sat Sep 19 13:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Tethys was more than just that to me, he was almost like a father. - Sat Sep 19 13:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Ask yourself this: what would your friend want you to do? - Sat Sep 19 13:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Mourn his death or use it as a sanctum of progression to your mind and body? - Sat Sep 19 13:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: He would probably tell me to let go. - Sat Sep 19 13:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Do you second guess his words? - Sat Sep 19 13:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I know what I need to do...But I just can't. - Sat Sep 19 13:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: In one way I feel like if I let go I will be fulfilling Tethys wishes. - Sat Sep 19 13:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Only you can truly determine your fate. Tethys walked you down your path for majority of the trail, it's just time you take off the training wheels and advance on. - Sat Sep 19 13:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Let go not of your memories, but the feeling that you are lost and uncertain. - Sat Sep 19 13:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Fore it's those two enemies you face. It's those two enemies that downplay your sword of Dreams and shield of Goals. - Sat Sep 19 13:11:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) could finally get back to training fter talking with Erebus, while he did hate being disturbed while he was training, Erebus gave him a lot to think about.
He got his mind back on track however, clicking back into training mode. Now that he had the basics for controling the direction of the fireballs all that was left was refinement and mastery. He started by building up chakra like usual. He formed each handseal quickly and focused on the waterfall as he unleashed a volley of fireballs towards it. Over half of what he released hit the waterfall itself, the others strayed off into the wall.

He felt like he was making progress, understanding everything he needed to refine now. Once again he built up chakra and formed the quickly memorized handseals. He focused on the waterfall and started firing fireballs at it. He maintained concentration on his chakra control, curving each fireball he shot out in the way he desired. This time around three quarters of the shots he fired hit the waterfall like he intended.

Once more he qould quickly build up chakra, wasting no time by resting or giving himself a breather, he was making good progress and he knew it. When he was ready he quickly formed the handseals needed for the jutsu and started firing off fireball after fireball, using his chakra control to curve, spin and direct each fireball how he liked. This time most of his fireballs hit the waterfall, besides a few stray shots. He stood back and took a quick breather, he knew that he mostly had the jutsu down and there wasn't much more he could practise, time to move onto another jutsu.* - Sat Sep 19 15:00:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) turns and walks by Baen, going off in a direction to the north.* - Sat Sep 19 15:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) made his way up the waterfall, finding a nice spot to sit down and meditate in, he just needed a calm place to think for a while, he did have a lot to process afterall. His chat with Erebus made him realize that there really was a bigger picture, a future ahead of him. While he still desperately wanted to kill Zetsumo...maybe that wasn't the be all and end all...or was it? He still didn't know how he could progress after all this, even if he did survive...what would be the point of it all?

Currently he knew that he didn't have much going for him in life, The only person to ever show affection to him, Noriko, had been out of sight for weeks now. The only friend and pretty much father figure he had was now dead, everyone in the village is passive-aggressive towards him, he hurt inside and to top it all off...he has no motivation or direction in life which is why he was planning to die fighting Zetsumo...but did he really want that? Was that all there was for him or was there more than he could see at this point in time.

He remembered what Lera said, what she told him up here a few days ago. He opened his eyes and looked all around at the village, his village. It was quite marvelous up here, even when heavily fortified. This was his home and he didn't want that to change...but what could he do under such terrible circumstances? He needed to kill Zetsumo...that much was clear to him, but he didn't know how.

His next problem was the fact that he literally had no friends or allies in the village or out of the village, everyone was so passive-aggressive towards him and he didn't know why. One moment they are begging him to stay because he's such a valued member and the next he's getting beaten down for contributing. He couldn't understand what he was doing wrong, or why he was doing it wrong but clearly he was doing something wrong.

Tethys dying by Zetsumos hand also didn't help, it felt like he had half of himself torn out when Tethys died, a huge void that he was struggling to fill with any emotion or happiness. The only thing that took his mind off all that was training...but he couldn't train forever. He simply didn't know what to do with himself at this point in time, what was the next steo forward and why would he take it?

He then closed his eyes and began thinking of the past again, back to when Tethys will had been read out. He thought back to what Tethys had left him, a little joke telling him to lighten up, it still made him chuckle a little. He realised that the joke wasn't just a joke, more of a message to him saying 'Hey, Himura. Even when we're in war, things aren't so bad, learn to smile.' As he thought this something clicked in his head, like cogs setting in motion, sending him back deeper through his memories.

He remembered when he gave his entire bank account to Tethys, all because he wanted to help the village, he realised that now. Before he gave it to Tethys simply because he wanted to help him since Tethys was pretty much everything he wanted to help...or was it? He realised deep down that he donated that money so that someone else who needed it could have it, not to live up to some kind of legacy Tethys left or to provide him with more help.

His mind then wandered back to the Chuunin exams, when Noriko brought him into her childs room when he found out she was seven seperate people. She proceeded to tell him everything about who and what she was, telling him more than Tethys even knew. He didn't realise up until now why she had done such a thing, why she hugged him. She saw something in him, something worth looking after and trusting, something that others have failed to see his entire life because of the way he shuns people and inturn, they shun him.

He then remembered back to when Tethys and Noriko first called him into the Mizukage office, he saw Noriko sitting on Tethys lap, looking like a real family. They asked him what he wanted out of life and he responded with reaching the rank of Jounin and becoming feared across the Shinobi world...something he still wanted to achieve deep down inside. Even if it meant becoming Gezo he would become a Chuunin, even if it meant fighting everyone he would become feared...because it's what he wanted to do.

His memories would then spring back to Tethys death and Zetsumo and he would feel that pain again, the lust to fight and kill Zetsumo. He hated Zetsumo so much he doubt he could speak or write words to descrive the fury that he held towards Zetsumo. He is evil, his men are evil, his ways are evil and whatever end goal he has is evil...yet was it really? If theres one thing he knew in life it's that there is no concept of good or evil, only peoples best intentions. What was good for one, is evil for another.

So could he really blame Zetsumo for killing Tethys? He could hate him for it, kill him for it, curse him for it...but could he blame him? Tethys was a strong individual that could have killed Zetsumo so it's only logical to end him...even if it did hurt to think such a thought. All this time he had been thinking about how Zetsumo did this for personal reasons...but in the end it's just simply war. In that split second after thinking that train of thought he had realised something, he had forgiven Zetsumo...For Tethys death was not out of spite.

Thinking on things he realised what an idiot he was being up until now, he really was being a disappointment and failure to those that had got him this far. They didn't do it out of pity or because he was weak...they did it because they saw he was strong but needed help getting there...they did it out of kindness...because it was the right thing to do. He slumped his head down and rubbing his face with his hands, now realising what a stubborn idiot he was being to everyone.

One last thing crossed his mind, where he would go from here. Even if he had accepted Tethys death as just a part of war, he still wanted to kill Zetsumo with everything he had...but now he wanted something more than that, something more out of life. He wanted to leave a legacy behind after he died, not just a legacy of him sacrificing his life to kill Zetsumo...He wanted to be remembered as the one that killed Zetsumo and went on to beat even stronger people, achieving even greater things and being a really fearful but respectable person...that was his goal in life.

With those thoughts now passing through his mind he opened his eyes once again and stood up, walking to the edge of the cliff to over-look his village once more. There was a lot of work to be done, a lot of preperation to be made and not a lot of time to do it in but something inside him told him they could do it. He jumped down onto the water below, walking off towards the courtyard moments later. He still hurt inside, he would do for a long time...but somehow that wound was feeling a lot smaller and a lot less painful.* - Sat Sep 19 16:57:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: These threads are used to control the masks? - Sat Sep 19 18:06:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Or are they meant to be kept secret? - Sat Sep 19 18:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Had he gotten caught in his genjutsu and his focus dispersed, would the masked be rendered useless? - Sat Sep 19 18:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: That's the theory Tethys came up with, Koeki. - Sat Sep 19 18:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: The contents were a variety of Tethys' techniques. - Sat Sep 19 18:09:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Niza... were there any about how to wield swords, or sword related information? - Sat Sep 19 18:10:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I guess not, Koeki. - Sat Sep 19 18:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: When I remember seeing him, I don't recall any threads being used to control them. This is somehing different than puppetry, I believe. - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: These threads..yo- of course. - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Sending a squad to do that would be suicide. - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: If they were just normal threads then they would be no problem.  - Sat Sep 19 18:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) thinks: These threads, perhaps are composed of chakra. I know of only one style that could counter those effectively.  - Sat Sep 19 18:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: But yeah, the masks' bodies seem to be composed of these threads. - Sat Sep 19 18:12:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I asked Tethys on that too. - Sat Sep 19 18:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Zetsumo was able to operate them, and still fight himself, from high in the air. - Sat Sep 19 18:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: He infromed me the threads were easily cut but blade edge. - Sat Sep 19 18:13:45 2015
