Quickly he formed a set of handseals as he built his chakra up. Once he was ready he took in a deep breath and pivoted his upper body forward, exhaling. As he exhaled a large fireball would grow infront of him before being shot off towards Erebus.

As the fireball would travel one would notice it would be getting quite low to the ground. Himura had aiming the fireball at the lower-half of Erebus, specifically aiming to try and burn away the insignia he was drawing and potentially burn his legs too...though since he fought him before, he didn't have much hope of burning Erebus himself.* - Tue Sep 22 13:53:55 2015
