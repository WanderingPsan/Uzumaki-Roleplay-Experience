<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) Came to the training field to begin training one more, now that he had mastered great breakthrough it was time to start mastering the fire techniques Izanami had taught him. He would start with his favourite, Exploding Flame Shot. He enjoyed the technique because of how versatile and quick it was, not even needing hand seals. He would simply build his chakra up and heat it to apply the katon chakra nature change, then send his chakra down to his hand, focusing it to his palm. He would then flick his hand and release the chakra in the form of a tiny fireball, having it travel for a bit before exploding, marking the completion of his preliminary practise.

The first thing he would work on would of course be the refinement of the jutsu, he had to get that down first before he focused on anything else. He remembered how Izanami's flame looked like a spark, rather than a tiny fireball. He would begin building up chakra again to begin his real training, heating the chakra as he did to apply the katon nature change. Once his chakra had been prepared he would send it down to his hand, trying his best to focus it all into the centre of his palm. He would then flick his arm and release the chakra, sending off another tiny fireball that would explode after a few seconds.

He began moulding up chakra again, trying to pick up the pace at which he was doing so to get through this quicker. As he was moulding up his chakra he would have been heating it to as hot as he could get it, applying the chakra nature change to it that elemental jutsu need. With his chakra ready he would feed it down an arm, focusing it into his palm as best he could to concentrate it. He would then make a fist with that hand as he continued focusing all his chakra into the centre of his palm. He would then flick his arm forward, opening his hand and releasing his chakra from the centre of his hand into another tiny fireball, it would again explode after traveling a few feet from him.

He was starting to get the hand of this as he continued to practise it, though this would only be the first small part of refining the technique. Still, he would begin building up chakra to perform the jutsu, he liked this technique, no hand seals needed was a great thing in battle. Once his chakra had been prepared he would then heat it to the best of his ability, applying the nature change to it. He would then send his chakra down to his hand and focus it to his palm, trying to condense it down to the centre of his hand. He would then make a fist and flick his arm forward, opening his fist and releasing his chakra as a tiny fireball, exploding after a few seconds.

The tiny fireball or 'shot' seemed to be becoming a little more concentrated and stable as he focused his chakra with each practise. He would start moulding up chakra as he thought about how he could try and refine this better. He would begin heating his chakra as he figured he would just need continue practising. Once his chakra had been properly prepared he would hold his hand out and focus his chakra to the centre of his palm as best he could. Balling his hand into a fist he would then flick his arm forward and open his hand, releasing his chakra just as before, a tiny fireball leaving his hand and exploding after traveling a few feet.

Another thing he noticed with this technique was the fact that he was barely getting fatigued with it, he was starting to like using this more and more which only helped him continue training. He would have been building his chakra up for the sixth time, heating it as he did to save time and mould the chakra up better overall. Once his chakra was ready for use he would then guide it down his arm and into his hand, focusing on condensing it all to the centre of his palm. He remained as focused as he could on it as he made a fist with that hand, pulling his arm back slightly before flicking it forward and releasing his chakra as he opened his hand, sending off another tiny fireball that would again explode after traveling for a bit.* - Sat Oct 31 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) Took a rest for a little while before getting back to training, remembering he was working on refining the technique he refocused on his chakra, building it up and heating it as quickly as he could. He would then send his chakra down his arm, focusing it to the centre of his palm as best he could. He would close his hand into a fist and pull it back a bit as he continued to concentrate on the chakra. He would then flick his arm forward, opening his fist and releasing his chakra. He would send off a tiny fireball that would travel for a few feet before exploding into a fiery blaze. He wouldn't straighten up and form the seal of confrontation to help focus his chakra as he thought about the technique.

After spending a little time thinking about the jutsu and how he could better refine it he would come to the conclusion that to further refine his use, he would need to condense the projectile into a small ember or spark, rather than a tiny fireball. With this in mind he would refocus on building up his chakra, heating it as he did to apply the chakra nature change. He would then hold a hand out as he focused his chakra down to it, concentrating it to the centre of his palm. He would try his best to condense the chakra as much as possible before making his hand into a fist and then flicking his arm forward, releasing his balled hand and with it, his chakra in the form of a small, fireball like projectile that exploded after a few seconds.

He didn't notice much difference, but he would continue on regardless as practise makes perfect. He continued to hold up the seal of confrontation, helping him focus his chakra easier. He was building up his chakra much quicker than when he started out so he was getting through this quickly by now. As always he would heat his chakra in his body as he built it up to apply the chakra nature change. He would then start pushing his chakra down to his hand, focusing it to the centre of his palm and condensing it as much as possible. He would then flick his arm forward, releasing his chakra as he did in the form of a tiny fireball…though the size of the fireball would be shrinking with each practise it seemed.

When the projectile exploded he would form the confrontation seal again to focus his chakra, building it up as fast as he could as he continued on. He would keep his concentration on his chakra as he moulded it up, heating it at the same time. Once his chakra was prepared he would focus it to his hand and then concentrate it to the middle of his palm. He would focus all his efforts on condensing as much as he possibly could, trying to cut back on the chakra consumption while refining his mastery over the jutsu. He would then make a fist, pull his arm back slightly and flick it forward, releasing his chakra as he did in the form of a projectile tiny fireball. It would explode after travelling a few feet.

He spent no time reforming his stance, keeping stood straight as he formed the seal of confrontation once more, it helped him focus both his chakra and his mind in some odd way. He would continually mould up his chakra as he heated it to apply the change in chakra nature. When his chakra was adequate enough to perform the technique with he would focus it down his arm and into his hand, concentrating it into the centre of his palm. He would ball his hand into a fist as he continued to try and condense the chakra in his hand to continue refining his use of the technique. Once he flicked his arm and released his chakra he would notice that finally the projectile he was looking like a spark or an ember, rather than a fireball.

He would straighten up once more, making the confrontation hand seal with his hand to help focus his chakra. He would concentrate on moulding up his chakra and heating it within his body so that the change in chakra nature was being applied. Once his chakra was fully prepared he would then send it down to his hand, focusing it to the centre of his palm. He would then try his hardest to condense the chakra down into a small ember within his hand, flicking his arm forward and releasing his chakra as he did, releasing the ember.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) Stopped training his jutsu for a bit, holding up the seal of confrontation to help him focus his chakra as he stood and thought for a bit. He had recently been thinking of a rather revolutionary idea, in his mind at least. He thought about how some jutsu worked well off each other, like wind and fire or water and lightning. What if he could take that further though? What if he could do a combination jutsu at the same time? He sat and thought about that idea and supposed that to successfully pull off a combination jutsu, you need to get the chakra amount and the chakra control similar. He wondered that if by doing this when you mould up chakra, could you potentially execute a combination jutsu with one technique?

He knew he was most proficient with lightning and water, plus he was most familiar with combination jutsu from those two elements. He decided to give his budding idea a try, just to even see if such a thing were possible. He would focus on the chakra he had been moulding up all this time, wondering how he was going to do this. At first he would begin vibrating his chakra like one would to apply the lightning nature change. Once his chakra was vibrating he would then attempt to convert his chakra into water…while it seemed like a good idea all this did was simply change the nature of the chakra from lightning to water.

He shook his head and refocused, dissipating all the work he had built up previously. He would attempt to do the same as before again, this time moulding the chakra into water within his stomach. With the water prepared he would then concentrate on said water, focusing on the chakra within it to vibrate it to the best of his ability. All this did in return was churn his stomach, making him feel sick. He would continue on but eventually he would sick up a load of water from his stomach, feeling dizzy after he had done such. He let himself recover for a bit, sitting down to gather his thoughts and refocus his chakra. He would then stand back up, forming the seal of confrontation as he did to once again help focus his chakra. 

While he was sitting gathering his thoughts he thought of on idea, instead of trying to apply one chakra nature, then the other, why not split the chakra into two halves, one lightning and one water and then try and mould them together. He would start moulding up chakra to test such an idea out, first building his chakra up, then splitting it into two. He would focus on one half first, vibrating it to apply the lightning nature change. Then he would move to the second half, converting his chakra into a free flowing substance akin to water. He would then slowly try and integrate each half into each other, having a little success but eventually losing control and having it all cancel itself out.

His idea seemed to be sound though, so he would continue on, building more chakra up. Once enough chakra had been built up he would again spend time splitting his built up chakra in half. He would once again focus on vibrating one half first, then converting the other half into a free flowing water type substance. He would focus on both halves and like before, would slowly try and integrate the two together to combine both the chakra, and the nature changes. He would get a little further than before but ultimately it would prove too straining to keep up. He had learned a lot of valuable stuff today which he would practise in future, but for now he needed to focus on other stuff.* - Sun Nov  1 01:02:43 2015

Sure enough as he read on he would soon find out that the general idea of the technique was to condense the earth into four sharp spears that would sprout out from the ground, attempting to impale your opponent from four different directions, front, back, left and right. This made it so the technique is difficult to dodge and even if they did, it would leave them open to attack.

As he read on he would find out the jutsu did not need any hand seals, this seemed to be the norm for earth style jutsu. He read about the technique being a short to mid-range jutsu, meaning he would need to get close to use it. He supposed that if an enemy were to get close to him, he would be able to use this jutsu to either surprise them or ward them away so that the enemy couldn't follow up with his attack. He could already see the uses for this jutsu and he hadn't even finished the scroll yet.

Next he came across how to manipulate your chakra to form the spikes that would attempt to impale the enemy. The ground didn't necessarily have to be hard, it just needed to be dry and malleable. You would need to split your chakra off into four, each moving to a separate point in the ground. The points in the ground where your chakra lay would then become focal points for where you condense the ground into a harder form. From that point on it would simply be a matter of manipulating all four point to spike up diagonally, aiming to stab the opponent in all different directions.

He read about how you could condense the ground to make the spikes harder and there for, more likely to pierce the enemy and cause damage. Using your chakra as the focal point as explained before you would draw in more and more of the earth, compacting it and condensing it down onto itself. Once this reached an adequate level you would then use both your chakra and the energy built up from condensing the earth to spring the earth out of the ground, moulding it into a sharp point so it would impale whoever your target is. You would also need to bring more of the ground with the spike as it grew to stab into the enemy.

Lastly he would read about how he could manipulate the four spikes to move in any direction he wanted. They could either all be aimed at impaling and ripping apart the stomach or you could aim two at each leg to pin the opponent to the ground, or two at each arm to immobilise the movement of their arms and hands. He was surprised at how versatile you could make this honestly since it was made of earth, he couldn't wait to try some of this out for himself. He seemed to already love the technique without even properly practising it yet…though he would do that soon enough. He looked up as someone was speaking to him, ending his reading for now.* - Sun Nov  1 01:52:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) looks down as his eyes well up for a second, blinking a few times to clear his eyes of any tears. He didn't want to start crying infront of Nori. He would look back at her after a few seconds. "It's uh...I don't know...I don't know if I want to talk about it."* - Sun Nov  1 03:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hm. . Alright. But if you need anyone to talk to, just ask. Not gonna pry you for intel or anything. - Sun Nov  1 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) would also take a step closer to Nori, side stepping next to her. He would turn to rest his back and head against the wooden fence.

"I mean...I was just walking through the mansion and I found her...there was nothing I could do..."* - Sun Nov  1 03:47:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) pushes off from the fence, waiting for Nori before walking off.* - Sun Nov  1 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) takes a seat opposite of Nori, mostly so he could face her and talk to her easier. "Order what you want, I'll pay for everything...think of it as a little sorry gift." He would say, looking around for a waiter just after. "Think I might have some beef ramen..."* - Sun Nov  1 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) orders himself some beef ramen, as well as Nori her shrimp miso ramen. He frowns at what see says...before he takes it in, understanding he may be going too far and might be coming on a little strong, he had a lot on his mind recently and got caught up in the moment without realising it. He sighs and looks Nori in the eye. "Right...yeah sorry about that. I just um...I've got a lot on my mind and get a little caught up in things...sorry if i'm coming off a bit strong here." he would reply, truth in his words. He was just trying to be friendly is all, he didn't mean to potentially overwhelm.* - Sun Nov  1 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) looked around for a few seconds, a bit unsure on how to respond, he would even be tapping his leg under the table out of nervousness. Eventually his eyes would centre back to Nori, "Well...you're my friend Nori so I thought i'd treat you...I want to keep my friends close to me." He would reply, looking around to see if their food was being brought out.

He would turn his head back disappointed, he was actually quite hungry. "But enough of that...So uh...what do you do outside of being a Shinobi? You know, like when you're not doing missions and stuff." he would reply again, trying to change the conversation to a bit of a more light-hearted one.* - Sun Nov  1 04:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . . I've actually still been trying to do a mission. . Never did one yet. But aside from that and medical work? Not much, since when I get home, either it's a bit of training then sleep, or pass out. . - Sun Nov  1 05:06:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: I should go. - Sun Nov  1 19:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) Came to the training field to continue training his exploding flame shot jutsu. Last time he had managed to refine his execution of the technique, even increasing its power a little in the process. Now that he had the refinement down though, it was time to work on its explosive power. He would however start building up his chakra and heating it for his first practise that he usually did to 'limber himself up'. Once his chakra was ready he would then send it down his arm and into his hand, focusing it to the centre of his palm. As he condensed his chakra down a small ember would appear in his palm. He would make a fist and pull his arm back a bit, then flick it forward and open his hand as he released the ember forward. It would explode after traveling a few seconds.

While the explosive power was quite impressive, he knew that he could potentially increase the explosive force by applying more chakra and further condensing down the chakra. With that he would begin building up chakra again, heating it simultaneously. With his chakra prepared he would then it down his arm and concentrate it to the centre of his hand. He would push more and more chakra in, more than he usually would. It took a bit more time to condense and prepare but eventually an ember would appear in his palm, albeit a little bigger than usual because of how much chakra he used. He would then release the ember as he flicked his arm forward. The ember would become unstable as soon as released however, exploding within a second.

The explosion was impressive but unfortunately it was a little too close to him, knocking him off his feet and burning his hand and arm a bit. He gripped his hand in pain as he used his other hand to help him to his feet. He brushed himself off, noticing his clothes were burned and singed. He wouldn't let it get the best of him however, these things happen. Instead he would hold up the seal of confrontation to help him focus his chakra as he moulded it up and heated it. He would then send his chakra down his arm, focusing it to the centre of his uninjured hand. He pushed as much chakra as he could into this focal point, condensing it down as much as he could too. Another ember would appear in his palm and he would send it off again. It would travel a little further than the last but it would start to shake and eventually turn volatile, exploding prematurely.

He took the time to take out some bandages, wrapping his hand and arm up as best he could to keep the elements off of it. Once he was finished he would use his injured hand to hold up the seal of confrontation as he held his other hand out and moulded up his chakra. Once his chakra was ready he would focus it down to his hand, pushing more and more chakra to his palm. He would then start condensing it all into the centre of his palm, concentrating as much as he could on keeping it stable. as he applied more chakra. An ember would appear on his hand once more, this time the ember itself would look a little more stable than before. He would release it again, having it travel a few meters away from him. It would explode prematurely again but this time it made a lot of progress.

Still holding up the seal of confrontation to help him focus his chakra he would mould up more chakra to practise with again, making sure to heat it. Once his chakra had been properly prepared he would hold his other hand out and focus his chakra down his arm, pouring it into his hand. As he continues to channel chakra into his hand he would begin focusing it into the centre of his palm, forming a small ember in his palm as he did. He would take his time with condensing the chakra, making sure it was stable and under his control. Then he would flick his arm forward and release the ember, shooting it off. It would travel the correct distance this time and once it was far enough away, it would explode with considerable force. 

With a smirk he would refocus himself and begin building up his chakra once more, heating it as he moulded it up. He wanted to make sure that he had this completely down so he would prepare his chakra to practise it again. Once his chakra had been adequately prepared he would begin focusing it down his arm as he held a hand out again. As he did this he would condense said chakra to this middle of his palm, sparking an ember to life in his hand. Once more he would concentrate as much as he could on his chakra, making sure his chakra was as stable as he could make it. Once ready he would then release his chakra, flicking his arm forward and sending the projectile off. Again it would travel a certain distance from himself before exploding with force.* - Sun Nov  1 22:16:44 2015
