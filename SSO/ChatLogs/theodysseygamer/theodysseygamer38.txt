<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) Walked off to the side to train what Ortho had shown him, it looked easy enough. He knew how wind worked and even had a jutsu for it, this shouldn't be too hard. Once he was far enough away from everyone he would build chakra up within his body as quickly as he could. Once the chakra had been built up he would focus it to his hands. As the chakra was gathered to his hands he would then begin to force the chakra over itself, sharpening it to apply the wind chakra nature change. With his chakra prepared all that was left was clapping his hands. He clapped his hands together lightly and forced his chakra out…though this would old blow each of his hands back…meaning the jutsu hadn't gone right.

It didn't really matter, this was the first bit of real training he had in a while both because he had no teacher and…because of what had happened. Either way he would quickly begin again, building his chakra up as best he could and then sending it down to each of his hands. Once at his hands he would repeat the process of sharpening the chakra over itself until it was to a fine point. With his chakra once again successfully prepared it would take no time at all for him to again clap his hands, this time trying to force the wind out from himself. Again his hands would blow away from each other, not as fiercely this time as some wind did push forward, though he knew this was still wrong.

Once more he would waste no time in building up his chakra again, he didn't really care if the others around him mocked his progress…then again he didn't care for much these days. Once his chakra had been correctly prepared within himself he would send it down to each of his hands, beginning the nature change process again. When his chakra was sharpened to as fine a' point as he could possibly manage with his level of understanding and practise with wind he would raise his arms up and get them in position to clap once more. With one final clap he would push the built up wind style chakra outwards, pulsing a bust of wind through the air in front of himself in the correct manner, finally having completed the jutsu.* - Thu Oct 29 01:45:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) Stood there staring at Izanami as he began building up chakra. As he built his chakra up he would begin heating it, apply the fire nature change to his chakra. Once his chakra had been prepared he would hold his hand out and concentrate it to his hand. He clenched his fist as he did and turned to focus on the tree. Once his target was in sight he refocused on his chakra and flicked his arm the same way Izanami did, trying to release his chakra as he did. This however did not do to plan, instead he would have released a small fireball that would explode as it flew a few inches from his hand. Luckily only minor burns were sustained.

He simply continued on, not really caring about his failure or the burns he had sustained. He had an odd look on his face, rather like the one Izanami had given him when she first looked at him. Either way he held his other hand out as he prepared his chakra, heating it up to apply the usual chakra nature change to it. When his chakra was fully prepared he would focus it to his hand, this time gathering it to his palm. Again he would clench his fist, trying to condense the chakra into a small spark like Izanami. As he flicked his arm he would open his fist and release his chakra, sending out a very small ball of fire. It would hit the tree and explode, marking the success of the jutsu. He would then look back at Izanami, continuing on with the lesson.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) Watches each handseal carefully, then observes how the jutsu is executed. With a nod of his head he would turn to the direction Izanami was facing and began again with building up chakra. Once his chakra was adequately built up and heated to apply the nature change he would form the handselas he was shown slowly, inhale and then exhale as he pushed his chakra up. The flames would all release at once, coming out in a massive burst that looked like an incendiary explosion more than what you would call a 'flamethrower'. He had to pull away quickly to make sure he wasn't burnt; the flames however would have quickly died out.

Moving on again he would quickly begin building his chakra up once more, moulding it within his body and then heating it within his stomach. Once his chakra was ready it was a simple matter of going through the handseals, much quicker this time, and inhaling. As he exhaled he would push his chakra up to his chest and pucker his lips. This time he would slowly release the chakra in a much more sizable and condensed form, expelling a jet of flames from his mouth that would carry on for a few meters. The flames would continue on for a few seconds before dying out. He would then straighten up and turn back to Izanami, ready to continue.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) Whips out his own shuriken, tying wire to it and throwing it at the tree. Unlike Izanami his shuriken would just bury itself in the tree, he couldn't manipulate shuriken like she could. In any case he held onto the wire as he built his chakra up, heating it to apply the nature change as always. Once he was ready he would bite down on the cord and hold it between his teeth, proceeding to perform each handseal he had seen Izanami do. With the handseals done and his chakra prepared he would exhale and push his chakra up, trying to feed it along the wire that was held between his teeth. While he did manage to do this somewhat, the flames just exploded outwards after a few seconds.

He got a new shuriken and tied some more wire around it, throwing it at the tree as before. He placed the wire between his teeth as he built his chakra up. Once his chakra was sufficient enough for the jutsu he would quickly form each handseal from memory and inhale. He would push his chakra up as he exhaled, focusing it completely on the wire. As he made a connection with the wire he would feed it down it, using all his focus and effort to do so. Eventually the flames hit the shuriken and the tree, burning the tree as it did. He would let go of the wire as it burned and looked to Izanami again, giving a nod to say he was ready to continue.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) Was admittedly a little surprised by this next technique, it seemed to be some kind of flammable gas that was expelled, then lit later on…or so he guessed, Izanami didn't say much or even tell him the name of it. It didn't matter, he would attempt the jutsu all the same. He would obviously begin by building his chakra up and heating it, doing so rather quickly by now. Once that was done he would form the handseals of the jutsu and inhale. As he inhaled he would push his chakra to his chest and exhale, releasing a large stream of fire, akin to what you would have seen from the flamethrower jutsu. Immediately he would cut the chakra supply off, obviously realising he had gone wrong somewhere.

He stood and focused for a moment, thinking of what he could do to get this right. He knew the handseals and preparation was right, it had to be in the execution of the jutsu. He thought on how Izanami had exhaled a gas, not actual flames. With that in mind he had a little idea and began building up chakra. Once his chakra was prepared he would form the handseals for the jutsu and inhale. Once he had inhaled he would push his chakra to his lungs, mixing the heated chakra in with the air he had taken in and changing it into a flammable gas. He would then exhale that gass over the water. To make sure he had done it right, he would gather chakra to his hand and release an ember from it with a flick, igniting the gas and confirming he had been successful. "What was the name of that jutsu?"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) Continued to observe Izanami as she went through each of her jutsu one by one, she wasn't kidding when she said she specialised in fire. Once she was done performing the jutsu it would be his turn, though he had all been building up chakra in preparation to do so. He formed the one handseal needed for this technique and pushed his chakra to his chest as he inhaled. He would then exhale and expel fire from his lips, shooting it off in a jet like appearance that would once again be similar to the flamethrower jutsu. He continued on until the flame died out and shook his head after it did, it didn't look right, at least not how Izanami did it.

He would begin again, building up his chakra as fast as he could and heating it just the same. With his chakra fully prepared he would form the tiger handseal and inhale. This time however he would push his chakra to his chest and mix it with the air he had taken him. As he exhaled he opened his mouth wide and let out a large breath, expelling a large amount of fire all at once. This time the fire looked different than before as it was released pretty much all at once rather than continuously like the flamethrower required. "What was that called?" He would ask again.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) pulls out a strange looking Kunai, it's shape would be the same but the metal would be a lot lighter and shinier than what you would expect, almost as if the metal were different. Putting that aside he held then kunai in one hand as he built his chakra up. He had studied chakra flows a bit so even without an explanation on how it worked, he was sure he could figure it out. He understood what he had to do…mostly, building his chakra up and then heating it to apply the fire nature change. He would then try and force the chakra into the kunai, which he managed to do so somewhat. The kunai however would not gain any kind of fire shroud around it, it simply stayed normal.

After a few moments he decided to stop and backtracked a little, building some more fire style chakra up as he looked down at his Kunai. He figured that like a sword, a weapon was an extension of one's self and as such, an extension of their chakra network. With that in mind he would begin pushing chakra down his arm and into his hand, this time instead of forcing the chakra in he would simply coax it into the metal, trying to envision the kunai being part of his chakra network. With his chakra now in the blade he would then expand it out of the blade, forming a sort of 'fire shroud' around the blade. He held it out for Izanami to see before cutting the chakra supply off and putting the Kunai away.* - Thu Oct 29 05:08:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) builds chakra up within his body, vibrating it to as fast as he could possibly get it to go. He would then turn to Izanami and hold his hands out, making sure she could follow them. He would slowly go through each of the handseals before holding his hand out. "Gather your chakra to either one or both of your hands." He would say, doing so as he did. Lightning would then begin to crackle around his hand. "Then simply place your hand or hands on the floor and pulse the lightning in the direction you want it to go." As he said this he would take a knee and place his hand on the ground, doing just as he said, pulsing the lightning through the ground. Izanami would notice the ground would probably have been torn up as the lightning passed through it. "You can control the vibrations of the chakra to either severely damage just like that or simply give you foe a paralysing shock, you try." he said, standing up straight just after.* - Thu Oct 29 05:17:26 2015

He continued to rub his eyes for a bit, trying his hardest not to cry, he didn't want to do that anymore, Finally he would look back at Marrisa.

He held her tightly like he used to Hana, staying like that for a long while as he just cried and cried. Once he had cleared himself up a bit he would turn his head to rest the side of it on her.

"She was my adoptive mother...I met her just before you left...she told me she'd never leave me but now she's gone...just like everyone." He would say, setting himself off into another hard cry. "I sat with her in a pool of blood for a long while...then on my own as I saw her body over and over...I was so alone...everyone has left me alone..." he would continue on between crying, finally burying his face back into the shoulder of Marrisa for comfort.* - Thu Oct 29 06:41:04 2015

"I-I...Tried to kill myself Marrisa...I wanted to do it...so badly...I was going to burn the mansion down and sit in the flames...I would have done it but I was stopped...I'm a horrible person..."* - Thu Oct 29 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) let up on hugging her too tightly, easing into a more gentle hug now. He would still have his face pushed up against her, though that was mostly so she didn't see him crying. "I just...don't know what to do anymore...whats the point in training? getting stronger? I have nothing to protect anymore...everything has been taken from me...I just don't see the point in anything any more..."* - Thu Oct 29 07:04:06 2015

He was about to get mad...real mad...until she continued on, explaining what a shinobi was and what he had to live for...it still didn't resonate with him like she probably hoped it would, but it helped bring him down to earth somewhat.

He pulled away from her and stepped back, no longer crying he looked her in the eyes. "You don't understand Marrisa...I'm not like you...I can't do that stuf...i'm not a good person, I've killed someone in anger...I couldn't even prevent the death of Suitengu or my own damn mother...I'm just a bad person..." he would say in a cold, self demeaning tone, not even looking her in the eye towards the end of it.* - Thu Oct 29 07:26:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) starts to rub his eyes as the become irritated and red, a few tears would even start to drip down his face. After rubbing his eyes he would look at Shinjin as best he could through the tears, "S-So much has happened...I've been so alone...We have so much to talk about...so...so much..."* - Fri Oct 30 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Y-You need to come with me...I have to show you something... - Fri Oct 30 01:06:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) guides Shinjin out of the mansion and around the side of it, walking all the way out to the far left of the mansion. He would stop next to Shinjin as they came close to the grave, by now the flowers would have probably crumpled and died, though he would fix that soon. He began crying again as he looked upon the grave and without even looking at Shinjin he would say, "This is...This is where I buried mum...Shinjin...This is where I laid Hana t-to rest..."* - Fri Oct 30 01:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) really started to break down when Shinjin asked that, falling to his knees in the process. He sobbed hard for a few seconds before taking in a deep breath and looking upon the grave once more. "I haven't told anyone this...I didn't want them to know...just you and me..." he would let out, coughing after to clear his sore throat. "S-she did it...She killed herself...mum...killed herself..." he said slowly, his tone seeming to flicker between sadness, anger and confusion as he did. In the end he would just be sitting there, crying slowly to himself. He hated saying that outloud but it was the truth...the hurtful truth...* - Fri Oct 30 01:18:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) slowly stops crying as his sadness is sucked away and replaced by much darker feelings. He looks down at each of his hands with cold eyes, "I can see it Shinjin...the blood...her blood...it's all over me again...it stains my hands and I can't get it off...I can't-" was all he said, cutting himself off. He slowly rose to his feet and turned to Shinjin, still looking down at his hands however. "You left me Shinjin...I was in the darkness...I was nearly in the darkness forever until Ketsuki stopped me...I thought she had brought me out of that darkness but i'm still there...i'm still there."* - Fri Oct 30 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) looks up as Shinjin places a hand on his shoulder, he takes in the wisdom being provided to him and for the first time, it wouldn't fall on deaf ears. He understood what Shinjin tried to get across to him, Shinjin understood his pain. He slowly closed each hand and brought them down to his sides, his cloak falling back into place as he did. "You're the first person...to make sense to me Shinjin...Everyone else simply tried to tell me it would be ok or they tried to change me because they feared what I was becoming...but not you...Thank you..."

He would bring Shinjins hand down off his shoulder, grasping it with his own hand he would give it a firm shake, a hand shake. "I've been trying my best to hold things together...and i'm going to keep trying...we're going to keep trying. The fire of Konoha will never again be extinguished."* - Fri Oct 30 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) nods to Shinjin as he walks off. He would stare down at the grave some more and promise to bring new flowers before taking off in his own direction.* - Fri Oct 30 02:27:12 2015
