<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) steps onto the water and walks infront of everyone present. "Now what Yan said is correct, Water is not solid and is usually flowing in some way or another. To walk on water you simply need to apply chakra to the bottoms of your feet again...but this also has a trick to it that you must learn on your own."

He turns around and walks back a little, turning around again when he was a little ways away. "I'll be here incase anyone starts drowning and Setsuna is a medic so if you can't swim, have no fear of drowning."* - Mon Sep 14 16:14:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) stood a good ways away from the waterfall, giving himself a lot of area to work with when training his fire jutsu. He still needed to practise his fireball jutsu before he moved onto the newest jutsu he recently learned. He placed his hands together and built his chakra uo quickly, making sure to apply the katon nature change to it. When he was ready he weaved a string of handseals and pivoted his body forward, exhaling and forming a large fireball within seconds that he fired off into the water.

As he watched the fireball extinguish in the water he began preparing again, straightening up and placing his hands together once more. It took him a few seconds to build up the chakra in his body and when he was done, he would be seen weaving together a string of handseals once more, inhaling a deep breath as he did. He would pivot forward as he exhaled, a fireball bursting to life infront of him and growing twice his size within a few seconds. Once again he fired it off into the water.

Once again he would waste no time in getting ready to practise the jutsu once more. Placing his hands together he began building up chakra once more. As he was nearing being done he formed the handseals neccessary for the jutsu once more and breathed in again. He pivoted forward as he breathed out once more and another fireball grew infront of his face. When it reached the maximum size he could make it he shot it off into the water again, once again watching it extinguish.

He returned to his normal stance, hands placed together and started building chakra up again. It had become routine to him at this point, he had practised this jutsu many a time before and he was only doing this practise to master this jutsu. When he was read he weaved a set of handseals and inhaled, exhaling a second later and with his breath came a large fireball which grew to about twice his size. He fired it off into the water once more.

He figured he'd practise it one last time before moving on to practise other stuff, theres no harm in practising at the end of the day. He placed his hands together once more and built his chakra up, once he was done he weaved the jutsus set of handseals and inhaled as he pushed his chakra up. As he exhaled he pivoted forward and a small fireball would burn to life infront of his face, it would grow to be around twice his size within a matter of seconds and once it grew to the maximum size he could make it, he'd fire it off into the water and watch it drown before walking back onto dry land, spotting Ikarus in the distance.* - Mon Sep 14 18:28:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) stood in the muddy area near the waterline. This was a good place to practise his proficiency with doton. He placed his hands together and began building his chakra up quickly, applying the doton nature change to his chakra to the best of his ability. He kneels down and places his palms against the mud, he begins moving the chakra he built up through his arms and down into the ground, trying his best to most, if not all of his built up chakra into the ground. He was a bit rusty so his control wasn't that great, but this was just a warm up.

He stayed on his knees and placed his hands together again, building up his chakra for a second time. Again he would be applying the doton nature chage to his chakra, trying to change it into a more solid, earth like form. When he was done he'd place his hands on the ground again and would push his chakra into the ground once more. This time was a lot better now he had his first practise in, but it still needed work.

He lifted his hands from the mud and placed them together again, once again building up chakra and applying the doton nature change as best he could. He would try and focus himself as best he could, even with the background noise of a spar happening. Once he placed his hands on the ground he would be kneading his chakra into the ground once more, trying to be as efficient and effective as he could when doing so.

He pulled his hands back once again and placed them together, building up more chakra to practise with again. He tried to refine the quality of chakra he was using to the best he could get it, making sure it was well moulded. Once he was ready again he would place his palms on the ground and would once again start pouring his chakra into the ground, trying to make sure all his chakra was being accepted quickly and effectively.

He pulled his hands back, placing them together. He was feeling quite fatigued, he was using a quite a bit of chakra every time he did this. He decided to go for broke and spent extra time building chakra up. When he placed his hands on the ground he started pouring a large amount of his chakra into the ground, filling quite a large portion of the ground with his chakra which any sensor type would no doubt be aware of. When he pulled his arms back he slumped back into a slouched sit and started breathing heavy, fatigued from using quite a bit of chakra.* - Mon Sep 14 20:37:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) was feeling much better after a short rest and while watching the an on going spar, he was reminded that he learned mud silhouette and should probably get to practising it. He moved away from the waterfall area since there were quite a few people there. When he got to an isolated area he placed his hands together and began building his chakra up. When he was ready he formed the needed handseals and pressed his hands to the floor, spreading his chakra through the ground as best he could and forming a small mud puddle.

He was quite new to this skill so it was a start. He'd place his hand together and started building chakra up once more, applying the doton nature change to it to help with the jutsu. He formed the handseals and placed his hands on the ground and spread his chakra through an area he wanted to affect. He tried to liquify the earth into a muddy river but all he succeeded in making was a slightly larger mud puddle than before. He stood up and prepared to try again.

Once again he would place his hands together as he build up his chakra slowly. When he felt he was ready he formed the neccessary handseals and knelt down, placing his hands on the ground. He started kneading his chakra into the ground and when he was ready, used his chakra to try and liquify the ground into a muddy substance. This time he affected a little larger of an area, but still not a great amount.

He stood back up again and placed his hands together once more. He was getting tired from all this training but he had to press on. He began building up chakra once more and when he was ready he knealt back down and started kneading his chakra into the ground. When he was done he would use the chakra he kneaded into the ground to try and liquify it into a muddy substance. This time he once again increased the size of the mud 'river' but then again it was only slightly.

He decided to try it one last time before heading to see Tethys again about getting a mission, then he'd go lay down and rest a bit. He stood up and began building up chakra one last time, taking a bit longer because of how fatigued he was feeling. When he was finally done he knealt down and placed his hands on the ground, kneading his chakra into the ground and spreading it in an area he deemed appropriate to his skill. When he was ready he tried to turn the earth saturated with his chakra into a muddy river, succeeding only partially in making a sizable puddle of mud. With a sigh he stood up and walked away slowly, huffing and puffing a little from fatigue.* - Mon Sep 14 21:47:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) walked out onto the water like he usually did when training now. He would once again be practising fireball jutsu again today, determined to squeeze out all the practise he could get with it to truly master it. He placed his hands together and began building up his chakra like usual. When he was ready he would weave the headseals he was now most familiar with. He would pivot forward as he exhaled, a fireball growing twice his size within seconds just infront of his face. He shot it off into the water and returned to a normal stance.

He really did like practising Katon jutsu, there was something about fire that he just like, perhaps it was how free and powerful fire is, something he hopes to achieve one day. Without much further thought he would place his hands together again and build up his chakra. Once he was done he would weave the handseals and inhale, pivoting forward as he exhaled and pushed his chakra up and out with his breath, a fireball once again growing infront of his face before being shot into the water.

This kind of became second nature to him now since he practised this jutsu so much, he really wanted to start practising other jutsu but not feeling like he truly had this jutsu mastered was holding him back in some way. He would place his hands together once more and focused on building his chakra up once again. When he was done he weaved the handseals for the jutsu and inhaled, kneading his chakra into his breath. When he exhaled he would pivot forward and a small fireball would burst to life infront of his face, growing in size quickly. Before it became unstable he would fire it off into the water.

Once again he would return to his normal stance and place his hands together like he usually did to build chakra up. When he was done with building his chakra up he performed the handseals needed for the jutsu in quick succession. As he inhaled he would lean backwards a little before pivoting forward as he exhaled, a fireball forming infront of himself like usual. Once it got to the he could barely contain the fireball he would fire it off into the water, letting it extinguish.

Again he would straighten up and place his hands together, concentrating on building up his chakra once more. Once he was again done with that he would again form the handseals for the jutsu in a fast pace. He would inhaled and pivot forward as he exhaled and pushed his chakra out with his breath, again forming a small fireball infront of his face that would grow to around twice his size. He would again push chakra into it, trying to hold it together as long as he could. When he felt he could no longer contain the fireball he would fire it off into the river and watch it extinguish before reaching into a small backpack he had on and pulling out some food to eat.* - Tue Sep 15 14:34:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) looks back and sees the large tsunami heading his way. Without a moments thought he would build his chakra up as fast as he could and formed the Ram handseal. He would then push the built up chakra through his body and saturate his muscles in it. He'd then attempt to move at high speed to get to dry land and avoid the oncoming attack.* - Tue Sep 15 15:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) had attempted to use Shunshin to get away but he just wasn't fast enough. He would get swept up with the Tsunami and smashed against the dry land most likely. He would lay on the floor, dizzy and confused both from being in pain from using Shunshin and having his body hit the floor like a rag doll. He would just be laying there currently, not being able to do much else. Why does this always happen to him?* - Tue Sep 15 15:21:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) sighs and stands up, walking back onto the water, "Time to get back to training."* - Tue Sep 15 16:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) felt he pretty much knew all there was about the fireball technique so he decided to start practising his newest jutsu. This jutsu was the Phoenix Flower jutsu, something he had only just picked up. He began by building up his chakra and applying the Katon nature change to it. When he was ready he formed the following handseals Rat, Tiger, Dog, Ox, Rabbit and finally tiger slowly. He then proceeded to exhaled, shooting out one small sized, fast traveling fireball.

It wasn't all that impressive but then again, that was basically the first time he had properly practised that jutsu. He placed his hands together and began building up chakra in preparation. He formed the handseals of the jutsu a little quicker this time and inhaled, exhaling and once again shooting out a small fireball that traveled fast, hitting the water and extinguishing quite quickly.

He began to understand what he was doing wrong, he was releasing all his chakra at once when he needed to sort of 'spit' it out in volleys. With that in kind he placed his hands together again and began building up chakra once more. When he was once again ready he formed the handseals needed for the jutsu quicker than before and inhaled, infusing his chakra into that air. He would then attempt to 'spit' out that air, causing two to three fireballs to fly from his mouth and it the water.

Now that he had the trick he placed his hands together again and began building up chakra once more. He made sure to apply the Katon nature change like always, but this was second nature to him by now. He went over the handseals in his head then quickly performed them when he was ready. Once again he inhaled and as he exhaled he would push his chakra up wtih his breath, spitting out four fireballs this time, once again aiming them at the water.

He would again place his hands back together and began building up chakra once more. When he was ready he once again went over the handseals in his head so as to not get them wrong, He would then perform each handseal quickly. He inhaled and exhaled, pushing his chakra up as he did. He made sure to gauge his chakra and to sort of break it apart so he could spit it in volleys. He didn't managed to spit anymore than four fireballs but it was a start.* - Tue Sep 15 16:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) walked back to dry land to practise some of his other jutsu like Shunshin and the Doton jutsu he knew. He definately needed to be on land to practise Shunshin since overusing it made him pass out. With that in mind, he thought he'd practise Shunshin for a bit. He started building up his chakra, building up a smaller amount as to lessen the adverse effects on his body. When he was ready he formed the Ram handseal and burst his chakra through his body. He took off and made it quite the distance within a second, still feeling dizzy afterwards.

Since he was feeling dizzy he gave himself a minute to rest before standing back up and placing his hands together to focus himself and build his chakra up. He built non-elemental chakra up a lot faster since it took less time to mould, meaning he could practise this faster. When he was done he formed the Ram handseal and burst his chakra through his body and muscles again. He set off and once again covered a large distance within a second. The dizziness returned and his muscles started to ache, he'd have to rest for a while.

After around ten minutes his body was feeling better, he'd remember that for when he practised Shunshin later that performing it twice in quick succession seemed to lead to muscular pain. In any case he began building up chakra once more and when he was ready he formed the Ram handseal and burst hsi chakra through his body. He aimed to move as far as he could each time so he could get used to the maximum effect the jutsu made you feel when using it.

He was feeling dizzy again so he sat down to gather himself again for a minute or two. When he felt better he stood up, placed his hands together and began building up chakra again. Once he was ready he formed the Ram handseal and spread his chakra all throughout his body, effectively supercharging it. He set off and made it as far as he could, his head and body spinning as soon as he stopped. His body would then start to spasm in pain again, causing him to have to sit down.

He'd wait around twenty minutes or so for his body to stop feeling spasming and hurting. He jumped back to his feet once he felt better and placed his hands together like usual when he built up his chakra. Once he quickly built his chakra up he formed the single handseal needed for Shunshin and spread his chakra all through his body. He set off once more and tried to get as far as he could. He was still feeling very dizzy by the time he stopped but he noticed that the dizziness wasn't as strong now he had experienced it quite a bit.* - Tue Sep 15 17:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) once he had spent time eating and recovering from practising Shunshin he decided to practise his use of Doton some more. He felt he was quite adept at using the doton nature change now and this last peice of training would seal the deal. He stood on dry land and began building chakra up, apply the doton nature change to it with the best of his ability. When he was ready he started to channel his chakra through his body and down his legs, through his feet and into the ground. He managed to get a good chunk of his chakra into the ground, but not as much as he'd like.

The purpose of this last bit of training was that in his mind if he could channel it through his feet effectively, he'd have a good understand of how to use and manipualte Doton jutsu and the doton nature change. He'd begin building up chakra again, making sure to apply the nature change to his chakra. When he was ready he would again push his chakra down his legs, trying to dispel it through his feet. Once again he got a good portion into the ground, but it wasn't great.

He'd be keeping absolute focus on his chakra, making sure not to let any outside noises distract him, even if someone was talking to him he probably wouldn't know it. When he was ready again he would push his built up chakra down his legs, through his feet and into the ground as best he could. His third try seemed to be better, he estimated he got around 70% of the chakra he built up into the ground.

He thought back to suimen when trying this, remembering how you needed to keep the chakra feed constant and solid. He believed the same applied here only you were pushing into the ground not on it. Once he was done building up chakra again he'd force it down his legs and into the ground, improving once again as he did. Again he estimated that he was getting around 80-85% of his chakra into the ground efficiently.

Just like last time he would go for broke on his fifth attempt. He would take longer to build up chakra in order to burst as much of it as he could through th ground. When he was ready he focused himself solely on his chakra control and started funneling the mass of chakra he had built up into the ground. He filled a large area of the surrounding ground with his chakra in a few minutes. He eventually stopped and started to breath heavy, feeling tired from that last practise. He now felt like he knew most if not all th basic to do with Doton chakra, the rest was just practise from here on out.* - Tue Sep 15 18:07:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) decided that sicne the courtyard was quite empty he would train here, it's not like he had a secret jutsu to hide afterall, he was just going to be practising Shunshin. He found a decent spot to bounce around at high speed in and began building his chakra up to do just that. When he was ready he formed the ram handseal and burst his chakra through his body. He moved forward at high speed and got quite far, but was also extremely dizzy once he stopped.

He had to sit down and rest like usual when training to us Shunshin. Once he had been sat for a minute or two to gather himself he stood back up and placed his hands together to build up more chakra. When he was once again done he formed the single handseal needed for shunshin and took off once more. When he stopped the dizziness would immediately set in and his body would start to hurt from using Shunshin. Just like before he would need to sit down and rest for about 10-15 minutes to recover.

When he felt better again he would stand up and continue his training. Once more he would place his hands together like usual when he built up his chakra. Once he was done he would form the ram handseal and spread his chakra through his body and into his muscles. He set off and moved quite a considerable distance within a second, The confusion and dizziness setting in once more, albeit not as bad.

With another minute or two's rest he would get back with training once more. He placed his hands together like he always did and concentrated on building up his chakra. When he was finished with building up chakra he would again form the ram handseal and would spread the chakra he built up through his body. He took off and made it as far as he could before stopping. As he stopped he would feel muscle spasm pain all through his body once again and would need to rest once more.

He decided to push for one more time and stood up after resting for around 15 minutes. He repeated the process of placing his hands together and building up his chakra in preperation. Once he was done he formed the ram handseal as usual and burst his chakra throughout his body, saturating his muscles.He moved forward as far as he could, gaining considerable distance before stopping. The dizziness would return and he would need to sit down but he took this chance to rest and eat before going on to do something else.* - Wed Sep 16 16:39:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) would open the mission scroll Tethys gave him and read it over again, scanning through the information that was vital to the mission like his targets name, usual area of activity and description. Once he was done reading he checked all the vital information over once more before putting the scroll away. He would then proceed to check all his ninja gear to make sure he was fully prepared to do this mission...it would be his first A ranked mission and it was quite the task for him to undertake.

He would move to the north-east housing district which is where the scroll informed him that Manaku was hiding in. He would first make a quick sweep of the area, seeing if he could find Manaku himself before asking the locals, he didn't want to make his presense there too obvious straight away incase Manaku caught wind of him and slipped away. When he was done scouting the area, not finding much in the way of anything he would move on to asking the locals of the area if they had seen a man that fit his description.

Nearly half an hour went by and he was starting to think that either the information was wrong or he was explaining the looks of this person wrong. He came across one individual that told him a person that looked like what he described came to eat at a certain noodle bar near here. Without hesitation he thanked the individual and moved as quickly as he could to the place described. When he found the noodle bar he would notice it was empty, he'd have to do a stake-out on the place.

Around an hour went by and once again he was starting to lose hope until he caught sight of someone that seemed to match the description. He got a closer look as the person entered the noodle bar and he confirmed it was indeed Manaku. He would start to think of a plan in his mind, trying to think of a way to do this quickly and quietly. He would decide against using ninjutsu for the most part since it would be noisy and could attract a crowd. Instead he would aim to take Manaku out quickly and quietly with a blade.

He would wait and make preperations as Manaku ate his noodles. When Manaku was paying up and leaving he would finally get in position to strike and waited for him to get a small distance from the noodle bar. He would then throw two kunai at him, one aimed at him and one aimed at his feet with a tag. Suddenly Manaku would turn around and catch the Kunai thrown directly at him, stating he knew he was being watched all along. The tagged kunai at his feet would then explode, covering him in a dust cloud.

A figure would move out of that dust cloud and Himura would begin his assault. He would move up to meet figure leaving the dust cloud, now becoming visible. It seemed Manaku, while sustaining small injury from the blast, was quite fine. Himura would then take five shuriken in one hand, throwing them at Manaku. Using the kunai he caught Manaku would block four out of the five shuriken hurled at him, the last slicing his arm slightly. Manaku would then charge forth at Himura.

Himura would jump back, sustaining a cut on his leg as he did. He didn't really want to he resorted to using ninjutsu. He formed a single handseal as he prepared his chakra before shooting a jet of flames at Manaku. Manaku then proceeded to do the same, using an opposing water technique. The two jutsu clashed, steam being made because of the water hitting his fire. Himura slowly pulled his tanto out of it's sheath, pulling it close to himself to keep himself protected.

Himura would notice a kunai coming at him in the last second, deflecting it with his tanto just in time. He would then hear the rasp of a blade in the distance as he assumed Manaku unsheathed his own tanto. The steam started to clear and he could just make a figure out, moving for it immediately. When he got close to it he saw it was Manaku and he slashed at it, slicing him down the chest...only for the assumed defeated Manaku to poof into smoke and reveal a log. He then turned around and felt his blade block a heavy hit from Manaku. He managed to push Manaku back and slashed at his leg a little, hopefully slowing him down.

Manaku would disappear into the steam again but it soon lifted from the area, revealing both combatants once more. He would reach around into his backpouch, grabbing five more shuriken. He would then charge forth and fake slash at Manaku, following up with a deft throw of the five shuriken in his hand. Manaku blocked three but took one to the leg and another to the shoulder, jumping back as he did to gain distance between himself and Himura. He would smile and tell Himura he would pay for that, not that it scared him.

He knew that he had an advantage over Manaku since Manaku was part of the council and therefore, quite old. This game him a speed and physical advantage but left him a little lacking ninjutsu wise as he was about to find out. Manaku would quickly formed quite a few handseals, summoning a large tsunami headed towards him. He looked around himself and saw a little alley way he could duck into, putting his tanto in it's sheath and forming the ram handseal to shunshin to it, just missing the water.

He would be dizzy from using Shunshin but thankfully he had time to recover since using that jutsu also took it out of Manaku. Both took a short few seconds rest before returning to combat. He came out fast, weaving a few handseals together and spitting three or four fireballs at Manaku to dodge. Manaku obviously dodged these fireballs but they left him open for attack just like Himura had planned. Manaku would attempt to gin distance between them by throwing kunai and jumping back somewhat.

Himura got sliced by some of the kunai sent his way but he kept focused on the plan he made. He took out three kunai, all with tags attached to them and sent them at Manaku, one to the left of him, one to the right and one directly at his feet, effectively blocking any escape. Once he had finished that he began weaving a few handseals again while building up more chakra. Manaku on the other hand saw pleased at the distance he made until he saw the three tagged kunai land near him.

Manaku started his own chain of handseals but he was too late since Himura was already done. He pivoted forward as he inhaled and exhaled a very large and powerful arc of flames towards Manaku and the tags. Manaku managed to get his jutsu off, another spout of water aiming to counter the flames from Himura. Unfortunately for him the fire combusted the explosive tags, causing a massive chain reaction explosion to happen. The water Manaku sent forth had just spared him from death, but he would be on the floor, burned and bleeding.

Himura would walk over and take his tanto out. He would look down at the barely breathing Manaku before giving him a killing blow, stabbing him straight through the chest. Himura would remember this moment as the first time he killed, an oddly exciting but terrible feeling going through his mind and body. As for the body? He'd move it to a secluded location and would tell Tethys where it is as proof of the missions completion. For now though, he would head back to tell Tethys the news.* - Wed Sep 16 21:11:40 2015
