<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) began building his chakra up, taking his time to do so for what he wanted to do. He built a lot of chakra up for Kai practise, focusing on his chakra network as he did. When his chakra was ready he continued to focus on his chakra network, slowly easing it down to a halt. Then as his chakra network seemed devoid of chakra he took the chakra he had built up and burst it through his network, instantly pumping it back to life.* - Mon Oct 12 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) stood in the training field of konoha, focusing himself and begining to build up chakra. He had a few more things to practise with mud silhouette before he felt like he could be done with it, speed of the mud and control of the mud. When he was done building up chakra he began sending it down his legs and through his feet, into the ground. As he dispersed it into a large area he would then clap his hands and change the earth into a more muddy and viscous texture. With this done he began moving the mud around to the best of his ability, getting good reception from the mud but some of it was being left out.

He would move to a different spot and begin again, quickly building uo his chakra for his jutsu needs. When that was again complete he did as before, funneling his chakra into the ground and dispersing it into a wide area infront of himself. Once he had done that properly he clapped his hands together and turned the area he influenced with his chakra into mud. Once that was done he used his chakra still in the mud to begin moving it around, trying to move and effect as much of the mud as he could. This time he got even better results, moving around most of the mud.

With his progress going better and better he wasted no time in moving to a new spot and building up his chakra again, completing his chakra within a few seconds. With his chakra now prepared he started kneading it into the ground and quickly filled up an area of the ground as large as before. With that he clapped his hands and quickly changed the earth into a more muddy substance, then he started moving that mud around with his chakra, focusing on everything he could and in time, he was moving the entire mass of the mud at a decent rate.

Once he felt he had refined his control over the mud it was time to increase its speed, he could already move it around at a decent pace but he knew he could get it to go faster. With this in mind he found a new spot and built his chakra up, kneading it into the ground shortly after. Once his chakra was in the ground he simply clapped and willed the ground into mud with his chakra. He then started moving the mud around, motioning it back and forth ahd having it pick up speed as he did. He would focus on his chakra, trying to move it, and the mud, as fast as he could.

With the speed progressing a long nicely he stopped, moved to a new area for some fresh soil and began building up chakra again, accomplishing that in seconds. With his chakra built up he simply kneaded it intp the ground through his feet, marking his preperation complete. With that he clapped his hands together and changed the earth into a muddy viscous substance, using his chakra to start moving it shortly after. He did the same as before, focusing on his chakra to move the mud in a small wave like pattern. He got the mud to move at a decent pace, as much as you could expect from mud before quiting, finally feeling like he had no more to practise with this jutsu.* - Mon Oct 12 02:05:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) started reading through his scroll for a chakra flow, fire to be specific. He wasn't too interested in learning it since it was more of a close range technique while he mainly focused on mid-long range but hey, it would come in handy at some point he figured. With that he got to reading, coming across the first bit of text which detailed how a chakra flow worked. You simply needed to take hold of your weapon and think of it like an extension of your body, then you focus your nature changed chakra into the weapon and you will have completed the technique, seemed pretty simple.* - Mon Oct 12 04:53:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) catches, opening it and reading through it. "...How fun..." He thought, giving a nod to Hideki and walking off to complete his mission.* - Mon Oct 12 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) walked to the crushed gate of konoha to begin his guard duty, setting his eyes upon its truly sorry state. Once he was actually at the gate he began his mission, standing at his post in the midst of the rubble of the gate. He watched as workers came to remove and fiddle around with some of the rubble, making him wish he was doing what they were doing, at least he would be walking around and actually being productive, not just standing keeping guard over something that was totally destroyed. Still, it was his job and he had to do it, with a heavy sigh...his work had begun.

The first little while into his mission was a total bore fest, having literally nothing happen. He stood around and kept a watchful eye out on those that had come to move and dig through the rubble, going about their day to day working business, all quite casual and boring stuff. He wished he could be doing something fun like before, but nope, he got stuck with guard duty...of a gate that doesn't exist...how productive. Still, he kept a watchful eye out as always, making sure none of the work men and women were up to no good and such, all quite standard stuff.

He saw some young kids playing around a dangerous area of the would be gate now turned to rubble. He shouted over to them, telling them to get some. They giggled and laughed, starting to run him, himself making chase. Obviously he caught up to them, his training as a shinobi coming into play there. When he did he made sure to give them a firm warning about not playing around this area as it is both having work done and is dangerous to play around due to holes and unsteady rocks. He tried to sound as casual as possible but the kids still went off a little upset, at least they would be safe.

With that he got back to his post and spotted a few caravans coming up to the ruined gate. He made sure the path was clear for the three that he saw and made them halt as they got to where the gate would be. He went to the first caravan, it being a simple travel means for what looked like some kind of upper-class person. He asked this person for his travel pass which he supplied with a rude tut. The pass seemed to check out and he handed it back to the person, motioning for his caravan to carry on through before getting the next one to spot where the last had been.

The next caravan was a food hauler, carrying an assortments of fruits and vegetables it seemed. He asked the driver for his pass and traders license, checking both over and making sure they were up to scratch. Once he did that he then circled the caravan, giving it a thorough check through, making sure that all their merchandise was legal in konoha and that nothing like a bomb or black market material was being hidden. After he had checked the caravan through he gave the driver his pass and license back and stepped aside, letting it pass on through into the village.

The last caravan jingled as it came a long, signifying to him that it held some kind of metals. His theory was confirmed when he found out it was a small time weapons dealer, mostly selling swords, kunai and shuriken. He proceeded like that last, checking his travel pass, traders license and special merchandise license for the weapons. As he did that he would also look through his caravan thoroughly, like the last. He took his time doing so for two reasons, one to spot any dangerous weapons and two because he was secretly inspecting his wares. When everything checked out ok he let the caravan pass through and got back to his original spot, now returned to his post.

Not too soon after the caravans had come through he spotted a few people approaching the gate. It seemed like they were from the village and were just out on a stroll but given recent times he had to be sure. He stopped them and asked them a few questions, checking them over to see if they had and weapons and such, the people didn't look too pleased but this was life at the moment and they just had to deal with it. Once he was done with his mini-interrogation he gave them a smile and let them pass through, trying to ease the tension. The smile seemed to have worked but the people seemed to have been a little worked up, oh well, can't please everyone.

A short while after that occured he spotted a few characters in the distance that put him on edge, they seemed like shinobi. Upon closer inspection his fears had been rid, seeing as they were shinobi of konoha. They looked tired and a little roughed up but mostly in tact. Just as before he had to make sure and stopped them, they seemed to be more understanding than the last set of people. They provided him with their mission statement and he happily let them pass, he didn't want to keep shinobi that had just been on a tough mission too pre-occupied afterall.

As if right on cue another set of people strolled up, two to be exact, an old man and what seemed to be his younger son or grandson. Both looked a little worse for wear, having slightly frizzy hair and not the best of clothing, obviously the signs they had been through tough time. He stopped them and asked for their papers, they couldn't provide any. He shook his hand and told them they couldn't enter, which didn't please the younger man at all. He spoke about the hardship they had been through and while it did hurt him to do so, he still refused them entry, he had a job to do afterall. The younger male was about to get violent but his father or grandfather calmed him and pulled him away.

With those last set of people done and dusted with he got set into the last little haul of his shift and like usual in the last part of any job you do, it was long and boring. He tried to find things to preoccupy himself but knew he had a job to do, keeping a watchful eye out at every moment. It finally ticked over to his job being done, a tap on his shoulder from a fellow shinobi that was taking over his role. He spoke with that shinobi for a little while before finally heading off to fill out his report of the mission and give it back to Hideki to collect his reward, another successful mission.* - Mon Oct 12 05:51:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) came to the training field to begin training another jutsu, Great breakthrough. This would be his first wind jutsu and as such, would take some time to get used to. He decided to get in a first practise, just to get a feel for the jutsu and go from there. Building up his chakra he took his time, wanting to go slowly on this first practise. Once he was ready he went over each handseal in his head, Tiger, Ox, Dog, Rabbit, Snake in that order. He then went through each of those handseals and held his hand out, gathering his chakra to it. As he did he began applying the wind nature change to his chakra, folding it over itself to sharpen the chakra. When ready he then thrust his hand forward, pushing his chakra forward with it. He managed to produce a meagre gust of wind, above average of what you'd expect from a breeze but very sub-par.

With that shoddy first practise out of the way he decided against practising a specific flaw he had with the jutsu, opting instead to jutsu continue using the jutsu to get better and more experienced with it. With that in mind he began building his chakra up again, faster than before. He then went over the handseals in his head again before quickly performing all four handseals. With the handseals done and his chakra prepared he held his hand out, gathering his chakra to it. He then applied the wind nature change to his, sharpening the chakra before pushing his hand and chakra forward, releasing his chakra in the form of wind.

There wasn't much improvement from before, if any, but he felt he himself had learned a little bit more about the technique. Without a seconds more of thought he began building chakra up again in preparation for performing the jutsu once more. When his chakra was ready he went through each of the four handseals, doing so a little faster than before. He would then of couse hold his hand out and gather his chakra there, applying the chakra nature change just as before. He focused on the chakra at his hand and as he did, pushed his hand forward, releasing his chakra into a gust of wind, making a slight improvement this time.

He could tell this jutsu was quite chakra heavy as his body had already started to feel the effects of chakra consumption, still he pressed on, that was what training was about after all, pushing ones limits. And push he would, building up more and more chakra to perform the jutsu a fourth time. When ready he lifted his hands up and brought them together four times, forming a handseal each time. Once the handseals were done it was just a matter of gathering his chakra to his hand and applying the chakra nature change to it. Once he had done that he would again thrust his hand forward and release his chakra into a gust of wind.

The wind seemed to be picking up a bit of force now, at least not what you'd expect from the average gust. He was however, still no where near being adept at the jutsu. As such he would begin building up his chakra again, even as his body did strain from continued chakra use. Once his chakra was built up he began the handseal sequence, going through each handseal faster and faster with each use of the jutsu. With that all done he held his hand out and gathered his chakra to it just like before, adding the wind nature change to it. He then thrust his arm forward, holding his hand out and releasing his chakra into a wave of wind.

With that fifth practise done with his body was starting to feel real heavy now, the side effects of so much chakra being used plainly kicking in. His determination willed himself to keep going though, pushing his body to continue building up chakra for just one last practise. It was slowly and fatiguing but he finally got there, getting through the first part of the jutsu. Next came the handseals which he did quickly enough. After that he pushed his chakra down to his hand, it hurting slightly as he did. He then did as he had done before, applying the nature change to his chakra before thrusting both his arm and his chakra forward as one, releasing the built up wind in a small gust. He dropped to one knee just after, feeling dizzy, fatigued and heavy. He willed himself to stay awake and got back to his feet after a few seconds, slowly walking off to go eat and rest a while.* - Mon Oct 12 07:47:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) headed over to the mansion to begin his first mission of the day, rubble removal, how fun. The mansion was under construction already so he figured to help speed this process up, he'd go and clear some rubble. He got right to work, talking to the site manager to inform him of his presense. After that he simply went out and got to work, moving on over to a large pile of rubble which he started to collect bits and pieces from. He mostly started out of small bits, pieces of wood and small rocks before he did anything too straining.

After a while he felt like he wasn't really making much of a dent by just picking up the smaller pieces so he moved on to some larger stuff, at least what he could carry anyway. He even surprised some of the workers with the load he was carrying since he was still only a child but then again, he was also a shinobi. He wished that Ortho could have taught him shadow clone jutsu, he could be doing this a lot faster with that technique. Either way it had to be done and he moved as quickly as he could, moving back and forth with an assortment of rocks and wood to be crushed and burned.

Him being both a shinobi and a child seemed to be having a small benefit for him, occasionally a few workers would start to come over and chat to him about shinobi life and how it was working for one so young, being clever in his words he even persuaded a few to help him with the pile of rubble he was mainly focusing on, much to the site managers displeasure, as long as rubble was being cleared however, he didn't seem to mind too much. In the end workers would come and go to help him, never really staying too long for him to talk too much with them.

Eventually he had started making a dent on the pile of rubble he was clearing which led him to find something, a very large piece of the kage mansion stuck within the rubble. He knew this was his first priority and began working his way around it, clearing the smaller rocks and bits of wood that seemed to surround and bury this quite large piece of the mansion. He wondered if that pulling it out intact meant they could reattach it somehow, though in truth he knew that such a thing would be too dangerous and costly to do in the long run.

With the small pieces of rubble dealt with he took a short rest, nothing about ten to fifteen minutes before getting back to his pile of rubble and starting on the larger rocks surrounding it. This time he was much more careful as pulling out the wrong rock could have sent this thing toppling over but he wasn't too overly worried, the very large piece of rubble seemed to be stuck quite tight. He slowly worked his way around the pile of rubble, removing piece after piece to reveal his finding more and more like it was an archeological dig.

Once he felt he had removed enough rubble from around it to pull this large chunk out he went off to see the site manager, explaining that there was a very large piece that needed removing and that he couldn't do it alone. The site manager came and inspected the chunk before sending twenty men to the young shinobis disposal. He had each one hook a line to a different place on the piece of rubble, then start pulling. Even with himself helping it didn't seem to be moving but after a while more and more workers flocked to help. In the end he had around fifty workmen pulling on this large piece of rubble and finally, it came loose, tumbling down to the ground.

It seemed to be a wall section of the previous mansion as went it hit the ground it smashed it to four sizable pieces of flat rock, much too large for any one man to carry. The thanked the work men and got back to his pile, letting them handle the larger pieces as that was more their job. When the site manager called him over he tanked him for his time and said he'd put the word in to the kage to confirm his work here. He thanked the site manager and began to leave, looking back to see the work he had done today. It was strange, he had barely made a dent in retrospect but even so, in some odd way he was still proud to have helped.* - Mon Oct 12 15:28:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) simply watched and waited, the bear digging away at the ground. He looked around at the other holes around it and it gave him an idea. Just as Index spoke to him he would reply with his plan. "You see those holes? If we can force him into one and knock him off balance I can prepare a jutsu to stun him and then we can move him to outside the village. Sound good?" he asked, trying to keep as quiet as possible.* - Mon Oct 12 15:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) looked at Index, giving a bit of a confused look, not really sure what he was asking until he thought some more on it. "I think forcing it into a hole is our only option at this point unless you want to go toe to toe with a bear, it might look docile now but that will snap within seconds. I'll get its attention but throwing some stuff at it while you get behind it, we need to either force it into a corner or into a whole so I can stun it, other than that, I got no ideas."* - Mon Oct 12 16:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) picks up a rock as he follows Index north across the tree line. He would keep his eye on the bear as it seemed to be leaving the area. "We need to be quick Index, It's moving away, people could get hurt."* - Mon Oct 12 16:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) placed the rock in his pocket and began building up chakra in preperation for what they were about to do, he shook each hand off and crouched down, gaze focused on the bear. If they cat didn't work he was going to throw the rock at it to get its attention but in the mean time, he was just preparing to stun it with a jutsu, waiting for the right moment.* - Mon Oct 12 16:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) smirked a little, "Yes it does" he said, pulling out both the rock and a kunai. He would throw the rock at the bear, mostly to get its attention. Then he would launch the kunai towards one of it's paws, running forward as he did. He needed to get closer to it to pull off what he wanted.* - Mon Oct 12 16:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) continued forward as Index had him covered. Quickly he formed four handseals and held eahc hand out, concentrating his chakra to his hands. Lightning would start crackling and sparking around the both of his hands. He would then crouch down and place his hands onto the ground, surging the lightning he had built up through it towards the bear, hoping to fry it. He had hoped to hold back on the power of this but seeing as it was a bear that just smacked a kunai out of the air, he was taking no chances.* - Mon Oct 12 16:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) got a incredibly bad smelling burp wouldn't retreat backwards, the bear was clearly much more quicker and agile than himself and turning his back to run would be suicide. Instead he would follow suit with Index, forming five handseal and taking in a deep breath. He would pivot forward as he pushed his chakra up, letting out a huge breath in the form of a very large flmaethrower. The flamethrower would expand out to engulf both the bear and its left and right to hopefully block it's exits.* - Mon Oct 12 16:54:11 2015
