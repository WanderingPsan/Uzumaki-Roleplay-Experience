<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) stopped in no spot in perticular, taking out his tanto as he did. He was traveling to become stronger so training would be involved too afterall. He began by building up his chakra and applying the Katon nature change to it before pushing it through his body and flowing it through his sword. The sword would burst into small flames that would maintain for awhile before dying out, causing him to have to start again.

Once more he would build up his chakra, making sure to focus on the Katon nature type. When he was ready he began flowing his chakra down his arms and into his sword, concentrating on the blade. The blade of the sword would begin to radiate heat and would have flames bursting to life on it once more, staying lit for a little longer than before then dying out.

He shook each arm off one at a time and began again, gripping his sword in both hands while building his chakra up. Once his chakra was built up he began focusing on the blade, concentrating his chakra to it. He made sure to keep the flow of chakra going, trying to keep the flames alight for a little longer than before. He did succeed in this but the flames once died out again, causing him to need to restart.

Restarting once more he re-adjusted his grip on the hilt before begining to build his chakra up again, doing so fast because of his experience with the Katon nature type. When ready he flowed his chakra into the sword, focusing his efforts on the blade. This time he would try and fill the blade with his chakra, rather than keeping a steady supply to it. The flames kept going for much longer before when he did this and even appeared stronger.

Again he re-adjusted his grip on the hilt and began building his chakra up quickly, being ready to try again within a few seconds. Once ready he would flow all the chakra he had built up into the blade. The blade would burst to life with heat and fire, flames shrouding and encircling the blade. The flames were more potent than before and stayed alive a lot longer, seemed his training was paying off so far.* - Fri Sep 25 23:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) was happy with the progress he was making on his chakra flow and began practising again after a short rest. Now that he could hold the chakra flow for longer it was time for refinement. He took his tanto out again and began building chakra up to flow into the sword. Once ready he concentrated and began the chakra flow into the sword, causing it to burst to life with fire. He knew that he was expending too much chakra in the chakra flow.

Once the chakra burned off he began building up chakra to try again. When ready he concentrated on his chakra, guiding it through his body and into the blade of the tanto. He focused on his chakra, trying to make sure most of his chakra was being used efficiently. He noticed some of his chakra was being lost, expended or bounced back when using the chakra flow, something he'd need to work on.

Again he'd let the chakra in the blade burn out before building up chakra to try once more. Once he was done he began concentrating his chakra into the blade again, focusing as much as he could on trying to use all his chakra efficiently. This time he felt like more of his chakra was being used correctly, a lot of it still being lost however, he was learning how to control this better and better though.

When the flames on his tanto subsided he began building up chakra to practise with again, making sure to focus his chakra on the Katon nature type. When he was done he began flowing his chakra into his weapon, trying to focus as best as he could on using all his chakra the way he intended. Again he improved how he was using his chakra a little bit more, wasting less and less now as he continued to practise now.

He'd try this one more time before taking a short rest to go and do something quickly. Once the flames again subsided he began focusing on and building up his chakra before pushing it into his tanto when he was ready. His weapon burst to life with flames as he did and he tried his best to maintain his chakra efficiency, managing to reduce the amount of chakra he was wasting by atleast a little.* - Fri Sep 25 23:30:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Fine. - Fri Sep 25 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) took out his tanto and gripped it by the hilt with both hands, starting to build uo chakra as soon as he did. Once he was done he would begin pushing chakra into the blade, causing it to heat burst to life in small flames, making sure to keep up the efficiency training he was doing before. He noticed that while he was being efficient with his chakra now, he wasn't being all that effective with it, the flames he was producing being not that great.

He let the flames subside and started building up chakra again, making sure to focus on the Katon nature change. Once ready he began flowing his chakra into the blade, heating it and causing flames to dance around on the blade occasionally again, while impressive it clearly lacked power...but he had an idea. When he was first shown the technique he saw masses of flames surrounding the blade, rather than just small ones.

With this in mind he let his chakra dissipated before starting to build up chakra again in preperation. When ready he began flowing his built up chakra into the blade of his tanto. As he did this he forced his chakra out of the blade, forcing his chakra to surround and shroud the blade rather than just heating it. Flames now encircled the blade, coating it in a literal flow of chakra.

He began again, letting his chakra dissipate before building up more chakra to practise again with. One he was done he flowed his chakra through his body and into the tanto, effectively making the sword apart of his body. He would then release the chakra stored within the blade, fire and heat forming a shroud around the blade which threatened to seriously burn anything it came into contact with.

One last time he would let the fire dissipate before begining building up chakra again. He maintained his focus on his chakra, building it up quickly and flowing it through his body and into his tanto when he was done. The sword started to heat up and when it did, he released the chakra stored within it, forming a shroud of fire around the blade which followed the movement of the blade, drawing from the chakra within it to stay lit. He would then dissipate the chakra flow and sheath his tanto, taking a quick rest before starting again.* - Sat Sep 26 00:30:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) pushed off the wall and stretched his arms a bit, "Welp, Time to train again."* - Sat Sep 26 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) took his tanto from it's sheath, holding it by it's hilt with both hands. As he did this he would be building up chakra in preperation for practise. He would be aiming to strengthen the flames of the chakra flow hopefully. He pushed his chakra into the blade and then expanded it out into a shroud, trying to pour more chakra into the blade to produce stronger flames. He managed to do so, but lost control after a few seconds.

He shook his arms off and began building up chakra in preperation again. Once he was ready he poured his chakra into his weapon, focusing on the blade. Once he released the stored chakra to form the fire shroud he would push more chakra into it, trying to increase the strength of the flames that were produced. The flames once again grew bright before dissipating once he lost control of the chakra flow.

Once more he re-adjusted his grip on the tanto and began building chakra up as quickly as he could, he liked doing this as it was good battle practise. When he was ready he flowed his chakra into the blade and formed the shroud with it, attempting to push more and more chakra into the flames to increase their strength. He could hold it for a little longer now but eventually the flames would burn out quickly.

Once the flames had burned out he began building up his chakra again, taking only second to do so. Once that was done he repeated the process of flowing his chakra into his blade, trying to push more and more chakra into it to create and even stronger chakra flow. The flames once again burst through the chakra quickly but he was managing to produce a large and strong shroud of fire.

Again he let the flames burn out before quickly moulding up the chakra he needed for the chakra flow. When that was done he continued on to flow chakra through his body and into the tanto, focusing his chakra on the blade of the weapon. He formed the shroud around it and poured more and more chakra in, increasing the power of the flames as much as he could until they eventually burned out from chakra consumption. He sheathed his tanto and headed back to where everyone seemed to hang out in Kumo* - Sat Sep 26 03:12:25 2015
