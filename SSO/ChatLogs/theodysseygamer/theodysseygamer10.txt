<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) would be staying in Kumo for a while so he thought he might as well get some training done, the ground around here was perfect for training doton jutsu anyway. He'd start with the easiest one he knew, Mud Shilhouette. He began building chakra up, focusing his chakra on the doton nature type. When he was done building his chakra up he calpped his hands together, pushing chakra to them. He then placed his hands on the ground, kneading his chakra into the ground also. Once that was done he'd use his chakra to try and liquify the ground into a muddy substance, forming a medium sized mud puddle.

He moved to a different spot and began building up chakra again, making sure to focus his chakra on the doton nature type which was slightly difficult for him since he was most used to using that nature type. He clapped his hands together and bent down, placing them onto the ground. He started to knead his chakra into the ground as best he could. When he was done he used the chakra he kneaded into the ground to turn it into a muddy substance, making a puddle a little bit bigger than before.

Once again he moved to a different place to practise since the mud had not dried yet. Once he was in a different spot he placed his hands together to begin building up chakra again, making sure to keep his focus like before. Once he was done he'd clap his hands together, kneeled down and placed his hands on the ground. He spread his chakra through the ground as best he could and when he was ready, used it to change the ground into a muddy puddle that was of medium size.

Now he was getting used to using this jutsu he was becoming a little faster with it. He moved to a different spot and began building up his chakra again, doing it a little faster this time. Once he was done he clapped his hands together and bent over, placing his hands on the ground. Once he had kneaded his chakra into the ground he used it to turn the ground into a slushy mud, making a slightly larger amount than before.

He figured he'd practise it one more time before taking a short rest. Standing up straight he moved placement again and began building up chakra quickly. When he was ready he repeated the process of placing his hands on the ground and kneading his chakra into the ground. He turned the ground into mud as best he could, making a large-ish puddle. He stood up and dusted his hands off, walking off shortly after.* - Mon Sep 21 12:56:19 2015
