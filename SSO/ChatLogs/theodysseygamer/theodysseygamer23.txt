<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) unbinded the scroll Hideki gave to him and sat down it it, rolling it out across the floor. His eyes got to work, starting to scan the scroll for information on the jutsu. He soon found out it wasn't a jutsu, but a taijutsu technique...with a sigh he kept going, he wanted to learn this so that he could learn how to summon from Hideki. The first bit of information he came across was the stance, detailing where and how to place your footing, body and arm to get maximum efficiency from the maneuver.

Next he read about the first part of the technique, a feint high-kick to the opponent. The scroll had a lot of diagrams for him to follow which was quite obvious since this was a physical maneuver and not a ninjutsu. He read and saw how you needed to bring your leg up to the opponents head while twisting your body to spin yourself around. You had to be fast when doing this as you needed to both bring you leg up to adequate height while also maintaining a spin, not the easiest thing to pull off.

Next came the second part of the technique, the actual low-kick you would be delivering to the opponent. This detailed about how while mid high-kick and spin, you would lower you leg and body down as you spun around in a 360 motion, using you leg to sweep the feet from under your enemy asyou moved around. He looked on how to do this, which was basically a reverse maneuver of the last technique expect you had to lower your body by using you hands to balance yourself as you got close to the ground and then sweep you foot into the legs of the enemy.

The next part was how to combine these two, detailing how you should be moved you leg and body as one fluid movement. It inscribed how you needed to move you foot and leg around in one movement, bringing it up, sweeping it at the face of the enemy, then bringing it down and sweeping at the legs of the opponent. He read that your body should be limber and ready to stretch and bend at a moments notice to transition from a high to a low-kick to the enemy. The last part was about using you hands to help you balance yourself while spinning to perform the high-kick, then using them to support and balance yourself while doing the low kick.

With all this in mind he stood up and looked down at the scroll, making sure he could read it fine. He then looked over a few things, getting himself into position. With one last look at how to move your arms and legs he began the taijutsu technique, spinning his body and lifting his leg up as best he could to sweep kick the head of the enemy, then bringing it down to sweep at his legs. His movements were janky and not very fluid, lacking proper practise but he felt he had the basics under control. He sat down again to look through the scroll, making sure he was getting things right. He'd probably need to refer back to the scroll to perform this again, but he was making good progress.* - Sat Oct 10 20:02:46 2015
