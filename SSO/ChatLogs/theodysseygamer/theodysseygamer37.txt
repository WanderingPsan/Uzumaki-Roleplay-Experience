<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Saying you don't care if you die? Thinking like that? That just makes your death all the more likely. - Tue Oct 27 22:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: You won't survive if you don't /want/ to survive. You won't get anywhere in life if you don't /want/ to get there. - Tue Oct 27 22:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: This.. apathetic hopelessness, just hampers you. - Tue Oct 27 22:49:36 2015

A dying village? HAH. Where am I going to get in life? Chuunin? Jounin? Yeah, fantastic goals, real thrilling. I don't care because theres no point in caring, The more I care the more I hurt. If I care then when I die it will only be all the more painful...so no, I don't care."* - Tue Oct 27 22:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Because dying for no point would be wasteful. - Tue Oct 27 22:53:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Living for no reason would be wasteful as well. I suggest you find a goal, something to care for. - Tue Oct 27 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: You stopped me from burning the mansion down. - Tue Oct 27 22:54:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: And if you don't find something to live for, you'll just keep finding yourself back there... - Tue Oct 27 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Crying until you kill yourself. - Tue Oct 27 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It doesn't have to be a person, or anything like that. - Tue Oct 27 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Something...TO CARE FOR!? - Tue Oct 27 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But a goal- something to want, something to live for. - Tue Oct 27 22:54:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: Hrhngh. Anything can set off this damn nutcase, can't it? - Tue Oct 27 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Why should I care for anyone anymore? - Tue Oct 27 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: You're simply wrong. Continuing to think the way you are now, will only cause you more pain in the long run, and eventually kill you in a wasteful, meaningless fashion. - Tue Oct 27 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? I didn't say a person. - Tue Oct 27 22:55:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: You can care about goals, about dreams. About causes, about desires. - Tue Oct 27 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Everything leads to pain one way or the other. - Tue Oct 27 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Because if you don't, your life is meaningless. Because if you decide you want to never feel pain- you'll shortly find that you'll never feel joy, either. - Tue Oct 27 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I'm just cutting that pain out now. - Tue Oct 27 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: If you avoid investing, avoid caring, avoid /trying/, all you'll be is a meaningless heap of shit incapable of joy, pain, or anything more than a dull, pathetic, meaningless apathy. - Tue Oct 27 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Good. - Tue Oct 27 22:57:16 2015
