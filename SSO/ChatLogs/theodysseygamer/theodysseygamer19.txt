<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Not yet...I have many other jutsu to practise too... - Sun Oct  4 01:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I was about to do that but...then this happened... - Sun Oct  4 01:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I see. - Sun Oct  4 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: What are you practicing. - Sun Oct  4 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: E-Earth Flash... - Sun Oct  4 01:43:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: O...Ok...I'm not that good yet... - Sun Oct  4 01:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) brought each arm partially forward, setting up to form each handseal quickly. He begins by kneading chakra within his body, taking only a few seconds to do so. Once that was done he swiftly went through all five of the handseals for the jutsu, holding one hand out infront of himself after he did. He would then send his built up chakra through his body and down his arm, amassing it at his hand. A few small streaks of lightning would then crack around his hand as he thurst it forward towards the floor, sending very weak, small streaks of lightning into the ground.

"Uh...I'm...not very adept at it yet..." he said, pulling his arm back as he did and taking up a rather recluse like stance, a little embarrased with his sub-par performance.* - Sun Oct  4 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) watched and learn, absorbing all the information given to him, he may not have looked or acted like it but he was quite smart in that regard. He took note of how much better Suitengu was at the jutsu than him, feeling a little disappointed in himself. With a sigh he looked back up at Suitengu, "I know...I just need more practise is all...I have been busy practising Fireball jutsu and only just started with this one...I'll get better quickly..."* - Sun Oct  4 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Just keep training. Despite what people may say, knowledge is the real key to surviving in this world. - Sun Oct  4 02:06:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I hope he comes back. - Sun Oct  4 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) came to some kind of field in Amegakure to train in, now that he had trained fireball jutsu all he could it was time to move onto a new jutsu to train, specifically a lightning one; Earth Flash. He had practised this a bit before, but that was just to learn it, he was totally new at the technique but he figured he'd catch on quickly. He began, of course, by kneading chakra within his stomach, adding a vibration to it as he did to apply the lightning chakra nature. He then went over each handseal in his head, Boar, Ram, Snake, Horse, Dragon before forming all five quickly. Once that was done he held his hand out and pushed his built up chakra to that hand, surrounding it in a weak lightning. He then pushed his hand forward, a small stream of lightning coming from it and hitting the ground, dying out quickly after.

It was a good first attempt, at least to grasp the basics but he knew it would be a while before he could shoot off a decent stream of lightning. Instead he'd first focus on building up the power of the jutsu, then practising it further. Again he began by kneading chakra within his body, adding vibrations to it to give his chakra the lightning nature change. Once he was done he'd slowly go through each handseal, trying to memorize them better as he did. He then pushed his chakra up through his body and down into his arm, small streaks of lightning emminating from his hand again, he focused on it, trying to refine his control over his chakra.

He cut off the chakra to his hand after the jutsu had gotten weaker and began building up chakra in his stomach again, adding the nature change to it. Once more he went over the hand seals in his head before actually forming each one, getting a bit faster each time he did. Once the handseals were done he held his hand out and pushed his chakra to it, small streaks of lightning once again coursing around his hand. The lightning seemed to be stronger as he focused on his chakra each time he did this, continually trying to refine his use of the jutsu.

When the lightning dissipated he would start up again, building up chakra within his body and eventually applying the nature change to it. When he was again ready he formed each handseal of the jutsu and pushed his chakra up through his body and into his hand. As he held his hand out he concentrated on the chakra gathered there, small lightning struts firing crackling across his hand every so often. He maintained his focus on the chakra, trying to refine his control over it while keeping the vibrations of his chakra at a decent level. Slowly he was begining to grasp a better understanding and use of this jutsu.

Again the lightning would dissipated and he would start building chakra up once more, adding vibrations to it as best he could to apply the lightning nature change. When he was ready he quickly formed all five handseals of the jutsu and held a hand out, gathering his built up chakra there. As he did this he once again refocused on his chakra, trying to keep it's power as best he could. He knew that due to his lack of control his chakra was losing vibration and in effect, power. He continued to increase his chakra output, trying to make up for his lack of control.

He was getting fatigued but he pushed for one more, building up chakra again as soon as the lightning chakra gathered at his hand diminished. Once he had built up a sufficient amount of chakra he formed the handseals for the jutsu and  gathered chakra at his hand, causing lightning to once again crackle around it. Again he kept increasing the power output of the jutsu, trying to train himself to become proficient with the correct levels he should be using. The lightning was now looking much stronger than before, but still needed some work. By the time it had burned out his hand was left numb and his body fatigued, time to rest a while.* - Sun Oct  4 02:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) once he had rested for an hour or two and had eaten quite a bit he got back to the area he was in before and began training again. He would  of course begin by kneading chakra within his body, adding vibrations to it to apply the lightning nature change needed. Once that was done he quickly went through each handseal of the jutsu and held one hand out, gathering his chakra there. Again lightning would spring around his hand, it becoming more and more violent as he added more and more chakra to it. The lightning was started to become powerful now, but he had to keep going.

Once the jutsu had dissipated he regained his posture and began building up chakra again, making sure to apply the usual nature change to it. When he was ready again he formed the handseals adeptly and amassed his chakra to his hand, keeping focused on it to ramp up the vibrations and in essence, the power. His hand was starting to feel a little numb due to the lightning irratic behavior from his lack of control but he kept going, knowing he could still apply more power to the jutsu. Once the jutsu had run its course he shook his hand off for a few seconds before begining again.

Again he would repeat this process, kneading chakra within his body and applying the lightning nature change to it. He zipped through the handseals, having become quite acquianted to them now. Once all that was done he held out his hand and gathered his chakra there like before, lightning sparking to life as he did. He continued to concentrate on his chakra, continually try to apply more and more power to it, knowing that he could better the power of the jutsu. Although the lightning now looked powerful, it still wasn't like what Suitengu had produced so in his mind, it still wasn't good enough.

When the jutsu dissipated again he noticed small burns across his hand, a long with a numbness in his fingers. He figured for safe measures he would switch hands he was using, just to be safe. With that he built up more chakra, formed the handseals, held out his other hand and gathered his chakra there. He continued to push his chakra levels, trying to squeeze out all the power he could from it. The lightning was now looking much more potent than before and he figured with a couple more tries, he would have this part down.

With the jutsu once again dissipating he began building up chakra once again, shaking off the hand he used at it was feeling a little funky. Once he was done with his chakra he switftly went through each of the handseals and focused his chakra to his hand. He concentrated on the chakra, trying to increase the vibrations as much as he possibly could. The lightning produced was now incredibly irratic, sparking off all over the place. He cut off the chakra supply before it could get too dangerous and started to try again.

With the lightning now this powerful he felt he only needed to experience doing this once more time before he began trying to refine the control of it. Once he had built his chakra up to a good standard he formed each handseal as quickly as he could and held his other hand out once more. Again he would concentrate chakra there, forcing lightning to spring to life within and around his hand. He continued to ramp it's power up, lightning crackling and cracking across his arm and hand. His hand started to pain as he could no longer contain the power of the lightning, shutting off the chakra supply instantly. His hand was burned, nothing more than a few blisters but he would need to keep this in mind for his next set of training. For now he was tired and wanted to rest his hand a little, he'd continue training after he had slept a while.* - Sun Oct  4 03:20:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) looked down at the ground, rubbing his neck with his hand for a few seconds as he did. He kinda regretted speaking to Ortho since he himself was such a recluse but he wanted to make the effort to at least make something out of all of this, even if it was just a short-term friend. He looked Ortho back in the eye and reluctantly said, "Takeda...How...How you been doing..?"* - Sun Oct  4 15:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) thought about his current state of affairs too, he wasn't too bad really, he didn't have any family left alive coming from a Shinobi family background. Of course his home had been wrecked and for all he knew some other worldly monster had made it's home in the wreckage of Konoha. He supposed he was pretty good, All he really needed to focus on was getting stronger and that was what he was doing in Konoha anyway. "Uh yeah...About the same here...Just trying to get by I guess."* - Sun Oct  4 16:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) felt a little bad inside, it wasn't that sparring wasn't his thing it was just he felt his power was lacking and didn't want to make a mockery of himself or Ortho. He promised himself he would spar Ortho eventually...but he just didn't feel ready quite yet. At the mention of Suitengu his head shot up again, he hadn't seen him in a while and the last he heard he was taking the private exams..."Oh yeah...Suitengu...Last time I spoke to him he was leaving to take the private exams...I haven't seen him since..."* - Sun Oct  4 16:26:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) stood up and walked a little ways away from everyone. "Guess I'll just go train..."* - Sun Oct  4 22:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) went and stood in no place in perticular in Amegakure, once again preparing to get some jutsu practise in. He had recently been practising Earth Flash so it was time to start that back up. Now that he had the correct amount of power with the jutsu it was time to refine the control of it. Kneading chakra within his body he began vibrating his chakra to a high degree. When he was done he formed the five handseals for the jutsu and held his hand out, gathering his chakra there. Large and powerful struts of lightning began crackling around his hand, he concentrated on the chakra there, trying to refine the vibrations of it and not use any excess chakra.

The jutsu was burning out too fast due to his lack of control, he needed to work on that. It was also leaving his hand numb and occasionally burned, something else he'd need to work on.  Again he kneaded chakra within his body, vibrating it as he did to give it the lightning nature change. Once that was done he formed the handseals for the jutsu and began gathering chakra to a held out hand. As lighting sparked to lift in and around his hand he focused on it, trying to keep the chakra reserve for it while also maintaining the jutsu by controling the chakra. He managed to make the jutsu last a little longer, but it was still dying out fast.

Again he began kneading chakra within his body, applying the lightning nature change when he was ready. As soon as his chakra was ready he raised his hands up slightly and quickly went through all five handseals the jutsu required. Once he did that he held one of his hands out and gathered his chakra to it, officially starting the jutsu with a flash of lighting covering his hand. He concentrated on his chakra again, trying to reserve it as best he could while also keeping the jutsu active. The jutsu again lasted a little longer but was still dying out quickly. As the jutsu deactivated he felt a numbness come from his hand, not realising he had burned it a bit. "Time to switch hands..." he thought to himself.

After shaking off and resting his hand a bit he felt comfortable continuing, begining again by building up his chakra and adding the usual nature change to it. When he was ready he went through the handseals of the jutsu as quickly as he could, always trying to train and increase his handseal speed. He then held out his other hand, gathering his chakra to it like before. With a small crackle lightning sprung to life around his hand, wizzing around his hand and fingers. He concentrated on the chakra he was sending to his hand, trying to reserve and retain it as best he could. The jutsu seemed to be lasting longer and longer, but it still never work.

Again he shook his hand off before starting again, building up his chakra like he had been doing before. He then went through each of the handseals required by the jutsu and held the hand he used before out, amassing chakra to it. As his hand sparked to life with lightning he concentrated on the chakra present at his hand, once more trying to refine his use of the chakra to make sure he wasn't overusing it or expending it unneccesarily. The lightning now seemed to be holding for much longer than before after his continued practse of it, he figured he'd try one last time before resting for a while.

He was determined to get this over with quickly so he could go rest, the chakra toll was taking it out on his body a bit. In anycase once he was done building his chakra up he formed the hanseals as fast as he could and held his hand out to gather chakra there and start the lightning up. Once the jutsu had got going he continued to focus his efforts on refining his control over the chakra, trying to reserve everything as best he could. He managed to get the jutsu to last much longer now and he figured it would only get better with more practise. When all that was done he simply sat down and rested his aching hands, maybe eating something later when he felt like it.* - Sun Oct  4 22:21:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) did as Suitengu suggested, slowly getting out the two scrolls Suitengu had given him. He looked at the two and picked the one labled, 'Mud wolves' to read, placing the other back. He found it hard to open the scroll at first, his hands still numb from his previous training but he got it eventually. He placed the scroll onto the ground and unrolled it, begining to read through it.

As he began reading through it he saw what it meant by the name 'mud wolves' as the jutsu literally made wolves of mud. The first thing he read about was how one needed to seal this jutsu into a scroll, meaning it couldn't be prepared easily in the midst of battle. It described how you needed to lay the trap with the scroll and place it down in an area you deemed neccessary.

He moved on, reading about how you set the trap off, it was simple really, all you needed to do was coax the enemy into coming into contact with the trap, their foreign chakra would then set the trap off and release what you have in store for them. He read the details about how to perform such a feat, the feat being the ability to set the trap off with the opponents chakra.

The jutsu then went on to describe how to actually set the scroll up. This was also simple but he could see why it would take time. You simply form the mud wolves and seal them into the scroll for later use. It seemed like three was the max amount you could use, but that was a pretty decent amount in his mind. The fact that the wolves were made out of mud, also seemed quite genius to him.

Right on cue the next part of the scroll was about the wolves themselves, how they needed to be made out of mud because of how the functioned. The wolves functioned a lot like a mud clone, being able to reform after being struck. This made them useful in the fact that they can either be used to slow the enemy down while you attacked, prepared or ran away. The wolves being prepared before hand also gave you the bonus of them not draining you in battle.

He would have read more, but his hands were feeling much better now so he figured it was time to train again. He rebound the scroll and put it away, standing up to begin practise again.* - Mon Oct  5 00:06:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) takes a small step back, nothing major, just to signify he was turning to leave the area. "I'm going to...go train in a...more quiet place..." he would say, turning quickly after and walking odd if he had been allowed. His voice shaked as much as his body, he was clearly scared of the man that just told him he was a serier killer...he was only twelbe years old after all. As he walked away he would be thinking to himself, "Have I fell in with the wrong crowd of people..?"* - Mon Oct  5 00:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Very well. - Mon Oct  5 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) walked off into a quiet area and began building up chakra and applying the lightning nature change to it in preperation for practising Earth Flash. Now he could hold it for longer it was time to control the power level of it so it didn't pain his hands. He formed the five handseals for the jutsu and held his hand out, gathering his chakra to it. As the lightning gathered around his hand he concentrated on it, trying to keep the vibrations under control his hand was already starting to pain and go numb after a while so he cut the chakra off and started again.

He would be building chakra up once more, making sure the apply the chakra nature change to it by vibrating his chakra as he kneaded it with his body. He then deftly formed all of the handseals for the jutsu, holding his hand out again after doing so. He then gathered chakra to his hand once more, picking up where he last left off. He focused on the vibrations of his chakra and tried to keep them in check, making sure they weren't being too irratic and weren't damaging his hand. While his hand was still feeling the effects of the lightning, he seemed to be lessening it slowly.

Once the jutsu had again dissipated he began kneading chakra within his body once more, taking his time with the chakra nature change to become more and more accustomed to it. When he was ready he zipped through each handseal, having become very accustomed to them now and held his hand out. Once more he amassed chakra to his hand and began focusing on refining his control over the vibrations. He was getting a pretty good grasp of how to control the vibrations now, his hand barely feeling numb at all after holding it for a while. He felt comfortable moving on to practise refining his control over the lightning.

As he was kneading chakra within his body again he raised his hands to prepare to form the handseals and noticed that the hand he was using up until now was blistered, he'd need to switch which hand he was using. Regardless he was now ready to try again, forming the handseals and gathering chakra to his other hand. This time he kept focused on both the vibrations of his chakra and how the chakra moved, trying to refine it so it didn't come into contact too much with his hand. By the time he dissipated the jutsu his hand had suffered a few burns but it seemed he was getting better at controling this jutsu.

Happy with the progress he was making he continued on, even if a little fatigued from chakra consumption and the pain emminating from his hands. He continued kenading chakra within himself and when ready, formed the handseals like usual. When he gathered his chakra to his hand and started the jutsu he again continued focusing on it, continually refining the vibrations of the chakra and his general control over the lightning. Once more when the jutsu dissipated his hand had a few minor burns on it but nothing that wouldn't heal over night.

He figured he'd practise one last time before heading back to rest, just to get the refinement down. Quickly he built his chakra up, becoming more and more acquainted with the lightning chakra nature. He motioned through the handseals as quick as he could and held his hand out, gathering his chakra to it like before. Again he focused on the chakra he was pushing into his hand, making sure the vibrations and the lightning itself was under his control exactly how he wanted it to be. When he felt he had enough he dissipated the jutsu and began walking back, his hand barely suffering burns that time. He knew that he still needed more practise, but he was doing much better now.* - Mon Oct  5 01:22:46 2015

He would watch the match between Suitengu and Darius for a little bit first, just to see the next development.* - Mon Oct  5 02:36:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) let his eyes slowly sink down to the parchment of the scroll, his eyes scanning it for information once more. He read over some of the stuff he had learned about before, just to job his memory. Once he got back to his place he continued on. He looked over some of the handseals for the jutsu, practising and memorizing them slowly as he went. They all seemed quite easy, just simple and usual earth style handseals. He practised this a few times to get it into his head before continuing on, shifting his eyes through the text rather quickly.

He eventually read about how to perform the jutsu itself, it was almost like fuuinjutsu, just a very, very basic type of it. This made him slightly more interested as he did like Fuuinjutsu and wanted to dabble into it later in life. He read about how to prepare the scroll for the trap, what handseals you needed to use and how to prepare the actual trap that would be sprung. All of it seemed quite easy in his head, then again he was quite smart so most things did, he knew however that in practise this was going to be much harder.

The scroll also detailed about preparing this in or around a muddy area so the quality of the jutsu and the trap being sprung was of a higher degree and therefore, much more likely to succeed and fulfill it's purpose. This did worry him slightly since he didn't know many muddy areas...he would have to ask someone about that. For now he continued reading, learning more about how to prepare for this in a better manner and how to save time on some things, even detailing how you could potentially set this up in battle.

As he read on he learned about a few things to do with doton, specifically how you can better prepare this jutsu by doing certain things with your chakra like making it a little liquified like mud or by creating your own mud with your chakra or another doton jutsu. Most of it seemed to be trivial stuff but to an inquisitive mind like his, it was still valuable information that he would have been using in the future when practising and using this jutsu, he just needed to get through all this first.

Soon he would come to the end of the scroll, not having much else to take away from it. The last little end bit were more about how you could use the jutsu in a combat situation and history bits, interesting...but not that useful. Instead he skim read those parts and went back through the scroll, lightly brushing over the key points that he had been going through up until now. When he eventually got to the end of the scroll again he knew that he was done reading the scroll, his next step would simply be using the scroll to reference off of as he practising the jutsu for the first time, but what would have to wait for now.* - Mon Oct  5 03:45:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Heh. - Mon Oct  5 04:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) walks off, not too far from the group but far enough where lightning wouldn't suddenly start zapping them.* - Mon Oct  5 04:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) started kneading chakra within himself to practise Earth Flash again. Now that he had the control down all that was left was to practise the jutsu itself. He knew it could be used two ways, either ending the lightning through the earth or through the air. He figured through the air would be easier so started with that. When he was done kneading chakra in his body he formed the handseals and sent the chakra to his hand, remembering to keep up with the control. He then knelt down and placed his hand on the ground, pulsing his lightning through the ground. It didn't get very farbut certainly caused damage as it surged through the earth.

He would start up again, happy with his preliminary progress. He could already half guess what he was doing wrong, but wanted to run another quick test just to be sure. When he was done with kneading chakra in his body he performed the handseals and gathered his chakra to a held out hand. He then kneeled down and placed his hand flat to the ground, surging his chakra and the lightning through the ground again like last time. Also like last time the same thing happened, there was damage but it was very sort ranged and not concentrated.

Now he knew what the problem was, he simply needed to focus and concentrate his chakra, giving it direction. As soon as he was ready he began kneading chakra within his body, finishing doing so quickly. When he finished he formed each handseal for the jutsu and amassed his built up chakra to his hand, completing the jutsu. Once more he knelt down and placed his hand to the ground, surging the lightning through his hand and into the ground. As he did this he focused his efforts on the chakra he was expelling, trying his best to concentrate and focus it to move straight forward as one entity. He got some traction with this, but a lot of it still went off wildly.

Again he stood up and began kneading chakra in his body, making sure as always to apply the lightning nature change to it, taking only seconds to do so. As soon as he finished he took barely any time to complete the handseals of the jutsu and concentrate his chakra to his hand, lightning forming all around it. He bent down again and placed his hand to the ground, pushing the lightning into it. He focused on his chakra, trying to hold it all together and push it all in one direction. Slowly but surely he was managing to focus the lightning, getting better with each try.

With that in mind he began once more, building up the chakra he needed to perform the jutsu with. Taking only seconds to build his chakra up he found himself motioning through the five handseals of the jutsu quick as a flash. Also quick as a flash was the lightning now buzzing around his hand as he gathered his chakra there. Again he placed his hand to the ground and pushed his chakra into the ground, lightning cracking and searing the ground as he focused most of it in a single direction. He had this down mostly now, being able to concentrate his chakra in the direction he wanted, he figured he'd practise one more time before resting a while.

The thought of having a good rest on his mind he quickly zipped through building up his chakra, performing the handseals and gathering his chakra to his hand all in quick succession, It's amazing what motivation can do. With all that preperation done quickly he placed his hand to the ground one last time and surged his chakra through the earth, focusing it all in one direction, specifically right infront of himself. The lightning sprung off, carving and crackling through the ground and leaving a trail behind it. Once it had dissipated he stood up and walked off, going to rest a while.* - Mon Oct  5 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) went back to the spot he was training in before, ready to begin again after his well earned rest. Now that he could successfully send his lightning through the ground successfully it was time to up it's power. Once he had finished building his chakra up he formed the handseals and sent his chakra down to his hand, concentrating it there. As he placed his hand to the ground and began surging his chakra into it he increased the vibrations of the lightning which had a noticable effect on the damage he caused but not much.

He began again, building his chakra up and forming the handseals for the jutsu. When that was done he once again pushed his chakra to his hand, concentrating it there. As he did lightning would flash around it, signalling the jutsu was ready. He placed his hand against the ground again and surged the lightning through his palm and into the earth, making sure to focus the direction the lightning as he did. Also as he did this he would continue to vibrate his chakra more and more, trying to increase the power of the jutsu.

As the lightning dissipated he started up again, begining by kneading chakra within his body and applying the lightning nature change to it. Within seconds he was ready to begin, performing the handseals for the jutsu flawlessly. As he finished that he held his hand out and focused his chakra there, lightning springing to life in his very palm. He placed hand hand to the ground and pushed his lightning forward again, making sure to keep increasing the vibrations of his chakra as much as he could. His hand started to burn slightly again as he was losing control of the lightning from the fierce vibrations.

He kept going, knowing he could squeeze just a little more power out of this. Once the lightning was done he stood back up, refocused himself and began building up chakra again. Once more he took only seconds to build his chakra up, flying through the handseals of the jutsu just as fast. He then concentrated his built up chakra to his hand and placed it across the ground, increasing the vibrations of his chakra as soon as he released the lightning. The palm of his hand started to suffer burns again, but he was sure that with a little more practise, he could stop that.

Now that he had felt he had increased the power of the jutsu to as much as he possibly could he would practise getting used to doing so to help him better control the lightning and not burn himself. After a few seconds of kneading chakra he formed the handseals for the jutsu, almost like second nature to him now and pushed his chakra to his hand. As he did he placed his hand against the ground and surged the lightning forward, concentrating on keeping the vibrations steady while also focusing his lightning into the ground.

His hand was less burned that time, much to his pleasure. One more time he would practise this before laying his head to rest, he had been training basically non-stop for a while now and while the little rests were nice, he did need proper time to recover. As he had finished building chakra up one last time he formed the handseals quickly and focused his chakra to his now aching hand. Once that was done he quickly bent down and placed his hand to the earth, surging his chakra through it. The lightning tore up the ground as he concentrated on keeping the vibrations and control in balance. Once he was done he picked his hand and himself off the ground and saw no new burns on his hand, "Time to sleep..." He said to himself quietly, walking off just after.* - Mon Oct  5 06:11:12 2015
