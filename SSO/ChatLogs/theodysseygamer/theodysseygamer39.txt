<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) runs off quick.* - Fri Oct 30 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) Came to the training field to begin his new training regime, he was going to need a tough one to pass this exam. It would be his first real bit of training in a long while. In any case he now had a load of jutsu to work on thanks to Izanami and Ortho, time to make good on that. He needed to finish up with great breakthrough first though so that's what he'd be working on now. He had already been building up chakra so it was a simple matter of forming a few handseals and then sending said chakra to his hand. Once it was at his hand he would then begin sharpening the chakra over itself, forming it into sharp, fine edges. With a thrust of his arm he sent his hand, along with his chakra, forward, creating a large gust of wind.

With his first practise out of the way it would be the spark that ignited his ambition to train once more, in a fulfilment kind of way rather than proper ambition. He remembered what he was working on last time, the timing and execution of the jutsu. With that in mind he continued on with building his chakra up for a second practise. Once his chakra had been built up he would quickly form the handseals of the jutsu and concentrate his chakra to his hand. With the chakra now at his hand he would start adding the wind nature change to it, sharpening it over itself as much as he could. With all the preparations complete he would push his hand forward, trying his best to release all his chakra at once, expelling a large burst of wind as he did.

The reason he was working on the timing was so that he could release all his chakra at once without problem, this would mean that the jutsus power would be maximized to prevent any loss of power, at least in his mind it worked that way. In any case he would continue on with building up chakra, doing so quickly. With his chakra built up he would again form the handseals of the jutsu and hold his hand out, gathering his chakra to it shortly after. With his chakra in his palm he would add the wind nature change to it to fully prepare for the jutsu. Pushing his hand forward he would attempt to once again release all of his chakra at once in the form of a gust of wind.

He felt he was getting the hand of it, though some chakra was being 'left behind' as it were. He would continue to work on this though, it had to be perfect. Building up chakra again he would try and block as both the outside and his own thought, focusing almost solely on his chakra. Once his chakra had been prepared he would perform the handseals of the jutsu and send his chakra down to his hand to apply the wind nature change. With that done he simply thrust his arm forward, attempting to release all his chakra in one massive burst. Again he would produce a massive burst of wind, sending it through the air.

He felt he nearly had this down, just a little more practise and he could move onto the next stage of this, the timing. With that in mind he would start building up chakra again, spending all his efforts on doing so to complete the task quickly. When his chakra had been fully built up he would form the handseals of the jutsu within a second, holding his hand out just after. He would then send his chakra down to that hand, concentrating it to his palm. Then he would begin sharpening the chakra over itself to apply the wind nature change. With all that done only one thing would be left, the actually execution of the jutsu and with that, he thrust his arm forward and release all of his chakra at once, expelling a large and powerful burst of wind.

That time he felt like he had expelled all of his chakra at once but just to be sure he wanted to practise one last time, beginning building up chakra once more. Once his chakra had been built up he would bring his hands together and form the handeals for the jutsu. With those done he would then hold his hand out and gather his chakra to his palm, applying the wind nature change to his chakra as he did. Once all that had been fully prepared he would then thrust his hand forward and release his chakra all at once just like before, producing another large burst of wind.
