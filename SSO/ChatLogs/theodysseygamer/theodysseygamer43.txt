<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I am Takeda, Genin and adviser of the Hokage. - Tue Nov  3 19:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: ... - Tue Nov  3 19:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: She's dead. - Tue Nov  3 19:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..... - Tue Nov  3 19:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Hm? - Tue Nov  3 19:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) turns to Heiwa, looking at him with much colder eyes than usual. "That's how it is Heiwa, So I became the new Advisor." he would then turn back to the two new faces, wanting to get formalities out of the way first. "Would you two mind introducing yourselves?" he asked, looking back and forth at Yonbu and Kurt.* - Tue Nov  3 19:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) doesn't even bother to turn around, he figured it was either the use of Shunshin or he was simply that fast. In any case without even looking back he would say, "Nice to meet you Kurt. Are you a shinobi of this village?" not a hint of fear of hesitation would be shown in his voice or on his face. He had dealt with far more menacing people than someone moving behind him at a fast pace.* - Tue Nov  3 19:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) shrugs his shoulders, he didn't really want to deal with someone like this right now. "By your response I guess that's a no. Either way welcome to Konoha, Kurt. I hope you enjoy your stay here." he would say, settling his gaze on Yonbu after. He would step forward to get a better view of him. "And you?"* - Tue Nov  3 19:24:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: I am looking for missions to accomplish. - Tue Nov  3 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Oh, No sorry. - Tue Nov  3 19:49:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Oh and Rias, Don't worry about putting a message with the flowers. - Tue Nov  3 19:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: It won't make a difference. - Tue Nov  3 19:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Why? - Tue Nov  3 20:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: It should always have kind words with them - Tue Nov  3 20:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: My mother is dead, these flowers are for her grave. - Tue Nov  3 20:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: ...  - Tue Nov  3 20:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) was more than a little surprised by what she did. He almost flinched as she hugged onto him tightly, pulling him against her frame. What probably surprised him the most was the fact that she had kissed him on the cheek, he wouldn't resist. A small tear rolled down his face as he hugged her back, her height, figure, hair, age, kiss and overwhelming kindness all reminded him of Hana. He hugged her back tightly to show his appreciation, whispering to her, "Thank you Rias...it means a lot."* - Tue Nov  3 20:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ... - Tue Nov  3 20:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: If I hadn't been here she wouldn't have died.. - Tue Nov  3 20:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: She only died because she wanted me in her family. - Tue Nov  3 20:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) allowed the tear to be wipes away, pulling away from her as she did. He would nod to her as she turned to walk off. "I'll wait for you here." He would say to her, before turning to Heiwa.* - Tue Nov  3 20:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Ok~ - Tue Nov  3 20:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: How'd she die? - Tue Nov  3 20:40:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Oh...Yeah. - Tue Nov  3 20:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I'm not sure...Someone must have come into the mansion and killed her... - Tue Nov  3 20:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) thinks: I can't tell Heiwa the truth...even if he was close to Hana too. - Tue Nov  3 20:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: It was me. - Tue Nov  3 20:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..No one knows who? - Tue Nov  3 20:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Just like Kirie. Just like..everyone.. - Tue Nov  3 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: No, Unfortunately. - Tue Nov  3 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Anyway Heiwa... - Tue Nov  3 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: What are you doing back here? - Tue Nov  3 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Kirigakure is going to be in ruins. - Tue Nov  3 20:45:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: How did she die..? - Tue Nov  3 20:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: There was no hierarchy. There'll likely be a power vacuum that will end up taking the village down. - Tue Nov  3 20:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Someone went into the mansion. - Tue Nov  3 20:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And killed her. - Tue Nov  3 20:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Then blew it up. - Tue Nov  3 20:46:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Sorry about that thing with Rias...that was quite unexpected. - Tue Nov  3 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Hm? - Tue Nov  3 20:55:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) thinks: I sense a lycan - Tue Nov  3 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: You know...the whole hugging and kiss thing... - Tue Nov  3 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: That was really unexpected... - Tue Nov  3 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Kind of awkward too... - Tue Nov  3 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: You there, Dog guy. What's your name? - Tue Nov  3 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Dog guy? - Tue Nov  3 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: My name is Yonbu. - Tue Nov  3 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Yonbu, Perhaps you would be willing to go a round or two against me? - Tue Nov  3 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I don't see how I'd be the one to get upset over that happening to you. - Tue Nov  3 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Would you be willing not to use your sword? - Tue Nov  3 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: I will use it with a hilt. - Tue Nov  3 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...I might be leaving soon. My Uncle might come by. - Tue Nov  3 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Hideki is dead. - Tue Nov  3 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: I'm sorry, But who's he? - Tue Nov  3 21:00:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm. - Tue Nov  3 21:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I wonder when Rias will be back. - Tue Nov  3 21:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm..how has your training been? - Tue Nov  3 21:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Good I guess. - Tue Nov  3 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: It's slow because I have to fill in for the Hokage a lot... - Tue Nov  3 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I'm taking the Private exam too... - Tue Nov  3 21:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..As in the Gezo private exams? - Tue Nov  3 21:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Yes. - Tue Nov  3 21:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Those are.. - Tue Nov  3 21:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Really hard. - Tue Nov  3 21:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You can die from that. - Tue Nov  3 21:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: He can't be ready for that..can he? - Tue Nov  3 21:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I know, I don't really have a choice though. - Tue Nov  3 21:21:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: The training field. - Tue Nov  3 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: After she comes back? Or now? - Tue Nov  3 21:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Now. - Tue Nov  3 21:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I sent her a message. - Tue Nov  3 21:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) starts to walk off, hoping Heiwa would follow.* - Tue Nov  3 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Heiwa. - Tue Nov  3 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Before we start. - Tue Nov  3 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Can I make an odd request? - Tue Nov  3 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A request? - Tue Nov  3 21:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I know you use genjutsu. - Tue Nov  3 21:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Please...don't use hell viewing... - Tue Nov  3 21:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...I don't use Genjutsus in spars. - Tue Nov  3 21:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Good...thanks. - Tue Nov  3 21:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I don't gain anything from it. I don't use it against anyone but an enemy. - Tue Nov  3 21:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Alright. - Tue Nov  3 21:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Do you want to start or should I? - Tue Nov  3 21:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You can start. - Tue Nov  3 21:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Alright then. - Tue Nov  3 21:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) started to build chakra up within his body, applying the wind nature change to his chakra as he did by sharpening his chakra over itself to the best of his ability. He would pull three kunai out and throw them up into the air, focusing his chakra to each hand as he did. As the kunai fell, he would clap his hand, releasing a massive burst of wind that would shoot all three kunai towards Heiwa.* - Tue Nov  3 21:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) tried to follow Heiwa as best he could, he had planned that the weapons wouldn't hit, forcing Heiwa to move. While his sight wasn't 'trained', his body was. Using his reflexes he would turn to face Heiwa, jumping backwards in an attempt to build some distance between himself and Heiwa. As he dashed to the side he would build up more chakra and form a few hand seals. Once his chakra was ready he would focus it to his hand, thrusting his arm forward and releasing his chakra in a large burst of wind. His aim? To knock Heiwa away from him and potentially even knock him over.* - Tue Nov  3 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) was actually quite surprised by the speed of the child, it really was quite impressive. The jab sent his way would ultimately make him flinch as he thrust his own arm forward to release the blast of wind. Much to his surprise the punch wasn't really all he expected, not really effecting him at all physically. It did shake him mentally however, his reaction to the punch sending his arm and jutsu a little off target. While he expected Heiwa would get hit by the wind, it wouldn't be hitting him clean on, more of a glancing blast against either one side of his body or the other depending on which fist he had thrown.* - Tue Nov  3 22:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) smirked at the compliment from Heiwa, continually building up his chakra even as they conversed. "You're pretty quick yourself." he would remark back as he held out a hand, focusing his chakra to it. An ember would form within his palm, he would close his hand into a fist shortly after. He pulled his arm back and then flicked it forward towards Heiwa, opening his fist and releasing the ember as he did. The ember would move quickly towards Heiwa, though it wouldn't be aimed at him, instead being aimed at the ground he stood on.

Heiwa would note that if he should let this ember reach him, it would explode into a fiery explosion upon contact, aiming to try and once again knock Heiwa off his feet. To note, Takeda would be holding back somewhat while using this since...this was an explosion and he didn't want to actually hurt Heiwa badly.* - Tue Nov  3 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) pulled his other hand up, having gathered chakra to that hand to, he would have another ember in his palm. He was about to launch it off again until Heiwa stopped dead, then his words hit the ears of Takeda. He let his chakra, and the ember, dissipated. He would look to where the child motioned to, noticing Rias in the distance. "Ah, Guess that marks the end of our spar for now then, sorry. I had fun Heiwa." he would say, walking over to greet Rias.

Once close enough he would inspect the bouquet, a warm smile emerging on his face. "It looks amazing Rias...did you do this yourself?" he would as the woman.* - Tue Nov  3 22:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: If he comes and wins..it'll mean a lot for my training and how far I've come. - Tue Nov  3 22:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) takes the bouquet in hand, giving a nod to Rias. "Thank you...how much do I owe you..?"* - Tue Nov  3 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Hmm, 2500 is the cost - Tue Nov  3 22:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) leans back a little as he leans the bouquet on his body, holding it up with one hand. With the other now free hand he would reach behind himself, taking out a sizable wad of cash. "Heres 30000, Take is as a years subscription, I'll need more flowers once these die." he would say, holding the cash out for her to take.* - Tue Nov  3 23:01:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) slowly shuffles past Rias, making sure to keep a firm but tender grip on the bouquet as to keep it in place but not ruin it. "This way." he said once he was past her, walking off and expecting her to follow.* - Tue Nov  3 23:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) lead her all the way around the side of the kage mansion, to where he himself had buried his mother. He would place the new bouquet down next to the grave, clearing away the rag-tag bouquet he made when he first buried his mother, it would be all dried and dead by now. It wouldn't take him long to clear everything, then set the new flowers in place. He would stand back, taking a spot close to Rias. "H-how does it look..?" he would ask, hoping he had done a good job.* - Tue Nov  3 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) would turn to Rias after being patted on the shoulder. "Thank you..." he would say, before attempting to place both his arms around her waist area, trying to hug her if she'd let him, not even caring about the dead flowers she held. In the event she did allow him to hug her to would state softly,"Thank you for coming here Rias...you didn't have to. Ever since mum died things have just been so lonely for me...thank you for being here." His voice would start to crackle with emotion. He was afterall, only twelve years of age and sometimes...things did get the better of him.* - Tue Nov  3 23:29:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) flicked through a few papers, pencil in hand. He was going through paperwork for the Hokage. He would look up immediately as Ortho made his presence known. "Ah, Hello Ortho."* - Wed Nov  4 18:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) nods his head to Ortho. "Yeah, well someone has to do it. Plus it's good practise for when i'm actually the Hokage." he said, looking down to sign a couple more papers off. Once more he would look up to Ortho, "How have things been for you?"* - Wed Nov  4 18:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) puts both his paperwork and his pencil down at that, focusing entirely on Ortho. "And why would you do something like that..?"* - Wed Nov  4 18:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) shrugs, it didn't bother him much. It wasn't for him to judge Orthos actions. "I see, well if that's what you feel then that's what you feel. Who were the shinobi you killed? I heard Kirie died recently, was that by your action?"* - Wed Nov  4 18:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) nods his head. "Ah, I see. Well, I didn't really know those two so I don't really care. Apparently some woman came looking for me a while back, attacked Ziare and then left...though this could just be Ziare lying because he wouldn't tell me who it was. I'm also taking the private exam very soon...Zues just kinda signed me up for it..."* - Wed Nov  4 18:52:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) shrugs, "Maybe, maybe not. I think it's more to do with relations and such. Anyway, I wanted to ask you something if you don't mind" he would say, his tone changing to something a little more serious. He would even turn his chair to face Ortho better.* - Wed Nov  4 19:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) brings a hand up to the desk, starting to tap it lightly. "A while back I m-" was all he would say before seemingly cutting himself off mid sentence. There would be an awkward pause before Takeda attempted to speak again, "I m-" was again all he would say before bringing a hand up to hold his forehead, his eyes would squint, suggeting either discomfort or pain. He wouldn't attempt to talk again.* - Wed Nov  4 19:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) looks up at Ortho, opening his mouth to speak once more. "I met E-...E-..." was all he would let out before shooting out of his seat, grasping and gripping at his head fiercely with both his hands now.* - Wed Nov  4 19:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ....... - Wed Nov  4 19:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) started to shake as the pain would worsen inside his head, he was fighting it as much as possible to try and get his question across. "I-I can't O-Ortho...He-..." was all he would reply with again, his speech turning into audible moans of pain.* - Wed Nov  4 19:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) does as Ortho said, taking in a few deep breaths for a few seconds to both calm himself and let the pain somewhat subside. "I met E-..." was all he was able to say again as he tried to speak, his mouth shutting tightly and his head screaming with pain once more. He found his seat and sat in it, taking a few more breaths as he let the pain subside over time. "I...I'm sorry Ortho...I just...can't...I don't know whats wrong with me..." he would reply back, this time being able to speak perfectly clear as if he had miraculously recovered.* - Wed Nov  4 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) opened his mouth to speak, only for it to clamp shut before he even had a chance. He would just stare and awkward stare at Ortho.* - Wed Nov  4 20:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) would once again go to speak, only being shut down once again. He would simply have to shake his head to show it wasn't someone from Konoha.* - Wed Nov  4 20:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) nodded his head, this time to show Ortho was correct.* - Wed Nov  4 20:12:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) tried to nod his head as best as he could in approval to Ortho, though the pain would start to set in again as he was technically communicating information over. He clutched at his head once more, not noticing the two that just walked into the room.* - Wed Nov  4 20:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Let's see if Takeda will listen to her. - Wed Nov  4 20:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Nice seeing you too, Marrisa. - Wed Nov  4 20:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) tried to sit up straight and present himself to Marrisa as best he could, even through his pain. He nodded to her as she explained the situation about Index and Katsune but frowned when she commented on him taking part in the private exam. "I understand Marrisa, Suna and Konoha are allies so your enemies are our enemies, thank you for the heads up. As for the Private exam, you advise is welcome but not needed. I have to take the exam, no matter what." He would reply as she tried to leave the room.* - Wed Nov  4 20:33:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) stops off at the gate, looking around for the architect they're supposed to escort and protect. He's a bit puzzled at first, what does an architect even look like? "Psst, Nori. Do you know what architects look li-" was all he could say before being approached by a man, introducing himself as the architect. With a nod he would turn around to Nori again, "Looks like we found our guy, you ready to head out?"* - Thu Nov  5 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) nodded back at Nori, then at the Architect. "Let's get going then, I'll take the front and you take the back Nori, Keep an eye out. Stay in the middle of us mister Architect." he would say outloud, both towards Nori and the Architect. He would begin walking down the usual beaten path, keeping a lax but watchful eye on his surroundings. It was only a C - ranked mission so he didn't expect there to be much trouble, if any. Still he had a job to do, he was to protect the architect that had payed good money for this protection and he wanted to show that he was definately getting his monies worth. He would say much to Nori right now, mostly because there wasn't a lot to talk about in all honesty.* - Thu Nov  5 03:54:14 2015
