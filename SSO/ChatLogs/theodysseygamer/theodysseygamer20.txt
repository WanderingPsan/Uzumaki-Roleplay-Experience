<br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) turned to speak to Ortho, just for some idle chit-chat until he saw the giant fan type weapon on his back, something he didn't recognise. He remembered the friend of Suitengu gave it to him, but he honestly had no idea why or what the 'weapon' did. He guessed it was maybe for fuuton enhancement? After a few more seconds of staring at it and pondering upon what it was his interest finally won out over his lack of confidence.

"O-Ortho...What is that on your back..? I've...Never seen that before..."* - Mon Oct  5 15:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) was quite pleased with what Ortho had responded with, not only did he learn the name of the weapon but also the name of the man that gave it to him, killing two birds with one stone. There was still the problem that he didn't know what it did, it didn't look sharp or very sturdy so he decided to push for more answers, purely out of his own interest in such an unorthodox weapon.

"What...does it do? It doesn't look very...damaging so I guess you use something like Fuuton with it or..?"* - Mon Oct  5 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yes, fuuton is aided by ti. - Mon Oct  5 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Oh...So you use it like Marrisas fan? - Mon Oct  5 15:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Similar, yes. - Mon Oct  5 15:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: So you know this Hideki well then? - Mon Oct  5 15:37:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: What you saw was as much as I know. He asked for a spar, I accepted, we only went one round and he stopped due to some Baen person showing up. - Mon Oct  5 15:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Strange how he gave you his weapon if he didn't know you... - Mon Oct  5 16:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Maybe he just saw something in you from your spar...even if it was just a short spar... - Mon Oct  5 16:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That, or he simply doesn't know how to manipulate the wind element so he gave it to someone who can. - Mon Oct  5 16:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I guess thats also a factor...Still kind of strange in any case. - Mon Oct  5 16:05:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) began his practise session by building up his chakra like usual. He had a couple more things to practise with Earth Flash before he truly felt like he had learned all he could with it. Once he had adequately prepared his chakra he formed the handseals and gathered his chakra to his hand. Before he had placed his hand to the ground to release the lightning, this time he would hold his hand out facing the ground, releasing the lightning. The lightning sprung from his hand, quickly hitting the ground and scorching it. The lightning was unfocused however, forking off into a few different directions, though he expected as much.

Once he had finished that last practise he refocused himself and began kneading chakra within his body again, applying the lightning nature change as always. Once that was done he formed the five handseals of the jutsu, held his hand out and amassed his chakra there again. Once he saw and heard the lightning scrackling around his hand he faced it towards the ground and released it, lightning flying through the air and eventually hitting the ground. He concentrated on the chakra he was releasing to focus it in one direction, directly ahead of himself. This time the lightning traveled much more centered, his proficiency with the jutsu clearly becoming more and more apparent.

As the lightning had disperesed into the ground and died out he regained his posture and stance and began building up chakra once more. When he was fully prepared to practise again he quickly zipped through the handseals for the jutsu and held his hand out, gathering his chakra there like he had done many times before. Again he held his hand out, palm facing the ground and lightning circling around it. As he did he pushed his chakra, and the lightning, from his hand and through the air, into the ground. Again he focused on centering and concentrating the lightning, having it all move in one direction without forking off and losing power. After the lightning had done it's thing he stood back and looked at his handy work, noticing something odd...

The lightning didn't seemed to be damaging the ground as much as it was when he practised before, he theorised what this was almost immediately. Since the lightning was traveling through the air, which is a natural insulator, it was losing vibration and in turn, losing power. With that in mind he quickly built his chakra up and formed the handseals required by the jutsu, then gathered his chakra to his hand. He increased the vibrations of his chakra as he released it, having a noticable effect of scorching and damaging the ground more this time. With a pleased smile he would continue on.

Pleased with himself over figuring that out so quickly he built his chakra up within seconds and zipped through the handseals at the same pace too. As he held his hand out and gathered chakra to it, lightning sprung to life within his palm and started flying around his hand. He would then hold his hand forward and shoot the lightning off through the air, having it hit the ground shortly after. Again he increased the vibrations as much as he could as soon as he shot the lightning off, succeeding in having a more damaging effect on the ground.

He figured he'd practise one more time just for the sake of practise before either going to rest or practising another jutsu. He built his chakra up within a fast time and went through all five of the handseals the jutsu used just the same. Holding his hand out once more he gathered his chakra to it hand held it out to face the ground. As his lightning sprung to life he shot it off towards the ground, increasing his chakras vibrations as soon as he did. Once again the lightning ripped through the ground, showing him that it was as powerful as he could get it now. With a smile on his face he turned to walk off and rest, thinking about the progress he was making. He stopped oddly as something occured to him...

That being he had only been using one hand to fire the jutsu off with, not two. He supposed it didn't exactly matter but shrugged and turned back to practise using both hands, couldn't hurt to practise right? He went through the motions of building his chakra up and forming the handseals, all of which were pretty much second nature to him at this point. Then instead of focusing his chakra to one hand he split it and sent it to both, clapping his hands as he did. Lightning then circled the both of them as he pushed them forward and shot off the lighting towards the ground. He noticed the lightning lost a little power, probably due to being seperated into two but he figured with continued use, which he was sure he would do, that wouldn't be a problem much longer. For now, he felt he deserved a nice rest.* - Mon Oct  5 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) stood up and began kneading chakra within his body after his having a very short rest. He couldn't stop thinking about how his lightning had lost some power when he used two hands to fire it instead of one, as a semi-perfectionist he just couldn't leave it alone. With that he went through each handseal as quickly as he could and focused his chakra to both of his hands, holding them out towards the ground. As he focused his chakra and fired it off he concentrated on the lightning, refining how it was being used by both hands. When it hit the ground it gave a better result than before, akin to what one hand would produce. With that a weight had been taken off his mind and he sat back down to finally enjoy the rest that had been disturbed.* - Mon Oct  5 17:13:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) took the scroll, keeping it in hand instead of putting it away, possibly pointing to him beign eager to learn it? He nodded his head to the comment from Suitengu, "I understand, I'll follow wherever you go."* - Mon Oct  5 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Good. - Mon Oct  5 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) nods his head again, mostly in respect. He'd then walk past Suitengu to where he was standing before, jutsu scroll in hand. He plopped himself down, unbinding the scroll and rolling it out before himself, ready to begin reading.* - Mon Oct  5 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) set his eyes on the scroll, starting to read through the information it had contained within it. The first thing he came upon was what the jutsu actually was, not surprisingly it did what it said on the tin, literally a jutsu dedicated around making mud. It detailed that the amount of mud one could generate was up to the user, from a small puddle of mud to a large river used to wash your enemy away. It also spoke about how this jutsu could be used with water or a water jutsu to speed the mud current up, helping it move faster.

He continued on, eyes continuing to scan for information about the jutsu. The next thing he came across was the handseals for the jutsu...or rather handseal to be exact. It detailed that all the user had to do was clap their hands and focus their chakra into the ground either through their feet or through their hands, which ever they prefered. He found this to be quite a simple way of doing things but then he remembered that Suitengu said the jutsu was D ranked, and now he knew why.

The next part he read about was how to spread your chakra through the ground quickly and effectively. While he did had an adequate understanding of the Doton nature type this information was useful as it informed him on how to saturate a large area of the ground with his chakra, this was important for the jutsu as without doing that, you couldn't create the large amount of mud you could potentially desire to use against your enemy. It also explained how to do this quickly and efficiently so that when you practised this, you wouldn't expend chakra unneccsarily.

Next up was how to use your chakra to churn the ground up into a mud. It explained how doing this without water was slightly more difficult since mud needs water to flow sufficiently. The explanation it gave was simple and easy to understand. All you had to do was use the chakra you placed into the ground to quickly change the way the ground was, you did this by first saturating the ground in your chakra, then using your chakra to give the earth a more muddy, viscous quality.

The next set of information he came up would be considered trivial information by others but to him, it was something he could apply to learning the jutsu better. This information was about picking and choosing where to use this jutsu and how to use it. It stated that obviously using this jutsu to try and turn solid into mud wasn't the best idea, and that trying to use perticularly watery mud in the jutsu could do more harm than good, leading to a lack of control. All of which could be thought of as minor and obvious, but still good to know. He continued on but stopped after a few seconds, taking his eyes away from the scroll to rub them and give them a rest.* - Mon Oct  5 22:35:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Hm... - Tue Oct  6 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) sat down, pulling the jutsu scroll he was reading before out. Again he would unbind and open it, picking up where he last left off. He reread a few things that he had gone over before, just to job his memory. Mostly he went over the stuff he had either forgotten or just generally needed to brush up on which was how to perform the jutsu, how you want to control you chakra and how you want you chakra to behave. After that he skipped over to where he left off, officially getting started on reading the rest of the scroll.

Immediately he came across an interesting section which detailed how to funnel your chakra into the ground either through your feet or your hands. It explained how it was a good idea to first gather your chakra to either your feet or your hands and set that as a focus point, then use that as a medium to create a flow of chakra between yourself and the ground. It also pointed out that it's best to learn with your hands first, then your feet as pushing chakra through your feet is hander than your hands.

The next thing he came upon was how to control how much mud you made when performing the jutsu, this seemed like common sense to him but he read through it anyway, no reason not to afterall. It detailed that one should use the appropriate amount of chakra to the appropriate situation to avoid over-exertion and to allow for more versatile and unpredictable use of the jutsu. It also detailed that the amount of mud made can also effect how the jutsu functioned.

Next came a few diagrams and pointers, explaining and showing the user how to stand and what to do when they prepared for the jutsu. He followed a long, standing in the advised stances and moving his arms in the way it advised to allow for more versatile movement should you need to react quickly. He felt at least some of this would come in handy since the way one stood in battle affects a lot of things like how you react and move to certain things.

Finally he came to a few more diagrams which detailed how to knead chakra in your body for the juts and how to control that chakra. He skipped past the kneading chakra bit as he was at least adept at using the doton nature type but made sure to look and read over how one should be controling your chakra, how you should be focusing it and how you should be concentrating it. All in all it was quite basic, but at the very least insightful for one that had never used the jutsu like himself. He saw that there was a few bits of text to read before he got to the ned but decided not to read them as they looked like history bits, instead he rolled the scroll up and put it away, both because he wanted to rest his eyes and because he felt like he could at least attempt the jutsu now.* - Tue Oct  6 02:00:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) stands up and turns left, walking forward. Even in the mist he knew where the door was, afterall he was in line with it. He'd continue on until he hit the wall, then slowly edged his way around until he found the exit, proceeding to leave just after.* - Tue Oct  6 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) found an odd little arena like area to train in, he guessed Kumo used it for both training and sparring so he would be fine to train here. The ground wasn't suitable for doton jutsu training so he moved onto another, Suiton. He began as always by kneading chakra within his body, performing the Suiton nature change by changing his chakra into water. As he finished preparing his chakra he formed the following handseals; Dragon, Tiger, Hare. As he did this he pushed his chakra, which was now water, up and out, puckering his lips as he did and finally spitting a stream of water out.

While it is impressive to spit a stream of water, his lack of experience with the jutsu was plainly showing off as the stream he produced was quite weak and didn't reach very far. He figured he'd focus on power first, then the length of it. With that in mind he began kneading chakra within his stomach again, turning it into water. He formed the three handseals, going over them in his head just before he did. Once he did that he puckered his lips and pushed the water up, concentrating on the chakra within the water, trying to refine it and push it out at a higher velocity.

Once he was done with his second attempt he got right to starting his third, already kneading chakra within his body and converting it into water. As he was doing that he went over the three handseals the jutsu needed in his head, making sure he was doing them right. When ready he proceeded to form said handseals and focus on his chakra, using it to push the water accumilated in his stomach up and out. As he did this he again kept focused, pushing harder with his chakra to increase the strength and speed of the water as it came out.

As he began preparing for his fourth practise he noticed that gradually the water stream was also increasing in length, he thought this only natural however since he was increasing the speed he pushed the water out slowly but surely. Once his chakra and the water was prepared he formed the three handseals and puckered his lips, ready to spit the water he had accumilated. As he did he continued to focus on his chakra, using it to push the water out at faster and faster speeds, this was important because despite it only being water, it can still hurt if it hits you fast enough.

When he last attempt subsided he started to pant, even with his higher than average chakra reserves for a genin, the jutsu was still taking its toll. He took a few seconds breather before taking in a deep breath, straightening up and begining again. As he finished kneading his chakra into water he again motioned through the handseals at high speed. Once they were done it was simply a matter of puckering his lips and producing the water once more, making sure he kept refining his use of chakra as he produced said water from his mouth.

As he began kneading chakra in his body for his sixth practise of the jutsu he thought to himself that he would make this his last practise before resting for a bit. With that still in mind he quickly finished building up water within he body. He zipped through the handseals, puckered his lips and began shooting a stream of water from his mouth. As he produced the water he focused on his chakra control, continually refining and pushing it to push the water out at a more decent rate. Once the stream died out he walked off, going to check if the commotion in the Ramen bar was still happening.* - Wed Oct  7 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) walked through the door, instantly be hit with the mist from before. With a large frown now present on his face he turns on the spot and walks off, no way was he going to get stuck in the commotion again.* - Wed Oct  7 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) came back to the arena area after he had checked out the ramen bar and rested in the kage mansion for a while, snacking on some food bits as he rested. Now he was rested up, it was time to begin again. He focused himself for a second before kneading chakra in his body, turning it into water. He went through each handseal very quickly, having already grown accustomed to them. When the handseals were finished he pivoted forward slightly and puckered his lips, shooting a stream of water from his body out his mouth as he did.

Now with the initial practise to get him re-acquianted with the jutsu out of the way, it was time to start practising for real. He built his chakra up like before, kneading it into water within his body. He then went through the three handseals as quick as he could, always testing himself in the department. With those preperations done he leaned forward slightly and puckered his lips, using his chakra to help spit the water out of his mouth at a high velocity. He focused on the chakra he was using, making sure not to expend too much while also refining how he used it.

Once the water stopped coming forth from his mouth he straightened up and began building his chakra up again, kneading it into water soon after he was done. After that he would of course lift his hands up and speed through each of the three handseals, now being fully ready to try again. He used his chakra to push the water in his body up and forward, puckering his lips as he did. As the stream of water continued out of his mouth he focused on the chakra he was using, concentrating on using it to the best of his ability to force the water from his body.

Again after the water had stopped he began preparing to try again, kneading chakra within his stomach into water. When the water was prepared he built his chakra up a little more as he performed the three handseals. Using his chakra he pushed the water up and out, firing from his mouth in a projectile stream form. He concentrated on his chakra, using it to of course force the water out. He continued to work on refining his use of it, trying his best to make sure he wasn't expending too much chakra and in turn, was making sure the jutsu was as powerful as he could make it.

Now onto his fifth attempt he noticed he wasn't as fatigued as before, a clear sign that his training was already paying off and that he was working in the right direction. With his determination reinforced he quickly built up the water within his body and zipped through the three handseals of the jutsu. He pushed the water up and out with his chakra, concentrating on it as he did to continue to refine his control of his chakra and the water speed. The water was now coming out at quite an impressive rate, splashing all over the place as it hit the ground.

With that last practise of the Raging Waves jutsu he did begin to feel a little fatigued again, his body feeling physically tired. He knew that if he pushed himself though, it would be good for him in the long run. With this in mind he kneaded chakra within his stomach, turning it into water. With the water made up he formed the three handseals and used his chakra to force the water up and out, firing it off at a high velocity as usual. He focused on the chakra he was using just like before, making sure he was using it to the best of his ability. As the stream finally died out he would move to leave the arena again, happy with his progress so far.* - Wed Oct  7 01:26:11 2015
