<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) held up the seal of confrontation as he focused on his chakra, thinking to himself as he did. He retraced his metaphorical steps. He remembered how he split his chakra into, one lightning style and one water style, then tried to mix the two together. He would start to mould his chakra up, splitting it into two halves as he did. He would then focus on one half, vibrating it as much as he possibly could. Then he would focus on the other half, converting it into a free flowing, water like substance. Slowly he would bring the two together like yin and yang, trying to mould the two into each other. He managed to mould it together a little like before, only to eventually lose concentration, dissipating all his work.

He would continue on, knowing that he needed to go through this trial and error process if he was going to get anywhere with his theory. He would build up his chakra once more, splitting it into two and then focusing on one half of it. He would vibrate that half as much as possible, adding the lightning nature change to it. Next he would focus on the other half, converting it into a water like substance, applying the water nature change. He would then attempt to mould the two together gently once more. He would try to integrate them together by feeding one half into the other. The task was incredibly taxing on the body but he managed to get a little further than last time in progression before having to stop.

He took a short rest before beginning again, throwing up the seal of confrontation to help focus his chakra. Again he would mould up his chakra, making sure to mould up quite a decent amount. He would the split that chakra in half. Once again he would focus on each half one after the other, first applying the lightning nature change and then the water nature change. Again he would try to integrate the two together, focusing all his efforts on doing so. He would make considerable progress again, though eventually he would have to stop once more, dissipating his chakra.

He would waste no time in building up his chakra again, both to push his body and get faster at doing this. Once his chakra had been moulded up he would split it into two, one half for lightning and one half for water as always. He would then begin with applying the nature change to each half, vibrating one and converting the other into water. Once more he would begin trying to mix the two together, slowly pushing to two halves back together to form a whole. He was making good progress now; it was slow but it was good. Each practise he would be getting better and better. Eventually he would have to stop and rest again, though he didn't really mind.

After resting for a few minutes he formed the seal of confrontation again to help with the focus of his chakra. He shut out all outside interference, keeping his mind and body totally focused on his chakra as he moulded it up. He would split the chakra into two just as he had been doing, then focused his efforts on each half, vibrating one half first, then converting the other half to water. He would then keep absolutely concentrated on his chakra as he began integrating the two halves together, feeding one into the other. He made considerable progress again, getting further than he had ever done so before. He managed to feed around a quarter of one half into the other before having to stop. After he had stopped again he would call it quits for today, going to rest a while and then focus on some of his jutsu again.* - Mon Nov  2 00:31:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Hello. - Mon Nov  2 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) Switched his mind a little, wanting to give his injured hand a bit of a rest. Instead he would focus on practising a basic jutsu he had been taught, flamethrower. He would build up chakra within his body, heating it at the same time. Once his chakra had been prepared he would then form a single hand seal, Ram, and inhale. He would push his chakra up to his chest and exhale, breathing out a small stream of fire, marking the success of his preliminary practise. As the stream of fire dissipated he would straighten up and think of what he needed to improve on, getting a general idea of what he needed to practise.

He began building his chakra up as he thought on a couple of things he could do to practise and improve his mastery over this jutsu. He felt that he could extend the range of the flames which would make the jutsu have a large effective range. With that he would start heating his chakra in preparation to use it. He would then form the tiger hand seal and inhale, as he inhaled he would push his chakra up to his chest. He would then pivot forward and exhale, pushing his chakra up and out as he did. A large stream of fire out expands out from his mouth, shooting forward a decent distance.

He would straighten up and hold up the seal of confrontation as he began building up chakra again, heating it as he moulded it for use. The distance the flames reached were pretty good, but he knew he could do better. Again he would form the tiger hand seal, inhaling as he did and pushing his chakra up to his chest. He would then pivot his body forward and exhale, pushing his chakra out as he did. He would attempt to use his control over his chakra to push the flames out further and further. The flames shoot out further than before, dissipating a few seconds after they had appeared.

Again he would stand back up straight and hold up the confrontation hand seal, once again moulding up and heating his chakra in preparation for his next practise. Once he felt he was ready he would push his chakra up to his chest as he inhaled, forming the tiger hand seal as he did. He would then pivot his body forward once more, exhaling and pushing his chakra out with his breath. A literal jet of flames would then burst forth from his lips, stretching out further and further as he manipulated his chakra to extend the range of the jutsu, the flames would once again die out quickly, ending the jutsu.

Once the flames had gone out he would begin again with moulding up more chakra, continually heating it as he went on. When his chakra had been adequately prepared he would form the tiger hand seal and inhaled, pushing his chakra up through his body and to his chest. He would then pull his arms back and pivot his body forward slightly, puckering his lips. He would then exhale and push his chakra up and out with his breath, releasing a long jet of fire within the blink of an eye. The flames would once again continue on further and further as he focused on and manipulated his chakra. The flames would once again die out after a few seconds, marking the end of the jutsu.

He felt that he was getting towards the end zone of how far he could extend the flames, though just to be sure he would begin building up and heating his chakra for one last practise before going to rest for a bit. Once his chakra had been fully prepared he would again form the tiger hand seal and inhale as he pushed his chakra up to his chest. He would then pivot his body forward and expel his chakra, breathing forth a jet of flames that would extend an admirable distance from himself. The flames would dissipate over the course of a few second though, causing him to stand up straight. He would then walk off to get some food, coming back later…* - Mon Nov  2 02:37:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I don't really train. - Mon Nov  2 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: It's wasted effort. - Mon Nov  2 04:23:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Totsuka, Amaterasu(Tsundere-san) says: Uh... what do you have? - Mon Nov  2 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Well, I can teach you fireball jutsu, Raging Waves or a simple technique called Mud Silhouette. - Mon Nov  2 04:30:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) Started building chakra up within himself, heating it to apply the change in nature to his chakra. "Watch carefully." He would state as he brought both hands up, going through each hand seal for the jutsu slowly so that she could follow along. "There's two ways you can do this jutsu, either a giant flamethrower or a literal ball of fire." He would state again after going through the hand seals. "Simply inhale, push your chakra up to your chest and then exhale as you push your chakra further up and out." He would say, turning to the side to give a demonstration. He would take in a deep breath and push his chakra to his chest, like he had just said. Then he would pivot his body forward and pucker his lips, exhaling and breathing forth a massive amount of flames. Once he was done he would turn back to face Amaterasu, "Try doing the flamethrower style of the technique first, producing a fireball takes a bit of practise."* - Mon Nov  2 04:39:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) takes off a katana he had been wearing, holding it out to her. "Here. It's Iron so it's probably not as good as your one but the maker of this wanted you to test out his weapon."* - Mon Nov  2 04:58:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) turns around, taking a few steps away from Ketsuki and Ziare to get some distance if they were indeed to fight.* - Mon Nov  2 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm, The test? - Mon Nov  2 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: It's something I have to take for the good of the village, that's all. - Mon Nov  2 05:34:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'd rather not, but if you're gonna force me... - Mon Nov  2 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I am. - Mon Nov  2 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well, then. - Mon Nov  2 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Come at me. - Mon Nov  2 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: You're not going to form some kind of strategy with Ziare? - Mon Nov  2 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: We're really not suited to fight togehter. - Mon Nov  2 05:43:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Oh, Nori is back. - Mon Nov  2 05:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: So, you want in on this Nori? - Mon Nov  2 05:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Naaaw. I rather be there on the side to see who gets too injured during this. - Mon Nov  2 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Oh well, that's fine I guess. - Mon Nov  2 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Successssssss. - Mon Nov  2 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: If she's out, I am too. - Mon Nov  2 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Nope, you're in Ziare. - Mon Nov  2 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I have to heal people though. - Mon Nov  2 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Why am I in? - Mon Nov  2 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Because we're starting. - Mon Nov  2 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) started to build up his chakra, thinking about how he was going to do this. There were two opponents, standing quite far from each other too. He'd need to rely on jutsu that affect a wide area at first, then try and draw them in for concentrated attacks. Just like that he would start sharpening his chakra within his body to apply the wind nature change to it. He would quickly reach around into his backpouch, pulling out five shuriken.

Instead of throwing them at Ketsuki and Ziare however, he would throw them all up infront of himself. Then as the shuriken start to drop out of the air he would bring his other hand up and push his wind style chakra to each hand. He would clap his hands together once, pushing a wave of wind out from himself. This wind would send all five shuriken flying forward in different directions, both to ward off attack and potentially hit Ketsuki and Ziare.* - Mon Nov  2 05:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) didn't really focus much on Ziare being hit, one because he knew he would quit after the first exchange and two because he was looking for Ketsuki. He would however immediately turn around and form a few handseals after hearing Ketsukis voice. While he pretty average hearing, he'd know she was behind him from her talking to him. As he came to face ketsuki he would once again concentrate his chakra to his hand after finishin his hand seals. He would thrust his hand forward and release his chakra, shooting off a massive burst of air that would most likely knock Ketsuki off her feet and send her flying back from him if it hit.* - Mon Nov  2 06:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Medic!!! - Mon Nov  2 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I need a doctor! - Mon Nov  2 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) smirks as ketsuki vanishes from sight once more. He would quickly turn around on the spot again and sure enough he would find her behind him, albeit a lot further away then before. While he was a ranged fighter he started to move closer ketsuki, moulding chakra and forming more handseals as he did. Once the handseals were done and he was in position he would convert his chakra into water within his stomach, puckering his lips as he pushed said water up and out, shooting a fast paced stream of water at Ketsuki, aiming to hit her torso to once again try and knock her off balance with the force of the water. He would hold back on the power somewhat though, just to make sure she wouldn't get too injured if hit.* - Mon Nov  2 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: G..gyah.. - Mon Nov  2 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Ehh? You okay? *@Ziare* - Mon Nov  2 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) grimaces as he noticed Ketsuki spit out blood, he had gone too far. He rushed over to her side, skidding along the floor as he slide down to his knees to make sure she was ok. He would try and pull her up, at least trying to rest he head on his knees for comfort. "Shit...shit...shit, I'm so sorry Ketsuki are you ok? Please be ok." he would ask quickly and frantically, worry apparent in his voice.* - Mon Nov  2 06:42:46 2015
