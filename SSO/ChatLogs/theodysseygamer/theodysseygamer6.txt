<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Not much else to do. - Fri Sep 18 20:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) went back to the waterfall to train his newest fire jutsu up for a bit. He had cooled himself off since his heated...'discussion' with Hassa, Jin and Seisuke and could now actually focus. He stepped onto the water and made his way to the middle. He then placed his hands together and focused on building up his chakra. Once he was ready he formed the handseals needed for the jutsu na dpivoted his body forward and he breathed in and out. He then started to blow out fireballs, four in total, all quite small and weak in size, straight at the waterfall.

The small fireballs hit the waterfall and extinguished. Once they did he returned to standing straight and began building up chakra once more. He had been thinking on how to improve his use of this technique and found that if he tried to 'spit' or 'blow' each individual fireball fireball out it worked better, this was easier said than done since he needed to infuse his chakra into that. When he was done building up chakra he formed the hadseals as quick as he could and pivoted forward. Spitting out another four fireballs.

Four seemed to be his limit...which was a bit...terrible. He began building up chakra once again, focusing on it as he did. When he was ready he would inhaled and pivot his body forward towards the waterfall. He would then push his chakra and tried spitting it out as best he could, managing to produce five fireballs in total this time, though they were still quite small and weak from what he believed.

He guessed he would work on producing as many as he could first before trying to increase their power. Once again he straightened up and began building up chakra. Since this was a Katon technique, building up his chakra for this was much easier and faster. When he was ready once again he would form the handseals for the jutsu as fast as he could and inhale, pivoting forward as he exhaled. He fired off five more shots before standing up straight again.

He would practise this one more time before resting for a while since this jutsu used a lot of chakra. Once more he would build up chakra, concentrating on it to make sure he could control it to the best of his ability. Once ready he formed the handseals again and pivoted forward as he exhaled, shooting off six fireballs this time. Each one hit the waterfall and dissipated. He then walked off the water to give himself and break and eat something while he rested.* - Fri Sep 18 21:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) decided to stay on land this time and just fire the fireballs into the water since staying on water took extra effort and focus. Now that he had the basics under control it was time to start trying to increase the amount of fireballs he could produce. He walked up to the water, staying just on the edge of it. He would then build up his chakra, form the handseals needed for the jutsu and bend down slightly to aim at the water. He then inhaled and exhaled, firing off six fireballs as he did.

He straightened his back and thought on how he could increase the amount of fireballs he produced while building his chakra up. He couldn't really think of anything at the time so just focused on hs chakra. Once he was done he would form the handseals, inhale and aim at the water. He then exhaled and out with his breath came seven fireballs this time, probably due to the fact he was getting used to the technique.

As he started building chakra up he thought about how he was using his chakra, all he needed to do was pretend like he was using fireball jutsu but instead of firing it in a massive load, you split it up and fire it at a rapid rate. With that in mind he finished up with building his chakra up and aimed at the water once more. He formed the handseals, breathing in and out. As he breathed out he forced all the chakra he built up out, cutting it off and releasing it as fast as he could. This time he nearly doubled the amount he could fire off before, a total of twelve in the end.

He was happy with this result and began building up chakra right away, making sure to get the refinement right like always. Once he was ready he formed the handseals needed for the jutsu and aimed down at the water. He then inhaled and exhaled, doing the same as last time when he exhaled, rapidly pushing his chakra out in chunks to fire off more and more 'rounds' of fireballs. This time he managed to exhale fourteen of them, but he wouldn't stop there.

He was making too much progress to stop now. Immediately he would straighten his back and begin building chakra up as quick as he could, he liked training fast like this since it applied to real world scenarios. Once he was ready again he would form all the handseals that applied to the jutsu, aiming down at the water as he did. He pushed his chakra up as he exhaled, making sure to push it out in chunks to produce as many fireballs as he could. By the time he was done firing fireballs off he had shot sixteen into the water and he had steam all around him. Once again he would sit down to rest a while, resting was important while training too.* - Fri Sep 18 21:59:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) would stand up after resting awhile once more. Now that he could control how many fireballs he produced easier it was time to increase their power and potency. He placed his hands together and faced the water, building up his chakra once again. Once he was ready he would aim at the water and form the handseals for the jutsu. He would then breath in and out, pushing his chakra up as he did. He focused on the chakra he was cutting into chunks to fire out, trying to refine it and conserve chakra while increasing it's potency. He shot out slightly improved fireballs, but they were still quite weak.

He was slightly happy with the progress me made, but he knew he could do better. He started building up chakra again, making sure to focus on his chakra control. When he was again ready he formed the handseals for the jutsu and prepared the chakra he had built up. As he inhaled and exhaled be pushed the chakra up, focusing on refining, increasing the potency of it and cutting it up into fireballs. Once again he fired off multiple fireballs, all of them seemed as powerful as before.

A new idea struck him as he started building up chakra for his next attempt. If he refined the chakra as a whole after he builds it up, he wouldn't need to do so while he was firing it. When he was ready to put his theory to the test he formed the handseals and aimed at the water. He kept focused on refining his chakra before blowing it out in multiple fire balls. It seemed to work as the fireballs he produced were large and more powerful than before, if only by a little.

It would take time but with practise he would get this down and would be able to fire off more potent fireballs. He began building up his chakra in preperation again, doing it quickly because of his affinity and experience with the katon nature type. Once he was ready he aimed at no where in perticular on the water and formed the handseals, making sure to refine the chakra he had already built up before exhaling it shortly after. The quality and potency of fireballs seemed to be rising quickly now.

Again he would begin building up chakra shortly after finishing firing off the fireballs. It seemed to be getting easier and less taxing for him now, even with the rate he was practising at. He reckoned he could go a couple more times before needed to stop and rest again. Once more he would perform the handseals and fire off multiple fireballs into the water, trying to improve his control and refinement of them.

Happy with the progress he was making he pushed himself forward, not wanting to give up and rest yet. He quickly built up his chakra and formed the handseals to the jutsu, aiming forward at the water as he did. He inhaled and exhaled, pushing his chakra out as he did. Again he tried his best to refine the fireballs he was producing, making them more stable and more potent each time he practised.

When he finished that volley of fireballs he started building up his chakra again, quickly doing so since he was practising this non-stop. Once more he would quickly plough through the handseals of the jutsu, focusing on his chakra as he finished the handseals. Again he would fire a volley of fireballs into the water in no direction in perticular. He was trying his best to refine the chakra he was using, the fireballs seemed to be coming out a little bit better each time he practised now.

He was getting fatigued but he decided to give it one more go before resting again. He held his hands up and placed them together like usual when he focused on building his chakra up.
