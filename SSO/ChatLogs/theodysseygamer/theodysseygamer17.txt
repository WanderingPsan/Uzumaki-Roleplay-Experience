<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) walks up to the building/mansion he had followed Fuji and Kohaku to, lagging behind them because he had been day dreaming. He hadn't seen them enter the place but he was pretty sure they'd be there...where else would they be? He tried to walk close to the building, walking face first into the barrier and bouncing off it slightly, "What the..?" He questioned in his mind.

He knocked on the barrier twice, wondering what the hell was going on, "This day...Oh this day..." he said verbally, heaving had quite enough of weird jutsu today.* - Mon Sep 28 00:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) watched as two guards came up to the barrier and passed through it, apparently it had opened up without him realising. They told him to come with them, he did so because he thought he must be in the right place. Everything was going fine until they started to lead him down into a chamber...which worried him slightly until he saw Fuji. The guards then motioned for him to move forward which he did, the guards then leaving and heading back up top.

He stood next to Fuji in the 'safe spot' wondering what the hell all this was, "Hello Fuji...What is all this..?"* - Mon Sep 28 01:06:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) was a little slow to start, his head wasn't really in this and sparring wasn't really his thing, he was only doing it because of what Kohaku had done for him before. Eventually he would lift his arms up and form a few handseals, breathing in as he did. As he breathed out his mixed his chakra in with his breath and started spitting out fireballs, eight to be exact. Each fireball went into a diffierent direction towards Kohakus' left, right and center, aiming to block off her exits while trying to hit her.

He would then pull out a Kunai and took up a defensive stance, waiting for Kohaku to come at him, he knew what kind of speed she had so he predicted she would probably dodge the fireballs.* - Mon Sep 28 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) had expected as much from Kohaku, it's always important to get behind your opponent afterall. He channeled chakra into his kunai, causing a shroud of fire to encircle the blade. As he did this he turned and set of to meet Kohaku head on, not really paying much attention to what she said to him.

When he got close he'd flick his kunai around so the blade faced inwards and punched forward, aiming to slice into the arm that was holding the large Shuriken, hoping he might cause her to drop it. If it hit the wound would cut and burn because of the chakra flow the blade had.* - Mon Sep 28 21:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) let go of the kunai in his hand as soon as Kohakus' Shuriken started to overpower him. Instead of jumping back to avoid any further damage he simply brought his hands together and formed a single handseal, inhaling as he did. As he exhaled he mixed his chakra in with his breath, blowing out a large jet of flames aimed point blank straight towards Kohaku to hopefully either burn her or push her back from further attacking him.* - Mon Sep 28 21:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) would have turned to meet Kohaku head on again, only to be met by a solid punch to the face that would knock him back a bit. When he saw the kick coming for him he would jump back a few feet and clap his hands together. As he landed he would bend over and place his hands on the ground, quickly kneading his chakra straight from his body and into the earth. The ground would then liquify into a slimy, muddy substance which was hard to move through.

He would push this river of mud forward with his chakra, aiming to wash Kohaku off her feet and get her stuck in the mud to slow her down.* - Mon Sep 28 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) had missed Kohaku with the mud, but only just. This was becoming a little tedious to him, he still wasn't really enjoying himself. Now that he had some time however he formed a few handseals and moved forward a little, inhaling and mixing his chakra with the air around he had just taken in. As he exhaled a volley of fireballs would exit his mouth again, this time all of them were aimed towards Kohaku. He knew they wouldn't but he wasn't too concerned.* - Mon Sep 28 21:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) could have used Shunshin but he didn't really feel like it, it was too costly to use in battle. Instead he raised his arms up as best he could to block the fire-fist gunning straight for his face. He would partially block the punch, cushioning the attack slightly but still taking the majority to his face. His cheek would be burned from the fire, his face mask probably most likely being burned off too. His arms would also most likely suffer burns too.

The punch would knock him back once more and with that he was done. He held a hand up to his face to masquerade his appearance and held another arm out infront of himself to motion her to stop. He would also tell her, "Stop...I'm done." as best he could while holding his face, his voice probably sounding a little muffled by his hand.* - Mon Sep 28 22:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) looked Kohaku in the eye, only one of his eyes visible as the other was hidden by his hand, he didn't really understadn why she had said sorry, then again he didn't have great social skills. "You don't need to be sorry...I've just never shown any Shinobi my face before..." he'd say, still trying to hide his face as best as he could with his hands.* - Mon Sep 28 22:14:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) turns around, taking his hand off his face and placing it into his backpouch. He pulled out a new mask and pulls it over his head, pushing it into position to hide to bottom half of his face. Kohaku probably would have been able to see his face while he did this. He turned back shortly after, taking a step closer to the masked stranger, "Show me the gift...Please." He'd say, oddly being polite to the stranger.* - Mon Sep 28 22:21:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Waiting. - Mon Sep 28 22:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) cautiously grabbed the hilt of the blade before a snake shoots out of the persons sleeve. The large white snake would wrap itself around his arm before working it's way around his body, constricting him completely. Before he could even ask why or call to Kohaku his neck would be deeply cut by a kunai, blood probably spurting and pouring out everywhere. In his last moments before he bled out he wondered who had come to end him and why, knowing he had made a lot of mistakes in his life.

He looked back on everything he had been through, the friends he had lost and the pain he had suffered and endured. In that moment he was almost happy to die, happy that he could finally be at rest, happy that he didn't have to endure any more pain. He didn't believe in a god, but he hoped if there was one he would send him to where Tethys was, the only true friend he ever really had.

As he slipped out of conciousness his eye sight faded and his eyelids shut, his head would finally fall limp as his heart stopped beating from blood loss and oxygen deprevation. His body too would go limp, held up only by the snake which contricted him, he was finally gone.* - Mon Sep 28 22:42:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) stepped onto what he believed to be the training area, not being quite sure since he was fresh out of the academy but it looked like the kind of area people trained in. He found a spot in the north-east corner of the training area and began. Lifting his arms up he formed a set of handseals while building up his chakra. He inhaled and mixed his chakra with the breath he took in. As he exhaled a jet of fire would exit it's mouth, slightly larger and more powerful than what you would expect from a normal flamethrower jutsu, this was because he was practising Fireball jutsu.

Once the flames had died out he focused himself and built up his chakra again. When he was ready he formed a string of handseals and breathed in, infusing the air in his lungs with the chakra he had built up. Once he had done that he exhaled and breathed out a large jet of flames, spreading fire out into the air infront of himself in an arc like fashion. He took a deep breath in as the jutsu dissipated, he was getting a little tired.

He pushed on however, not like he had much else to do anyway. He figured he could do this once more without harming himself and with that, he began building chakra up again. He formed a string of handseals when he was ready and inhaled, repeating the chakra infusion process. As he exhaled a large arc of flames would spew out from his mouth for a few seconds before dying out. After that he sat down and pulled some lunch out, eating it to help restore his strength.

After around an hours rest he got back on his feet and began building up chakra again, taking a stance that let him form handseals easier. Once he was done he formed a set of handseals needed for the jutsu and inhaled, mixing his chakra with the air he had taken in. As he exhaled he would breath forth a torrent of flames, taking up a large portion of the space infront of himself for a few seconds before dying out.

Quickly he regained his posture and began building up chakra in preperation for his next practise of the jutsu. When he felt he was ready he inhaled and mixed his chakra in with his breath. When he exhaled the air he breathed would ignite into a large jet of flames which would spread out and fill a large space infront of him for as long as he held it.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) begins to walk towards the door, "I'm done here."* - Tue Sep 29 19:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) walks onto the training field in Konoha, picking a place out of random to stand and train in. It was time for some heavy training. Holding up a hand and forming a halfseal he shut his eyes and began focusing himself, building up his chakra and applying the Katon nature change. When he felt ready his eyes snapped open and his two hands met, forming handseal after handseal. He inhaled as he finished the handseals and mixed his chakra with his breath, exhaling a large arc of flames infront of himself.

As soon as he was done he returned to a straight standing posture, returning one of his hands to a halfseal. He began focusing and building up his chakra again, making sure he was mixing his chakra up correctly. Once he was done he quickly went through each handseal for fireball jutsu and inhaled, mixed his chakra in with his breath and released a torrent of fire infront of himself, burning brightly in a wide arc.

He was becoming more accustomed to the jutsu but he needed more practise. Again he took up the same stance as before and built up his chakra as quickly as he could. Again he formed each handseal for the jutsu quickly, inhaling just after he finished the last one. He mixed his chakra in while the air he inhaled and as he exhaled, his breath would ignite and spread out like wildfire, burning in a large flamethrower like arc.

Quickly he transitioned back to his focus stance to build up more chakra as soon as the flames had extinguished. He was really getting the hang of this jutsu and he didn't want to let up now. Once he was done building chakra up he formed the handseals as fast as he could and repeated the process like before, breathing in, mixing his chakra in and then breathing out to produce the flames. 

He was getting tired but he would push for one more, this was training afterall and how could you train if you don't push yourself? He built his chakra up as fast as he could and formed each handseal for the jutsu just the same. He again repeated breathing in and out, mxing in his chakra with his breath as he did. Again he breathed forth a powerful jet of flames that would arc out would, increasing in width as it expanded out from Takeda. After the jutsu subsided he was left panting, tired and in need of some rest, probably some food too.* - Tue Sep 29 20:46:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) flinched a little from both the speed at which the woman moved and the enexpected 'Hey' in his ear. He turns to Misa and just stares at her, looking her up and down, he recognised her from before but he didn't know her name which made it even more awkward for him. "H-..." he would let out before going silent as he felt shy.* - Wed Sep 30 17:33:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) came to the training field to do some more training since he didn't have much else to be doing. He had five jutsu that he needed to work on and master but since he had started with Fireball jutsu, he'd continue to practise that one. He held up a halfseal as he built up his chakra and once he was ready, formed each seal for the jutsu. He inhaled and exhaled, breathing out a torrent of fire as he did. The flames burning brightly for a few seconds before dying out.

While the flames were certainly powerful, they weren't what he would deem to be 'up to standard' which only gave him more determination to keep training. He'd be practising to increase the power of the jutsu now. Again he built up his chakra up and formed each handseal for the jutsu, inhaling shortly after. He mixed his chakra in with the air in his lungs, applying as much as he could. He then exhaled and focused on pushing more chakra out, producing slightly more potent flames.

Once the flames had died out he returned to focusing himself and building up his chakra, taking a little longer to do so. Again he executed each handseal one after the other before inhaling. As he exhaled he pushed forth a large part of his chakra, flames bursting out in every direction from his mouth as he did. He was finding it harder and harder to control the flames as he increased the power but he could work on that later.

He had to take a short breather before continuing on as the continued use of this jutsu was tiring him. When he felt ready to continue he built up his chakra and deftly went through each handseal the jutsu required. He breathed in and mixed his chakra into his lungs, breathing out to produce a large plume of fire. He fueled the fire with more and more of his chakra, trying to produce more potent flames, control over the flames was again getting more difficult as he did.

After using the jutsu four times with only a little rest his body was feeling tired. He wanted to rest but this is what training was about, pushing yourself. He built as much chakra as he could up in as little time as he could manage. Again he phased through each handseal at above average speed and inhaled. He pushed his chakra up and out as he exhaled and produced a mighty jet of flames that expanded outwards, he even burned his facemask and mouth when producing this fire due to his lack of control, though that would be his next thing to work on, for now he needed rest.* - Wed Sep 30 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) took a good rest and ate a few things before getting back on track. He began again by building up chakra once again, doing so quickly. He also went through each handseal for the jutsu quickly, inhaling shortly after he finished the handseals. He used a large portion of his chakra as he exhaled, expelling fire from his mouth. He focused on his chakra, trying to refine what he was using and control the flames easier.

He made a nice start, atleast not burning himself that time, the control was stil way off however as the flames weren't concentrated. Again he built chakra up quickly and formed the handseals for the jutsu just as quick. He inhaled and exhaled, pushing his chakra out with his breath. He concentrated and focused on his chakra, trying to refine his use of it and concentrate it into a direction he wanted to aimthe flames. It was coming along, but the control was again still off.

As the flames dissipated he got started right away, building up chakra as fast as he could and motioning through each handseal for the jutsu. Again he inhaled and exhaled, breathing out a quickly expanding jet of flames which spread out to fill a large area infront of him. Once more he would focus on his chakra, aiming to refine his control over it and and the flames of the jutsu. This time the fire was much more contained and concentrated and lasted for longer before dying out.

His training had clearly started to pay off in the fact that while he was tiring, the jutsu was becoming less exhausting to perform. Once more he built his chakra up and sped through the handseals of the jutsu, quickly inhaling and exhaling once he was done, blowing forth a large burst of flames. He focused on his chakra, trying to concentrate it and manage how much chakra he was using. Again he managed to extend how long the flames lasted while also concentrating the flames.

He had to take a sort rest after the fourth time, though it was an improvement over before. Once he had rested awhile he got straight back to training, building up his chakra and forming each handseal when he was ready. Again he would exhale large amounts of fire, burning the space infront of himself He concentrated on keeping the flames, as well as his chakra, under control. The flames were now much more contained and with that, much more reliable in battle.* - Wed Sep 30 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) had used a bit of his time to rest again before moving onto the next stage of Fireball jutsu. He could now use the flamethrower style of it pretty effectively but it was time to start learning how to perform the actual fireball version of this technique. Building up chakra and forming each handseal he inhaled and pushed his chakra up as he exhaled. In his mind he had the image of a ball which he used as a template to form the fireball with. He made a small fireball as he exhaled but it died out instantly.

He had the basis for performing this version of the technique, it just needed practise. Again he built up chakra and formed the handseals for the jutsu like he usually did. When he was ready he inhaled and pushed his chakra up and out with his breath as he exhaled. He held the ball shape in his mind as he exhaled, trying to control his chakra and mould it into a ball of fire. Again he made a small one which he held for a few seconds before dying out due to his lack of control.

This had already started to tire him out as he had never done this before but he tried for one more, continuing to build up chakra as quickly as he could. He formed each handseal and repeated the usual process of inhaling and exhaling while pushing his chakra up. He retained the image of a ball in his mind and tried to mould his expelled chakra into a ball. Again he formed a more solid looking fireball, it was small but it managed to hold for a few seconds before dying out.

He took a short ten minute rest, making sure to not over stress himself while training. Once he was ready to begin again he would stand up and begin building chakra up once more. He went through each handseal like normal and pushed his chakra up and out as he exhaled. Again he would concentrate on moulding the chakra he was expelling into a fireball like shape, building a small one which lasted for around a twenty seconds before burning out.

Happy with the progress he was making he pushed for one last try before going to rest properly for awhile. He built his chakra up as fast as he could while being fatigued and formed each handseal as fast as he could too. He went through the process of breathing in and out while pushing his chakra up, trying to mould his expelled chakra into the fireball he desired. He ended up with a small fireball which he could atleast maintain. It needed improvement, but that would have to wait till later.* - Thu Oct  1 00:19:37 2015
