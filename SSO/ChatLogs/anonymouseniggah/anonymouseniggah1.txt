Come onto the tip of his toes and the heels of his hands, and then walks his feet back until his body is in the plank position. Keeping his hips lifted to avoid the lower back from forming a bowl. He then begins to bend his elbows, lowering his whole body down towards the floor. His elbows will bended out to his sides. His would head stay in line with his spinal cord. Lowering himself down until his chest is about an inch or two from the ground and then slowly push himself back up to the starting position.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Iwatobi(Anonymouse Niggah) saw his chance to engage on one of the unsuspecting intruders. The person who had backed up towards the building he was on was really an unlucky guy. Iwatobi had a large grin on his face as he shows his jagged teeth. His skin then started to get turn greenish and scaley, while his mouth grew further out. His hands nails grew longer and his and his pupil split, and out from his tail bone sprouded a scaley tail. 

Then with a his grip tighting onto the roof of the building, Iwatobi launched himself at Yori with his mouth abnormaly wide  and all 80 of his teeth showing. If Yori allowed himself to get within his graps, Iwatobi would aim to bite down onto Yori's right shoulder and dig right into his skin and muscle. As well as taking his right hand and slamming it onto his face as he tried to grip onto it with his big scaley palms. All while his left hand grabbed onto the arm that he was biting onto. Aiming to bring him down onto the ground as he trys and tear meat from Yori's shoulders.* - Sat Dec  5 02:03:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shanzo(Anonymouse Niggah) was laying wait, watching as the two fight. Drinking his sake and having his katana pre-drawn in his free hand as he waited for his chance to enter the fray and gain the upper hand. So when he saw his chance, he made sure to finish up his sake as he moved from the coner and ran at Koji's position as he moved backwards from Token's attack. 

With his unbalanced and wabboly steps, Shanzo held back his katana and gave Koji a sloppy but percice diagnol slash onto his shoulder. Followed by  twist of his hips as he sends his left foot to try and clip Koji off his feet. If he had succesfully tripped up Koji, he'd simply back off of him for a bit.* - Sat Dec 12 21:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shanzo(Anonymouse Niggah) had cut through the clone, making it disperse all while Koji was 64 palming Token. Shanzo would then follow his blade downwards with his upper body and brought his katana towards his left hand so that he may grip it with both hands. He'd had made it seem as if he was about to fall fast first into the ground, but before he would face plant the ground. Shanzo took his right foot and slide it forward infront of him all while taking his katana and making a horizontal slash at the back of Koji's right knee. Aiming to cleanly chop his lower leg off from the rest of his body. Using his whole body to swing across into a small spin so that even if his attack missed, it would have been followed up with another rising slash into the back or stomach of Koji.* - Sat Dec 12 22:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shanzo(Anonymouse Niggah) 's attack would have broken through the rotaton, but Shanzo had decided to easy up on his attack so that it would simply bounce off the jutsu. Causing him to stumble back away from Koji and placed his back against the wall. Once he had his back against the wall, he'd push himself off so that he could stand and sway around on his own. Once he was off he would relax give off a relaxed feeling and reached for his sake gourd that was on his hip. Taking it and started to drink some of his sake with his katana held downwards in his other hand.* - Sat Dec 12 23:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shanzo(Anonymouse Niggah) would have taken his gourd and splashed some sake towards Koji's eyes as he was coming at him. One things for sure, is that Shanzo never let his guard down. Especially when he was drunk. He had let his guard down on purpose to catch Koji off guard when he had tried to attack him. So while he threw some sake at Koji's eyes, Shanzo would turn his blade around so that the sharp of the blade was pointed at Koji. He'd wait untill he saw the results of the sake, he'd simply do an upward diagnol strike across Koji's chest and towards the vital spot of his neck where a major artery is at.

If Shanzo's attack had hit, Koji's throat would start spewing blood out at a rapid pace. Filling his lungs up with blood and spraying blood onto Shanzo as he drinks some sake.* - Sun Dec 13 00:19:34 2015
