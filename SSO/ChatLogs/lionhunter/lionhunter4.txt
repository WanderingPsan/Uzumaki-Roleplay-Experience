<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would open the scroll and read it intensely. The scroll contained a very powerful jutsu apperently and she could learn it. She looked over the information and her thought process  escalated. She looked at the  description of the jutsu it was something that would take time to master. She continued to read over the jutsu.

The idea of of using genjutsu as a concept of attack was unhearlded. It was a concept that she never even thought about because she never thought about attacking anyone. The aspect of killing people was something she was willing to do as a shinobi but didnt witness yet. Was this jutsu the first taste of blood? Will it change her?

She thought about it for a second. The desire to kill... the blood on her hands... the way of a shinobi... it was all being developed. She looked around because she felt a presence that wasnt there. It frightned her a little and she cluched the scroll in her hands tight. She checked around once more for signatures* - Thu Nov 12 05:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) then she went to the mechanics of the jutsu once more.  She shook off her feelings of being watched off and went back to her training. She would then study the remainins parts of the scroll and return* - Thu Nov 12 05:28:32 2015
