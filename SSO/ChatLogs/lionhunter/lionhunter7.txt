<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Lead the way. - Sat Nov 14 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Wonder what that was about. - Sat Nov 14 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hm. - Sat Nov 14 06:13:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Everything alright? - Sat Nov 14 06:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would say with irritation in her voice,"Yea... Im fine" in a typical girl answer... Lera should have been able to interpret it easily Izanami too. SHe got in a fighting stance and crouched alittle keeping her hands together* - Sat Nov 14 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: *stares* - Sat Nov 14 06:17:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thought so. - Sat Nov 14 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And he said something that upset you? - Sat Nov 14 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: He kept teasing me and I dont like that! - Sat Nov 14 06:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Wow... - Sat Nov 14 06:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: He poked my stomach and flick me - Sat Nov 14 06:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well they do say that the subject is always the oblivious one. - Sat Nov 14 06:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: He likes you - Sat Nov 14 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I know that, he told me he did. But he didnt have to go that far! - Sat Nov 14 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its a sign of affection. - Sat Nov 14 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I dont like being teased - Sat Nov 14 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Then tell him that. No need to go off in a huff. Like I said, he was just showing his affection in the most non-awkward way he could. - Sat Nov 14 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I told him that  wasnt looking for a relationship right now. And he said he understood; I can understand joking but that was for too long! - Sat Nov 14 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *shrug* I guess. - Sat Nov 14 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well. Come at me I guess. - Sat Nov 14 06:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Ok... dont hit me too hard... Im fragil... - Sat Nov 14 06:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I won't hit you - Sat Nov 14 06:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Unless you force me too. - Sat Nov 14 06:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: ... - Sat Nov 14 06:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would start, she walked forward and formed several handseals as she moved forward at a decently fast pace. The chakra was mounded and it looked she held it in place for now. She didnt do much the first turn other than that. Then the area around her began to chage; sand rose from her under Lera and started to rotate around her. 

It seemed that Rias was controlling the eviroment around her.* - Sat Nov 14 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Tweaked it so it wouldnt be that BAD a nightmare... she liked the girl she wasnt trying to scare her to death* - Sat Nov 14 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Imma make some custom jutsu gens when I get all mt clan stuff - Sat Nov 14 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: -omit that- - Sat Nov 14 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Nothing I can do about the sound...will just have to bear it. - Sat Nov 14 06:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: Genjutsu.. - Sat Nov 14 06:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: I know those handseals from a mile away. - Sat Nov 14 06:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Well...this didnt exactly turn out as she planned. She moved forward still and she would form a single seal that lera couldnt see, a seal that formed a circle in her hand and her body would go limp. A jolt of chakra would move straight in front of her and aimed at Lera. Lera wouldnt notice it unless she sensed chakra* - Sat Nov 14 06:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would take over her body and talk to her. "Lera... its me.. Rias, Im sorry I did this to you but I really dont have a rival in my profession. I just want to test my abilities on a veteran shinobi." Only Lera was able to hear her as they were bonded by the mind atm... She would remove the the blindfold to see her nightmare.

Tetsumi would see Lera acting like Rias, she placed her hand over her mouth in shock and cried... "Im so sorry!!!" she said dispelling the gen and returning to her body.* - Sat Nov 14 07:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You say you wanted to test on a veteran shinobi. - Sat Nov 14 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yes - Sat Nov 14 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But I don't think theres anyone...well besides a few, who could resist that. - Sat Nov 14 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: ....That technique again..... Doesn't she learn?... - Sat Nov 14 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I resisted it! HA! - Sat Nov 14 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Shukaku: - Sat Nov 14 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: -OMIT- - Sat Nov 14 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Shukaku:"SHUT UP!" - Sat Nov 14 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Bitch Shukaku, I have more chakra than you. - Sat Nov 14 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Shukaku:"SHUT UP!" - Sat Nov 14 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I see, well can I try another technique if you dont mind... Since this spar cant really work? - Sat Nov 14 07:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure. - Sat Nov 14 07:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would form one more seal but it was in the shake of a square. "I trust you guys so please dont tell anyone..." she said as Lera would feel jolt of chakra in her nervous system and she would lose control of her body* - Sat Nov 14 07:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Whoa.. - Sat Nov 14 07:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: This girl...could be a tide changer. - Sat Nov 14 07:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: That's kind of scary.. - Sat Nov 14 07:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter)  would not know about the extent of her power over the mind. She would make Lera take the sword and swund it around a few times. then she would then place the sword back to the position on her back and release the jutsu...

And smile, "Its good having friends to share my jutsu with~" she smiled She would ask her... "How did that feel Lera?"* - Sat Nov 14 07:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: ..... - Sat Nov 14 07:17:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: He would put his dick in you so fast, you wouldn't know what hit you - Sat Nov 14 07:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: ............ - Sat Nov 14 07:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Hassan says he likes woman of.... My size - Sat Nov 14 07:19:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: If not - Sat Nov 14 07:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Use that technique and kill him - Sat Nov 14 07:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: He better stay away. - Sat Nov 14 07:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Don't even hesitate. - Sat Nov 14 07:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: ...Hm.. - Sat Nov 14 07:20:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I hear alot about him. - Sat Nov 14 07:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: No Hassan says Edge like women of my size... I have no idea what Hassan liked - Sat Nov 14 07:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah. He's...for lack of a better term...a bit of a dick. - Sat Nov 14 07:21:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I should've killed him back then... - Sat Nov 14 07:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I've heard the rumors of that, alls I can say is...be careful of him I guess. - Sat Nov 14 07:21:10 2015
