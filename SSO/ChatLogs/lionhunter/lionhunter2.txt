<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Practice you jutsu - Fri Nov  6 18:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would pull out the new scroll she got and placed it on the table. She looked it over and read about the details of the scroll. It was a jutsu called sly mind effect, the jutsu was harder to learn then her other techniques. It mattered little to her as she could tough it out. She would preform the hand seals with ease and go ofter what it would do.

She would read the jutsu intensly and preform the hand seals again. She moulded the chakra but she never executed the jutsu. She would have to eventually find a target to use the jutsu on but that would most likely she would use it on J or Z. She recited the jutsu line for line and began to think of strategies to impliment with such a jutsu. "Maybe if I put them in a gen first it will be easier to put them in my jutsu..." she wondered.

Rias hugged her body and pushed her breast up. Her cleaveage would be in full view from her dress as she continued to read. <I wonder if I should get some glasses... I bet that would make me gorgous~> she said in her head getting distracted. These other jutsu would increase her efficancy and give her another option other than her signature technique.

She reached the end of the scroll. She learned the jutsu front and back on paper. The concept of the jutsu was simple but now she had to impliment it in battle.* - Fri Nov  6 18:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would them try out her new genjutsu, she walked out side and stood by the door. She spying on a cute guy walking outside the plaza. She would form the hand seals and isolate him in the genjutsu. She succesfully hit him and stopped in his tracks. She was curious about what he was seeing. She would use her mind transfer to send her mind into his mind. 

As she entered his mind she would talk to him. She told him to relax and tell him what he saw. He told her about what happened and that he couldnt reach his destination. She would thank him and retreat back to her mind. She would then  release him with genjutsu kai and walk back inside. 

She then walked back to the desk and went to try her other move. She form pull out two shuriken, she would place one shuriken onto another. She would throw them at the wall. The shuriken hit the wall but the move wasnt hidden very well. "I guess I need more training" she said sighing* - Fri Nov  6 19:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would go through her jutsu once more. She would form several hand seals and activate her genjutsu. She wouldnt activate it becasue she had to to have a target.

She would go over the hand seals of all her jutsu one by one. The purpose of this was to increase her hand seal speed and the effeicencly of her jutsu going off. As long as she could finish the hand seald she could get ready for her combo.

She would look over her knowledge of her jutsu once more.* - Sat Nov  7 00:52:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would scoot closer to Z and look at the stars. SHe took a note of all the constellations he mentioned. "You must really love stars.. but then again this is nothing new." she said as she would move alittle on the going.* - Sat Nov  7 06:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) She just wanted to cuddle, he was suprised he didnt notice. She would recite the names after him rapid fire, it was easy for her to remember. She felt his face nearing her explaining the stars and seeing his eyes... she blushed a little and pushed his glasses up for him. She would lean her head over to his.* - Sat Nov  7 06:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) sighed she would then roll over... "I need to get you a girlfriend... " she said  still looking in the sky..."Im getting sleepy... walk me home?" she said looking at him* - Sat Nov  7 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would get up and dust off her clothes, "No you dont you work with me and J" she said walking home* - Sat Nov  7 07:42:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: What's up? - Sun Nov  8 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Nothing... I was just about to start training - Sun Nov  8 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Can I tag along? - Sun Nov  8 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Sure I dont mind - Sun Nov  8 02:12:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Come on~ - Sun Nov  8 02:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) brought up her hand seals and quickly went through them with speed. She held the last one and preformed the Bushin technique. and summon clones in front of her. She would look to Z and say, "Check ths out!" she smiled.

She placed her hand on his shoulder and his perception would change. He would see what she was sensing. It looked like blue fire orbs in his eyes, "I learned  new move for better team work" she said sensing the world around them. 

She would them then preform more  hand seals and try the aspect of her Sly mind effect by targeting Z. He wasnt in effect as long as he didnt move. She would dispell the jutsu with haste so she could work on her next jutsu.

She would twirl shuriken between her hands and throw them as she tries to put one shuriken hiding in another. Its was still a work in progress jutsu, but she was going to get it someday 
* - Sun Nov  8 03:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Was almost done with her current skills, she would begin to intensly sense she area around her. She would feel the presence of everyone far away.  She would slowly build on her sensing so she could naturally find people and further predict their movements. 

She planned to focus her chakra and preform her signature jutsu. Her planned path was to curve her mind path so it could be harder to predict. She would push more chakra into the jutsu. She though about this for a while.

She would then add the strategy of Z adding his shadow into the target after she caught the opponent. Z's job was to immoblise the target after she caught it. Then finally  J was used as the nail in the coffin. J was her protecter and her attacker. His job was to protect mer liveless bodyand as a weapon. But was a difficult team to make, however they had the drive.* - Sun Nov  8 03:36:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) form her seals and her jutsu went into motion... suddenly her body went limp and lifeless falling to her knees. Anyone noticing her would think she passed out for some reason or another. She would go through the strategy would go through her head as they started their formation.

She was the first person on the order of movement so she had an important job. She would wait for Z to start his action.* - Mon Nov  9 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) as he smashed the scarecrow her head would look up and she would say, "Ok, I got it from here Z." she said as she would wait till be released from the jutsu. She would then ask, "Ok so far we have the first formation down pat. We just need to increase the speed in which we can use the combo." she said  as she would start to read teh scroll that Z gave her... <Just useless> she thought as she put it up and start again.

She formed her seal once more and poured  more energy into using it. She passed out once again as she would wait for the next step on the plan once more* - Mon Nov  9 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Termine, Jover(Bosshoggoutlaw) says: just yall be missing - Mon Nov  9 04:26:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would come back to her senses as J would destroy the scarecrows. "Im sorry I didnt hear it but I bet it was good!" she would smile and walk to high five the giant.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yea, I om not a taijutsu user or ninjutsu user - Mon Nov  9 08:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Interesting... are you sure you wouldn't be interested in a spar? - Mon Nov  9 08:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I mean... what do you use? - Mon Nov  9 08:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Hm, Not Tai or Nin...could be Genjutsu she uses. I doubt it would be Fuuinjutsu like me. - Mon Nov  9 08:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Just simple Kenjutsu. - Mon Nov  9 08:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Sounds a little risky Rias. - Mon Nov  9 08:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: If you get sliced up...well we don't have many doctors in the village... - Mon Nov  9 08:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: See... I cant match that... it would be over rather quickly unless you stll want to try... - Mon Nov  9 08:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Heh. Easy for which of us, hrm? - Mon Nov  9 08:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Well I guess we can give it ago... - Mon Nov  9 08:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: This is a bad idea... - Mon Nov  9 08:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) //

"Ok..".let me start with this. Rias started to look at the scroll for the new moves Z would tell her to study. She sat down and study the scrolls. It was a taijutsu move which completely disinterested in. Its not like she couldnt attack , be it was useless for her to do so. Her body was soft and spongy and was not combat ready.

She would read over the scroll and and get the mechanics of the move. It was rather simple to execute the move in question, and it would make her look wierd. She continued to read on read and look at some examples of the move. She move was basicly a flying kick. <Im not using this at all > she though tossing away the scrolls and putting them back in the bad she had* - Mon Nov  9 08:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Uh, Sword lady. - Mon Nov  9 08:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I don't doubt your skill with a blade but. - Mon Nov  9 08:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Please don't inflict any deep cuts. - Mon Nov  9 08:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: We have nearly no medics in the village. - Mon Nov  9 08:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would walk to the side oppisite her and get in a ready stance, Her letgs were spread and her body was stand straight. She had a great body, her chest was a D cup with a big but to match. However it was propotionally perfect to her shaply figure. Her skinw as soft and her body bounced with every movement. She wore a combat dress that hugged ger curves and she would form several hand seals  with a relatively fact pace to ready her first move* - Mon Nov  9 08:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) As she noticed her hands she would be cause in a genjutsu... the point of this jutsu would be to thorw off her opponents sense of direction. She would manupulate the jutsu to make it see like Rias was alot closer then she seemed to be. It would be like Mitsunara's vision would be zoomed  in do she would not beable to reach her.

if this worked she would throw 1 shuriken at her. If she had good eyesight she would see that where was something under the shuriken.* - Mon Nov  9 08:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) was close... in fact she didnt really move from her spot. She stood still as the gen took effect just before she reached her. As the weapons bouced off her skin she looked on and thought. <Well she has me beat if she attacks> she thought. She formed a wierd hand seal... she though to herself. <No..I can use that... I have to accept the loss...>she thpought again. She would break the genjutsu and put her hands up..."I give up...your too strong" she said* - Mon Nov  9 09:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Mitsunara was still not close to Rias from her genjutsu effect...nor did she indicatated that she moved. So as she still held her blade and moved forward intending to attack Rias would put up one hand seal in the fraction of a second and pass out. Her body would lay helplessly on the ground as Mitsunara would feel a presence taking control of her body and hear a voice in her head.

Rias would have cause to do this becasue she never seemed to stop the spar in the first place. * - Mon Nov  9 09:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would dispense the genjutsu from a distance and say, "Im done... you win your way stronger than I am" she said walking to Akira... she would think <Im glad Z is not here... He would bug me to train.> 

All of this were to happen of she was allowed to leave* - Mon Nov  9 09:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would shake her head, "Sorry but we literally just ate... but maybe next time ok?" She smiled to the woman."Every one has their strengths and weaknesses; for example you could destroy me with that in close range, but im not a Taijutsu fighter so of course I couldnt win. Its all about strategy."

Rias then said, "But your definatly a strong person... I cant underestimate you." "Akira, do you want to walk me home?" she smiled at him* - Mon Nov  9 10:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yes bye~ - Mon Nov  9 10:08:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yea, im fine but I cant puch my uck in spars anymore... - Mon Nov  9 10:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: It's fine, don't worry you did great. - Mon Nov  9 10:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) grabbed his hand and walked home* - Mon Nov  9 10:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) arrived at her house safe... "Thanks cutie... you sweet." She would kiss him on his cheek and wave him off. * - Mon Nov  9 10:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Maybe~ - Mon Nov  9 10:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) walks inside and locks her door before saying, "You just have to wait and see~" she said smiling* - Mon Nov  9 10:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: So do I. - Tue Nov 10 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Heh. Both in the same boat I suppose. - Tue Nov 10 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah, Might ask that lady after her spar. - Tue Nov 10 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: She seems to know a thing or two. - Tue Nov 10 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Hmm. That does seem like a good idea. - Tue Nov 10 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: I'll let you have her though, no point slumping two of us onto her. - Tue Nov 10 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) walked up swaying her hips playfully and say, "Helloooooooooooooo everyone~"* - Tue Nov 10 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) thinks: Judging by that hip movement. I'm guessing this is the village bike. - Tue Nov 10 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: They're still going at it..? - Tue Nov 10 05:43:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I knew you showed potential. - Tue Nov 10 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would walk up to Akira with her hands behind her back smile at him,  she looked at the other guy and smiled to. Rias was taller then average for a girl. She stood 5'10'' with a busty figure. She had D cup breasts with a butt to match. Her measurements were porportioned just right to match her body type. Her skin look very soft , and her personallty looked very bubbly.

She faintely sensed everyone in the area naturally to sense what kind of chakra they had. She then walked to her partner sparring and stood by to watch* - Tue Nov 10 06:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Way to go Z! - Tue Nov 10 06:09:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would walk to him and hand him a towel, "Nice fight out there Z! I like it when you actually try~" she said with a smile on her face. She could sense his chakra and see he wasnt -THAT- tired... <He probuly ran out of stratgies> she thought.* - Tue Nov 10 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: ....he's going to fight her? - Tue Nov 10 06:18:01 2015

"So your our teacher now? Should we call you Sensei~?" she wondered. "And we need chakra to shoot out the wire?" she questioned the logic of the jutsu... could it even be called a jutsu?* - Tue Nov 10 08:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Right. . So the process behind this jutsu is deceptivly simple - Tue Nov 10 08:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: You keep the spool hidden in your sleeve or on your belt, or where ever. Then you gather up chakra and form your handsigns, flowing it into the hidden wire. With that don, you use your chakra to direct where you want the wire to go. It can be amazingly helpful in combat, or in a suprise attack.  - Tue Nov 10 08:18:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would look at the wire and tug on it. She tested the durability of it with weak strength. She couldnt break out of it but if her thinking was right then it could be extremely useful to her. She heard the conversation between the two and it seemed like the were in fact really close. She didnt look too deep into it, she just went back to examining the wire.

Rias was alittle jealous that Z was getting all of the reconition for his skills as he sparred and trained with everyone but she could not. I mean it wasnt like she couldnt spar but she was scared to be hurt. Ever since J hit her my accident one time while they were playing, she went to the hospital becasue she was alit more frail then she looked. She thought to herself while fidding with the wire and trying to find a place to put it.

She placed the spoll under wrist and looked at it...<I really need a place to put this...>she thought thinking about an interest in fuuinjutsu. As she placed it there and wrapped it around wrist and asked Marrisa. "Um, do you know anyone who knows fuuinjutsu? It might serve a good use for me." she asked while testing the weight and the aim of her knew wrist launcher... <I might need to make a few improvements on this> she thought.

She aimed it tried to push her chakra into the wire to push it out and about but didnt work. She would wonder what she was doing wrong... she had enough chakra but she wasnt focusing it right. She tried again to control her chakra. She would place her arms out with one arm holding her arm of the other. She build up her chakra and focused that chakra into her wrist where the spool was.

She concetrated on the wire and extended toward the gate.* - Tue Nov 10 15:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would go on to continue her practicing the technique. She might have a great idea for this jutsu, if it could be even call that. She would pour the chakra in to the wire and it acivated the it, making the wire come "alive". She wire shot out from her wrists and it shot to the gate. It stopped short of the gate and dropped to the ground. <Shoot... I guess I need alittle more work on this... Im a smart girl this shouldnt be that hard!> she thought.

Rias went to go pick up and reel back in the wire. while doing this she thought back to the spar. She was always taught not to tip her hand before playing it. Her jutsu would only work if no one knew about it. If they did know about it then it would be easier to catch them until she got higher ranked jutsu. She would reel the wire back in the spool while she was in her thinking mindset.

Rias focused her chakra once more after forming her hand seals. She would shoot out the wire from her wrist and the wire would fly out towards the gate once again. The wire would go to the gate and im pact it beforefalling to the ground again. <Ok, I hsave made progress... a few more tries and I think I got this thing down.> she thought reeling the wire back in.

Rias plan for the wires was to use it as a tether. A surefire traveling line for her conscience to move along to make sure her technique hits its mark. It would serve a great purpose for her. As she fully reeled back the wire once more she would aim to try to use it again. She would quickly form her hand seals and try to shoot the wire once more to its target hitting the gate and wrapping around a few of the links.

<So thats how it works. You have to keep channeling your chakra into the wire to control its movements. Ok so as long as I can channel chakra and I have chakra when the move should work.>She explained in her head to get the complete understanding of the jutsu. She would marvel at her success and with the wire and attempt to pull it back from the gate.

Pouring more chakra into the wire she would make the wire lax and slowly unwrap it from the gates. She would the think... <I really need to find a way to hide this... it will not a surpise if people can see it.> Rias sensed the area and left to find Z and J so she could stay by their side. "I should try that tea shop today with him. I wonder will I like it?" she thought. She had a feeling that he liked her and she did think he was cute but she wasnt looking for a relationship currently... She wanted to have fun alittle while longer.* - Tue Nov 10 16:14:30 2015
