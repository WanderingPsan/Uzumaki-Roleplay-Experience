It had markings all over his body with a giant tail behind him... It was overwhelming and angry; it towered over me... I was an ant compared to it..." she started to sweat and shake now... clearly she needed to be comforted.

"It kicked me out after wrapping me in what looked like sand and then I was in my own body... and that was all I saw" she finished* - Fri Nov 13 07:08:48 2015
