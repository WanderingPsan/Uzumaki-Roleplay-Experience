<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yes dear - Sun Dec  6 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would stand up and walk toward the girl. The kneed beside her and would look at the dog and back her her... "You really love him dont you?" she smiled and patted her on the head. 

"Well since you showed be yours then I can show you mine~" she said biting her thumb and placing her hand on the ground and summoning a poof of smoke... out of the smoke make a cute little bager would walk over to sniff the dog and the girl. 

"I dont have a name for them but this is my summon~" she smiled continuously* - Sun Dec  6 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would shake her head. "No im a genjutsu and clan specalist.... I dabbled in summoning recently" she would say reaching to the dog, "Can I pet him?" she asked getting closer to the child.* - Sun Dec  6 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) didnt have a grasp of the womans physical features so she was unaware of her appereance. She would smile at the -woman- around her age. Rias stood 5'10; rather large for a woman but she was naturally tall. 

She would nod at her "Thats good... you look similar to me... Im frail in nature even though im "curvy" and I decided to focus on my clan techniques and genjutsu... I wanted to do Fuuinjutsu but it was too much for me"* - Sun Dec  6 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) was quite shocked... she found a woman in her village that was around her height... around her body size... and was related to a family that had its ties in Leaf also. "I have a feeling we will be the best of friends~" she smiled and hugged the woman. 

Rias's body was covered by the diamond armor that was covered by the hokage robes she had... that covered her frail yet curvy body. She would stand up and say "Its a badger and sure, they are friendly..."* - Sun Dec  6 06:28:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: You know its only been a while since i had this much fun in a while - Sun Dec  6 06:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) thought the woman was beautiful and rather cute. If she was into girls it was assumed to be in her grasp. But however, she was only into one girl... her resent love, Paine. She would say, "You are very cute when you do that."

Rias wanted her in her Hokage harem... She hand a close circle of friends in the village. It was a good move to her. she would get back to her seat and sit down. She rested on the chair and the badger was picked up and put on the desk...

"Well if you need anything do not heitate to ask me ok? Im here for you" she smiled as Abraxas came in the mansion* - Sun Dec  6 07:04:57 2015

Rias was no stranger to blood. She killed 2 criminals daily when she was being trained by Hassan. Some of the killed were extremly bloody while the others were not at all so was she proficient enough to reconize it?

Either was she didnt care care if the woman used blood ink or not... as long as it was done. "Thank you I will reward you for giving me this information."

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(LionHunter) walked into her office, the robes of the Hokage still on her, her form under the robes were less structured and more rounded. Her stomach was rounded and out. It would soon be known that she was pregnant. She would slowly sit in her chair and see several news letters on her desk. 

One of the letters was about Kumogakure declaring independence from and naming Konohagakure a ally in their goal. "Well thats g-... Nope... Nope... nope..." she immediatly went to pen a letter to Sanoke to inform him of a meeting that was requrired. She had no idea what was going on but she wasnt going to allow such a rumor to slide.

She hold her stomach as it was already time for the baby to be due..."Ugh... already???" she said calling a doctor in her office. He would arrive shortly.

Two people came in and she would greet them..."Grover where is your brother... Im worried about him... ugh.." she said trying to hold the baby in for a little longer until the doctor came back... She would then see Kai, "Hold on just a minute hun... ok?" she said sitting in her hair* - Tue Dec  8 05:36:12 2015

After a time in the hospital Rias gave birth to a healthy baby boy named Hayate Jiki. It was his fathers idea to name him and she didnt object. A few days later she was alittle soar but she would come back to her office with the baby in her arms. She loved the child even though she and Tetsumi werent together. Who knows what Tetsumi wanted to teach the baby.

As she relaxes, she would get down serious business. She formed a shadow clone to take and hold the baby for her as she would contront Grover and Kai...

"J... I see... I will find out who did this and I will bring them to justice... they will pay for my best friends death" she said coldly before returning to Kai... "Ok little guy whats your name?" she said with a kinder tone* - Tue Dec  8 05:50:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(LionHunter) would dart her eyes around keeping track of everyone in the mansion. A shadow clone of Rias was holding her baby beside her. Mitsunara walked in, said hi to Asteroth and left shortly. Asteroth would exit the building as well. There actions would be noted and there relationship would requre insight. Asteroth was a traveler so she probuly met her on ther travels but it would still be looked into.

<Hayate was one... maybe?>

Would focus in Kai for the moment, "Come on hun spit it out... I dont have all day..." she said as the childs timid nature was hindering progress. She would then point to the anbu agent... and point to the baby... "Come on... dont be shy... get him please might have to leave..." she said looking at the letter she received* - Tue Dec  8 06:05:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(LionHunter) would take him in her arms softly rocking him back and forward to calm him down. "There, there, mommy is here... its going to be ok..." she kissed him on his forehead.

She would look up at Grover, "Well congradulations... Im sure you will do fine... but as for now I need to have a meeting with the Kazekage... I will be back soon. Osuda your in charge while im gone ok?" she said getting up and heading to the door.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) thinks: This is awkward.. - Tue Dec  8 07:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) thinks: I wonder what can I sell to these people here. - Tue Dec  8 07:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: Weird. - Tue Dec  8 07:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) thinks: I should try to get information on the two while I'm here. I'm sure she'll know something. - Tue Dec  8 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .... - Tue Dec  8 07:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: . . . - Tue Dec  8 07:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: What are all of these people here for, Lady Hokage? - Tue Dec  8 07:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: ZE KRIEEEEGGGGG! - Tue Dec  8 07:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would go to her desk and press the button on the loud speaker... she would tell everyone in her office to hush for a second while she made the announce clear. A hush went over the room as she would calmly and say with a strong feminine voice...

"It has come to my attention that Kumogakure has planned to gain independence... naming Konohagakure as a ally. Let me make one thing perfectly clear..." she clears her throat. "Sunagakure and Konohagakure are allies. The current establishment is now, which is Kumogakure, will continue to be a vassal state of Sunagakure. After years of pouring in labor, we won't allow such insubordination. As such, one last plea for peace is given. Raikage -- stand down, or suffer. Any likeminded individual is urged to -- alongside their leader -- leave the village and start anew. But the land itself remains owned by Sunagakure. That is all."

She turns off the intercom.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: Seems as if she's still eating from the palm of Sunagakure.. - Tue Dec  8 07:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: So that's what this is all about. - Tue Dec  8 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) thinks: If I keep this up, I'll learn something. - Tue Dec  8 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: Unecessary. - Tue Dec  8 07:33:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Maybe I was. - Tue Dec  8 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I still doubt there will be a war. - Tue Dec  8 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah.. maybe. - Tue Dec  8 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Anyway.. ah, Hokage-Sama... I'll talk to you later, then. I'll.. be around town, training. I'm.. certainly not ready to help with this kind of thing. - Tue Dec  8 07:33:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: I guess I should start making some calls. Whoever has the better supplies will win in the end. - Tue Dec  8 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Wait... War?... Nope! Going to flee this village too! Nope Nope, NOT AT ALL! I WON'T BE DRAFTED!!!! - Tue Dec  8 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks: ..... - Tue Dec  8 07:34:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks: War. - Tue Dec  8 07:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Thak you Trill, Yes this is my office... who are you again?; Osuda these are shinobi and guards from Suna to help us if we are attacked - Tue Dec  8 07:34:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Excuse me, may I have your name? I just can't keep looking at your beauty without knowing who you are. - Tue Dec  8 07:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Akainu_Hellhound) says: .... - Tue Dec  8 07:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Don't you think all of this is a little unecessary? - Tue Dec  8 07:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Hrm? Asteroth. Why? - Tue Dec  8 07:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Mrm... I don't think so, little Izanami. - Tue Dec  8 07:37:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: What a beautiful name to match a splendid craft of human perfection. - Tue Dec  8 07:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: It's reasonable people will get angry. It's like Sunagakure is the adult that forcefully holds unto their childs hand and tells them what to do even though they are old enough to make their own decesions. - Tue Dec  8 07:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I don't think they should be punished for trying to be themselves. - Tue Dec  8 07:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: The real problem is why is Sunagakure still holding the hand of Kumogakure? - Tue Dec  8 07:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: I recall a situation like this before a few years ago. Just the sides were switched. - Tue Dec  8 07:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: The way I see it, this is only making a problem bigger then it already is. - Tue Dec  8 07:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: They clearly want their independence.. - Tue Dec  8 07:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Anyway, it's bad manners for me to not state my name. I'm Tetsu.  - Tue Dec  8 07:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I say instead of trying to solve things violently, we come to a consensus and allow them their freedom. It's not another villages place to control another village..it only causes problems. - Tue Dec  8 07:39:56 2015
