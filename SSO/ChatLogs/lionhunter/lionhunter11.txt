The would take her a minute to complete as she would look up and smile upon hearing them. "Yes sir~" she said puttin her nose back to work.

She looked at the papers and reminded him, "Oh, Hassan Kiyoko is planning her wedding... I dont know if you will need permits or anything for the private or public venures." she wondered finishing the paper work and handing him the papers that required his immediate attention.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would start her push ups... then a wild Hassan got on her back, she blushed a bright red as he did so. Her idol was top of her... She would squirm a little out of excitement. "Y-y-es sir." she nervously said as she began her push ups. She knocked the first 10 out like usual. Hassan on her back made it alittle harder but she would still complete the first 10 easily.

She would still stuggle now, and it was alot harder to do it witht he extra weight. "Its t-to much sir..."  she struggled to get out the next ten push ups. He wasnt heave but the extra weight but a extra strain on her body. She was starting to shake and buckle just from 20 push ups. SHe really needed to improve her strength* - Tue Nov 17 08:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would feel his excitement and continue on her push ups. She would knock out 10 more with the new level of adrenaline she had. It was thanks to Hassan he gave her the strength she needed to power through the rest of the push ups. It was her determination that needed to get tot he next level. She knocked out the other 10 and she started to sweat and buckle more under the pressure.

<Come on Rias you can do it! This is for the progress you deserve!> she thought in her head with such passion. She would slowly but surely pull off the final 10 push ups, but the weight affected her. She was back to her original position of weak kneeded and jello armed pain. But it was more tolerable this time, she could still move her body.* - Tue Nov 17 08:47:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Got up and readed herself* - Tue Nov 17 08:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would nod, she rubbed her legs together imagining the impossible... his crotch was litterally by her head... <The things I would d- No! he is my idol! I cant think such thoughts to this creation of perfection! Im not worthy of replacing Rin!> she argued with herself. She would run outside and make sure not to run him into anything. She found her way to the prison, her back starting to hurt and her bady started to sweat alot more. She huffed making it back to the office extremely tired and soar from the exercises* - Tue Nov 17 09:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: ... - Tue Nov 17 09:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) She looked at the man... anger was in her eyes... children were the light of th world and this man would seek to destroy that light. She had debated before about taking a human life... she wasnt opposed to it. In fact she would willingly do it if she had to. This was the life of a shinobi she accepted... "You scum of the earth... For your crimes against children and girls you will face the nightmare known as RIAS INOZUMA!" as she said this she would slowly place him in a genjutsu... the jutsu showed a enormous fireball coming for him and melting his skin and eyes. Of course this was all in his mind but she wanted a deep mind fucking before she would actually kill him.

He warched him suffer in his mind. Hearing his screams of pain and agony as his brain felt the powerful genjutsu. She would feel that he needed the feel the pain of everyone person. Every single little girl he killed... he needed to feel their agony. Was this harsh for Rias? Yes supremely... Would Hassan stop her? Maybe? But she would not stop herself. She showed a different side to Hassan. A ruthless side to her bubbly personality, a dark side that manifested when she dealt with scum of the earth.* - Tue Nov 17 09:38:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) As the next man came in he was just as disgusting.... "I will teach you not to disrespect me or anyone else again..." she formed one hand seal Hassan had not seen this technique before... Withen  mere seconds he would lose control of his own body. "You are under my control now..." she said as he was helpless. "And the first thing you will do is remove that sad excuse if a dick..." in a flash he unwillingly grabbed his dick and ripped it off with his bare hands... the man screamed in pain.

"Stop you whining you piece of shit..." as he man stuffed his mouth with his ripped off dick. She would then finish the man stabbing him in the neck to end his life also. The only blood on her hands were on her shoes as she stepped over the bodies. She justed killed two people in the span of 30 minutes... She made pretty good time.* - Tue Nov 17 09:54:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Watched as Hassan preformed the Sumien technique. She was aware of the move but never personally learned it. Now she was getting a chance to from her idol. She would have plenty of material to "have some fun tonight" while Hassan was sleeping. After all she was a growing girl.

She would stand there and concentrate on the technique for now. Her hands were formed and her chakra was building. She focused her chakra into her feet. She would take a minute to regulate her chakra in her feet by balancing the flow of chakra untill she felt equlillbrium.

When this was achieved she would slowy move tho the wall and place her foot on it. She would then finally move along the wall and turn to him, "This took a while... but I think I get the gist  of it" she stated as she focused on keeping the focus on her feet* - Tue Nov 17 10:13:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: He has soo much energy - Tue Nov 17 10:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would catch on the the concept quickly. She noticed how he would distripute the chakra to his body, pushing chakra inside of his body to increase the rate in which his body moves. She would follow his example and mimic his actions.

One thing he forgot to mention was to what the move caused the body to do as a result. She would exert chakra all throughout her body and into her organs to increase the rate at which she could move. She seeming moved a short distance, moved to his opposite side.

She smiled and said, "See I-"she stopped and covered her mouth as she would hunch over from the pain and suffering from the after effects of the technique. "Oh God... w-" she said trying to hold it in. But the effects of the jutsu was strong. She disgustingly swallowd her "pride" and stuck her tongue out in disgust* - Tue Nov 17 10:36:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would look around at the ingredients. There was alot of ingredients and spices around, the place was pached with supplies...."Ok this should be a cake walk..." she said with confidence. She rolled up her sleeves and got down to business. 

She would aquire the pots and pans she needed for the cooking the pasta. Rias sprayed the pan with cooking spray. She then cut the chicken breast into strips and cooked it until tender in one of the pots. While cooking the chicken she seasoned it with garlic, onion powder, salt and pepper and set aside.

Moving on to a different part of the kichten and fills a pot with water 3/4 full with water and bring to a boil. She puts the pasta and adds 1 tsp. olive oil to prevent sticking. She finally cooks 3 to 5 minutes until al dente.

Rias was busy with cooking she didnt notice her surroundings.* - Tue Nov 17 11:27:21 2015

She grabbed several plates from the cabinets and placed some of the pasta on a plates. from the seperate pot she added broccoli and corn to add to the healthiness of the food. She place chicken strips on top of the mixture and topped it with Alfredo sauce. 

Rias added a little treat and sprinkled Parmesan cheese over the top for an additional flare~

It looks like diamond, its the hardest mineral so I know its going to be tough. I hope you cut it right, but I assume you did it is your job. I hope you make it so it doesnt constrict me Im a big girl so it takes a delicate hand to make it right. And you need my measurements so it doesnt squah me right?

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Introduce yourself. - Tue Nov 17 22:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would walk in the class room, she was acting less like a sexual deviet and more like a proper teacher. Although with her body the "sexy school teacher" look was impossible. She would introduce herself, "Hello little ones, my name is Rias and im here to explain the Bushin jutsu to you all~" she said with some excitement in her voice. She felt like she was great with kids so the assumed this would be easy. Especially when the Kazekage supervising, <I wonder how the kids will act around me though> she thought* - Tue Nov 17 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: // - Tue Nov 17 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) looked at the group of students she would turn around and grab some chalk and write on the board. "Now... Bushin no jutsu or  "Clone Technique" is a ninjutsu that creates an intangible copy of one's own body, without any substance." She would start to draw a diagram of chakra output and a model of the technique.

"Since the clone itself doesn't have the ability to attack, and thus can only be used to confuse the enemy, it is mainly used in combination with other ninjutsu." She said as she would preform the technique. She formed the hand seal and a copy of her would appear in a cloud of smoke. Standing in a pose with a hand on her hip the Rias clone stood in beauty.

She continued, "It's a basic technique, but depending on one's ingenuity, it can be used effectively. The clones may not dissipate when they come into contact with something becasue it cant really do anything." she would throw a weapon at the clone and it would poof away.

"These clones can be easily distinguished by persons with "special eyes". A person with normal eyes can also distinguish the clones from the original, since the clones do not have shadows and will not disrupt the area around themselves with their movement. Like crushing grass or making tracks."

She would turn back around to face the class, "Any questions?"* - Tue Nov 17 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yo, Kazekage-Senpai-Sama-Sensei-Kun. We killed the dude, rescued Chikyu, and took no injuries. - Tue Nov 17 23:01:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yea? - Tue Nov 17 23:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: It's a secret technique, so it has to be somewhere no one else is. - Tue Nov 17 23:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Hmmm... your house? - Tue Nov 17 23:32:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: ok - Tue Nov 17 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) She would pour chakra in her feet. She walked over the mountain, following Hassan she had inproved the technique and she did have as much trouble.* - Tue Nov 17 23:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would follow his lead. She felt that Hassan was rubbing off on her. As his secretary and student he was always near her. She was with him in every decision and every conclusion. She would start to act like Hassan alittle, be alittle more confident and a little more out there. her speech would slightly alter. 

"Chakra flick got ya~" she said focusing her chakra in her hand. "So I just start to focus chakra in my finder tips?" she said slowly gathering chakra to her finger tip...She would take the time slowly to gather the chakra it would be a minute while she focused on her finger. She stared at it* - Wed Nov 18 00:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would continue to concentrate on her fingers, she would pour more and more chakra into her fingers as she concentrated hard in her training. She had alot of chakra so this would kinda offset the balance in control by over loading her finger with chakra.

"Yea thats it! Just like this!" she said as she kept pouring chakra in her finger. "Ok, so I just have to flick it out. Like exploding my chakra out of my finger while flicking out to get the push back I want." She though to her self for a bit... she really needed to get chakra control down in her next week of training.

She would focus more pressure on her finger and flick outward. It showed alittle power. She run after him to see if she was doing it right.* - Wed Nov 18 00:19:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter)  would continue to concentrate on her fingers, she would pour more and more chakra into her fingers as she concentrated hard in her training. She had alot of chakra so this would kinda offset the balance in control by over loading her finger with chakra.

"Yea thats it! Just like this!" she said as she kept pouring chakra in her finger. She would unleaseh the chakra build up in the air and a small cloud of dust would form in the area.  

"Ok, so I just have to flick it out. Like exploding my chakra out of my finger while flicking out to get the push back I want." She though to her self for a bit... she really needed to get chakra control down in her next week of training.

She would focus more pressure on her finger and flick outward. It showed alittle power. She run after him to see if she was doing it rightWould restart her training, she would refocus her chakra in her body to her hand. She then pushed even more chakra into her finger and formed a flicking motion before actually flicking. She would focus her chakra into her finger even more forcing chakra into her tip.

The was a grueling process as everything was usually easy for her. She was cringing as she felt techniques were supposed to come easy. "I guess I need to prove my battle prowess not just on paper... " she thought as she continued her training.

As the chakra was focused  she would flick her finger again. It produced chakra but not enough to where it would be sufficient to call her a success at preforming the move.

"Ok so Hassan said focus all my chakra into one pont in my finger and flick to make a explostion-like effect." she noted as she would get back to her position. She moved to flick the wall of Suna as it was a hard surface to impact.
 
She moved to the wall and placed her finger on the wall with her palm up. She would flick outward and expell her chakra to see the effect of the move she was learning* - Wed Nov 18 00:51:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would kick at the wall in anger and grab her foot in pain, "Ouch..." she said grabbing her foot for a moment. As the pain stopped for the moment she would grab her wrist and focus her chakra into her hand yet again. She focuses her chakra into her hand and then moved to the tip of her pulled back finger. She concentrates hard and puts a tremendous amount of chakra into her finger. "I got this... I need to focus..." she said sensing the chakra in her finger. Once she sensed alot of her chakra was in her finger she eould unleaseh the move.

With an explostion of chakra, Rias would flick the wall with her finger and cause a big dent in the earthy sand wall. She would sense the pressure in her finger dissappear as she unleashed all the chakra she had. She turned to Hassan and noticed Cypher. "Did I do good?" she would look and smile.* - Wed Nov 18 01:10:49 2015
