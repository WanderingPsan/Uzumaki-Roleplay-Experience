<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would walk to the old district area, it was battle torn and destructive about. She would look to the houses destroyed or damaged mailboxes for Hassan's mail box and she found it after a while searching but Hassan's house remained intact oddly. 

She would stare at the house for a while reading the mail box. It barely showed his last name but it was there she reconized it. There was another name there but it was crossed out, it read Tetsuki... she didnt know about a tetsuki but she had to have been precious to him.

She would enter the house as she had the key to the door being the secretary. She entered the home and looked around. It was old and dusty but the funiture was there. Layers of dust was everywhere as she walked through the house. She coughed and cough in the dusty area as she went to the bedroom.

Upon going to the bedroom she would walk past the bed, running her hand along the mattress and headign to the bathroom, she wondered what the gift was. As she entered she would look where the scroll was said to be located and grab it. She cluched it in her hands as she would say... "I will live on you you... My lord and my love... my dear sweet Hassan. This little solider will follow her dream and make you proud" more tears dropped from her face as she showed determination in her eyes to do her best!* - Thu Nov 26 05:20:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Other than that, the place seems pretty ok for now. - Thu Nov 26 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: There is noone here... - Thu Nov 26 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah, I think we should rest up here tonight. - Thu Nov 26 06:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Then continue the search for Ziare tomorrow. - Thu Nov 26 06:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) sighed... she sensed noone in the village. He would look at Akira and nod i agreement. She would sit down in the middle of the mansion area and real the scroll that Hassan had left for her. It would be her toughest yet to read and learn. * - Thu Nov 26 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Hmm?... - Thu Nov 26 07:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would feel his embrace as she noded. She would continue to read her scroll when she sensed someone one in her range. She would get up and look.* - Thu Nov 26 07:02:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: Get behind me. - Thu Nov 26 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would look at the man and sense his chakra, she didnt want to seem hostile to him but he looked dangerous. She would exercise caution around him, "We are from this village, Its ok... I just wanted to check the status of it... Who are you?" she said flashing her headband.

She was standing 5'10'' and covered in a blueish hue armor. It was a full body suit of armor that covered her features but her head. The woman was beautiful and her armor hugged her body which was the shape of a hour glass.

"My name is Rias... and you are" she said not standing behind him. She learned  to be fearless in front of opponents as she would gain respect from that.* - Thu Nov 26 07:13:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would run to him as fast as she could and hug him tightly. Tears were running down her face as she missed her childhood friend! "Z.... I was so worried about you! I sent you a letter but you didnt respond... I have so much to tell you!" she cried on his shoulder as the reunion was just what she needed* - Thu Nov 26 07:22:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: ... - Thu Nov 26 07:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would follow him all over Kono she also focused on him with her senseing so he would not escape* - Thu Nov 26 07:47:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I should probably get going actually. - Thu Nov 26 16:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) waves him off* - Thu Nov 26 16:39:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Just did. - Thu Nov 26 17:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: And where is J? - Thu Nov 26 17:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: No clue. - Thu Nov 26 17:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: ... - Thu Nov 26 17:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I thought he was with you. - Thu Nov 26 17:01:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: The worst that can happen to him is...Well nothing. - Thu Nov 26 17:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would sit down and pull out the scroll that was left to her by Hassan. She opened the scroll once more and started to read from it. The scroll listed very detailed instructions for the jutsu inside and  it was difficult to decipher.

She would focus on the contents of the scroll but it would take a while to read. At first it seemed like gibberish and she didnt really understand the scroll at all but eventually she would find a way to solve the mystery of the jutsu. After all she loved mysteries and thi as just another mystery to solve.

She would continue to read the scroll on and off for a while it would take a while for her to learn the jutsu but in time she would get it. She just had to stay focused and continue her reading every day.* - Thu Nov 26 17:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Your really irresponsible - Thu Nov 26 17:04:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'm still gonna protect you. - Thu Nov 26 17:11:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Good - Thu Nov 26 17:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Hello. - Thu Nov 26 18:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Hello - Thu Nov 26 18:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Is there a leader here? - Thu Nov 26 18:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: No there isnt currently - Thu Nov 26 18:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Oh so the both of you are the only people in this village? - Thu Nov 26 18:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: No... - Thu Nov 26 18:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: There are others - Thu Nov 26 18:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Well do you know if any of them are skilled in Raiton? - Thu Nov 26 18:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Not that I am aware of... actually I dont thing any of them can even use it - Thu Nov 26 18:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) says: What about Suiton? - Thu Nov 26 18:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) shakes her head* - Thu Nov 26 18:22:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Bye. - Thu Nov 26 18:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) decided that she would need to start thinking about mastering the art of genjutsu. She had been phsically training so much that she was slowly moving away from her strongest skill. She would start to get back to her genjutsu so she could have a stronger chance of protecting her self from any attacks that were forced on her. She would form several hand seals and cast her genjutsu, slowly she spread her chakra in the area trying to ensnarl multiple people in the same jutsu. It would take a while to accomplish but it will happen eventually.* - Fri Nov 27 10:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Hey Ziare, I'm back for good now. - Fri Nov 27 20:33:29 2015
