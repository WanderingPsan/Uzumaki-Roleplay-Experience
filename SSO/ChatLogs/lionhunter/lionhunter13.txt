"To get out of a genjutsu you need to disrupt your chakra flow. Basically like a restart get it?" she said simply. "You saw the hand sign right? Now you get out of this jutsu with it. Also this is the jutsu you will learn from me. But fell free to put your own twist on it with your guitar~"she said forming hand seals

Since he was going to be caught in the genjutsu on purpose she made the trigger obvious. She taught him another demonic illustion technique, Desending fire. He would see a huge fire ball headed toward him. The effects of the genjutsu would feel quite real to him. "Now try to break it before your mind in enfulfed in flames~" she said.

"Even having a lunch like this is abit slacking... Muhummad would have my head if he found out." she said casually. "I have to be a jounin level shinobi by the end of the month.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Was all about her training at the moment, she couldnt slack. This was her reason for coming to Sunagakure in the first place. "Im not eating, Im on a diet... I have a diet I have to follow." she would shake her head at the waitress.

While she was with him she was focusing chakra in her fingers. Praticing a jutsu for Hasssan. She had no off switch in Suna.

"Well Im Rias, born and raised with my close friends Z and J; I love them dearly. I was born in Konohagakure. And Hassan is my childhood idol" she noted* - Wed Nov 18 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) nods to Hassan responce as he leaves, training never leaves her mind as she gets used to the armor and manipulating her chakra as she sat there. She looked at his food and with her intellect guessed the calories and carbs and such. 

She had her elbows on the table, "Well he is a busy man... while kiri was in trouble he was organizing Suna from a bandit camp to the strongest and most profitable village in the world" she boosted his ego. * - Wed Nov 18 23:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) shake her head, "Not enough protien or carbs, I cant cheat." she said declining the food. The beauty looked determined to follow her regimne while she was there. "I need to beat someone, I need to become a Gezo private level shinobi in a month...Its my goal..." she said on a stern tone.

"But thank you for complimenting my figure cutie~" she smiled. She loved her body which was why she trained it so. "We decided to go down different paths but we will meet up eventually.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would get ok and face Hassan, her finger was still in a flick position this whole storing chakra this entire time. "I would not mind, but if your looking for a relatioship you looking at the wrong girl." he would be at Hassan plce at this time.

"I loved the time we spend together, catch you later cutie~" she said heading out the door* - Thu Nov 19 00:10:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yes - Thu Nov 19 00:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: 8 - Thu Nov 19 01:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Started the training, she would concentrate her chakra into her body. She was slowly building her chakra control but she was training it to this day soit would not take that long to acomplish.

She reordered her chakra and placed her hands together, she stopped trying to use the flick technique. She would look at his a moment in disbelief, "Wait... your just -NOW- telling be about this? I was facing a fucking jounin level shinobi and your just NOW giving me this?" she was baffled and alittle upset.

"We really need to talk about piorities later..." she said going with the training. Her assumtion of the technique was her making a clone of her self hence the name and the spliting of the chakra. She prepped herself for the technique and assumed it would me draining for her.

She concentrated her chakra in the center of her body and try to split her chakra in her body. She tried her split her chakra but it was too difficuly for her and she tired her self off. "This is a tough jutsu," she said.

She went to try it again. She would preform the one hand seal and slowly try to separate her body into two parts. She would feel the split happening but it was still to great of a split and she tired out again.

"One more time" she said as the would clasp her hands together and form the handseal. She poured alot of chakra in her split one more time and she succeded in forming the clone. An exact copy of Rias would appear to the right of her.

She looked it over... examined it. As the other Rias did the same. The busty beauties poked and prodded each other as they wanted to know about each other. Rias felt weaker as she and the clone tested various skills.

She attacked the clone with tajutsu and the clone attacked back. She tried using weapons and the clone did the same. She tried gen on the clone and it did the same, they caught each other and then they released the genjutsu on each other.

She would then sit down and talk to the clone in the sand they had a wierd conversation about nothing as they asked each other questions and answered back woth questions and never really got any answers.

She would then try to damage the clone but the clone didnt poof away. She thought it was odd. She assumed that clones usually died by minimal damage. She would be attacked by the clone also and it would start a hravy girl struggle.

The clone and rias comically fought each other. They scratched, and pulled each other hair in a manatic fashion. Rias has lost her composure for the first time... This clone was rather annoying and she wasnted to get rid of it.

She would finally get right of the clone as she some how got in the air and landed on the clone with her weight. Rias hair was in a mess and she was covered in dust from the scuffle. She looked at Hassan and blushed.

She blow red hair off her face and and patted her self off. "Well that went well" she said sarcasticly. She fought with herself today and learned alittle about herself.* - Thu Nov 19 01:47:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would get on get down on the ground. She relaxed her body as she went to the ground. The armor was hindering her but soon it felt like a second skin to her. She went down to the ground, flexing her muscles and pushed up off the ground. She was showing progression in her exersices, she shot through 15 push ups easily.

She was unknowningly getting stronger and faster physically. Her body was getting toned. Her muscles were showing more definition and her skin was tightening. She was starting to break a sweat in her exercise rush! Another rush of 15 push ups was seen from the beauty... 

Hassan was training her to be a physical monster, it was to counter her weakness to her frail body... It was only a back up but better safe then sorry. She rushed through the last 20 push ups in the a last stride session. She would get up not feeling as tired as usual and be ready for the rest of the training.* - Thu Nov 19 03:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would get up and get in a boxing stance. This type of training was new to her. She jabbed forward hitting his had and he moved it. Her eyes moved with his hands as she jabbed the hand with her opposite fist. In the next movement she throw a hook to hit his hand as soon as he moved it but she missed.

"Damn" she said and she shook her head and threw another shoot at his hand impacting it then. Hassan was training her to be a true solider and he was proud of her but she would not feel the love and admiration until she took out Kana in the end. This was her plan and she was sticking to it.* - Thu Nov 19 03:56:48 2015

<He has blood on his hands... he has to be strong...> she thought in her head. Several strategies came about as she figures out a good starting move. She moved one step forward as her armor glistened in from of him. She withdrew three shuriken from her sides and threw them at the boy. Then she preformed several hand seals shortly after.

She waited for his response...* - Thu Nov 19 04:12:09 2015

As the shuriken was rather dodged rather skillfully she gauged his strength. He was actually skilled as a fighter for fawlling over her and her beauty. <He is better that I thought... I guess I cant try a different strategy then can I.>

as the pillers impacted her she would poof and a log would replace her. Rias was actually off to the right of her original position. As she appeared she would turn to use her clan technique and attempt to control his body. All she needed was do was to get him in eyesight and it would catch him rather quickly. Her seal went up rather fast* - Thu Nov 19 04:30:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) He was caught in her jutsu. She moved his body to the right position for her plan to work. When she moved him she moved to her spot and she went up close to him.

Gathering chakra in her finger, she would flick him in the forehead sending him flying to the Suna wall. It would carter him in the wall and it would hurt. She would watch him as he was released from the jutsu and hurting* - Thu Nov 19 04:55:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm..what is that a hole in the rules? - Thu Nov 19 05:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would pour chakra into her feet and brace for impact. She didnt have the speed to dodge the in coming mud river. She very heavy from the armor and she anchored herself to the ground. She moving earth damage hurt her legs but she had to edure the damage. As she was getting hit by the mud river Rias for form several hand seals and shoot wires from her position to wrap around his hands. 

Her plan was to prevent him from forming hand seals and slowly drag him forward.* - Thu Nov 19 05:26:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) didnt need to know where he was if he was underground or not. The truth of the matter was that she was a sensor. She already know where he was... she always knew where he was. She was still feeling the pain from that mud river attack and she was barely able to move. she was always knew about her surrounds.

<Fuck.... that move again..> she thought annoyed. She was yet to find a way around it. She would make a clone of herself and throw it in the air for a turn to simulate that one she was still there. she simply waited for her faith* - Thu Nov 19 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Huh.. - Thu Nov 19 06:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) was wrist locked by the pillers as she was locked from doing anything. The shadow clone however, came falling down as he came up. 

-The clone would form several hand seals and spew a mud river from its mouth. The river would directly hit Akira hopefully as he attacked the original Rias. If successful he would be flooded out of his tunnel and damaged.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That was a pretty good match. - Thu Nov 19 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You guys are really good. - Thu Nov 19 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) sighed... she lose again... she was not going to accept the give away win. And this is the second time the opponent went underground... that really ticked her off. <Another lose, another fucking person going underground... I REALLY hate that move.> she thought. A look of iritation on her face as she was freed from the technique. She rubbed her wrist as she dispersed her clone. "No, you win... dont give me your pity..." she said ticked off. "But im glad you didnt hold back" she said casually

She would stagger across Hassan, she sensed Kuro and Nigen in the area. One had light chakra sense and one had a darker chakra she sensed. "Is was a decent battle but nothing special." she said to the red haired guy.

She slowly moved to her residence.* - Thu Nov 19 06:35:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would get pissed and turn him around grabbing him by his shoulder. She was still injured and her actions could be avoided. "What is your deal? Do you have a problem with me or something? First you like me now your disrespecting me? Give me an answer." she said alittle ticked off. Currently she was acting more like a warrior then a woman but it was the situation* - Thu Nov 19 06:47:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Looked on as he lied to her, she developed hatred... a ruthlessness that Hassan had developed over the years. She was already pissed over the argument that she had with the guy who "loved" her. She clenched her fist and  pummeled the man.

She used her bare fists to beat him down. Blood splattered everywhere in the room as he was hit with punch after punch. She never stopped attacking the defenceless man as he was spitting and coughing up blood. A left punch knocking out teeth, a right punch breaking his jaw; she beat him until he was unconscience and then beat him some more.

She slammed his head against the wall after she felt his body go limp. He suffered every bit for his crime and her hands were covered in blood. She slammed his head against the wall over and over and over again untill he looked inreconizeable. He deserved this for his crimes but it was obvious Rias was taking her pain out on him.* - Thu Nov 19 07:16:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would contiune her training and ignore his words, she didnt want to hear about that cancer... She was DONE was with this conversation. She would run out of mansion and be on route to the prison.

She would run down the path with him on her shoulders. It was a odd sight to see. The Kage seemed to always be around the girl and vise versa. It was assumed that they had a close relationship of some kind. 

She ignored the stares as she ran to the location of the prison. As the prison came up she would start to slow down. She was sweating under the Suna Sun running up the hill. "We are here sir." she said as she looked up at him. She seemes to be completely comfortable with him now* - Fri Nov 20 06:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .... - Fri Nov 20 06:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would ready herself for another killing session. Upon hearing his comment she would say, "Yea, but its more as that... I couldnt replace Rin... nor could I replace her." she said crossing her arms for the criminal  to come in* - Fri Nov 20 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: -Im gonna restart my computer real fast- - Fri Nov 20 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: U almost done? - Fri Nov 20 06:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) looked at the woman... "Team killer..." it rang in her... Normally she would attack without hesitation but she had to know her reason. She would pull out her kunai and stabbed her in the leg. "Why did you kill your team... explain." She would slowly start to injure her to make her talk. She didnt have the ability to look in her mind so far so she would drain the information from her.

"You went on a mission with your team but you let them die... You were paid by the people that killed them and you were left alive? They could have killed or raped you and saved money... explain." There could have been little to this story but she didnt take any chances.

Rias was not just a souless killer and it wasnt about the fact that she was a moman either. She was a smart thinker, she planned out strategy and thought out her actions.* - Fri Nov 20 06:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) look on with a simple response, "Ok..." she would flick her wrist and bring the kunai up swiftly and slice her neck. "I thought it was a good reason, but it wasnt... you never give up your team for such a selfish reason"

She would toss her hair back and look at Hassan, "I assume there is no need question them... " she asked. She wasnt sure he would throw her any curve balls and find a mental issue in her personality* - Fri Nov 20 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Nice and swift. - Fri Nov 20 07:04:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: What's up? - Fri Nov 20 07:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would focus on her chakra while she was at the gate. She watched the gate and sensed who all went un or out of the area so she didnt really need to focus with her eyes anyway. She concentrated and focused on the opposite flow of her chake system. She had experience with this using Genjutsu Kai so the concept was there.

She didnt have too much control over her chakra in actuallity but she had it in theory. The art of reversing your chakra flow required skill and training, it was something that she would focus on immensly as she was on guard. She thought about death during guard duty.

She slowly reversed the flow of chakra backwards and forwrad while thinking. If  Muhammed died how would she react? Surely she would be hurt about the event and mostly thought it was impossible. But if he did she would probuly be greedy. She would take his body and cremake it... make it into a weapon in his honor.

"Yea... that would be cool and honoring" she said slowly breathing in; starting to flow the chakra in her body normally. Then she slowly exhaled; reversing the flow of chakra in her system. She looked up to check if any people came up so far. She sensed them... there was noone there; she brought the chakra back normally through her system. * - Fri Nov 20 07:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) continued to sense the areaa but nothing was to be found. She would notice changes in her body. Her body was still gorgously shaped, it was shaped with a big top, a big bottom, and smaller waist. Her breast were still exposed from the top of the armor, obviously a feature Marco wanted to change. She heard Hassan call her as she would nod in approval.

She touched the top of her breast and closed her eyes. She sensed her self; she wouls slow gain control of her chakra in her system. She showed concentration in slowly changing the flow of her chakra in her body. She felt the reverse flow of her chakra after hours of meditation. It was a difficult process to follow but she would continue the training.

She slowly increased the flow speed until it would be 2 times faster then normal. She then forced a slow down between her chakra, It took a while for her to accomplish this. When she did she would revert her chakra to regular flow and slowly felt that flow in her would speed up to 2x its normal speed. The flow would slow back down eventually* - Fri Nov 20 08:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) followed his instruction. She would feel his chakra and sense the motion of it as it flowed. His hands on her was would set in motion a flurry of events she witnessed. She had no idea that was going on but the nature of his chakra flow. It was noted and he stopped, she would start next.

She would then slowly reverse her chakra as he did. The process would take longer but eventually she achieved it. She would continue to focus in the chakra, trying to keep the flow reversed and increase the speed of the reverse.

She slowly tried to increase the flow of her chakra to the levels of his... the area around them would be affected but not to the affect that he displayed. As her wrists continued to be held she looked out in the sky. Normally it would throw her in a tizzy to be handled by him but she was being relazed. She was calm and friendly instead of treating him like a god.

She slow poured chaka from her reserves into her active chakra system and forced the reverse of chakra flow... the area activity would slowly form into a more chaotic reaction from her flow and wait for his reaction to her training.* - Fri Nov 20 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Good. - Fri Nov 20 09:43:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Lets go back home and coplete part 2 wit some dinner. - Fri Nov 20 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would be not as tired as she usually was from training. She would settle down her chakra and relax herself. She would said down and wait for what to do next.* - Fri Nov 20 10:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would take her plate and begain to eat while he explained. As he explained teh method she paused, "M-my lord. That is highly irresponsible on you to allow me to preform such an action" she said blushing a little. "Is this requred, can I not use my hands for the same training?" she asked stopping from eating her food* - Fri Nov 20 10:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Just don't think of it as a kiss - Fri Nov 20 10:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Think of it as training... - Fri Nov 20 10:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) //
"..." Rias didnt really have a answer... she hesitated. She didnt know what to do. Not about the milk... not about the measurements... not about anthing. She though he was a pervert. But she would slowly approach him and pucker her soft lips. She wasnt sure how this was going but she would watch for any funny business.

She planted a kiss on him and tried her best to follow his instruction. She revered the flow of chakra from her body while she held the kiss. She wondered what the man had in mind as she preformed her actions* - Fri Nov 20 11:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Now did you feel those effects, or at least sense them? - Fri Nov 20 11:05:36 2015
