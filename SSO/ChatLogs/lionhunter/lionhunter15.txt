<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would just sit there and focus on her chakra flow. She would refrain from kissing Hassan as Iza was here and it would raise some questions and start some rumors. She would practice control of her chakra more as she sat there in slience. 

She would open her eyes and yawn." Well I cant do this anymore... Im going to bed" she said getting up and shuffling to her room* - Sun Nov 22 07:57:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You gotta be more impatient. - Sun Nov 22 07:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: What? - Sun Nov 22 07:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You know you can split your expirience among shadow clones right? - Sun Nov 22 07:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: What? - Sun Nov 22 07:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Create 2 shadow clones and practice it all at once, trust me. - Sun Nov 22 07:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: ... fine... one more time - Sun Nov 22 08:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Dont forget to create the shadow clones. - Sun Nov 22 08:02:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: -omit- - Sun Nov 22 08:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would plop back down and concentrate on her chakra. She preformed the shadow clone technique and summoned 2 clones by her sides. The clones would look at her for direction; she told them about Hassans training and asked them to help with it.

Rias  would stay in her meditative state and focus on her control of her chakra flow as it was slowing down in her system to start a reverse flow. She had practiced it so long that it was slightly easier for her to just reverse her chakra flow when not in combat.She wondered how the clones would help her progress.

Clone one- She would immitate the real Rias and get in a comfortable stance and relax. She was told to reverse the chakra flow in her ysystem also. The clone was a split version so it was capable of doing what she was doing.She sloly began to reverse the flow of its chakra system and look at Rias for the next step.

Clone 2- As the second clone heardthe explination it would first feel the natural flow of chakra building up in its main reserve. The point was to restore chakra? Honestly they didn have any Idea what move she would have been talking about but it its about a strong move the she could see it it rquired so much.* - Sun Nov 22 08:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Alright seal the deal. - Sun Nov 22 08:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: And then dispell them. - Sun Nov 22 08:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: you'll see what I mean. - Sun Nov 22 08:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) All of the clones and Rias would regulate theirchakra back to its original state and regulate their chakra flow back. When she did that she would dispell the clones and restore her chakra back, but something else happened. All the knowledge from the clones flowed back to her. Rias was a bit taken back.

"W-what?I know so much experience with this training. So this shandow clones are for more then just fighting. They can bu used for learning too? Thats   interesting". she said with a curious expression on her face.* - Sun Nov 22 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Yeah. - Sun Nov 22 08:22:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: So now you understand the gist of the technique. - Sun Nov 22 08:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: But don't use this technique in the open. - Sun Nov 22 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Or even in private fights, only use it when i'm there to watch and allow it. - Sun Nov 22 08:24:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) was caught in a diving hug... He might have hurt himself divaing at her fully armored self. She didnt have the reflexs to catch him but she tried but holding out her arms. She was unfazed by the tackle as her weight of the armor balanced her. "I told you, call me  Rias, Hiro-kun" she said smiling.

She brightly smiled at everyone in the area.* - Mon Nov 23 01:19:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) patted him on the head softly, "Ok ok you can call me Ri-Senpai~" she could not resist that face. She was about to say hi to her best friend but she just left. She heard a spar and she was interested in the fight. "Come on Hiro-kun lets watch I have time to relax before Hassan gets up" she smiled* - Mon Nov 23 01:25:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: Thats different - Mon Nov 23 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would look on and focus her sensing on the girl. She was special in some way and was a unknown to Rias... Only Chikyu knew Rias reaction from the display of something new.. 

Rias drools alittle, "N-New..... data...." she said slowly licking her lips. She would focus entirely of the new girl...* - Mon Nov 23 01:35:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would nod and get in a fighting stance. She would run as fast as she could and try to punch Paine in the stomach. But to Paine it was like she was in slow motion. She trained her body and exercised all month, but she was no where near pains level or taijutsu skill.* - Mon Nov 23 02:55:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Was pushed in her armor and forced back. 

"Right..." she said balancing herself and heading back to attack. Rias didnt care about the form of training as long as it worked. She would run towards her again aiming to punch her again. Her punch was again slow in speed and didnt look like it would hurt much. She put all her might in every attack* - Mon Nov 23 03:16:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would straighten up and out, her curvy hourglass figure hugging the armor tightly. She would take a deep breath, one in and one out. She extended her fist out as far as it could go an a thrust. There was no wind coming from the punch that was thrown.

She would say in her head, <Feel the wind? I dont think Im strong enough to even produce wind...> she thought to her self still punching at the beauty.

She would pull one fist back and shoot one forward. One by one she would throw straight jab after straight jab in Paines direction. Hopefully with the fists coming back to back she would form some kind of wind that she would feel* - Mon Nov 23 03:42:17 2015

Her legs was adjusted, her thighs,her shoulders and torso. It was hard to keep the position as she was not used to it at all but she tried her best

She would then stop punching and .listn to what Paine had to day. She made fists with both hands and asked, "What is this position called?" she wondered as she stayed in it and punched the air switching her fists with each punch.

She was starting to sweat as she continuous punching was tedious exercise. She was lightly panting as she punching constantly. Her fists were starting to show fatigue. She was very tired at this point the stamina was not in her ability* - Mon Nov 23 04:13:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Rias locked on to their chakra sigatures, She was fighting two on one so she had to think strategically. She asseted their skills, Akira used weapons but he was also adept in earth jutsu; while Chikyu was purely taijutsu and kenjutsu. She formulated a plan in her head.

<Ok, first I have to stop Chikyu> she thought forming a handseal in the cloud of dust. In the cover of the sand cloud, Rias sent a jolt of chakra into the charging girl hopefully taking over as soon as she got in a inavoidable distance. The body of Rias passed out in the process.* - Mon Nov 23 18:28:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) As Rias entered her body she would talk to Chikya in her mind, "Sorry about this Chikyu... I wont hurt you two... I just have to win this fight..." she said. Chikyu would rush toward Akira and push him far enough out of the battle and out Chikyu away from Rias.

As she would push him back, Chikyu punched Akira in the gut hard enough to knock him out. Her plan was to avoid any damage to Akira or at least minialize it. She made sure to avoid his broken arm .* - Mon Nov 23 18:57:04 2015

Rias still kept an eye on both combatets the whole time* - Mon Nov 23 19:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) thinks: Is that the direction you're in Rias? - Mon Nov 23 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would form several shadow clones, 2 exactly, and they would ready another technique while Rias continued to bombuard her with a constant mud river... how ever Rias's mud river for signifigintly weaker at the time also* - Mon Nov 23 19:43:08 2015

Rias thought of another plan of action as Chikyu was getting ready to get close again. "If she closes in I might have to use... that" she thought in her head.  ut she would try to avoid that situation. Rias moved closer to reveal her location... or rather her clones location... and formed several hand seals for Chikyu to see.

"Are you still trying to fight? This is why I love you Chikyu... your really amazing" she said. The clone Rias would move forward and the other clone would be beside the real Rias* - Mon Nov 23 20:18:59 2015

The clone would take the shuriken in its arm and continue to walk forward. The clone bled a little but was still active. Rias and the other clone would continue to move behind it...

One of her plans were tossed out the window, while the other one was still waiting to be played. "Well I need a way around that one," she stated thinking of a plan. They slowly walked in a line to move toward Chikyu... Three bunched up chakra orbs are headed toward Chikyu* - Mon Nov 23 20:42:52 2015

Rias would stay a safe distance away while sensing for Chikyu. Her other clone revolved around for protection* - Mon Nov 23 20:56:32 2015
