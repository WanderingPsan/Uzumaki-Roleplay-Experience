She spun around ans asked the men, "So what do you two think?" she asked.

Her training for the armor was finished, but becasue of the log checks being on thursday she didnt have the rpp to buy it. So she would be very sluggish in the armor.* - Wed Nov 18 06:23:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would get on the ground like usual but this time the was sporting the new heavy armor she had on. It was weighing her down immensly. This was way tougher than her previous trainings. The armor provided a different beast then she was used to. She stuggled with even 10 push ups, but she completed it the first ten and she was already showing signs of fatigue.

She want pushing 20 then; pushing her body while her armor was pulling her down. She struggled as she was fighting the armor and herself at once and they were winning. Pushing 25 she started to sweat hard  and her breathing became shallow. It was clear that the armor was a little much for her.

She would push herself harder using nothing but will power at that point ans push out 15 more. She was soo close to her goal she could taste it. She finally finished all 50 but her arms gav out on her. She struggled immensely on the last 5. Those were the toughest. She would pant endlessly as she could not move at all* - Wed Nov 18 07:35:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would feel the hope he had. Hassans honey potting skills were god like they were the power she needed to get up and finish the training. "Ok but you owe me big when I win..." she said with grit. She would get up and place her jello hands on her knees. She would squat down and get up slowly in a slow moving pace. She keep this motion as it eased the weight on her, she has felt slow burning in her thighs as she worked out for the second time today.

She would then look at Marrisa as she came in, she was wearing new armor and working out. The armor is metallic and shiny with a dark blue tint. She kinda felt that she had power akin to Hassan's as his sectetary but it was a pipe dream. She was just the one who did all the paper work. "Muhammed, I assume Paine is done with that paperwork. I need to find her when I finish." She said blasting through the workout with her legs way easier than her arms. 10, 20, 30, 40, 50; She skated her through the work out and looked on as she legs were burning but she could handle that much.* - Wed Nov 18 08:23:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would feel the power from the wind attack, could not move from her spot just yet! She thought about her options. She would form a strategy as the wind rushed at her."I really didnt expect to be thrown in a fight so soon and with her no less!" she thought.

As a defence from the wind she would stand firm and form chakra to her feet so she would not be lifted from the ground. She was also -very- heavy so that help her from flying away. She trugged forward and cross her arms taking mid to deep cuts on the exposed parts of her body which was burned already. 

She was a solider and she had a burning will of fire that could not be put out.* - Wed Nov 18 08:43:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) As she recieved moderate damage from her technique and her armor was totaled on one fight maybe? It would have to be repaired after the fight probuly.  Rais sustained cuts all over her body as she Marrisa sunk under ground. She always knew where Marrisa was it was only a matter of time before she same came to the surface. She locked her sensing on Marrisa and formed several in a sitting and held the last one in place 

"I really hope I can outthink my battles... and get faster..." she thought as she didnt move this time. 

Rias was tired from the armor; from the training; from the ONE attack... but she had to impress Hassan and Marrica.* - Wed Nov 18 08:55:53 2015

As she was impacted by the earth spikes she poofed from the trap. She looking like she was trapped but she actually used the Kawarmi jutsu as a quick exit. She appeared two tiles away from her recent position.

The she went on the offencive, she formed a wierd rectangle hand seal that was unknown to Paine, Kiyoko, and Hassan; then one of Massia's earth clones would turn around and repeat his process of forming hand seals for earth spear and 4 bunted spears would be aimed to capture the underground Marrisa.
