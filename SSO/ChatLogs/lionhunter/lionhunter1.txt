<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) formed her hand specific technique which was a circle with her fingers hanging out the other. From there she would send her consciousness out from her body and in a straight path to the scarecrow. From the outside it would seem like Rias just passed out on the ground. Her mind wandered in the empty area until slowly  it went back to her body. She would slowly get up and think to herself, <I really need to make sure to hit my target... I hope J can guard me.>

She would get up and dust herself off and tool around. "One more time," she said getting in her stance. She would target the object with her eyes and as she is about form the last hand seal she passes out... She didnt have enough chakra to use the jutsu... after a few minutes she slowly woke up and looked around. I guess I will deal with this training later... "Night Z! We are training extra hard tomorrow!" she said with her friendly personality* - Tue Nov  3 10:23:21 2015

She picked up various colors of reds and mostly got roses. The others were a assortment of red colored flowers that she finally gathered.

She sorted them in the shape of his liking, "Circle formation... with the roses on the outer rim and the assorted flowers in the center for substance, perfect.~" she said cutting the stems off and wrapping them up.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yea - Thu Nov  5 06:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would go back to her training. She formed her hand seal and again her body went limb from an unknown cause. After a few mins she would appear alive again and study on her move... "I really need to speed up this time." she said as she would start to practice the other moves to. She had to master all the moves she had if she wanted to ge a great support for her teammates. 

She would practice her second move at this time. She pulled to shuriken from her pouch and throw them at the wall. Her goal was to match the speed of the top and the bottem shuriken. When she first tried it she didnt get the speeds right at all. they were sloppy and you could clearly see the trick it was difficult for her to get the timing right.

Then she would practice the genjutsu dispel. She would periodically stop the flowing chakra in her system and make it flow again. It was like a exercise, to make her practice how to break out of genjutsu. It would take a short amount of time for her to masterthese moves but only time will tell* - Thu Nov  5 07:45:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would wave "HI` Are you the person I have been hearing about from Z? Im Rias!" she said with a giggly and excited tone. Rias was 5'10'', tall for a girl.  She had the body of a voluptuous model. She skin was soft and she had a boiunce in her step. It could be known that she was not a tai fighter in the least. She had large breasts and a large ass that matched her shaply body... this was a note that couldnt not be bypassed.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would go ahead with her style of attack and start her move. She was still not a master at this move but hopfully it would work.She would form a clan specific hand seal... something that Marrisa wouldhave never seen before. Her hands cupped into a circle as she stared Marrisa down. But then something stranged happened... Rias just collapsed! What was wrong with her? Was she ok? It looked like she didnt have enough chakra to use her jutsu and over exterted herself. 

Her body collaped on the ground as it could not be supported by her legs.* - Thu Nov  5 10:31:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) //As Marrisa avoided it her body remained unconscience as the jolt of chakra slowly came back to Rias... but for the mean time her lifeless body would remain in its place. The jolt of chakra would slowly come from behind and aim to get back to Rias. But between the chakra and Rias was the chakra blob. 

The blob turned around to hit Marrisa again since it was in front of Rias. Marrisa was being distracted by Ziare so she coudnt not see what was behind her. She didnt have the 360 vision nor did she know the ability of the move so with all those factors maybe it hit before it came back?* - Thu Nov  5 10:58:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Many factors are taken into consideration. Mind Transfer is best affective when used on a binded/stationary person. It is more of a conscious thing I suppose. There won't be any rebound where someone gets hit unless the person steps in front of the initial path. As far as it being controllable, you can't arch it after ur activated the jutsu, but when aiming TO launch it, you can add that 'arch' or 'slant'. -) - Thu Nov  5 11:11:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) // the mind would hit Ziare I guess. If she was controlling Ziare she would put his body to good use... While she was in his body she knew him long enough to know how to use his jutsu. She would use the shadow possesion move to trap Marrisa under ground and immobile. using the one hand seal. After she did that she would travel back to her own body and stand up. <Man thats a pain in the ass, how did she dodge... can her red eyes see me or something?> she though as she would regain her sense of self. She didnt have anyplan of attack at the moment so she readied for another attack.* - Thu Nov  5 11:46:08 2015

She would stand next to Z and say, "I give! Your so strong, teach me please~" she had no desire to keep fighing... she revealed her hand to much anyway.* - Thu Nov  5 12:07:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would yawn as her body would shake and jiggle about. Ortho had not seen her description of herself so she had to explain.  She had medium length hair to her shoulders that was a bright red. She was sporting a voluptuous body. She had huge soft breast and a huge soft ass that matched her shapely figure. Her body and features jiggled usually when she walked. <picture Rias as a young ashley but way smarter >

She would hug Z, "Im sleepy... Im going home. Night guys~" she said walking off* - Thu Nov  5 12:22:49 2015
