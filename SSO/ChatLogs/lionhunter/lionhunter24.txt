With this link she would send her images of the baby and then close the link. Rias then wrapped her arms around Paine's wait to see her reaction. "Isnt he adorable~" she smiled.

She then turned to Eiyu... "Yes Im truly sorry for that but I couldnt let you actions stand. I cant let you stand against Suna nor can I let Konoha stand with you. You put me in quite a situation..." she said rubbing her neck. "Konoha is no threat to you and will not fight you and I hope you do the same. I love my villagers and I want the safe.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would walk past nigen placing a hand on his shoulder and then running off of it as she moved to head inside of the mansion... "Osuda... your the only person I can trust at the moment..." she said trailing off and heading inside to relax in her chair* - Thu Dec 10 09:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Thu Dec 10 09:29:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yuriko dear your back, good - Thu Dec 10 10:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would look at her with sincere eyes, "I treat all of you in my village as mt family...I love you all and I would never ty to hurt you... I will try my best to helpyou the best way I can" she would say smiling and asking "Are you ready?"* - Thu Dec 10 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: What will I owe you if you do this for me? - Thu Dec 10 10:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Your hand... in friendship~ Maybe like a daughter I never had~ - Thu Dec 10 10:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Uh... I don't really know how to be a daughter... but I can try to be a friend. - Thu Dec 10 10:18:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Come come, sit next to me - Thu Dec 10 10:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would form her hand seals and hold her hands to establish a strong telepathic link with Yuriko. She would peer deep in her  mind ans search for anything involving the past 4 years of Yuriko. If she wasnt a human then what was she? Did she have a creater? Was she born from Gezo blood? Was she a demon? All these questions would be answered soon.

<Oh here we go... Think hard about your very first memories... I will go through them as fasr as I can> she told her in her mind.* - Thu Dec 10 10:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would try to search through her mind, if she had one, but it was nothing... She began to search even harder for any sort of clue to her past but it was hard for her... <This is harder than I thought... Maybe I will need to make another jutsu... Maybe that will work> she thought on her second attempt.* - Thu Dec 10 10:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) though in Yuriko's head... <Ok this is strange... If this is your mind im seeing then why can i -see- anything... Its like nothing you experience is recorded.. but if that is the case then why can you remember anything. As you a machine... can you experience any of the 5 senses?> she was preplexed by this mystery... 

Rias would drool alittle un knowingly as her thirst for knowledge wasstarting to show. She was starting to get a strain on her brain as she cut the link. "This just makes me more curious about you, I wander can you sense anything?"she said extremely interested* - Thu Dec 10 10:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: Hmm? - Thu Dec 10 16:17:04 2015

If so, we like a count of those in your number that like to join the Chuunin exams. So, we have an accurate number of people to predict for. - Thu Dec 10 16:21:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(LionHunter) giggled, Paines nature never surpised her. It was alsys that shy caring aura that she loved. She would whisper in Paine's ear, "If you ever come back there is a massage with your name on it, I will make sure its very relaxing~" she would smile and look at Chikyu * - Thu Dec 10 16:57:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(LionHunter) was kissed and and she touched the spot on her cheek, she blushed lightly and preformed a sigh that signifled longing. "See you later sweetie... Later Chikyu... and ummm white eyed girl... I actually want to know something..." she paused for a moment* - Thu Dec 10 17:18:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: What is your name? - Thu Dec 10 17:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Mirai. - Thu Dec 10 17:21:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) thinks: Come to think of it I did pluck a boys eyes out that looked like theirs to but thats not worth noting - Thu Dec 10 17:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: Well then it might have been a family member of yours - Thu Dec 10 17:23:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: Well I will send her to you if I see her again. It was just that piece of information... but she is extremely shy so becareful with her - Thu Dec 10 17:26:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: Yes... I was in a bad way when I did  that whats done is done. And she was kicked out of Suna too? Who... I guess thinks change... - Thu Dec 10 17:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: Well I just wanted to tell you about her - Thu Dec 10 17:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Is that it? - Thu Dec 10 17:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: Yep - Thu Dec 10 17:33:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: Same~ - Thu Dec 10 17:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(LionHunter) wanted to get more kill from her genjutsu... she summoned several shadow clones from her person and would get all of them to spread out. Rias would motion all of them to look at her at once. She then formed several hand seals and would pour alot of her chakra in the general area. Her goal was to make a single target genjutsu caught a large number of targets. It was a difficult process but would be very useful in the long run. Rias was a skilled genjutsu user so she assumed that of she mastered some of the skills of her clan as well as the aspect of genjutsu she would be a extremely powerful shinobi.

Her first barrier would be to figure out a way to spread the influence of genjutsu. She had to look back on the different ways that genjutsu was effective. Genjutsu used advanced intellegence and chakra control to manipulate the 5 senses of an opponent to freeze them in place and catch them off guard. A person with the highest awareness of the situation would have the best advantage in using genjutsu. Rias would note the strengths and weaknesses of her skills before she would preform the actions.

She noticed a familiar large chakra signature in the area and all 3 of the clones and Rias would wave at Lera. "We are so glad you could make it~" she said in unison.* - Thu Dec 10 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hey there Rias. - Thu Dec 10 20:20:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: Fantastic - Thu Dec 10 20:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: You wanted to learn Raiton right? Any others? - Thu Dec 10 20:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: So I assume you know quite a varity - Thu Dec 10 20:25:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Not quite - Thu Dec 10 20:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Its nearly there. - Thu Dec 10 20:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: Raiton and doton - Thu Dec 10 20:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alrighty then. - Thu Dec 10 20:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Doton happens to be my favourite element. - Thu Dec 10 20:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: But which one first? - Thu Dec 10 20:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: Oh really? - Thu Dec 10 20:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Yeah - Thu Dec 10 20:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: Did you ever find a counter for going underground? - Thu Dec 10 20:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Well. After the light of course. - Thu Dec 10 20:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Raiton. - Thu Dec 10 20:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Theres also a Doton jutsu - Thu Dec 10 20:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: That can counter that ability. - Thu Dec 10 20:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: I need it... - Thu Dec 10 20:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Why not both? - Thu Dec 10 20:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Have you ever accessed your elements? - Thu Dec 10 20:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: Well if your willing to teach both I will call you sensei~ - Thu Dec 10 20:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: Not really... I been focused on my genjutsu - Thu Dec 10 20:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright then. - Thu Dec 10 20:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: We'll start with Raiton then, since that hurts the most. - Thu Dec 10 20:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would take her hand and smile* - Thu Dec 10 20:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Tch. Trill never does stuff like this. - Thu Dec 10 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would watch the display of control and power. It was truly a mind orgasming experience for her. She always liked and was facinated by Lera and her power. She would focus partuicularly on the doton and Raiton. She knew of these elements and the advantages.

Water > Fire > wind > lighting > earth... Lightning would be the best for mer to be more proficient in as it was hardly ever used but earth was a good support. She would say, "Yes r-" she was stopped as she heard her words and would feel the lightning corsing through her frail body. Thankfully it was just a light jot or she would be fried... 

She jumped on her top toes and her hair stood up alittle as she jolt came and left. He let off a brief moan of pain as she dropped to the ground. But her will was strong. She would get up and slowly staggering and look up to Lera showly as she was taller then her and looking down... "O-ok... i.. I see t-the power...t-the use-fulness" she said staggering* - Thu Dec 10 21:02:04 2015

She would close her eyes an concentrate her chakra in her body. Being a sensor she would slowly transform her chakra from the natural base chakra to the lightining element. she couldnt from form it right away but she would slwoly maifest the chakra she had to lightning chakra yet again.

After a few attempts she finally got the hand of manifestung lighting chakra. She just needed to morph that chakra into a tangable substance. She would slowly charge large amounts in her surrounding area and manifest her lightning chakra. Little sparks becan to form around her person as she used her massive reserves to for out the elemtal nature of lighting. 

After a few adjustments she would would finally see a outing of lighting flow in the genral 1x1 area around her... "Who knew elements took the same amount of control as genjutsu... Good think im a master at it~"  she noted at her progress* - Thu Dec 10 22:00:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would begin the lesson. "Genjutsu is all about control and intellect. It falls under the catagory of yin release. It is not tangable like ninjutsu so it is not oftenly used but it was useful becasue not many can counter it if you are skilled enough." But you cant just learn genjutsu like that becasue of its illusionary ways... I have to show you.

"Watch my eyes" she said weaving hand seals. Then a big shadow would slowly desend into Akechi. The giant ball of fire would slowly create a bigger and bigger shadow. She would feel the great heat coming off of it and would sweat porfusly* - Thu Dec 10 22:50:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) "Do you feel the heat coming off the genjutsu. Im skill enough to mage it feel real but it is just an illisuion. Grandmasters can make you confuse reality with illusion. But this is the technique...I will teach you ." she said releasing the genjutsu.

"To learn genjutsu you have to learn to make your dreams a reality. Put chakra unto your hand seals and try to change the landscape around your opponent." she said. "It requires a great deal of control to use genjutsu"* - Thu Dec 10 23:42:30 2015
