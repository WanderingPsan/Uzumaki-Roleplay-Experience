<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(LionHunter) //
"Oh... thats one thing we differ at. My body is not adapted for taijutsu at all. This is why I have armor" she said tapping on the armor. She stats after taking a long sip of her tea.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(LionHunter) Thought about this for a second... 4 years old but looks like a model... she is born -NEAR- the gezo empire but not on it... she is very articulated and smart for a 4 year old.... 

<Then again a 8 year old phlisopher was in my office a year ago...>

Could she be connected to the Gezo in anyway? I will not jump to conclusions but she will be noted.

"Ok... then what are you sweetie? You can trust me... I would never lie to you, hurt you or cause you pain. Im here to help and nurture"she said smiling* - Wed Dec  9 09:56:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) thinks: I assume she has a brain... - Wed Dec  9 10:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(LionHunter) as she stepped back and out of Rias grasps she would think back th that other shy girl. <I cant make that mistake again...> she thought.

With one out stretched hand Rias would smile at her with her eyes closed and her head tilted to the side slightly. "It will be ok... dont be afraid..."

<Good thing Im controlling myself alot more, other wise my thirst for knowledge might come out. *Drools in her mind*> she thought* - Wed Dec  9 10:16:32 2015
