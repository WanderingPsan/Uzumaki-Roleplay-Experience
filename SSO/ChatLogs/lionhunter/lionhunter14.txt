<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Big pappy) says: They can't do much underground other than surprise you. IF you use the technique yourself, the element of surprise is defeated and therefore the technique isn't all that useful. - Sat Nov 21 05:22:59 2015

Only he cooks for me so I cant eat anything else. But I will take a green tee please" she waitress jotted it down and looked at Paine. 

"And what will you be ordering miss?" she asked politely.

Rias would interrupt for a moment to explain, "A date is when go out or have fun with a person you like.~  You have never had a boyfriend before?" she wondered. "Dating can be a fun time or a bad time depending on who you are dating." she finished as the waiter waited for an answer.* - Sat Nov 21 06:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would get her green tea. It was in a handleless cup with rigdes in it. She would blow in the top of the cup as the tea was steaming. She wouls slowly take a long sip of it and then but it down. She listened to her words as she spoke, "Well who was he... was he cute?" she wondered curiously as Paine asked about her.

Her face grew blank, "There was this one guy... he really liked me but... I dont want to talk about it" she looked angry and irritated about the topic. 
"I was born in konohagakure, along side my best friends Z and J... eventually I came here for training."

She would take another sip of her tea, still hot and steamy, she placed it back down. "Eventually I want children also to follow in my family tradition, but I havent found the right one. " she looked at the girl with her ruby colored eyes.

Her eyes contrasted her blue hue of her armor. It was full body armor that wasnt as clankly as you would think. It was thick and heavy by sight.She moved easily in it. Her breasts were covered but showed a good amount of cleavage. Probuably due to the design of the maker. It hugged her curves and have her look knightly.

Her hair cascaded over her armor to her back in a ponytail. She was absolutly stunning to look at. "What was his name?" she wondered* - Sat Nov 21 07:37:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: You soo cute, Im glade we are friends~ - Sun Nov 22 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would smile and tile her head. This was her first time she had seen Paine smile without it being a nervous one. Rias was into men and never even though about getting with another woman. Hell she didnt even think of women as attractive sexually, but pretty was pretty.

She would reach beyond Paine and feel her hair she twisted it around her finger, "You know your really beautiful Paine... you could get any guy you wanted if you tried~" she noted as a complient.* - Sun Nov 22 04:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would wave her off. "Non sense, If I were into girls I would totally go after you cutie~" she said with confidence in her beauty. She would lean close and kiss her on the cheek if allowed. 

SHhe then pulled back and smiled turning to look at Hassan. "Hiya~" she said feeling good* - Sun Nov 22 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: It's time.. - Sun Nov 22 05:14:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) thinks: He sounds so omnious. - Sun Nov 22 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Time? Alrightly? - Sun Nov 22 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: u-umm...i t-think your n-needed - Sun Nov 22 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Well duty calls~ - Sun Nov 22 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: By Paine~ - Sun Nov 22 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: g-good...luck - Sun Nov 22 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: bye* - Sun Nov 22 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) turns to trot off in a extremely slow run* - Sun Nov 22 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You got 2 clients today. - Sun Nov 22 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Bring them in... - Sun Nov 22 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: People are starting to view you as a judgement goddess in a way. - Sun Nov 22 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Well Its wierd since I kill everyone but I see not problems with  that title - Sun Nov 22 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would look at him and pull out a Kunai, "What have you done for your crimes?" she wondered. She knew she had to kill him but She wanted to at least know the reason why he was being killed. They were sack of shit human beings but they deserved that much. 

* - Sun Nov 22 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Brought up the kunai to his neck. "Thats all I needed to hear.." She said with a gentle voice. She could almost see the crime in her head. She man was heartless, he sounded like a psychopath. He was married to a woman but had no problems killing her.

He was just a man out for saving his own ass. That was not the way to me as a human being. His actions were sufficiet for being served the death penalty. She stabbed him in the back of the neck, severing his brain from his spine. 

She would then wipe the blood from her killing kunai and looked at Hassan. "Bring the next one " she said wandering what the next killer did. She wanted to hear all their stories... It was interesting reason to kill a person.* - Sun Nov 22 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Looked as he came in, she was attractive so she wondered why noone thought of her as "eye candy" besides rapist. <The armor> she though;  the armor she was was covered in blood and armor so I guess It was a given.

She would look at the man and speak up, "Hey killer, what did you do? I dont have all day." she said twirling the kunai in her hand. She was interested in the story. She could also be called Killing Mother Taresa... As always wanted to hear their motives* - Sun Nov 22 06:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would bitch slap him with her left hand and slammed her kunai in his left eye, "Just for that Im making you my bitch for the next 30 minutes" she said to put him in his place. She would close the door and begin the torture.

The door was closes and sounds of male screaming was heard from the room. She begged her stop and even calling her -sama and -senpai via her demand. She didnt like the disrespect and she demanded respect from them or they would suffer from it.

After 30 minutes the room was dead slient. She would open the door and wash her hands... She wa covered in blood with a casual face on her. "Dont you love it when you get the respect you deserve?" She said wipping her hands.* - Sun Nov 22 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: ...My my, arent you the expirienced killer. - Sun Nov 22 06:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I have had  bunch of experience - Sun Nov 22 06:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Want to go train back at the house, or somewhere else? - Sun Nov 22 06:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Are we training that technique? - Sun Nov 22 06:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Mhm. - Sun Nov 22 06:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Well If you always train it like the way you showed me then we should go home - Sun Nov 22 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Right. - Sun Nov 22 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Let's go. - Sun Nov 22 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Well, you know what to do. - Sun Nov 22 06:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Reverse the chakra flow. - Sun Nov 22 06:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: And I still have to kiss you? - Sun Nov 22 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Until you get it. - Sun Nov 22 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Ok - Sun Nov 22 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: -omit- - Sun Nov 22 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: -omit- - Sun Nov 22 07:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: I know you're in there...I can sense you... - Sun Nov 22 07:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would sit next to Hassan, she would slowly concentrate on her chakra flow. She would take slow deep breaths and stop the flow of her chakra. When the flow stopped she would flow the chakra backwards. The process slowly started and she would turn to Hassan. She didnt like kissing him as she deemed it disrespect to the kate Rin but she would not argue.

She kissed him on the cheek as the the reverse chakra flow took place. She grew tired of the control needed to use the supposed technique. She would relax and go back to her meditative position. She recollected herself and focused on her chakra for a moment.

She then went back to refersing the flow of chakra and pulling herself up to Hassan. She wondered what he felt by her kising him over and over again. She would constantly feel the reverse flow in her chakra system. When he kissed him she felt a revitilizing force when she kissed him.

She had no idea why she was feeling this when she kissed him. So many reasons came to mind. Was he that powerful, was that the purpose of the technique, or was it a result of her training? All she knew was that there was more to come.* - Sun Nov 22 07:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: I wonder who is at the door - Sun Nov 22 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: What's up? - Sun Nov 22 07:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Is this about a promotion? - Sun Nov 22 07:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Deez nuts. - Sun Nov 22 07:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Because the exams were cancelled? - Sun Nov 22 07:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: -omit- - Sun Nov 22 07:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Er, it is about the exams..but i'd much rather test myself for a promotion. - Sun Nov 22 07:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Why were they canceled, i was looking forward to them. - Sun Nov 22 07:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I'll consider it since I need 2 new jounin and a new chuunin. - Sun Nov 22 07:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I'd appreciate the jounin position, since I do need to reach jounin to become a private, right? - Sun Nov 22 07:36:32 2015
