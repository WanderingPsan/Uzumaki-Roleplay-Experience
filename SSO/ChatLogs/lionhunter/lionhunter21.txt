She would slam her hand in the desk for a moment revealing a bluish glow under her cloak. "Ok first of all... Is is the offical first rule in Konohagakure during my rule... No disrespect toward -anyone- in this village. That means no calling people out of their name, no back talk, no fighting without it being a organized spar, and no attacking or touching without permission from the other person."

She would glare at Yoshima because of his disrespectful nicknames. "Secondly... what every they say their names are, thats who they are until I say other wise... Hana is Hana and Claudette is Claudette. If they were called something in the past thats the past. If they are lying to be then it is my problem to deal with and mine alone..." she continued.

Her voice was very feminine and lower in tone as she spoke akin to Tsunade at this point, "Thirdly, The past is the past let it go... Zetsumo is dead and he is not apart of this village anymore. I am in charge and this is my village to mould, anything in the past is irrevelent now. And there will be -NO- fighting in my office. I will punsh everyone who starts a quarrel."

She would then assess the current situation directly. "Yoshima I care for you as one of my own children and I will disipline you if I have to to prove a point. And dont care about the past 5 years... I care about the present now and you need to apologize to them for your rudeness now. As for Hanae, he also needs to apologize for ruffing you up against that wall." she said standing up. she was cloaked in her Hokage robe and she took off the hat revealing her long red hair. "I will wait for your compliance..." she crossed her arms over her large chest.* - Fri Dec  4 20:13:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would explain the technique. "Well here is how the jutsu was mastered, instead of projecting your conscience into the target you use less of your mind and you only transmit your thought and feelings toward them. Since you have trained for it already it should be easy for you to grasp the concept. You know all of our techniques are all about brain power." she said forming one hand seal and the brain went into over drive and the thought and process was transfered to Hanae. 

"I have sent you my training and mastery of the technique... but be careful... but a extreme amount of pressure on the brain so using it for too long will kill you. Know your limits..." she said as she would "mind link" her all the knowledge that she knew and learned. All of the mental images, emotions, and traind she did with the move.* - Fri Dec  4 22:15:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would allow such actions... She was wearing her armor under her robes so Hanae would feel a hard plating. It was warm to the touch and as hard as diamond. Her hair was put in a messy bun and the strands were all over the place. "But my hair will grow longer... I dont want to cut it." she said as the woman fitted her.

It was no lie that Rias loved her body, it was her favorite feature. It was toned but an hourglass shape. She sported d cup breasts that were up and perky and a big ass to match. Her body was up and out for all to see, even her armor was form fitting as her armour hugged her body. The robes were the only thing that could have been alittle tighter and she agreeded.

Rias stood 5'10'' and looked at the man, She would chop his head as she had a feeling he was doing more than "measuring her". "I appreciate your sentiment but you are crossing boundries... Watch yourself" she said looking over at the door.* - Fri Dec  4 23:28:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) //
"Your right... one moment..." she said taking off the body armor and placing in on the stand by the bed. She also took off her Hokage robes and placed the im in their respective stand. This revealed the type body of Rias, her body dropped and started to move freely as they were pressed against the hard armor. 

Her D-cup breasts jiggled in movement as she never really wore a bra. the kept them up by bandaging them and keeping them in place. her ass would be out and rounded perfectly and soft. Her shape was a perfect hourglass; a small but not too small waist, thick thighs, and long legs.

She was removed her bandges and let her bouncing breasts fall. she was wearing a form fitting kimono that was undone from the back. It showed off her amazing body. She would lay on the bed on her stomach that was slowly getting bigger from the incoming baby. 

Her hair was in a messy bun from Hanae and she awaited Paine to start the massauage. Rias was excited as she really wanted this...* - Sat Dec  5 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) let out a small moan and a chill went down her spine. She arched her back from the sensation for a moment. She smiled ad she buried her head between in her arms as she was being taken care of. "Hmmm Paaaaaaaine, I thought you said you never did this before..." she trailed off and moaned again. She really needed this. 

"I know I dont... this job... this baby... its all weighing me down. Im glad I have you all to make me happy~" she said. She squirmed alittle she would slowly get while Paine was focusing on her lower body. She removed the top of the dress and let it slide to her waist. Her upper body was compleletly exposed and she would enjoy Paine's massuage* - Sat Dec  5 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would say relaxing, "Yes Paine... you make me very happy... I would go as far to say that my love for you is comparable to that of your love for Kronos...." she said in a kind of bombshell. "You are soft and shy... yet strong and resilent, your protect what you have to yet you dont over step your boundries. Im happy that your by my side but I will be sad when you leave." she said sighing deeply and closing her eyes and feelig the full effect of the massage.

She would continue to moan every now and then and purr as Paine knew all the right spots to hit. Rias was feeling completely relaxed as she was tempted to turn around so Paine could do the front too.* - Sat Dec  5 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would feel the sensation on the sides of her breast they were sensitive to the touch so Rias squirmed alot more and bit her lip. She didnt mind as much becasue of the trust she build with Paine. Paine was taken everywhere with her  for a couple of days so she felt a longing to be near her.

Rias turned around slowly revealing her full frontal nude body to Paine. Rias was blushing a bright red and her smile was soft and bright. "No need to thank me for telling the truth... and on to your other question... im not sure... I never really thought about it but im open to your opinion."

Rias's bottom half would still be covered, she hoped Paine wouldnt mov down there... there was a embrassing secret brewing in the area and she hope Paine ignored it. Rias was melting and Paine's gentle yet firm touch felt too good for her to want her to stop. "I believe anything is possible if you put your mind to it..." she stated cupping her own breasts and covering her nipples.

She wasnt into girls like she was into guys but she was curious in Paine's expression of love... She thought about that one mans expression and it was amazing. Just thinking about it make her squirm even more.... she moans slightly and shy away from looking at the girl. Intimate moments changed perpectives...* - Sat Dec  5 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would moan alot more as she was starting to get turned on from the massage. Every few seconds she would moan out as she closed her eyes... She was feeling great now and she wanted pleasure mixed in but she was trying to stop herself. She was even going as far as to move their hands from their nipples to their "lower area" placing her hands inder her dress shortly but she forced her hands at her sides.

"Y-Yes... keep... g-going..." she said as she was putty in Paine's hands. Her hands worked wonders as she was not used to as massage but they were always good as long as they werent too rough. Rias started to get touchly feely as she grapped Paines bottem half and tried to rub her thigh.

"Hmmm... ooooo....mmmmm" she moaned as she continued, but was said that it was almost over.... 

"Y-yes... I will massage you nest time love..." she said completely relaxed* - Sat Dec  5 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) was trying her best to enjoy the massage and avoid the sexual feelings she was feeling. She moaned softly as the were still on her tender breasts. Rias beathing was starting to get shallow as Paine was just the doctor sh- Oh no...

Paine found out her secret she was trying to hide. When she went to rub her sensitive clit it was extremely wet and engourged from her turned on mood. She would be at the mercy of the woman. "P-P-P-" was all she uttered as Paine kissed her lips... she wasnt into girls but the pleasure she was feeling was too much for her to turn away... She was in shock but extremely turned on.

As she removed her lips from Rias' she uttered "I-I want you..." she bit her lip and started pull Paine onto herself. She wasnt satisfied with just a massage anymore... she wanted Paine so badly... 

"I wan-t you t-to be mine..." she said tryign to force the woman to stay with her. If she was allowed she would start to slowly and passtionally kiss Paine if allowed.

If not... she just moan and carress Paine in her aroused state* - Sat Dec  5 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) //

Things went to a whole new level, Paine got on top of her and started to liss her like she wanted... Rias would slowly undo Paine's clothing during the kissing. The was enough to sent Rias over the top. Her moan escalated to louder levels as Paine started to take care of her. Rias sucked on Paines fingers as she tasted her juices, it was her secon time doing so and she loved her own juices flavor it was sweet. 

She moaned all in Paine' ear as her clit was being massaged and her juices were flowing down her knee; she threw her head back as Paine was giving her a lesson she didnt want to to end. "I-Im... P-P... I-I... Lo-" she was incoherent. She was feeling too much please she was about to burst.

She would rub Paine's nipples against her own and grind her hips against her knee as she was about to squirt all over her. After a quick stillness for her Rias, she exploded all over Paine's lower body with a squirting orgasm. She was extremely sensetive after that moment clinging to Paine...* - Sat Dec  5 06:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Rias was in bliss she never wanted to leave Paine in their intimate moment. This had escaladed from a massage to fun on sex. But she loved the experiance, she was still sensitive from her orgasm as Paine continued to play with her and massage. Even if she wanted to stop she could not speak as she was spasming from the constant pleasure.

Her nails started to dig into Paine's skin as she was squirming all over herself. Rias moan constantly as Paine played and with her pussy. She would try to speak but she couldnt, "I-I-I " is all she could utter. She was starting to get in the mood. She might be ready to cum for the second time.* - Sat Dec  5 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) //
The sensitive Rias grabbed Paine's head and forced her harder on her clit, Her moans turned into screams as Paine kept at it, she was already close to another orgasm as this one was coming alot faster then the first one because of her sensetivity.

She would call out God and Paine's name as she clenched her thighs on her head. Her tongue was hitting her spot as Rias couldnt take it anymore. "O-Oh God! P-Paine! Yes! D-Dont stop... I-Im cumming! I-I l-love you!" she said as she squirted once more with alot more force.

Rias was fill of raw emotion at that moment in a paradise of love and esctasy. She would squirt all in Paine's face and in her mouth, it wasnt something she could control... it was just happening but Paine got her wish. The squirting orgasm shot in her mouth and maybe to the back of her throat as the was directly in front of the blast. 

Rias couldnt take it anymore... she would just stay there...resting... unable to move as Paine pleasured her for hours on end. "I-I have n-never done that with a w-woman before... But I a-am in love it wi-with you." she said it full of emotion for Paine and all Paine... "If y-you feel you had no use... that a lie... I need you and I want you..." she was say tenderly* - Sat Dec  5 07:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) gave a slow nod as she kissed her back... "I do... I want you...now... here..." she said  cuddling with the woman. She embraced her lover and spooned her...  She would slowly grasp the situation as she would come back from her euphoric orgasm filled daze. 

"Do you want to be with me?" she asked, se he never even thought of getting with a girl but Paine changed that... she went her to the moon and back. she would softly caress her hair and smile.* - Sat Dec  5 08:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would shake her head, "No... im having their child but we are not together..." she said rubbing her stomach... the baby had just started to develop as she was in the first trimester. "Im like his baby holder..." she would rest on the woman yawning...

"Im going to change my hair color..." she said off topic and slowly closing her eyes* - Sat Dec  5 08:26:27 2015
