<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would slowly awake from her nap sensing the woman from the a few days ago. She was the one with no chakra and it was always wierd sensing her. Rias didn't know or trust teh girl and kept her guard up but putting on a friendly face as Hassan taught her. "Hello little miss do you need anything?" she said looking like she was lounging in the chair.* - Mon Nov 30 09:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) sighed, "Well we have alot of work to do and noone to do it... the first thing I even started is scavenging for any documents, permits, finaicial records... Somtheing that can get meto the right track of turning this ghetto into a village." she said pointing around her. 

The office was filled and littered with paperwork, but it was clean besides the paper in the ground.* - Mon Nov 30 09:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) was alittle annoyed by her character. However she couldnt let it bother her, from her responses to Rias two things were drawn. One, she was naturally a bitch or 2 she was just a bitch towards Rias. Either way she would respond casually, "Well miss its easier said than done; I will do my job and whip this place in shape. While you are free to help while you are in this village" she said.

Rias would form a single seal and a shadow clone would appear, the clone would walk around and pick up the papers on the ground and look over them if they were useful once more.* - Mon Nov 30 10:02:27 2015

We have to start from the bottom if we want to aim for the stars" she simply responding. "I hope you will help me in the rebuilding of this village, this is not a two person job" she finished.* - Mon Nov 30 15:32:41 2015
