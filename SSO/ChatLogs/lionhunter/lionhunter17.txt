<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) was saddened about this nonexpressive personality. It was boring and just not right. She would pull more info about him while feeding Hiro. Still with his fork in her hand slowly spinning it and the jucies of the meat being flung on her chest and the plate she would slowly take another piece of steak and bring it to her mouth.

She didnt notice the meat juice on her breast for now as she brought it up to her  mouth and slowly blew on it. She softly puckered her lips and pushed air out of her mouth to cool the meat down.  Her breath was low and shallow as everyone would hear the air blowing from her mouth. She placed her soft, small hands under the meat to prevent the juices from dripping on the table.

"Be careful its hot~" she said softly moving the meat to his mouth. She would wait till he opened his mouth and insert the steak in his mouth as his mouth  pressed down in the steak she would pull the fork back and twirl it before.

"So h-" she stopped when she sensed hid chakra... it was different than anything she ever felt. She focused on him and sensed the essance of his life energy. The chakra was.... dark from his natural alignment and it intimidated her alittle.. but then she felt another kind of energy. This feeling of chakra was nature based... like he was naturally absorbing the nature chakra around him.

It excited her and she she started to droll from excitement... She looked at him suggestively, her other hand twirling her hair starting at him. "S-So do you have any special abilities?" she seductivly smilled at him* - Wed Nov 25 06:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: . . . Ummm. . .  - Wed Nov 25 07:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: What were we talking about? - Wed Nov 25 07:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: ....Aza told us to seal our lips!... I mean stop talking about his chest.. I mean past! I... I don't know any more... *she goes back to eating her own food with a notable less vigor*   - Wed Nov 25 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: . . . .  - Wed Nov 25 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Even Kyu is messed up.. . . Damn Senpai. . .  - Wed Nov 25 07:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: My Chest. . .? - Wed Nov 25 07:06:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: SURPRISE MOTHERFUCKER!!! - Wed Nov 25 07:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) giggled at Chikyu's mash-up of words. Rias knew that was a obvious lie, she would wink at him while saying, "I understand...tiger" she said in a low seductive voice. She would change your attitude entirely as she had to know about his ability. She would take the fork and pick up and slowly stab another piece of meat. As the fork pressed in the meat, the juices would be ejected oiut of the steak and it would be dripping with juice. 

She would bring the steak to her mouth as the juice dripped on her breasts some more. She cutely wrinced alittle as the juices were alittle too hot for her,"Ouch..." she said using her finger to wipe the juices off and lick it with her small tongue. She then parted her lips and placed the meat in her mouth chewly slowly and politely. She wrapped her lips and tongue aroud the prongs of the fork not caring for Hiro's backwash.

She smiled at the deleciousness of the food as she would glance at all three of them while she was eating. She then picked up another piece of meat from the plate and feeding it to Hiro; but not before softly blowing on the meat to cool it down. "You dont mind me taking a bite do you Hiro-kun?" she smiled seductivly.* - Wed Nov 25 07:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: I wonder if his body changes like hers... - Wed Nov 25 07:25:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: I'm not sure if I am happy or sad that she came right now. . . .  - Wed Nov 25 07:36:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would drool some more before wiping her mouth and shouting... "W-wait... I need to talk to you... please dont leave!" Rias couldnt help herself, mysterious powers were her trigger. She didnt know if Aza has anything special but his chakra was off and that was a red flag to her. She would focus more on Chikuryunaki becasue she knew that she was special.

But all and all she didnt want anyone to leave... she would try to snap out of her behaviour and attempt to control herself. "B-both of you... please sit... we wil have a nice..c-chat." she said hopeful everyone would stay. She ignored Hiro for her interest but would respond to hsi falling. "Hiro... get up... scoot over... let them sit" she would motion them to the seats.* - Wed Nov 25 07:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) thinks: Oh now... the mystery its overloading Rias's brain! - Wed Nov 25 07:45:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) "..." she was right.... he was special... <He cant leave...> she thought as she was going crazy in her head. Hiro was used as a shield to avoid seeing her drooling over load. She wiped her mouth in a disguise as a cough; she ignored the feeding of Hiro for now as he wasnt a priority for her... 

She would stare at Chikyu with eyes of "If you can keep at least one of these people at this table I will do anything for you..."

She would then say, "I know you want to stay here... I can see it on your face. Your the host you invited us to this chat you cant leave... We will follow you if you do" she said with a will of fire in her heart.* - Wed Nov 25 07:54:52 2015

She turned to Chikuryunaki and smiled... when Aza left she would give him a friendly bye and  "call me" gesture. "So Chikuryunaki... tell me about your 'abilities'. " she said growing anxious* - Wed Nov 25 08:10:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would close her eyes and let it sink in. She was right... Rias's thirst for knowledge was getting in the way of making a friend and it hurt her. She would feel bad and her urges would subside. 

She would take a deep breath and apologize, "Ok, im sorry. Im sorry that I acted out the way I did. I don't know what got over me and I truly feel bad about hurting your feelings." She would cease all in inappropriate actions and look in her eyes to show her sincereity.

"Lets start over, as aquientences... I really want to be your friend Chikuryunaki. Im a really nice and fun person once you get to know me." she said sticking her hand out in friendship* - Wed Nov 25 08:29:00 2015

She balled her eyes out reading that her Idol Hassan had passed from this world.

But then she would hear his words in her head. "Why are you crying my little solider? Did I teach you to cry? Chin up and ride out its live. Follow my will and take over this world." she would get up and hold the letter to her heart

"I will never forget you..." she said in tear soaked eyes as she went to follow the will of the letter.* - Thu Nov 26 04:54:24 2015
