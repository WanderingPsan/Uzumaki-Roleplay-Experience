<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would get into her stance, she didnt save Paines rp so she had to assume the stance from irl memory which was bad. 

Rias would spread her legs shoulder length and crouch down alittle. Her stance was akin to a judo stance but it was modified to fit her. Deep down Rias didnt really like the training because it added muscles to her visible body that she didnt want. She likes having a womanly figure, She would eventually take off the armor just to get used to her body without it.

She would place both of her arms at her sides and take a deep breath. One deep breath and one deep breath out, she closes her eyes while doing this and opened them to start.

She would thrust one fist forwad and keep one arm back. Then she would thrust the her other fist forward and pull her primary fist back. She kept this motion  going as she shot one fist forward after another. She slowly picked up the pace.* - Tue Nov 24 07:41:39 2015

I have.... to... have..... a back up..... you know?" she said punching between every few words. Sweat dripped from her brow as she was getting tired from the punching.

"Paine...  how.... did... you ... get.... so... strong..." she stated to get her mind off the pain of punching ever and over again.* - Tue Nov 24 08:02:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) got alittle shocked with Paines strickness in training, it was intimidating. The shy girl could be serious if she wanted. Rias would try not to disapoint Paine and she would ket her stance firm and tight while punching.

Rias felt a burning sensation all over her body as she punched over and over again. Sweat dripped off her face and it shot forward, from jetting from the punch. She was struggling to keep her stance, but from the fear of continued training she forced herself to punch faster to keep her punches up and active* - Tue Nov 24 08:37:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) heard Paines words and noded to her. Her body was adjusted once again and she would continue punching. She adjustment was for her own good but it was pushing her limits. She struggled as her body slowly started to feel weight on her arms.

<No... not now... I have to keep it up...> she thought. Rias rpaced her punched to a reasonable distance and her punching speed started to slow down. She would be sweating purfusly now and her body would start to shake from the training. It was apparent that she was tired, but she will of fire burned within her... She would not give up until her ran out of energy.* - Tue Nov 24 09:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would finsh her up her last round of punches, the was striving to learn the minimal taijutsu needed stats to make her more rounded. But was it even needed? She never trained on her genjutsu since she got there... was it wasted on her? As her mind was on this thought she would continue to punch with each thrusting fist in the air, avoid the pain she felt.

She felt like she should have been focusing on her genjutsu until it was all powerful but no one saw it that way. She thought of a way to train in secret while everyone expected taijutsu training from her until she was able to unlock a chakra gate for a last ditch effort use. She would force the last round of punches and then drop to he knees in completetion.* - Tue Nov 24 09:36:00 2015
