<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would take the milk and look at it... she gripped it with both her hands. <If Lord Hassan gives he anything I must not question it.> She thought taking the milk to the head and throwing her head back. She downed that shit quick and brought her head down. "Ahhhhh" she said refreshingly.* - Sun Nov 15 11:31:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) was alittle exbressed that he asked and her face glowed a bright red... the same color of her hair. She would stretch her arms out a little and tighten her muscles in her arm, there was alittle show of strength. She was stronger than your average ninja but becasue of her naturally non athletic build it was around the strenght of an everyday person.* - Sun Nov 15 11:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: ok - Sun Nov 15 11:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) She was still doing her best for her idol. She rolled up her dress as she didnt  have on and work out clothing yet. It revealed some fishnet  stockings and standex to cover her lower body. She was nervous as she slowly lifted up her dress to reveal her somach. She had a amazing body but not really any abs just a flat stomach that was slightly toned. She tghtned her muscles to show that she  maybe has a 2 pack if she was lucky but mostly a flat stomach* - Sun Nov 15 11:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Not terrible. - Sun Nov 15 11:56:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: No sir - Sun Nov 15 11:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Well relying on just one attribute is nice and all. - Sun Nov 15 11:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: But once someone finds a counter for that, you're done. - Sun Nov 15 11:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I garuntee that with a slightly strengthened body, you will find a lot of improvement. - Sun Nov 15 12:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: You reakky think so? - Sun Nov 15 12:00:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Iwill did what ever I can to improve sir! - Sun Nov 15 12:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Then start. - Sun Nov 15 12:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I'll even keep up with you. - Sun Nov 15 12:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yea... its a nice back up - Sun Nov 15 12:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: -omit- - Sun Nov 15 12:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would to and dry some workout clothis from the front desk and head to the locker rooms/showers. She stripped down to nothing and honestly some of the woman there would make chatter and get alittle jealous of her body and that fact that Hassan was watching over her training. She put on a training bra <if that was a thing> and her thight fitted plain white shirt; her chest clearly trying to pop out. She would out on some short shorts that would give her maximum mobility. She would come out of the dressing room looking cute from her standards. She had hwer hair in a pony tail

She went down in front of him and began to do some push ups. 1...........2..........3......... She push slowly push agains the ground her arms fully extended waiting to come back down. 4...5...6... When she got down to the ground her breast were pressing down against the floor like balloons, it didnt bother her. 7...8...9...10 She staied focused and pursued perfect form push ups, her body starting to glisten with sweat. 11...12....13....14....15.... She would slowly pick up the pace of her push ups her goal was about 25 maybe 50 but that was is she paced herself ad didnt get tired to soon.* - Sun Nov 15 12:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) did mess up on her push from time to time. She would get scolded by Hassan and start over. She remembered when Z and J were slacking off in the training fields one day. She hadd to get over there and threaten them to get them to start training, Rias was scary when she wanted to be but she didnt like it. She rather be happy and helping. She would prefect the form of the push ups durin that mistake and continue on. 16...18...19....20... She was getting ready for the armor she was about to recieve. She needed that type of armor to protect the body from harm.

The armor she was training for something on the heavy side, she needed as much protection as possible to protect her frail body. But she needed to get stronger first hence her physical training. She would reach her first goal of 25 push ups and debate wether she would continue or not. 21...22...23...24...25... She was exausted. Sweat was dripping from her body, her shirt was getting wet and her legs were sweating too... She panted and looked up at him to see if 25 was enough to move to the next exercise. * - Sun Nov 15 12:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Felt like she could do more... her body was crying but no pain no gain! What would Z and J think if she would give up so easily. Knowing J he would mock her for being weak and she hated that. Hearing her demanding mentor she would continue to 50, she grid her teeth and went back down to the ground for training. She said in her mind, <This is for Z and J... This is for Lord Hassan... This is for my dreams...>She had passion in her heart but could her body keep up?

She tried speeding up the pace, 25... 26...27...28...29....30. She really stared to sweat now. Her body was shaking and dripping with sweat all over her body. She debated if she could even move her body for the next exercises. She pushed on however. 31...32...33...34...35... She struggled, starting to lose her perfect form for a more rushed method. She tried to disguise it the best way she could but most likely it wouldnt.* - Sun Nov 15 13:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) did in fact love her body, she didnt work out much but she ate right to keep every thing working properly. She would not hear any complains and continue her form. 36...37...38...39...40...  her elbows started to buckle and her legs started to shake. SHe moaned alittle in pain as she was pushing her body into something that her body was not normally used to. The area under her was wet with her sweat making it slippery when she tried to push it. It was a new difficulty but she had to finish she was so close!

41...42...43...44...45... She was sweating alot more and she was at her limit. Even pushing up was a struggle for her... "Come on Rias...... just a few more..." she tried to encourage herself as she pushed up from the wet floor and buckled some more. 46...47...48...49...50...! She finally finished all her push ups, when she did she collapsed on the ground. She felt like her body would refuse to move itself. <If only Z were here he would be able to help out.> sje though laying on the ground and slowly turning to face the sky. She felt Hassan reversing the flow of his chakra but didnt pay attention to it as it woud distract her. She would lay on the ground sprawled out and rested for a while. She panted perfusly.* - Sun Nov 15 13:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) could not move her arm to getthe water...she noded to the question of jogging* - Sun Nov 15 13:40:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would slowly roll her body to the side and use the gym wall to prop her self up... her arms felt like jello* - Sun Nov 15 13:43:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Slowly walked to the main area looking for Hassan. She was felling alittle better but her arms still felt like jello and burned. She was wearing a sweat drenched tight fitted white t-shirt and some short shorts.
