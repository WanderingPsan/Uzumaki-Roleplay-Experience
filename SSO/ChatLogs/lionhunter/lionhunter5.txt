<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) entered his mind, she was brought to a golden gate, "What the hell?" she said as her voice echoed in Tetsumi's mind. She would see strange markings on the golden gate and tried to examine them....  as she did she would would hear the voice again... Out of nowhere the appearence of a giant beast would be before her. She was scared... intimidated... she was frozen in fear... she couldnt move her body. 

The beast's image would be burned in her brain as sand began to wrap around her. It seemed to be manipulated by the beast, "WHAT THE FUCK DID I TELL?! DIE!" his voice boomed in the area. As the sand wrapped around her and "crushed" her she would be booted out of his mind... it seemed like only a few seconds passed in the outside world. To her it was like 5-10 minutes. 

In her body she would pop up like she was in a nightmare... She looked at Tetsumi and mouthed "Im sorry". She was firghtened of the man and looked on with... regret and sadness. She shut out everyone around her staring at tetsumi and the ... thing inside of him... <I dont think Im long for this world..> she thought as she looked at her with indifferent eyes* - Fri Nov 13 05:12:44 2015
