<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: ok - Mon Nov 16 10:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would take each bottle of the milk and down it one by one. She would then wipe the residue from her mouth and look at Hassan. "Ok, I finished them... now what?" she asked.* - Mon Nov 16 10:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would follow his lead and press her back against the wall. She was already tall for a woman, would this make her a amazon?* - Mon Nov 16 10:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) stood against the wall. The tall busty woman would look at Hassan while he measured her, she blushed. It was odd for a woman to be that tall in the first place, it would be hard for her to really date anyone since alot of men was sensetive about their women being taller then they were but she trusted him fully.* - Mon Nov 16 10:45:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) //

Rias felt taller... well bigger in general. She would notice how Hassan looked short than before. She would ask, "D-did it work?" she said as her clothing fit alittle tighter. He was pretty sure she was probuly the biggest person on the nnja world. Now standing at 6'4'' and sporting DD size breast she would be a dream to some of the biggest males. If Maloth was still alive he would probuly have a field day with her. She would sqirm in her clothing... "Hm, sir... I think I need to get some new clothes now... This outfit was tight enough as it is" she worried* - Mon Nov 16 11:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) took the clothing and she would wonder if he had clothes big enough to fit her and why? She didnt ask questions and would tear the clothing off because it wasnt like she could just take them off. Of couse she went in the bathroom to do this to keep her body a secret. She came out a bigger dress and she would sit down and look at him... "So im assuming Nina and Lera will have the same results?" sthe amazon stated* - Mon Nov 16 11:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Most likely similar results. - Mon Nov 16 11:16:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Yeah you have a more commanding presence. - Mon Nov 16 11:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: But i'm not done measuring you just yet. - Mon Nov 16 11:20:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Ok - Mon Nov 16 11:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) took her spot on the wall and waited* - Mon Nov 16 11:21:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would look down... "ugh... I dont know... a 5 I guess?" she was assuming* - Mon Nov 16 11:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would blush a bright read as she placed her arms out to be measured. She didnt  mind him doing it though. She trusted him with her life. She inhaled and exhaled and waited for him to start* - Mon Nov 16 11:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) "My weight..." she would wonder for a bit... She was sensitive about that topic but not overly sensitive. She knew she would weigh more then average because of her height and her chest but changing so drastically caused a problem "150 i would be my guess..." she said embrassingly* - Mon Nov 16 11:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) She saw the scale slowly move up in weight and she teared up... <Oh God...> she though as she was felt really bad about reaching a certain number. She would slowly accept reality and prepare for the verdict. * - Mon Nov 16 11:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: 192 pounds. - Mon Nov 16 11:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: That's not bad. - Mon Nov 16 11:59:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I'm sure you're also stronger. - Mon Nov 16 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Try doing 50 push ups again. - Mon Nov 16 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: ok - Mon Nov 16 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) Would listen to orders and get down to do the push ups. She had fully recovered from the last time she did the push ups. She would the got doen on the ground and start. She would feel that the push ups were alot easier. SHe finished the first 10 without even trying. Was this the progression of the training working? Was it the milk? Or was it a combination of the two?

She continued her pushups, she was in the perfect from and cleared the next 10. She wasnt even breaking a sweat so it was easy for her. She pushed up from the ground and went to the ground in a good pace. She was really suprised with her completetion rate so far; completeling them in record time and just now feeling the effects after 30 push ups. Sweat started to appear on her forehead but it was a light sweat and she was happy with her progress.

<Ok last 20... easy as pie> She finished the last 20 the way she started it. She would remain in her perfect form and finish 10 more, her body was just now takign the effects of the workout. But the pain was not as intense but a slight burning. She finished the last round of push ups and popped back up to face Hassan. She was alittle tired but overall perfectly fine...<I hope that everyonw will be accustomed to her new body... I will probuly seem like a giant now...>* - Mon Nov 16 12:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rias(LionHunter) would get on the ground and place her hands behind her head. she stared at rest position. She had total faith in him, but would he beable to hold down suck a sizable woman? She would quickly lift her body up and bring it back down to the rest postion. Her rhythm was constant and regulated, this motion of movement was to prevent wasted movement and preserve stamina.

Most people didnt know that doing repeated patterns in the same pase but less of a strain on your body then quick movements or long breaks. She continued the ride, counting from 10 sits ups to 20 sit ups then to 30 sit ups. She was worikng up a sweat and would have to take a shower after this. She finished up around 40 sit ups before she gor back up. Now she was tired.

"Sir can we finish this up another day... Im tired and you have really had me work up a sweat..." she asked. Hassan was ruthless when it came to training but it was what she needed to be Gezo ready.* - Mon Nov 16 12:53:07 2015
