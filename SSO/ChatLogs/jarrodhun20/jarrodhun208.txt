"If you want an example of my sword play you should ask... I will not let you disrupt the the peace in this village." she teen said as she would place her hands onto the the hilts of her blades, her body getting ready as the blood thirsty bounty hunter glared at her.

No thoughts went through her head as she assumed he would come from her but she was not afraid. She accepted her fate what ever it maybe but, in all honestly Erbus was completely unaware of her abilities... If anyone could feel her aura they would feel the pressure of her resolve bursting out of her... 

No other words were coming from her, the next sounds would be that of blades clashing. 'Noriko... Tethys... guide my blade as I eliminate this threat' she thought in her head as she watched his movements carefully* - Fri Sep 25 07:18:36 2015

She stayed in her stance and glared at Erebus and his figure watching any attacks that may come from him. She didnt not respond to the vagabond nor react to his idiotic way of "recruiting" of what ever he did when coming to this village.

Violet would dart her eyes quickly to Ushinawa then back to Erebus... she was still battle ready with no response coming from her body. Her swords rattled in their sheathes as she kept her hand on the hilts.* - Fri Sep 25 07:41:39 2015

She didnt want to fight or upset any one, she was just stating facts and protecting her villagers. She really didnt care about him and his fetish for those swords as she believed items should always be returned to their original owners. 

Violet ignoreed any comments about her as she didnt care about personal opinions about herself, she was there to do a job and help her comrades. Anything thing else was just talk. She retreated back to entrance og the mansion and put her head down not looking at anyone in particular, she gazed at the general area and stayed on her guard.* - Fri Sep 25 08:07:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) walked away from the scene...* - Fri Sep 25 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) meditated on the elemental nature of lightning, Violet stood outside the main area of the village standing on the mountain; She made it her goal to master this one elemental natural, she needed that in order to master the blades in her possession. Since she was solely a kenjutsu user and she felt like she had to improve and find another way to attack or defend herself if she ever wanted to get to the next level. She gets ready and focuses on his chakra into his hands and begins to surge her chakra, concentrating and forcing his natural lightning chakra to spark up his surrounding area. But what she wished didnt come true... Lightning was to far in the distance for her...* - Fri Sep 25 21:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) went back to training, she shook her head; slapped the sides of his face and began to focus on her training again. He was disappointed in her progress in this elemental nature. Her goal was to unleash her unfamilar nature with her chakra; her control was not the best so she had many problems focusing on one of the elements not in her affinity. She attempted to surged her chakra and thinking about being surrounded by lightning is a matter of seconds. But when she realized it was all in her head she was a littled saddened, but noone said learning a element was going to be easy, She just hand to do it and hope for the best.* - Fri Sep 25 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) pointed away from the village and continued to surge her chakra, forcing lightning to rotate around him, or at least in her mind. She still wasnt able to manafest the element . As she focused his chakra around his body, he concentrated his chakra to one point in his finger and shoot the lightning at a rock in the distance, but this was a dream that would take a a while to come true.

She looked over at the guy talking to her; the stopped her training and looked in his direction "Hello... Im trying to learn a new element..." she said in a soft tone* - Fri Sep 25 22:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Would look at her self and look back at him... "If I had a teacher then I would be trained by them but this is not the case... I am on my own so i have to deal with this burden"* - Fri Sep 25 22:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) sighed and went back to the bulk of her training. She continued to surge her chakra and tried to shoot the electrical currents from her finger at the rocks in the distance on the mountain, but she would never manifest it... This tiring training exhausted her and sweat pdripped from her pours. She would continue to attempt to shoot it and it would be nothing. She only knew what she  read in scrolls and what she saw from the opponent that wielded the kiba blades. She would try her hardest to charge the chakra in her body and slowly transform the chakra in her body to the unfamiliar lightning nature. She even tried to focus intently on the feel and thought of lightning but she still couldnt fire.But just then a single  spark came from her person in a split second burst. 

She was suprised and happy knowing that she actually and progress in this element that she was trying to learn.* - Fri Sep 25 23:08:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) watched as the Lera preformed the the jutsu... She focused the chakra around her as the earth began to swirl at her feet. She would push the chakra to her feet and channel the earth chakra as she saw Lera do. When she charka was built up she would turn the flow and shoot it to the same wall of the previous attack.

She had been trying to master a new chakra so chakra flow make things slightly easy* - Sat Sep 26 06:23:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Would watch as Lera taught her the next technique, she was greatful for Lera teaching her... she was a sweet girl very smart. She remembered back when Lera had thought of her as a girlfriend and it made her chuckle a little; now especially since she actually had a girlfriend and Lera had a boyfriend. She refocused back on the lesson for the moment.

She repeated Lera and formed one head and tried to form a clone but the mud would be a clump of brown next to her. She thought of this move and realized it was similar to yan and she figures out the trick to his clones. She tried the jutsu again and poured for chakra into the jutsu.

She would form the hand seal and try to reform the mud clone. The clone formed a better resemblance of her but it could have been better so she would tey one more time and be more precise with her chakra control. She would focus her chakra in her stomach and imagine a image of her in her mind.

She would form the hand seal and a perfect copy of her out of mud. She looked it over and looked at Lera, "Did I go it right?" * - Sat Sep 26 06:40:38 2015
