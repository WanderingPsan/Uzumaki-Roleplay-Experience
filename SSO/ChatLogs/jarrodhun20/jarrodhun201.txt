<br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Looks around and sees the jounin named tethys... She stared at him for a while... she didnt say much she was shy and reserved when she didnt talk to anyone. She nodded to him and stood there.

She held the hilts of her blades and placed the palms of her butt of her blades* - Wed Sep 02 02:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) was shy when it came to talking to people  she wasnt friendly with. She also didnt want anyone touching her... she had a bad past that noone knew of. She returned his words with some of her own. "Hi, ... Im fine..." she said. Her voice was soft and sweet to the ear.

She was short 5 feet and with long brown hair... she had many accerories in her to make her look cute but she didnt really pay it any mind until she adjusted it every now and then. The 16 year old stared at him again...* - Wed Sep 02 02:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) places her hands together and at the bottom of her skirt. She bows to him in respect, "Violet... Violet De La Cruze my lord" she said this as she was aware of the marriage to the kage and it made him a big deal. She would look back up and shyly smile at him... She would smile back at him; it was a small smile since she didnt know him personally* - Wed Sep 02 02:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) She looked up alittle stone faced... "Yes my lord, I am solelly focused on kenjutsu at the moment" she said letting her hands rest on the butts of her weapons

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Looked at the men with a small smile. The smile was for the lord... the other guy was creepy. She kept her hand on her blade... She blushed at she accepted the compliment. "I will try my best not to let you and the Lady down my lord" she said with resolve in her eyes... "But I need to train first... get used to my skills I still have alot to learn" she said darted her eyes at the creepy guy* - Wed Sep 02 03:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Her resolve would start so slowly pour out of her as it built up from the conviction she had, if this was physical of course...

"I first want to gain a legendary sword or two to wield, it would build my legacy.... Next I want to master all elemental natural chakra flows so I can flow an element through my blade that will fit my situation. Then I want to build a legacy and do what few people are capable of doing, and lastly I want to become a master at the art of dual wielding and chara flow... It is last because it is the last stage on refining my craft..." she said happily.

"I will get student someday when I become a master but that a while from now" she said looking in the sky* - Wed Sep 02 04:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) dared not speak ill of him or his decisions, "You live your love how you see fit my Lord. I will promise you that I will achieve my dreams or die trying... And I hope you achieve yours... dreams never die my lord... as they are dreams, they stay in your heart and evolve. The evolve into bigger and better dreams..." she simply stated... she was getting closer to him. She felt like he was her mentor and he taught her about herself. * - Wed Sep 02 04:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) was touched by the moment she could trust another person, she shead one tear of joy as she accepted the hug and said "I am so grateful for this moment my lord..." she said with passion and emotion.

Yet another person she could trust for a lifetime...* - Wed Sep 02 05:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) was released and she noded her head... "Am I am for you my Lord..." she fired back* - Wed Sep 02 05:15:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) was minding her own business when she decided to walk in side a building to get something to drink. She was in Kirigakure and she was tired from her training; she wanted some water from the vending machine. As she entered the building something strange happened... there was a distortion in space time and she passed out in a raman shop of a unknown land...

She woke up from this lapse and walked outside, she was in a whole different area! She was so confused as to where she was and why she was there and how she got there... Confusion was written all over her face when a woman not too far away greeted her. She scanned the woman, no tanto...no katana... this was not Kirigakure but she did have a pouch... who knows what was inside of it... She didnt want to be rude so she responded back, "Hi..." she said in a soft sweet voice. The shy girl kept her hands on the butts on her katanas if any troubles were to be caused...

Who knows what happened to her and why it happened; will she able to return home? This were questions with no answers* - Thu Sep 03 12:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) had no choice but to follow her, but she kept her wits about her... she was a ... special girl; she had a fear of strangers touching her... hopefully this would not cause any trouble.

She followed a few steps behind her and she was alert and attentive she monitered her surroundings... This was the start of a strange day... Who knows what will happen to anyone here or what will happen to her... only time will tell.* - Thu Sep 03 13:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) followed* - Thu Sep 03 13:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Was being shown around the Konoha village, this was odd as everone seemed  tense and unease.. she can feel then tension in the air. She looked around and clenched her blade handle to looked at the man. "What is this place... " she asked... It was surrounded by guards and not in the best of conditions.* - Thu Sep 03 13:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) she caught herself... noone would belief she was "teleported" here... it was out of the relam of possibility. She looked at the man and scanned him. Making sure not to be near him. She was taught never to underestimate her targets... that was the number one rule from her grand master...

She thought back to the question... "Who sent me? Well no one sent me here..." she said in a confused face. This dream was getting wierder and wierder... Distortions in time began to to fluxuate in the area. The skys blinked from night to day in an instant.

As she individuals saw this it would be quite strange to them... Was this a tell tale sign of wierd things to come?* - Thu Sep 03 14:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) She looked at the man as his personality seemed to switch to a more blood thirsty one. It didnt bother her in the slightest... it was like she could sense the aura coming from him... This sensation is wierd but she remained in guard. "As I said it is my code not to fight unless provocked..." she said to stop him. Most likely that trigger word at the end hinted the only way for her to draw her swords.

She looked on quite confused* - Thu Sep 03 14:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) She saw a huge fire ball coming for her... this angered her and the code would rely on a counter method...

In a flash her swords were drawen and they were placed in a x formation in front of her. Chakra would flow from her to the blades; the blades would harden to the maximum point and take the impact of the fire. The fire blast blew her back and dispersed. The blades were red hot from the impact taken and she placed them at her side...

"Dont escalate this even further..." she said in her soft voice* - Thu Sep 03 14:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) was trying to avoid conflict but hit could not be helped... her blades were once again utilized to act as a balance to weave the close range fire balls. She swayed in and out of the way as the shots grazed her cloths. The embers would  slowly burn away the dress as the fight ... but as for now they just damaged them.

After the weaves she would be in close range of the man and extend her foot attempting to kick him square in the chest as punishment for trying to melt her...While her foot was extended a clear shot of her snow white panties were in view briefly. If successful she would retract her foot and stand there with her blades at her side... If not she would attempt a sweeping motion is she was touched... This blade motion would not be aimed to cut but to slap as she used the flat part of the blade.* - Thu Sep 03 14:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) as he charges up for a lightning technique while she stands there and gets back to her stance... the lightning would flow out of his hands. As the lighting flowed she pointed the swords towards him... The lighting would gather to her her swords and light up them up... She dug the swords into the ground and the lightning disperses in the earth. The earth rose forward from the lightingning and felt a indent in the ground.

"Why do you continue to provoke me... " she woman said as the embers burnrf more of her cloths... Now her panties were fully visible and showing... She didnt register the shock of her skirt burning to... she assumed it was still there and talked with full confidence* - Thu Sep 03 15:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) a distortion in time was felt as fluations in her space of existance took shape... Before she knew it she was in a black bikini and water was sprayed on her.

Her reaction? She shrugged it off as she was fed up with this day..."As I said I dont want to fight... it is not in my code... I follow a strict path" she said as her resolve flowed out of her and a wave of wind would push through the area, it would not harm or push them back. 

She turned around and saw more people coming... "What is it now?" she thought facing side ways... the woman was in a black bikini and soacking wet with her swords draws* - Thu Sep 03 15:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Time would distort around the girl again... in the matter of physical ability this time... there was a strange effect power amplification happening to her... who knows that the trigger was?* - Thu Sep 03 15:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) As she walks past them she sheathed her bladed but keot them on stand by for anything counter strike* - Thu Sep 03 15:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thought the guy was creepy but it was her only lead to getting out of this dream. Suddenly a boom was heard in the air... then suddently her clothes were reformed on her person with the bikini underneath. * - Thu Sep 03 15:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) the earth starts to rumble and shake in Konohagakure as a ripple in time was formed in the sky above the village... What could it mean?* - Thu Sep 03 16:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) // the ground slowly started to shake even more... the time ripple over head began to open wider. The forces of of time and space bent around her. A black aura was starting to form... 

It seemed that charka was not the cause of this disturbence... but something far bigger. In her hilt the swords began to shake... Violet was hell bent on going home... and she didnt feel the thinks happening around her... But that was a lie... she did feel them but her focus blocked it out. She pulled out both of her blades as she darted her eyes back and forth at the number of people who would try yo interfere with her departutre. 

Some where in the village a portal was open... a portal where she could go home... this was her ticket out of this prison. "As a samuri and loyalist of the Gezo Empire and Kirigakure I shall ask you again, let me go or suffer the consequences..."

A sensor would feel her chakra multiplying for some strange reason, but she physically looked normal... What was happening?* - Thu Sep 03 16:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) draws both her swords and gets into a deep stance. she slowly edges forward with one blade pointed to her left across her chest and another aimed forward.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) was not fast enough to do anything fancy she moved her blade down to deflect and was knocked back by the effect. She slide back and caught herself... This guy was no joke when it came to swordsmanship. She didnt hold a candle to him but as a swordwoman with pride she got back up and went atfer him.

She would try to aim one sword to do a quick swipe across his body and spin with the movement of the blade. After the rotation she would try another attack with her second sword to aim at the bottom of his legs. When she spun she crotched so she was lower to the ground* - Thu Sep 03 18:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) As she finished her spin he was gone. He side stepped her second move and aimed to counter attack her immediatly with two quick attacks one at her arm and the other for her hip.

As she was still ducked down she continued to spin on her toes. She rose her blade up to block the for her attack for her arm the second move came mid spin and impacted her hip... she slide from her position and got up and tried to attack him again.

That was one point for him and none for her as she counted in her head. She would try another attend to hit him as she was too slow for him. She would try two more attacks aimed for each of his arms at the same time . She hoped this will make him choose what to block* - Thu Sep 03 18:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) bowed to her... * - Thu Sep 03 19:57:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) cringed the pain she let out a second moan; "... ok... I got this... Will ... of the swordswoman." she said as she let her wrist get cut over and over again. This was a process of repetition. Why was Violet letting a stranger attack her? Why wasnt she nervous? All these questions popped in her head* - Thu Sep 03 20:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) waited for her with her wrist out and waiting for the women. "When ever you are ready..." she said smiling* - Thu Sep 03 21:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) felt the jabbing pain and covered her mouth as she let it heal again... "Be gentle..." she said as she put more force into it. This was making her dizzy from the loss of blood even though she was being healled. Her legs started to wabble as she could barely stand. Her legs were visibly wobbling  as she struggled to stand up.* - Thu Sep 03 21:14:40 2015

"Alright then im enjoing it for sure... after trust is a big thing to me." she said relaxing on the bench. 

Blood would refill her body and she would slowly regain her strength, she would scan the womans body and features to memory. * - Thu Sep 03 22:52:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) "Im sure you will be amazing at medical ninjutsu soon, you could be my personal medic~" she said with a tune. It looked like they were in they own word at this moment. Violet was in a trance most of the time lost in though. Their eyes were locked in contact... she was ever curious about having a girlfriend... she stared in her lips..."Can I kiss you?" she said curiously* - Fri Sep 04 00:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) //"We-" Then she was kissed. The kiss was soft and sweet. She felt the softness of her lips and the softness of hers..."thank you it was... it was good... I liked it; but I also dont want to rush things. I like being with you...

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Violet thought to herself... 'she is awfully close right now... but I dont mind...I actually enjoy it.. she is warm, sweeter than she appears..'

Then she said it... those incredible words... those important words... you can only say those words to the special people... Violet was shocked but she felt like she could trust her... she felt like she could love her back. Then those words slipped out. "I love you too..." her mind said it... her heart said it... She felt the love of another human being...
* - Fri Sep 04 01:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Her body was held close... their bodies warmed each other. It was a tender moment for the lovers. The womans bodies pressed together, then Setsuna placed her head on Violets chest... her chest was small but they were close together and soft, she would enjoy it quite a bit. They were enjoying the moment; Violet began to relax and pressed her back against the bench. She was then staring in the sky. "Lay on me hun..." she said with a sweet tender voice... She wanted to lay her head in her body* - Fri Sep 04 01:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Im joyed the comfort as she snuggled untop on her. Violets body was small but so was hers...She was in the moment. "I assume you never have had a girlfriend before???" she was curious* - Fri Sep 04 02:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) "Oh... well tell me about yourself; your history... This is my first intimate relationship... Im kinda nervous but I feel like I can really trust you."
The warm was still there... Her blades rested at her sides and on her waist. The swung airbore in either side of the bench* - Fri Sep 04 02:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Felt even closer to her as the tiny girl hugged her even tigher... Her arms wrapped around her figure below Setsuna's arms... "I too have a past... it was one of ..... unforcunate circumstances... I feel like we connect on a deeper level, like we were destined to find each other... I have only known you for a short time but my feelings for you are real..."

Her life was a questionable past that was filled with disloyalty and trust. Broken promises and tears... It was just as sad. Violet could feel her pain ... her struggle... her story it was the link...* - Fri Sep 04 02:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) and Setsuna was face to face at the moment before she nuzzled against her... and rested in her shoulder in Violet... "Well I love you and you love me... so it should be easy to spread it." she said giggling from the tickle... 

"Have you met anyone else in the village love?" she said having a relaxing conversation where she was getting sleepy... this position was too relaxing* - Fri Sep 04 03:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Would kiss her head as she tried to fall asleep, "Night~" she whispered* - Fri Sep 04 03:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) reached out her hand to Setsuna as she felt comfort in holding her hand... "Setsuna, can you please come over here... that is if your not comfortable over there..."* - Fri Sep 04 13:35:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Looked around as everyone left to train, then Setsuna went more agresssive than she usually was. Setsuna really was was more affectionate as she like the privacy. Setsuna slide her fingers inbetween hersas she got infront of her. She she leaned forward Violet did the same and pressed her lips against hers resulting in a kiss between the two women. As she kissed she heard a slight moan soming from Setsuna; she liked it but she wouldnt address it. 

She kept the kiss alittle long and then she moved back a little; "Love... ae you ok? You didnt talk much..." she wondered* - Fri Sep 04 15:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Didnt like where this was going... or did she? Setsuna was a very touchly girl she didnt mind it but Violet felt this was moving a little fast for her. But she would try to stop her if she would do too far she would enjoy the moment for now... 

She was pushed against the post and her arms were caressed. She pressed her body agains Violet and she blushed..."u-uhmm but there are people still here..." she said shyly...a shiver went down her spine and it make  her a little weak. "I... like it though" she said as she bit her lip* - Fri Sep 04 15:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) couldnt really talk as their lips were touching; Violet was biting her lip and Setsuna was biting Violents lip also, it was very intimate. The woman's bodies were pressed together. As the Lord came in she froze alittle... she felt it disrespectful that she was doing this in front of the lord. She lost all feeling of sesuality. She pushed her away and held her hand.

"My Lord... what... please dont tell me..." she began to tear up as he walked out with the robes on his body.* - Fri Sep 04 15:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) on Violet's face wat that is of sorrow... She was crying hard... She had no idea but to assume the worst even though the Lord was smiling... She ran to him unaware she was pulling Setsuna with her and grasped him tight trying to comfort him... She couldnt ignore the tears... She loved the Lord and the Lady and ant thought of ilness was heart breaking...

She tried on his chest and praying deep inside that Setsuna and Tethys would comfort her... Was she over reacting? Who knows... the moment was there...* - Fri Sep 04 16:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) balled like a baby... when it came to her Lord, lady and  her girlfriend... She couldnt help but show her emotions.

IF you were a human being you had to either be sad or angry and she could tell tethys was the most broken by this even if he forced a broken smile. She was cradled but the two but slowly switched to Setsuna to low key give Tethys some room and space. "Why did it have to be her... why couldnt it have been me Setsuna?" her brown eyes were glistning as they were wet from tears... she buried her head in Setsuna's chest. A warm comforting embrace was needed.* - Fri Sep 04 16:30:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Pulls her swords out and flips her blades so she would not be lethal... She gets into a stance and crouches down, One blade was pointed toward him the other was across her body. She would slowly walk toward him staying on guard.* - Fri Sep 04 23:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) As the punch went to her chin she used the blade to block the fist... maybe his hand hurt hitting the blade?

Anyway she used the other blade to swiftly aim to impact him with the narrow back of the blade. The blade was aimed at his side and force him to slide to the side. She would watch him for any counter attack. * - Fri Sep 04 23:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) as the both impacts were made he countered by trying to trip her..

She was not expecting a trip or all things... but one thing made her snap... he touched her. She was sensitive about people touching her and when he pushed her back she stabbed her her blades on the ground. Her upper body fell back and she curled her legs... She aimed to kick him square in his chest with all her strength; this was an over reaction but she panicked.

note: She used the swords as a balance* - Sat Sep 05 00:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) She would re-balance her self and look at the boy on the ground. "Im sorry about that... but I panicked... I dont like being touched by strangers... " she said in a soft tone. "But are you getting back up? Or are we stopping?" she wondered.

The short girl stood there and she looked at him, she stood 5 feet tall and she hand both black blades in her hand. She waited for a responce...* - Sat Sep 05 00:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) looks around* - Sat Sep 05 00:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) She walked back to the bench and sat next to Setsuna... she rested her head on the womans shoulder and waited for a minute to rest... She was going to train later so she needed the rest* - Sat Sep 05 00:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) kissed her on the cheek before getting up to follow the lord* - Sat Sep 05 00:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) She ran toward him but kept her blades shethed till the last minute to aim for a quick strike... After all she wanted to focus on her speed so she would slowly run at him an watch his every mood... Talking during a spar with the lord would deem fatal so she remained slient and only thought "I must show him I am worthy to protect this village... I must show him the power of loyalty and conviction"

Her eyes narrowed and her body was small and slender. Her tiny frame made heis hit box smaller so he had few choices to aim for.* - Sat Sep 05 01:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) nodded from advice... this was nothing more than a lesson for her. He could outclass her in any form of combat but she knew this. As she was nudged, she extended her charging foot to stop her self and pivot her body in his direction. As she pivoted she drew her blade with as much speed the as she could muster from the "quick draw" and flip the blade so it was non-lethal hit. She aimed to hit his torse with the narrow part of her blade. 

If she hit she would repeat the action with the opposite blade... if not then she would try to counter any move he made and stay on guard* - Sat Sep 05 01:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) was spanked on her wrist and her attack woud miss. She studied all her mistakes and tried again. She would spin on her toes and pull her second sword from its shethe. She now had both of her swords in her hands and spinining on her toes. She would quickly aim two simultanious sword attacks, one aimed for his arm and the other aimed for his waist.

While she did this she would still be spinning on her toes to increase her momentum  and the power behind her attacks. If she missed she would duck while spinning to ready a second attack* - Sat Sep 05 01:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) //As her swords were blocked at the same time, she was caught off guard and pushed off. She tried to caught herself by stabbing her sword in the ground to stop her fall and immediatly got back up pulling her sword from the ground like a sling shot and flying toward him. She nodded her head while remaining slient, she was a little dizzy from the spin but she regained her composture as she charged for him once again.

She aimed for multiple parts of his body this time; her right strike aimed for his neck...; her left strike aimed for his left side of his torso midsection...then she added a twist to her move. Assuming she would make contact she would then then attempt a sweep kick with her left leg while he was guarding... She thinking was multiple attacks on different body parts would increase the chances of a hit.* - Sat Sep 05 02:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) never stopped attacking as she suceeded in making him use that jutsu. She smiles as she continued her attack. The blocks were efficicent of course and his eyes were keen she started another combo to test... she redirected her blades sliding them off his tanto and aiming to attack them in a way that if he block with his tanto again she had a chance to break the guard.

She aimed her right sword attack down at a angle starting from his shoulder.

She aimed her left sword attack aiming up starting from his waist.

Her goal was a pincer attack to squeeze his ribs... and as that went through she would retract her foot and extend it to stamp him in the stomach... She assumed he liked her three combo attack and she would always add it in her moveset.* - Sat Sep 05 02:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) was honored by the fact that was viewing the famed black blade... she kicked it and it did nothing to the black as she got repelled... She was elated... it showed in her face... She was already going at her full power as she tried to ready herself from more ways to fight. 

She hardened her blades with chakra flow prevent her blades from breaking as they clashed. Then she would switch up her tactics and start jabbing instead of slashing... She would jab him multiple times.... or at least try to jab him... the jabs would aim at his neck, his right arm, his left thigh and his left foot.

Tethys would feel the chakra flowing through her blades...* - Sat Sep 05 03:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Every attack was deflected by the black blade... thanks to the hardness if the blades they didnt break with the direct contact of the black blade. She switched the tactics again. She this time attacked him with one rapid hit aster the other... She would put forth a relentless assault as she ran out of options...

The swords would clash over and over again as she swung one blade after another trying to wear him down and give him no time to recover... Violet was getting tired and it showed in her movements... Metal clashing would he heard in the square and echo out in the village.

She huffed and puffed as she tried to keep attacking; the right side of the body, the left side of the neck, the right thigh, the left side of the body.* - Sat Sep 05 04:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) As his speed and reflexes out classes hers, her assault was over... he wanted to end the lesson. She would be held at sword edge and she would take her two blades and shethe her blades...

Sweat was present all over her body... it dampened her body while Tethys didnt  break a sweat... "Thank you for the lesson my lord... I have learned alot sparring you." She smiled and tilted her head. "I think I will lay down for a second..." she slowly walked to the bench... she was aching all over... she struggled taking steps.. "Walk it off Violet... dont show him weakness" she thought to her self.* - Sat Sep 05 04:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) rested on his shoulder for a quick second but passed out in the process* - Sat Sep 05 04:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) looks around, "Its so peaceful right now... and Setsuna looks so cute... I will wake her soon... or should I let her sleep?" she pondered this for a moment. "And over there is the speedstar kenshin... very famous like the lord but he is peacfully reading... Its so commonplace." She never said a word... just looking staring and thinking at her surroundings* - Sat Sep 05 14:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) sat next to her and stared... "I wonder will she notice me??" she thought* - Sat Sep 05 14:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thought "oh, that was random... well " she smiled and sat there... she started planning out her life for a moment* - Sat Sep 05 15:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) allows all her actions as Setsuna was very tired... She smiles as she felt the warm im brace of her partneron her. She went back to thinking how she would get faster* - Sat Sep 05 15:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) woke up from her nap and looked around. She walked to near to Lord Tethys and Lord Hassen and followed there lead on what ever is going on* - Sat Sep 05 23:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) as Setsuna left to get a honey bun, Violet smelled the faint smell of it as she teased her about her hunger... She turned to see that she deliperatly ate in front of her ..."Oh? Really now?" she said with a small smirk. She would grab he hand softly and pull it toward her mouth. She then took a bite of the honey bun and slowly chewed it in front of her. "Thank you~" she said teasing back* - Sun Sep 06 01:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) whispers: (I managed to buy 300 troops from pocket money for the village. We @ 4.3k now) - Sun Sep 06 06:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) would go to the coastline and take a few deep breaths. She would then crouch down deep into a samuri stance with her hand on the hilt of her blade and quickdraw her blade from the sheathe. She shot her chakra into her blades  and that hardened them to their absolute limit. She when preformed several slashes with all of her strength such as; a forward slash, a diagonal slash and sweeping front kick. She would then shealthe her blade and sit on the ground to meditate... 

She would refocus her chakra in her blade and try to maintain it. Really she wanted to get used to elemental chakra flow. Since she was told to master lightning chakra he should read and train up on manifesting the chakra in general. The nature she was naturally good at was earth which was the polar opposite of lightning so if she thought about the opposite of earth then she could maybe have a better understanding for lightining.* - Sun Sep 06 12:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) came back from her training to see Setsuna doing it again. She really didnt like her doing that to herself. Thats why she stopped her from doing it in the first place. "Babe, you cant keep doing that... you know I dont like when you do that..." she said in a somber tone grapping her arm.

She sighed "But I will be gone for a while, Im doing some speed trainning and I wont see you for a minute, so.... just.... be careful ok?" she said attempting to kiss her on her lips.* - Sun Sep 06 13:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Walked in the town square, sweating perfusly and her clothes soaking wet; she walked to the bench to sit for a while and greeted her girlfriend. She kissed her on her forehead as she plopped down bone tired. "him back... where is lord tethys..." she questioned* - Sun Sep 06 19:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) looked at the wound again... "it stll hasnt healed?" she worried* - Sun Sep 06 20:06:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) cluched Setsuna tight holding he as close as possible; their bodies touched and her head was rested on Setsuna's. * - Sun Sep 06 21:01:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Saw as all she battered and brused army return with a badly injured tethys returned... Violet ripped from Setsuna's arms as she ran to her Lord with Setsuna in tow... "My lord!! Setsuna... please your best to heal him"... she was glued to his side. First The lady ... now the Lord... Violet was in tears* - Sun Sep 06 23:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) went without haste and ran to the nearest water source which was a lake near by... She ran to the side of the lake and picked up a bucket.

She grently grabs her hand and she examines the wound. She checks the would for the start of the injury.

We can restore him from that state with water. But water conducts electricity. Logically speaking, Tethys-sama is a human conductor of lightning. He'll easily get screwed over by it, if I'm right. - Mon Sep 07 22:29:45 2015

She would prepare for any thing to happen and not care for her own safety... Her lord was the only concern. She would place all the water she had in her bag and place her hands on her blade hilt as a precaution* - Tue Sep 08 00:05:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) "If Koeki is risking her life to save Tethys then I will to...sorry Setsuna" she thought... 
She slowly weaved several handseals and she sent underground, she would slowly move to the location of the fight, she moved straight ahead. She she kept an eye on her target she followed the signature via magnetic waves and take her time* - Tue Sep 08 01:45:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) would still travel to her target slowly, unaffected by the sand because she is underground. She sensed everythung above her and it fucked with the senses but she remembered the general location of her target... she continued to sense the area and move forward.* - Tue Sep 08 03:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) still checking the senses above alot has hasnt changed but... Lord tehtys was gone? She hoped he was ok as she had her target in her sights still and moved directly under niza...

She was unaware if she would run into her lord but reguardless she would be under Niza* - Tue Sep 08 03:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Would come up from underground and relax behind Niza, "I think I will just lay here for a while..." she said as she layed against the mansion walls exhausted...* - Tue Sep 08 04:23:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) still rested on the ground* - Tue Sep 08 04:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) got up from her rest as she tried to get everyones attention,"This is insane; All the lord is trying to do is return the 7 artifacts of kirigakure back to kirigakure. But becasue of personal reasons the other guys refuses to comply. We were planning to kindly ask for it and compenate you in return as it mosly likely holds more sentimental value for his as a village than it does you becasue it was from kirigakure."

"I just wasnt to go home now I want to take Koeki and Lord Tethys and just go home; if we can have our sword back good if not we can discuss it later" she looks around.  Violet was never cauht by the bugs as the was underground and never a target. She calls a caravan and picks picks up Koeki and puts her on it. She does the same for tethys, and IF she could grab the swords she would get them if not stopped. 

"Im sorry for the altercation" she said. She would pay the driver and head to kirigakure * - Tue Sep 08 05:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Note: Whether it matters or not Violet is not attacking; but she is waiting for replies* - Tue Sep 08 05:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) was not scared of the man or his methods, she was a loyalist of Kirigakure and the Gezo empire and she would state this, "I am a loyal member of Kirigakure and the Gezo empire... And I will take be comrades home..." she said with her soft and tender voice. She was in no way threatening standing 5 ft tall compared to his 6' 2''.

"Your threats do not scare me, but you talk like you have something to them... Koeki is a medic and a far skilled medic than you are... Listen to your friend he speaks words of wisdom; I thank you Sand user I owe you a great deal." she said switching from Dravae to Tetsumi and back to Dravae.

As she grabbed the swords from Ushinawa's unconscience body she would place them on her back. Then she would grab Tethys and put him with the rest of the group of shinobi all while talking, "If you did something to them please undo it so we can leave" she said as she grabbed everything needed and was on her way to kirigakure with the swords and her bug free comrades* - Tue Sep 08 05:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Would keep an eye on everyone as they got on the caravan... she inspected everyone carefully before leaving. 

She inspected the jellified tethys and knew how to handle it.She poured a bottle of water in his mouth to satisfy him until they swnt to kirigakure. 

She inspected the injured Koeki she was bleeding from her mouth alittle and a indent was found on her chest... "I dont have her abilities check for injuries like she does so that leaves me with one choice." "If you are a medic bug man come here..." she said as she climbed back in the caravan.* - Tue Sep 08 06:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) would slap away his hand when he tried to grope her* - Tue Sep 08 06:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) //A massive light happened in the caravan and only Violet and Tethys knew what all happened, but everyone else would only know about a massive roar and a huge light. Violet would be by his side for any help that he needed in the caravan; she tried to gently grab her hand and calm her down even though she was knocked out... 

"Anything you need... im here..." she whispered to him.

The caravan driver was wierded out she she forced him to stay and take them out the village. While tethys was working his magic; the caravan would slowly pull out of Kono and on the road to kiri. And to think all this happened because of a hyuuga and abrume... once again Konohagakure fucks shit up for everyone* - Tue Sep 08 06:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Gets out the caravan looking pissed as fuck... "Are you fucking kidding me? After all this shit that you done you have the nerve to stop us from leaving and ask for this is weapon from MY village? Can you hear yourself right now?" she said with a soft yet irritated voice.

She didnt grip her blades is hostility but she was angry. "I was told of this 'Great Evil' in this world and as Kirgakure has helped before we will help again. Kirigakure as the wielders of these artifacts and we are best fit to wield them. If you want to use the blade for good then leave it with us so we can come to battle and wield it right!!! Not give it to some random guy so he can 'play' with it. I have a dying shinobi with me... as a medic that should be your number one priority, let me leave so I can deal with my comrades..." she finished hoping he would do the smart thing. * - Tue Sep 08 06:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) waits for tethys to respond as she holds him... he was on his last leg and she was suprised that he could even talk, but this was the power of a jounin

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) carried him to the caravan with Koeki and head to the village* - Tue Sep 08 07:22:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Runs to get water from every source possible and pours it on him and feeds him it, "Tethys.... please wake up tethys.... " she said as tears roll down her face...

She didnt even care about the blades she just wanted him to be ok* - Tue Sep 08 07:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) She orders the medics to take Koeki in the mansion with noriko and asked them to tend to her as Violet tends to the Lord. "Please take care of both of them... dont let them leave the hospital or their beds what so ever..." she ordered them. As Koeki was in critcal condition she hoped they used the village funds to heal her up quicktly. If not? Then they would stablize her and keep her safe, controlled and in bed.

The doctors would also take tethys and give him exactly what he needed to recover, they would supply him with a iv drip of pure water and place him in a bed in the hospital. The doctors would inform her of both of their conditions and their sucess at stabilizing them. "Good, good..." she sighed relief. 

She pulls the swords from her person and stared at them... "All that fucking trouble for fucking swords..." she placed them on her back and would wait to give them to tethys or noriko... she kept them safe with her and didnt tell a soul.

She would hide them before anyone would see that she had them.* - Tue Sep 08 07:41:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) should have felt glad, but she wasnt... She was at wits end with all this nonsense.. She smacked her face and looked around to survey the area... she would then speack to anyone avalible to talk... "How are Lord Tethys and koeki?" she said in a soft calm voice. She didnt feel like a important facter in the mission but was she? She didnt dwell on it
* - Wed Sep 09 00:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) did not shake his hand as she had a thing about touching strangers... "Im sorry I... cant shake your hand, but you have my word" she said bowing slightly to him.* - Wed Sep 09 00:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) After her mission she was always at the eadg of her seat... not only did she made an enemy of a strong shinobi but she aquired a weapon of great interest to who ever wanted them... Luckly they were in a vault and Kiri was a fortress that was nigh inpenetrable... She was still onedge but she felt safe in the walls...

"I.... need to go train; if you want to come then, but dont distract me... I .....really need this... " she said with a worring tone..* - Wed Sep 09 00:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) would walk to a wide area that would match her conditions and increase her stamina... As the males followed. She was still on edge but she had to trust her comrades... she tried but she felt like she could only trust few...

"No... im not" she said before walking off to the Kirigakure waterfall* - Wed Sep 09 00:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Would pull her swords from her sheaths in a quick draw motion as she aimed the tip of the blade at one precise point in the air, she was planning on using this technique one day to stop ninjutsu users but it was a work in progress. As she draw her swords she channeled her chakra to the blades to harden them to  their highest point. She had to master this skill to prevent her own swords from breaking when watched with a superior weapon. It was only a matter of time before a situation like that would arise.

She then formed several hand seals and sank under ground with her swords following her... She would immediatly come back up and attempt several slashes as she was fatigued from the jutsu delay. It was diffcult but she needed this train. She still was waiting for Hassan to order her equiment from the Gezo; she really needed it but she had to wait... patience was a viture for a samuri* - Wed Sep 09 01:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) She would then think of better ways to improve her swordplay... She would then get an idea in her head and stand on her toes, she would try to imagine that she was at a ball with a heel at the back of her foot keeping it arched. The purpose of this was to stay active and agressive... not focus on strong slashes but the speed of them at which she really needed more of. She would act as a ballerina as she would gracefully spin and strike constantly in the air she aimed to pull off multiple combos and overwhem the opponent.

She believed this would work best for her as she was already interested in spins and such in her sword style... But it would take time to master such a style.; speed was a must and she would do everything in her power to embody speed.* - Wed Sep 09 01:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) really ignored the men's conversation as she was focused on her training. She would reply if she was commented at though, she wasnt deaf. She continued to  stand on her toes and harden her blades for the second time. She would go for a vertical slash straight down the middle, then quickly transtion to another slash with her opposite hand which was a hotrizontal slash across the middle. Not losing momentum she would stay on her toes and gracefully spin with both of her blades facing outward like a graceful deadly tornado. 

She would extend her legs out to slow down the spin of her dance and stop. The blades would sing through the air as she would be breathing heavly as this was taxing to her stamina... she would slowly walk in the water toward the waterfall at this point getting completely soaked with all her cloths on* - Wed Sep 09 02:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) // As she walked in the waterfall the heavy water cascaded from the top and crashed on her small figure. She fliched as the water crashed but she was a trooper. She stood tall in the water and slowly walked to the center of the waterfall, the water made her cloths clings to her figure showing her figure to the world. She was a short 5 ft; she had a toned body with bgrowing to c sized perky chest. She had a tight firm butt that matched the proportion of her body; she gained this figure from eathing right and exercising as a swordswoman, she didnt care about her figure much.

As she slowly got on her toes she would slowly spin under the water fall; she used the movents of her blade and the cascading water as a windmill effect to increase the duration and speed of the spin. As she reached her limit of her training she would place her blades down and slow her spin to a stop. She then would sheathe her blades and sit down in the waterfall to meditate* - Wed Sep 09 03:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) responded "Its one of my several methods..." she said with her eyes closed and listening to the water flowing down her. She would feel the wind blowing and the serenity she was feeling was calming her nerves...* - Wed Sep 09 03:19:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) was sitting by her partner, she watched her as she practiced her jutsu... Violet decided to train also by concentrating her chakra into her blades. She slowly pulled out her blade and hardened it to its limits. She would then release the flow and smile at her partner... "Keep it up my love I believe in you" she said slashing forward at a nice speed for a then sheathing it. 

"I need to continue form if I want to get faster" she would meditate beside her as she trained* - Thu Sep 10 00:53:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) would sit down and watch the two spar, she would watch intendly and wonder did they have any formal training in lightining. She would eventually need to learn lightning moves also but she needed actual training first as she didnt have a natual affinity for lightning. She would pull her sword from her sheathe and flow her through her blade like she did from time to time so she could master this technique; It would take a while but practice made for perfect.* - Thu Sep 10 14:18:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Would quickdraw her sword and flow her chakra through it, hardening it to the limit. She would then arch her feet to get on her top toes; while she was on her toes she immediately would lean forward and preform three slashes. One slash was a horizontal slash to the mid-section, then she moved to a vertical slash to the left and one diagonal slash across the body. She would use the weight od the blades to keep her balance as she struggles to stay on her toes. The training was hard but speed was a priority for her and it was what she had to do* - Thu Sep 10 22:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) couldnt help but glance at Setsuna every now and then as she continued to train. She was in love with her girlfriend, but she really had a trouble with men... it was a problem that would be always present. She would start to refocus on her training by spinning on her toes and extending the blades on her sides to keep herself up. As she spun she would aim quickly for the top, the middle, and the lower body areas slowly squating as she spun. The motion was dizzying but she endured it. She would reform the chakra flow in her blades to imagine impacting a hard target with quick shallow strikes to slowly destroy the target.* - Thu Sep 10 23:15:24 2015
