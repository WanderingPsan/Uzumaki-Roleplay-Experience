She would then continue to the next rock while thinking, <Violet you are strong and you will prove to everyone and yourself that you deserve to wield those blades. They were your birth right... they were part of your dream. They were the legacy of Tethys, you have to prove to them that you can protect them. You can protect Lera... Setsuko... Kirie...Kirigakure. This is your home and your path. You cant join stupid fights.>

The village was getting alot better but there was ore to be done... Violetn wa glistening with sweat as she struggles to keep the clones up and attack at the same time.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) // Before she left Violet would run around to find the do that was eating dead bodies around. She had no idea where to look for the dog so she would start with the location of a bad spell. She would run around looking for the dog in a few spots where blood was around and bodies were present. "Shit he is not here..." She said as she went to the next area for the dog. She searched in the next area for the canibal dog... but he wasnt not in that area either. "Where is this damn thing?" she said running to the third location of dead bodies... she look in the area carefully for the animal. But the dog was still not there..she went to three different locations to find this animal. She decided to walk back to the square, maybe he was there...

Nope he was still not there, she gave up when it walked up to her... She glared at it and pulled her blade from its hilt... "You have delayed my training for the last time... I will end this." The dog ran off but Violet was fast and with a burst of speed she chases it off in the distance. She would place her blade in her hilt and form several mud clones... throwing the clones at the dog catching it. Her hair would rise with in tensity and she would throw the dog a good distance away in the area of the islands... "That will teach you to run..." she would turn to the hospital area for cleaning duty.* - Tue Oct 13 00:40:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) went to another area of destruction and acid decay. The acid mist was gone so it was just destruction. Violet went to her daily rounds of destroying the big stuff and reconstructing the small stuff. With the help of her clones she would move some of the debris around and sort them according to her plans. She had three options; either destroy it so it can be trashed or disposed of..., rebuild it so it can be quickly fixed and that wouls leave one less problem for the village or recycle it and send it to the be venter so they can use the material to rebuild buildings and such.

She would then go to the destruction pile and ready her fists...she decided against it and pulled out her blades and flowed through them. She would slash the trash and rubble in half struggling a bit but it worked out in the end. She would continue her sword rage and cut up all the rubble in the pile until cut pebbles remained... As for the rebuildable items she placed them in spot where they could fit in the ground, or at least make them fit, and run mud river from her would using her ninjutsu to fill the holes and such. Finally she would go and take the recycled trash and put it in the desginated area for the workers to use after telling them of course.She returned to the Mizukage and handed her the missions completed before returning back to the caravan after paying her way* - Tue Oct 13 01:16:48 2015
