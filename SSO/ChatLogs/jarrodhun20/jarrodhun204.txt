She would use one fluid moton and deflect all four and start rushing to the sergent of the Gezo... she would not hold back as he rushed him with kiling intent...

Then she would moniter the location Koji WAS at but felt that he was farther and had his full body on the ground... She assume he was defeated but she was still here even though she was blind...

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Violet was in the zone. It was a high ranking mission given by Lord Tethys that she planned to see through to the end. She would slowly make her way to the prison of Kiri and move to the jailed inmate section. She would gaze left and then right hearing nothing but whistles and terms she would haver want to hear as she walked with a guard escort to the desinated area. Violet would ignore the voices of the imates and aviod the grasps of them as she kept a hand on her blades at all times.

She would reread the mission in her hear to get an understanding of the mission. 'So I am to execute a prisoner on death row... sounds simple enough. I all I have to do id behead him and things would be fine,' she said as she made her way to the site. The preison looked at her with a crazed look, it was that of rape and murder... He would struggle wildly in the chains rubbinh his junk against the walls; it was akward but she didnt pay much attention to him until he tried to attack her. Th guards were precautius and they held him down and guarded her with her forces.

She quick drew her blade and aimed for his head... as she swung down his flailing stopped immediatly. She was glad it ended so fast but she didnt complain. She would walk back to the village square but not before swing her sword in the air to release the blood splatter from her blades. She would make it to the square and hand him the scroll signaling him to sign it and give her reward. She was one step closer to being a useful part of the higher ups of Kirigakure. Protecting them and providing support when ever she could.* - Thu Sep 17 03:49:20 2015
