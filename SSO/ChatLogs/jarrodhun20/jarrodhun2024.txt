<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) As soon as she got close Saeza she sheathed and unshethed causing a surge of chakra coming for her. She would try to use her reflexes to immedietely jump back away from the blast hoping she got off safe from it. Now Saeza had the momentum from the attack. <I cant use that move to help my blades... its too deadly.> she thought and Saeza charged. Violet chaged her blades with the same earth chakra as their blades clashed. The turned into a battle of strenght as she would try to force Saeza back using power.

<She is good... I need  her to teach me as much as she want to learn...> she thought.

If she was stronger Violet would foce her back and start to spin on her toes as she wanted to rush her wuth a barrage of attacks.* - Tue Oct 27 07:26:17 2015

This spar was going back and forth between the two kenjutsu swordwomen. One attack was countered by another with speed. Saeza was unnaturally strong for a little girl... but then again Violet was little to. She was 5 feet flat and trained her body to be slim and toned. As both of the women were about to clash on each other like tops Violet decided to try and repell the attack.

As she was spinning she wound quickly stop and move one of her blades in a cresent shape the range of the move was great and it would be effective even more now that Saeza was rushing toward her.  If the move was not successful Violet would cross her blades in a X Shape and try to block her flaming charge.* - Tue Oct 27 07:53:36 2015

She hated self training but it was a must sometimes... she pulled out both of her blades and gripped them in her hands. starts to do a series of attacks. She slashes foward with three quick strikes and jumps on the air... She then preformed two swift kicks in the air, spinning as she came down. She landed in a crouched position with both feet on the ground. 

She made a crater on the ground where she landed. It was a loud landing for her. She then unsheathed and unsheathed her blade. The shockwave from the  move was small and it rippled through the area. She would  study the effects of the move and use the tiger sign. She teleported to a space yards from her original position.

Then she would attempt a new technique, by applying her strength with her feet she would propell her self forward; then using the same method she would probell herself backwards. This was a way to provide a retreat option incase of any unexpected attack. She reeled back to look at the damage...  "Three craters... I miss Koeki..." she said as a sad sone sweept over her voice* - Wed Oct 28 16:20:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Yeah. - Thu Oct 29 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) would pull out her sword and get into a sword stance where she was in a crouched position.  She placed her hand on her hilt and focused. She was slient... she went the world around her. She put all of her strength in the her draw. With one swift motion she used the force around her and pulled her sword out and froze in place. 

The force of the slash sent a "air cutting" slash out and cut the waves of water. She looked as Saeza as she relaxed. "Basically its like the backdraft move but it is offensive" she stated. "It requires more strength than chakra but i dont really have the details... what do you think?" She said.* - Thu Oct 29 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Mm..Look at that Yuri goin on down there...-omit- - Thu Oct 29 06:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) would watch as Saeza explained... she nodded her head, "You know your smarter than you look. Its like you have been on this earth longer than you look. But I agree with you... I dont really use chakra like that but I I can see what you talking about." she said obseving her kenjutsu. "So let me see of I can immitate your progress." she said trying the move.

She would think about the technique she was trying to make. "The move requires chakra we know this now... and we know that it requires more than just chakra. It requires speed, strength, and a high skill with kenjutsu." She said flowing chakra through her blade. She thought about all the elements of the attack, the chakra flow for the strength and force behind it; and the speed behind it was with the skill she developed over time. 

"So its less like a force of your strength but more about the blast of chakra you want to produce," she said still in stance and unleashing the the slash forward. So the overall strength and ability if taijutsu will still be a factor correct? So the slash can cancel jutsu it targets.* - Thu Oct 29 07:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) //
"So the slash is just the trigger... its about the chakra; I should have know that its all about the chakra" she said smiling all the while working on the move with her new friend. "Well Im serious, we are both 16 but your may smarter than I am... where did you learn?"  she wondered with a questionable face. Violet wasnt a smart girl but she wasnt dumb either. She was a swordswoman at heart and mainly focused on her blade works.

"Well your really sweet for helping me with my technique and I promise to teach you as soon as I master it~" she said attempting to kiss her on her forehead. But I what I really need to do is work on a stance for my swords... I dont have a defined stance using both of my blades.  * - Thu Oct 29 07:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: You would do that for me - Thu Oct 29 07:34:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: What style do you use? - Thu Oct 29 07:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: It's called Santoryu.  - Thu Oct 29 07:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Where do you hold your third sword? - Thu Oct 29 07:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: In my mouth. I didn't use this form whilst sparring you originally because...Well I try not to show all of my ability all at once to strangers. - Thu Oct 29 07:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: I see...well im not a stranger anymore am I? - Thu Oct 29 07:41:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: So. D'ya want to finish working on the jutsu or d'ya want to start working on the sword style? - Thu Oct 29 07:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: The sword style - Thu Oct 29 07:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) watched the stance of Saeza, she was familiair with it... She used it before when sparing so she was familiar with it. "Oh, a simple stance like that? I have used it before... I guess I need to build off of this" she  said watching for any other changes she did if she mad any. 

"Sometimes I use a stance like this..." she said getting into stance. She narrowed her body frame. her left woot was in front and the right foot was on the back. "My back foot is used as a bursting foot to accerate forward," she explained. Her left blade was pointing diagonally forward at the opponent while the right was pointed to the right and diagonally faced. She was stand straight but leaning forward a little. "What do you think of this stance Sae?" she wondered* - Thu Oct 29 08:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Hmm..I really like it. The idea of using a propelling foot is really smart.  - Thu Oct 29 08:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Yea its another technique im trying to make that involves that method but this is all in the works...  - Thu Oct 29 08:19:12 2015
