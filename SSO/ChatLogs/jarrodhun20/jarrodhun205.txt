"I was born in a samurai settlement... her parents were decent enough... they were average... my mother was a house wife and my dad was a black smith. We made a living as it was good; I decided I wanted to be a samurai because I wanted to test my dads swords all the time. Eventually at the age of 10 I picked up my first sword and I began training... My dad lead me to a swordmaster and he taught me the way of the blade for three years. However also in those three years he was watching me... closely." she paused for a second as her tones changed to a slightly depressed one.. 

"He would have touched me every where while 'training' me and when I showered... when he actually tired to go further when I was 13; I cut his hand off and since he was the grand master of the village my family was expelled from the village. Then we moved in with another sword master... it was a woman; she said she would shelter us and we trusted her. We would stay and help her in her mansion with cleaning and repairs. We trusted her fully just like the black smith for three years as I continued to train under her household. But apperently I didnt have that much luck with living arrangements as she seduced my father and had sex with my mother... she was a black widow... She secertly killed my father and my mother in a course fo 3 years; I was unaware of this until my mother found out on her dead bed. She found out that the woman poisoned both of them and planned to groom me to be her sex slave. After she, my mom, died I escaped her mansion and fled to Kirigakure... I developed a shy personality that didnt trust men or woman... I fully relied on trust..." she would say getting up from the bath...
