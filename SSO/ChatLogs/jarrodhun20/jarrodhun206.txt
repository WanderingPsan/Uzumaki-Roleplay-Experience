<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: He could easily alter the winds around Kirigakure or even the battlefield, making it dangerous if not hazerdous to fly. - Sun Sep 20 02:03:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I have suggested this to both Niza and Koeki too. - Sun Sep 20 09:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Koeki is as child-play as this attempt to stand your grounds. - Sun Sep 20 09:38:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: The plan we worked out yesterday now can't and won't work. - Sun Sep 20 09:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: But how do you expect to get out, this is your problem. You suggest what we should do, but not the after thought of what happens  or how you'll accomplish it. Outside the most best of conditions. - Sun Sep 20 09:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Right now the best thing is to take advantage before their forces reach to surround here, and really make it impossible. - Sun Sep 20 09:43:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Either to persuade him or kill him. - Sun Sep 20 09:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: I gave him my thoughts on why his plan didn't work and suggest he think about it. - Sun Sep 20 09:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: And, all he said was throw lies at my face. That we're lower on man count. - Sun Sep 20 09:45:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: We should've acted sooner. And just done the plan Hassan, suggested. - Sun Sep 20 09:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: And why didn't you..? - Sun Sep 20 09:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Jin, We are lower on man power. - Sun Sep 20 09:46:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I am not a being of deception. I've seen their numbers compared to your own, you're out matched. Ushinawa, as he stated, matched his six-thousand with whatever was left with Kumogakure's forces. He then moved those troops to Amegakure. - Sun Sep 20 09:47:18 2015
