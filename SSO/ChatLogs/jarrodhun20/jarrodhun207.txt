<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: yeah - Tue Sep 22 00:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Any where is fine with me - Tue Sep 22 00:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, here is not the right place...So meet me at the waterfall, hm? - Tue Sep 22 00:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Ok... - Tue Sep 22 00:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Walked to the water fall getting ready for the spar* - Tue Sep 22 00:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...Good, you made it. - Tue Sep 22 00:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: My name is Yan by the way, I'm not sure if we have spoken much. - Tue Sep 22 00:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: I guess I will start? - Tue Sep 22 00:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: I will use my regular blades for this spar - Tue Sep 22 00:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) would get in her stance. She would crouch and place one foot forwar with her back foot as support.. She blasted off her back foot and aimed for a horizontal slash across the midsection with her blade fliped* - Tue Sep 22 01:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Would notice the water suddenly rush from his mouth and she would react as the water impacted her. Using the same tactic she did with hassan she jabbed her blade in the ground to prevent her from washing away. As she did this she would pull out her second blade and also jab it in the ground. This style was uses so the would stay in her location and prepare for her next attack.

If she was close enough the woman covered in water would aim to kick him in the chest...  if she wasnt she would stay with her blades on the ground and stand her ground as the water rushed at her.* - Tue Sep 22 01:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) As Yan summoned clones of hisself it was the same style he used against baen but she would not take it.. she assumed his plan... Violet picked her blades off the ground and went deep into a stance. She was correcting her mistakes.. she remembered Tethys training, watching her opponent and closing while staying alert. 

As would slowly walk up ready to burst into a sprint at any given moment...* - Tue Sep 22 01:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) was sure Yan was the middle person and the clones were present in her vision as she planned her strategy. She would avoid unnesseary battles by easily dodging the clone the clone only had at the move 50% of his strength so she out classes that easily. She moved faster then the clone so she would side step him and move to his side... She stayed on the move when she moved by the clone,.* - Tue Sep 22 01:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) was too fast for the clones but obsticles did slow her down but speed was something that she didnt lack... As she side stepped the clone, one clone shot a weak mud river at her. She was still moving so she with fly past the mud river when the another clone would come at her. She would deal with it quickly by cutting it cleanly in half vertcally, as the clone was now cut in she would fly past the clone and circle yan once again.

Yan was quick with handseals but lack in other areas so she went to expoit them.* - Tue Sep 22 02:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) As the preparation of Yan stopped his plan went into action, however as Yan was fast in terms of handseal speed Violet was fast in term of attack speed... She would still handicap herself to using her basic blades but she was now using them both at the same time. As the rumbling was felt she stopped her running and quickly spun in place with her swords cutting and destroying the spikes that were spawning on the ground, not dodging them. 

Strength of her blades were slightly augmented as she was using the momentum of the blades to keep her spin and completely escape the trap Yan had set. If he thought he Violet was a push over he was mistaken... when she took out the spike she was already expecting a counter attact from him and preped herself. * - Tue Sep 22 02:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) //Based on her attack speed Violet assumed she was destroying the spears faster than they were forming, especially since a clone with half if his power was doing the manipulation. She planned to tear through two sides of spears, giving her two points of escape. Why did she need two points of escape? Becasue Yan might plan to trap her therefore she would have an alternate route incase he blocked one way.

She was attacked each side with one of her sword hands and each of them were skilled as the other. When she crarved her path the would burst out of either side. Tethys always told her to stay on the move... so thats what she did... being stationary invites dead... As she burst out of her free side she watched her surrounds so she would not be caught off guard againt them* - Tue Sep 22 02:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) as the earth spikes stopped forming she was able to shoot out the side of the move that was free from the attack. Violet was of course showing signs of fatigue from running and attacking all day because its natural for a human to be tired during a spar. The odds of her escaping the jutsu in the first place was slim to none. 

Violet would opt to save her strength and take the blunt of the attack again. This, again, didnt push her as she would dig her swords in the ground... this prevented her from moving but it didnt leave her soaking wet and fatigued.

"Thats enough for now... Im tired and im going to bed... good spar" she said placing her bladed back in the sheathes and walked off to her home.* - Tue Sep 22 03:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You should go get checked on. Taking those two attacks head-on can't feel that great. - Tue Sep 22 03:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Im fine... I have a medic at home if I need one... - Tue Sep 22 03:26:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It's effective, that's for sure. - Tue Sep 22 03:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) stood there for a while as she would slowly gain her bearings... water presssure didnt show physical harm but because of the properties of water it cause some internal damage... probuly caused some compression in her organs and make it hard to breathe for a second...

She would look at both chuunin with a glance... As she was just a stronger than average swordsman with no use for ninjutsu she would mostly ignore his comment. 

"Some people are good at ranged combat... some are good with close combat... until you move up to the from a basic genin Im pretty sure I did better than most..." she said and paused for a second. "You choose your strategy depending on your skill level and your abilities; If this were a close range spar then things would have been much different but i dont dwell on that..." she finished as she sloy starys to walk away...

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) let her wrap her arm around her becasue she didnt mind being touched by her. Lera was the first person that talked and touched her when she came to the village so she trusted ehr with her life. She was suprised how confident Lera had become... she was not like this when they first met. 

"I guess that training with Hassan really did pay off?" she would smile at Lera* - Tue Sep 22 11:55:18 2015
