<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) spotted a pile of bodies on the other side of the hospital and decided what to do about the bodies. She thought for a second on what to do with the bodies and came to the only respectable conclusion. She used her blades to make a number of graves simliar to the number of bodies there were found by her and carried each body to the location of a grave. Her clones would help her and move the others to their graves. Violet and her clones would be caring two bodies each and taking their time to dig the graves for the people they carried.* - Wed Oct 14 08:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well. . . - Wed Oct 14 13:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20)  finished up all the bodies and went to follow the rest of of the clean up effort. This was still the area of the hospital and she cleaned up most of the damage so she went around the area to check for anymore things to fix in the area. She, along with her three clones, would start a beautification process with the trees in the area. Violet would begin to look through the area to any trees if the were still up. All the trees in the area were destroyed so she would up the tree that were there hoping they would find leaves or seeds to use to replant them.

However, they produced no plants so she would have to try again later. Violet moved to up root the rest of the trees while her clones continued to clean the rest of the area. She took all the stumps on the area and went to hack them up in small pieces. She drew her sword and used her strength to slice and dice them to rivets. She was getting alot better with her sword and training her body in the process so it was a plus side to cleaning up the area.* - Wed Oct 14 15:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Lera can we continue that jutsu training? - Wed Oct 14 16:09:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: I want to start withthe one you first taught me... the earth one? - Wed Oct 14 16:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right. - Wed Oct 14 16:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) would follow in her foot steps, she formed the handseals slamming her hands on the ground and forcing chakra in the same fashion she did. The earth however didnt move. Now she was a natural when it came to the element of earth... she even mastered some earth techniques. But as she was mainly a swords man she typically used the jutsu to make herself better and have trump cards to play. She was happy Lera was teaching her to not stick to one jutsu... Lera mastered several elements and she was strong.

She tried again, forming the hand seals and moulding her chakra with each hand seal set. After molding her chakra she would slam her palms on the ground, injecting the moulded chakra into the ground where four pointed pillers would slowly come from underground and impact each other in front of her. "I guess I can suprise someone with this if they expect me to only use my swords." she said looking at Lera... "Thank you for teaching me..." she smiled* - Wed Oct 14 16:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Any time. - Wed Oct 14 16:28:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) // "Oh, this one looks very useful... If I can slow ones reaction time even my a little I can strike without reprocussions!" she said as she would focus lightning around her body concentrating it in her body first, swelling her chakra until she built up enough friction of her cells to let it out. She then exhaled with a sigh slowly as she attempts to push out all the lightning built up on her system to the area around her. Small sparks of lighting would slowly form around her in a random fashion... She would look at them until they vanished. "I wonder is there a technique I can learn where I can have  this always on"* - Wed Oct 14 16:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ..Its possible. I can do that with Fire, so why not Lightning? - Wed Oct 14 16:50:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm. Do you want to learn genjutsu as well? Or are we going to stp there. - Wed Oct 14 16:56:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm...do you want to learn genjutsu? I don't mind if you don't - Wed Oct 14 17:01:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right. We'll start with that then. - Wed Oct 14 17:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) was put under the genjutsu as Violet watched her eyes,  the area around her became a mistly fog as multiple versions of herself. She would concentrate on her handseal she made and focused her chakra. She closed her eyes when she used the the jutsu it didnt work. She opened her eyes to see the genjutsu was still active, "I guess im not strong enough to use it?" she though in her head..."No I will get this! for Lera!" she thought.

She would try again, focusing her chakra all into one hand seal tryign to break the genjutsu. Odds where high that Lera was smarter than her naturally but Violet was not a stupid person. She knew it was a genjutsu as she was told of it  prior. She concentrated harder on her hand seal to release the genjutsu. She kept her eyes open this time to make sure that the illustion would dissapear. The area slowly started to clear as the flow of her chakra stopped in her body and restarted itsself. "I did it! Good one Violet... thanks again Lera... your such a good teacher." she smiled.* - Wed Oct 14 17:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thankyou. - Wed Oct 14 17:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) turned to grasp her tightly in a hug. She slowly pullher apart and grasped her hands and stare into her eyes, "Im greatful for all your love and support. I thank you for teaching me and being with me in my times of need. Takign care of me, helping me train... you didnt have to do any of that but you do anyway and I love you deeply for it..." She said in her soft tender voice.* - Wed Oct 14 17:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) blushed as she felt like Setsuna would want her to love again... She regreted her actions every day that she lasted seen her. She promised to never leave angry and showed love to the people she loved. She felt the gentle touch of Lera and closed her eyes waiting for the kiss to be planted...* - Wed Oct 14 17:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20)  felt close to Lera, she felt that Lera was showing all her emotions through this kiss and she relpied. Violet closed in on her and their bodies pressed against each other. As she heard a moan slip out a tingle went down her spine... it was passion... she felt her love, her pain, her passion all in this kiss. Violet return the affecting placing her hands on the small of her back and her waist. Slowly moving her head around, she slowly slipped her tongue between her lips attempting to penetrate it and catch Lera's tongue.

Anyone watching would notice a passinate moment between the two  * - Wed Oct 14 18:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) was in the moment... she always was... this was the only happiness she had between the bodies and the rubble surrounding them. When she was pushed away she realized that Lera wasnt comfortable with just actions as she was so she simmered down. She was held tight as she felt Lera's body trembling... She whispered in her ear "Are you ok?"* - Wed Oct 14 18:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah....yeah I'm fine. Better than fine actually...just had to...stop myself. - Wed Oct 14 18:28:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) smiled and giggled at her expression;  "You would be suprised at what I will do for you..." she said tying her hair in a ponytail... "I  guess I should clean up some more then..."* - Wed Oct 14 18:43:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) was alittle shocked but she felt safe as long as she was with Lera. She felt a strange sensation goign through her as she flew... she didnt let it show however* - Wed Oct 14 18:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Noted she had been here once with the boy Lera was helping. She came inside and helped him learn to cook. But the place was different now, like she renovated and added alot more things. "Looks like you added more to the place... " she said placing her swords on the wall on the side of the door. She walked around and twirled getting an eye fill of her place.* - Wed Oct 14 19:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) turned around once more look at Lera. "Hey do y-" she froze as she Lera seemed to grow lustful by her previous actions... Seeing Lera in her natural beauty made her tingle as she would sloly remove her cloths and walk towards her... "My, My, someone really wants a taste..." she said with soft sexual tone carressing Lera on her sides of her torso. Violet was a teaser and not much could be done with her strength was taken into play but she only used it on occastion.

Violet eyes her body in lust noticing all her features. "And what is this Lera?"  she said touch the mark slowly and puttign pressure in it. At  this moment both of her hand were occupied* - Wed Oct 14 19:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) would pause for a second and think "So she has it???" she said in her mind... She would ignore it for now... She enjoyed their moment for now. As she started nibbling on her neck Violet let out a moan. It was a great feeling; her toung dancing on her erotic zone as her teeth just enhanced it. Violet would then dig her nails into Lera ever so slightly and drag them up and down her sides and throwing her head back and lettign Lera have her way.* - Wed Oct 14 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) kissing turned to touching... touching turned to hugging... hugging turned into sexual lust and adventure as the two shared a night of passion and love together. They both loved their previous lovers but as the time moved forward the two SSoM weilders would fall in love with each other maybe. 
 
<Blackscreen game too strong>

After they finished Violet would kiss Lera and slowly get up. "Where is your shower sweetie." she said if Lera was asleep* - Wed Oct 14 19:48:16 2015
