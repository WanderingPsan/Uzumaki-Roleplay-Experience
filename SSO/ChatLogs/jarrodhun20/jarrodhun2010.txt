This generations weilder was Violet De La Cruze; she made a promise to the late and great Lord Tethys that she would master these blades and thats what she set out to do. Her first goal was to unlock the ablility to use the lightning element and whats what she achieved. Her next phase was to practice their usage and get better skilled with them.

She would pull the blades from her back and hold them out, the blades surged with lightining when she gripped them. She would jump in the air and and preform several spinning slashs in the air. As she spun in the air lightining would crackle in the air as the lightning would shoot out of the blade. She would flow two chakra forms in her blade; one for the chakra flow of earth and the other form the flow of lightning that enhanced the power coming from the blade. As she landed she would land on her toes and beginning to slash one sword after another in a fury of sword movements.* - Mon Sep 28 18:29:45 2015

As he stopped for a moment she watched Kirie slowly come on the mountain and Setsuko look her up and down.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) would form a a hand seal and summon forth a mud clone..."Excuse me.. can you please move away fromthe crater... it is currently under construction" she said about to fix it. She would spit the mud from her mouth and onto the crater. The crater was huge so it would take time and alot of clones and chakra to fill it. She restedfor a bit to gain more chakra to from the hand seals again and spit more mud out of her mouth to make another mud clone to go into the crater and fill it. Violet was exhausted from expending so much chakra but if she wanted to train her chakra control and her jutsu this was the only way to do it.

She then switched jutsu and spewed more mud from her mouth more mud to the crater via another jutsu. She would stop for a moment and say "My Lady, cause alot of damage to the village very easily; but if it wasnt for you I wouldnt have to train so hard so I thank you for that." She rested once again and restored her chakra for the third time as she spewed more and more earth natured chakra from her body to the crater... Finally it looked like it was finally starting to fill up. She would rest once more and once again slew mud clone and mud river based jutsu into the crater.

Her cycle consisted of resting and draining her chakra fully to master her jutsu and fill the crater that was almost filled. She was starting to sweat alot and get dizzy from extreme chakra usage and it was draining. She would funally fill the whole full of mud; the crater looked like a mud bath and it was so relaxing but she had a job to do... Maybe she could ask Koeki to make a mud spa or hot string eventually... She shook off her thoughts and walked to the mud pull slowly. She placed her hand on the top layer of the mud pool and she poured her chakra into the pool and the pool instantly hardened to fix the floor... "There now all there is left to do is paint it..." she said panting heavily and dropping to the floor exhausted but awake.* - Wed Sep 30 04:13:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hey, Vi...do you fancy a spar? - Wed Sep 30 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: I would love to - Wed Sep 30 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright~ - Wed Sep 30 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You can have the first move. - Wed Sep 30 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) It had been a while since Violet sparred against Lera, she was eager to see her progress as a shinobi. Violet would pull her blades out wielding both of them and sprint towards her keeping light on her feet and dodging if she needed. She would dash with her blades spread out at her sides and drifting to her right to attack her on her right side. 

When she got close she would attempt a double sword attack to her side using the back side of the blades. If she hit she would continue to rush her with more sword strikes to the body...* - Wed Sep 30 05:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) would encounter four clones between her and her friend. Using her immense strength she would swiftly and strongly cut through the four shadow clones on her way. She couldnt speed past them as she would get slowed down and end up caught up in what ever Lera playing.

Clone one: She would provide one quick diagonal slash across the chest, hoping to destroy it.

Clone two: She would duck down and stab it deep in the stomach, hoping to destroy it.

Clone three: She would spin and sweep kick it hoping to keep it airbourne, while it was airbourne she would kick it square in the middle of its body hoping it would hit and dispell clone four.

Clone four: would get hit by a flying clone three and hopefully dispell.

If any of this failed then she would try to block and evade... if it suceeded then she would be on her way to Lera * - Wed Sep 30 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Work it Violet , twerk it Lera..-omit- - Wed Sep 30 05:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) //As she was already moving toward her she never stopped attacking, when she finished the last of the clones huge mud balls were hurdling toward her. She used her reflexes to bring her swords up and harden them with earth chakra increasing their durability to the max. She would swing her blades to attack the mud balls but she force of the balls would push her back as she started to square one.

"Its just like Yan... I can never get clone to people who can clone themselves... I need to think" she said panting from exhaustion... She was good for short bursts as she was just a low skill rank but she tried her best to overcome this challange. She would try again and rush at her but this time she would zig zag and try to avoid any projectiles* - Wed Sep 30 05:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) would not go underground... it was a waste of chakra to her as she could porbuly last longer without using chakra. She would pull out her Kiba blades that she was training with and use those to escape out of the earth dome. She would firmly grip the blades and surge lightining in them. The lightning would spark throughout the blade and with several quick strikes she would destroy the earth dome with ease... 

As the Earth dome shattered Violet would look around for Lera... if she could find her she would look give chase, but if she couldnt find her then she would stay on her guard with the lighting embedded kiba blades in her hands. The surged with lightning every now and again.* - Wed Sep 30 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) was reflexive but not reflexive enough to blok or weave the several wind blasts coming toward her... She crossed her blades braced for impact, the wind blast would hit the swords and push her back to the wall. Each blast sen her reeling back to the wall behind her until she impacted it... A thud was made as she groaned in pain; she panted heavily as she was let again losing to ranged fighters... 

"At this range I will never beat Baen or Erebus... I have to .... get faster..." she muttered as she sank her sword into the ground using it as a crutch. Her left eye was closed and she was panting hard looking at Lera... "Im... not... yet..." she woman said clearly exhausted* - Wed Sep 30 06:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm, not unless y' see fit...Then Yeah I'd accept.. - Wed Sep 30 06:51:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Slowly took the scroll, "T-Thanks..." she said. she leaned on Lera... "You, still beat me... I need to get faster..." she said struggling* - Wed Sep 30 06:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Yes... sir... I have slowly begin to unlock the secrets behind them... - Wed Sep 30 06:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: What are they...? I've seen a couple of strange swords like that. - Wed Sep 30 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Good..Good, and I see you getting used to them by the day, don't let anyone get those blades. - Wed Sep 30 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: I wont but the previous owner comes by every now and again so i hide them - Wed Sep 30 07:00:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Learning Fuuinjutsu is quite difficult. - Wed Sep 30 07:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I could teach you how to, but it'll only distract you. - Wed Sep 30 07:01:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: What do you have in mind? No... I know Tethys and Noriko knew it but I have no knowledge of funnjutsu - Wed Sep 30 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: If you can learn the basics, then It will allow you to hide them in these two seals..Hold out your hands. - Wed Sep 30 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Unsealing weapons from a scroll can sometimes end up in that person losing that scroll. So Bodily seals have always been safe. - Wed Sep 30 07:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Tethys had body seals, I remember him pullign the swords from his body - Wed Sep 30 07:17:20 2015
