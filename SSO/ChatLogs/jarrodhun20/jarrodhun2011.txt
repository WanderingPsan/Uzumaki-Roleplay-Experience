She focused her chakra in her hands and flowed it through her sword, swords looked normal but it was harder then normal. "Feel it... feel the difference between these two blades... Once with chakra flow one without"

After she felt them she would say "Now you try, I will give you three attempts"* - Fri Oct  2 21:25:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) As mist flooded the area Violet would form several hand seals and melt underground in the mountain. "Who is this person and why are they doing this?" she thought to herself. As she went underground she would move the person she sensed that was away from the rest of them and swim to their location. Since she could sense the magnetic location of the target. While the clones missed her and the mist didnt deter her at all* - Fri Oct  2 23:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) As the target moved she could no longer sense him... the odds are he was on the water now... this was perfect... because now she knew where he was. She resurfaced from the mountain and dashed as fast as she could to the anbu agent. She quickly pulled her blades from her sheaths and aimed for the head of the agent... she watched his figure making sure she would contact him with her fast attacks.

If anything was in her way she would rip through it with ease with  her strength... The figure was trying to rip a life away from her and she would be damned if she let it happen. She would aim four strikes, 2 with each hand, at the target aiming to dismember or decapitatate him* - Fri Oct  2 23:40:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) //Violet knew the trick to this jutsu... Tethys used it all the time and she saw him counter it. Chakra would flow to her feet and she would be free of the sticky syrup, she would have no location of him and no location. For a split second as all the she would do was help her out. She quicktly forced her sword into the ground and throw Setsuko off the water fall..."Use suimen to get free!" she yelled before she dived back under ground and appeared at the bottom of the water fall.

Her plan would be just to escape as she had to get away from the water source* - Sat Oct  3 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: Give me the blades... - Sat Oct  3 00:26:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Violet didnt say a word to the user that was attacking them. She grew angry she was stuck in the sticky syrup in the thick mist where she didnt have good hearing to pin point where he was... She would break out of the syrup by forcing chakra to her feet to break free from the hold. She, however, couldnt have Setsuko from her entrapment. All she could do was force her body down on the syrup so prevent the girl from futher injury. for Violet how ever she would burst through the mist trying to escape the water source. If any clones were on her way she would burst through them and race to the side of mountain. * - Sat Oct  3 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) //As she saw a fire ball go for Setsuko she quickly formed her hand seals and formed handseals required to make a earth shadow clone... she would throw the shadow clone at the spawn of the fireball and hope to catch the person shooting it. If the clone caught the opponent then the clone would turn into mud and capture him on the wall. If the clone misses it would try to grab the wall and attempt to spew a mud river at the shadowy figure in the mist. All the while Violet would run along the mountain using suimen and get out of the mist yet again. hiding from the fire and water user.

Hopefully the fire blast would cover her plan sound wise... and she could catch him off guard since he didnt know where she was and he was occupied with the front area.* - Sat Oct  3 03:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) OK, so When I broke out, i ran to try to get out of the mist, but becasue i new i couldnt leave the mountain yet. so while i was on the mountain i ran to where i was one rp away from leaving the mountain but im still aware of the battle. iM not trying to leave the girl there to die; i want to avenge her... so when got as far as i could run i turned around to contine fighting... i dont want to hoe a villager and leave them to die* - Sat Oct  3 03:10:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Her actions were stopped as she was intercepted... the clones had a good idea where she was but she was quicker. Using her reflexes she dropped to the ground and rolled out of the way of the colliding water. She hoped that Kirie went to get help as Violet was in danger. The water collided over her as she saw him again... the faint image of the man attacking her. When the water clashed she got up and ran to jump out of the mist. The would run down the mountain to find her kage... "Koeki! Im under attack!" she screamed as she needed to get away from the water if she wanted to beat him.* - Sat Oct  3 03:56:22 2015
