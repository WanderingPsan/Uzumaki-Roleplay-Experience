<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) //"Damn, its back..." she thought getting angry and jetting off to the location of the attacks... "Everyone here... take cover... hide... get out of the village..." I will deal with this threat the best way I can... Take to Amegakure its the closest village."  she said this point ot the village location. "Stay safe." she would jet off in a blur to find the threat* - Wed Nov  4 00:46:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) would speed to the location and see an attack being done... It was Ortho... he was the cause of all of this...he had something to do with the disruption of peace. She would yell, "Why are you doing this? I thought you were supposed to take care of my daughter... why are you attackingthis village?" she was angry asshe placed her hands together.

She would form several clones made from the earth around her and make the mud clones use the mud river technique to push away the bandits in a wide range. "What was all that you were talking abouta while ago? Your being quite the hypocrite..." she said hoping her move would go off. But thats not the only thing she sensed. She heard the someone in the trees she kept an tab on their location. But her main focus is on the army and snake.* - Wed Nov  4 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: Ok Violet... ready to take out a giant snake? - Wed Nov  4 01:26:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tit Kubo(Tsundere-san) says: -omit- - Wed Nov  4 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) as her clones supplies the mud walls the were all blocked by a earth domethat she was aware of. <I guess time to use them now...> she said. She would pull out and reveal her blades that were passed down to her from her Lord Tethys... Her earth clones would all dive under ground and swim toward Tethys to help Elon... Violet on the other hand would personally deal with this giant snake. 

With her koba blades in her hands she would surge chakra into them and with amazing skill she could cut the dome to rivets. <I will not fail you my lord... I will not let you down my lady.. Your sacrifices will not be in vain!.> she thought as one slash of the dome would be seen from the Snake. "This is for is for Lady Noriko..." another deep cut would be seen... "This is for Lady Koeki..." another slash would be seen... "This is for Lady Kirie" another slash was made as it the dome was starting to crumble. 

"And this is for Lord Tethys!" as she made the final slash the dome pieces were sliing off the top to reveal a Swordswoman who hand lighting corcing through her blades in her hands. She would point her blade toward the snake while the battle ensured around the village, "My name is Violet De La Cruze and I will defeat you in the name of my fallan Lords and Ladies of this Land!" she exclaimed.

Now this was if the snake was smart enough to sense the danger coming from the closed dome. If not then the Snake would surely be cut down while he was falling on her because she would cut the dome and snake as it fell on her.

The 3 clones would be heading toward Tethys from the dome location.* - Wed Nov  4 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: so your trying to take away the clow through my blades? - Wed Nov  4 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) As all her moves were ineffective... she was facing a falling giant snake and two wind moves coming toward her. The wind moves would both his her back to back and the snake would come crashing down but not without a fight... She was outnumbered but she was a stupid gutsy bitch. She would catch herself hearing the wind coming for her blades. Matching her attack speed with his jutsu speed she would slam her right blade in the ground to brace her self from the wind attack. When the second wind move came she was already braced so it didnt knock her off balance... But as the the snake came down shortly after she hand one freehand.

She would swing her blade in a wide arcing cresent wave that aimed to slice the snake in half. With her strength and attack speed it should have been successful. The snake couldnt stop itsself mid air so it would not be able to dodge such a move. If that worked she would probuly be covered in snake guts. And then she would hide behind the body of the snake if Orthro would attack afterwards.* - Wed Nov  4 02:53:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) As Madara breakes underground missing her attack Violet completely ignores Orthro and with out a delay follows him under ground via mole jutsu. She heard him as well as Madara hearing him so as soon as he moved she wouls follow suit. While he was underground she would swim underground away from Ortho and his onslaught. Being she was undersground she felt all of Ortho's actions and want no part in it. 

She was fast and she could escape him. She would retreat for now as she was betting tired... <I can hold out anymore... I cant do this on my own... I need to retreat for now.>

One woman couldnt take out a army... not yet at least... She planned to leave Kiregakure for now as it was not safe* - Wed Nov  4 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: That Snake is fast... I need to get faster - Wed Nov  4 03:33:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: So it's already begun, huh? - Wed Nov  4 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) As she went underground she tried to follow the snake but she was impaled by a earth spike through her chest... mostly likely she was hit in thet heart and she was an a slow path to death... At the end of her life she felt like she let everyone down... the Lords and the Ladies of her land would turn in their grave to see what she had become. In the end her dreams didnt come true... they would always be a memory... As for the legendary blades... they would fall with her... diving deeper and deeper underground. She would reflect back on her life. She apologized to Noriko, Kirie, Koeki, but most importantly Lord Tethys...

She could not carry his will and her lifeless drifting body sheaedd tears... they would continue to flow as she feel to the earth core with her blades in her hands... She would never see her family again... Lera would be lost and heart broken as well as Nina... She would never forgive the man known as Ortho as the man that was supposed to take care of her daughter killed her without remorse. 

But thats how the shinobi world works, you have to puryour life on the life to try and do whats right. As she neared the bedrock of the earth her tears still fell as she cluched all the dreams she ever had in her hands...* - Wed Nov  4 04:12:35 2015
