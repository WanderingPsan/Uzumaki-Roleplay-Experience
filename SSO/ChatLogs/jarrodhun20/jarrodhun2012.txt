When she say the fast child she didnt see him as a child, she saw him as a shinobi and only a shinobi. As soon as he stopped to punch she would reflexively grab his hand and throw him at the wall. She normally wasnt a hand to hand fighter but as a kenjustu specalist you pick up natural tai skill. If she succeeded she would face the direction he was thrown and try out her new jutsu...

If he dodged the grab she would attempt to kick him a good distance away. If he reverse grabbed her she would use her other hand to punch him in the gut. She had to cover all bases.* - Sun Oct  4 19:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Would channel her chakra and dip underground avoiding the fire that was coming from her. She swam from her position to Anguo and would appear behind him. she would come up from under ground as she was just as fast... if not faster... then the boy and she would aim to kick in his side without causing serious injury.

If he would dodge she woud connect another hit with him ising her right fist simply punching him in the head. * - Sun Oct  4 19:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) As he escaped again she couldnt help but be impressed by him and his speedm he was very knowledgeable for a kid. He must have alot of experience, she would prepare her jutsu for him . She preformed a few hand seals and charged chakra in her hands, inside them a small ball of lightining would form in her hands. She would shoot the ball at the boy, if it hit she would run after him pulling her blade Radient-Phoenix. * - Sun Oct  4 19:54:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) //Violet didnt like this long range combatents... it annoyed her to know end. He disappeared again and shoot a huge fire ball at her. As she fire ball approached  her, she would form a hand seal summoning two mud clones in front of her. She would use the clones as shields to block the blunt of the attack and braced herself from the rest of the attack; crossing her arms in an x formation feeling the fire impact her and burn her arms* - Sun Oct  4 20:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) as she placed her arms at the sides as she shook off the burning senstation as her adreniline was pumping. The speedy child would run to and around her forming two clones, but thats where he messed up... The mud clones that were splattered from the previous his attack would refrom and encase both clones he summoned. Whether that would be possible or not didnt matter however becasue violet would pull out her swords and flips them to protect the boy. 

Violet would duck down and fan her blades out spinning on her toes and attacking everyone one tile out of her. Hopefully she was faster in her actions to prevent her defeat in close range  because that would demorilize her.* - Sun Oct  4 20:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) As she thought her clones were useless they were frozen in place and shattered... Violet's omni directional spin attack worked and it contacted him. She used the narrow part of her blade so minor cutting was possible...

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) Would smile and pick the boy holding him from his waist and carrying him to the bench where she would preform basic first aid. "Its ok, we all get hurt. But I will reward you for your bravery." She said kissing him on the cheek. As she set him on her lap she would gently remove his hands use a bottle of water to clean the wound and tear a piece of cloth from a shirt she had in her bag.

She mainly focused on the techniques she would actually use but every move would be trained. She goes down her list in her mind as she wouls focus on mole and flow first... Shushin would be next for she has plans for it. Then every other move was last in no patricular order.

She would start practice by enfusing both of her blades with chakra, concentrating and maitraining the flow. Keeping it firm and steady coating the entire blade. Sparks would emit from the blades as she would slice throught the air. She went back to her original position. then she went for a different move.

Flowing the chakra to her body she would increase her metabolic rate and use extremely high speed movement to appear a good distance away from her original position. This move was simple but she loved it. It would take a while to master but it would help her get alot closer to those pestky annoing ninjutsu users. She would continue to vainish from place to place but the cost was great... he would pass out from the over use from it and restt forcibly for a while.* - Tue Oct  6 13:44:44 2015
