This village... with its hopes and dreams that always gets trampled on... The village that I love.  This village who continues to struggle... Is it dying is it being reborn? Who knows... All I know is that im tired of waiting... I will stay in this village untill it turns into sand in the ground." she said with resolve to never leave the village again. 

She had no reason to leave... she had to find a way to repay the village for all that it has done for her* - Tue Nov  3 08:57:10 2015

"I no its not your fault." she said as Nina ran away... "Please stay with me... dont run... I need you Nina... you and Lera." she yelled. She had no idea if her words would reach her but she did know Nina didnt have a attachment to Kiriagakure like Violet did and she didnt want to make her stay.

She looked at Marco... "Your right and I plan to help this place rise from the ashes like the era of Noriko Hogo... I will make this place great... even if I have to become a Gezo Field Commander like Lord Hassan" she said with dreams* - Tue Nov  3 09:07:24 2015
