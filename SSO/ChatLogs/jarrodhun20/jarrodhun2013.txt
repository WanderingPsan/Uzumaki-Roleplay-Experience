She would attempt to hold Kirie as she comfort her like Lera held her when she needed it. "I will help rebuild with you... I love the fact that you doing this... It reminds me that Koeki is still here..." she said sheading a tear and wipping Kirie's.

She stared to use her strength and speed to start to fix the courtyard first. She lifted boulders and tossed them based on Kirie's pattern... "Is this how they go?"  she asked before continuing...

<br><br><font color=yellow>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) she hesitated for a moment, she lost her pride as a swordswoman... all she did was run... she let fear conquer her emotions... She was supposed to be a unwaivering samuri but she lose her resolve... "I-I dont fear anything..." she said  shuttering and moving back wards with every word she spoke. The faces of immovable forces have made her lose the will she once had. 

She used to be bold in the face of opposition, Baen, Erebus, the late Zetsumo...  but the lost of her love ones damaged her. The death of Setsuki, the death of Koeki, the death of Tethys... it warped her sense of resolve and weakened her.* - Fri Oct  9 04:04:54 2015
