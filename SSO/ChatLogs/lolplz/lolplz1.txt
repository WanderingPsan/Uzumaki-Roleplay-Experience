<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumo(Lolplz) ||It was unfortunate. While incarcerated, he didn't exactly have access to the Iron Sand that made his prowess so fierced in the first place. But even then, he still had usage of those two basic-tier elements, Doton and Lightning. 

Using his advanced magnetizing ability, more of the steel that had utilized to keep him bold is being ripped apart. "I'll need time to convert this to 'sand particles'. . .In the meantime, I'll using it in this stage to stab throguh my opponent. . ." As they take form, he shoots more projectiles out -- six in total. Three for Mirai, three for Sanoke. None were actually intending on landing, but just to serve as a distraction.

From the cloud of smoke, Tetsumo had emerged, this time with a bit of pep to his step. His hand is cladded in electricity, and he beelines right towards the turtle sage, deeming him the weaker of the two considering the weighted shell. Swiftly, Tetsumo swipes, hoping to electrocute.

Meanwhile, the poisonous smog still lingers, but is on the fringe of clearing up completely.

* - Mon Oct  5 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumo(Lolplz) says: <*Mirai's Byakugan would likely' pick up on something.*> - Mon Oct  5 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumo(Lolplz) ||The second Sanoke had moved to strike the criminal, something terrible happened.

Yep . . It was a clone! Raiton Kage Bunshin, to be more specific. On impact with the Tanto, the bunshin combusted, releasing a mass of cackling electricity into the area, no doubt sending Sanoke's body convulsing and being overwhelmed with the plasma energy. Assuming he's stunned? The crooked Magnetic Release user sends a single nail, this one aiming to slam and piece right through Sanoke's thigh.

Meanwhile, had Mirai continued to rush over to help with the assault, she too would be electrocuted. Although. . . The chances of her running after the electricity ran off was likely not high, assuming the Hokuma isn't a complete idiot. 

". . .Hah! He fell for it. . " By then, the poison had completely dissipated, revealing the true Tetsumo standing in the back, his hands pressed against the ground -- which was almost entirely made up of metal flooring. The metal was being reduced into a grainy state, to make his style of combat accessible. It was a style that greatly mimicked usual sand manipulators, such as Kronos or even Tetsumo -- both distant relatives.

A coy smile is worn all the while. * - Mon Oct  5 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumo(Lolplz) thinks: Should be careful from this point. . Took a good chunk of my chakra.. - Mon Oct  5 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumo(Lolplz) thinks: Need to make this quick too. . .I give it a little while longer before guards are coming in to check the commotion. . Should have a hostage before then. - Mon Oct  5 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) thinks: Oh my god was that a clone? - Mon Oct  5 06:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) thinks: Changing my name to Briney. - Mon Oct  5 06:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) thinks: Britney* - Mon Oct  5 06:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumo(Lolplz) smirked. The hesistation is precisely what he wanted. His hands continued to release chakra, reducing the metal ground into a dust like state. As time wore on, the shinobi was enabled to produce a sizeable composition of material, enough to mimic accurately having his gourd. With no time wasted at all, Tetsumo showcases the true extent of his power -- manipulating the dust particles just as it were sand. 

"Oh. . .This is just freaking dandy. . I suppose, I'll start with the pretty one. Women do often make for better hostages. . .Society cherishes them so much . . ." the rogue states with a sick grin, licking his lips, and staring onto Mirai as she were a piece of meet. WIth a simple had gesture, a gathering of iron-sand particles rush ahead, fully with the intent on capturing one of the girl's limbs, hopefully the leg.* - Mon Oct  5 06:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumo(Lolplz) wore a grin. The explosions hit their marks. The iron sand onslaught is momentarily disrupted, likewise, Tetsumo has to quickly move. 

The kunai that had been aimed his way misses, yet the brunt of the explosiove manages to catch him offguard. "Tch. . .This one is like deers in the headlights. The white-haired one will be trouble. . But the girl, she's -mine-. . .!" Tetsumo's hand again flicks, sending another stream of iron sand. It's a higher quantity, considering he no longer kept a little bit of sand by his person to serve as defense.

Once more, he's aiming to capture Mirai, although keeps tags on Sanoke as well. With a grin on his face, the wall of sand-like particles continue ahead, hoping to make short work of the presumably inexperienced shinobi. 

"You shouldn't take. . . rookies on missions like this, you know. She isn't a real shinobi yet. . Although, I doubt she'll ever be. I can tell just by looking, she belongs in the kitchen, mooching off some pig of a man. . Mmm, like you," Tetsumo taunts admist the assault.* - Mon Oct  5 07:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumo(Lolplz) was unable to see Mirai in her retreat. Regardless, he continued with the random assaults. His iron grains were shaped into bullet-like spheres, and sent rocketing through the skies, many of which ramming right into the Mist Servants. Considering the nature of the technique, this does no good, and simply spawns more bunshins much to Tetsumo's dismay.

Regardless, the wide-spread technique does it's job, and that;s to attack at random. It remained to be seen, would Sanoke and those annoying clans finally be put to rest?

". . C'mon, turtle man. Hiding behind. . . freaking clones?! Figght me like a man!" grunted Tetsumo, he was getting tired of these childish games, while Sanoke was likely just getting started. The criminal remained wary, unsure of whether to advance forward, lest there be traps.* - Mon Oct  5 07:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumo(Lolplz) is caught admist the surprise explosion. Considering the clones spawned before, he's never able to actually notice what's actually coming his way. Thus, the male is reduced to a burned mess, and subsequently expires.* - Mon Oct  5 07:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gulab Jamun(Lolplz) ||
And it was time for action.

Wasting little time, the creature moved through the rubble, his gelatin-like body allowing for more discreet movement admist Kumogakure's damaged infrastructure.

In time, the Gulab Jamun -- which was essentially a giant, jelly-like tentacle monster was upon the designated area. At his side was a turtle-like creature, a Kappa if you will. Speedily, it makes it's approach, and sends four tendils stabbing into the ground. With no time going by at all, the dirt is uprooted, giving it access to two bodies. . .

One of the esteemed Raikage. . . While the other was from a familiar face, Kojiro. THey're dead frames are tossed right into the creature's slimey maw, and literally ingested. Now, as they're held in suspension, the two demonic creatures make an escape, ready to drop off the bodies to the proper location.* - Sat Oct 10 01:22:20 2015

In come the Sunakgaure calvary!

About a mile away, the bandit camp existed. There were a relatively small number of deliquents, each seeking to take advantage of Sunagakure's relatively chaotic state. The numbering? Three.

However, they're well aware of the incoming troops an d seek to make things a bit interesting.

As Paine and her cronies begin to move about the area, a gust is developed, kicking up sand spawning a psuedo-sand storm. In addition, chakra is laced along the region, inducing an all too familiar genjutsu -- the Sly Mind method. In the current conditions, the illusionary technique certainly ran the risk of confusing the targets -- was any in the group capable of seeing through the genjutsu and distractions?* - Thu Nov 26 23:26:17 2015

They weren;t even close.

In Paine's apparent approach, she'd likely figure this to be nothing more than a simple mirage spawned by the desert's unrelenting heat. Indeed, it seemed that none of the shinobi possessed the intellect or analyical ability to read through the clear illusion.

Thus. . . Time winded on, forcing them to routinely move in a circular motion, never actually getting closer to the desired target. It was a perfect ploy, meant to exhaust the shinobi of their needed attribute -- stamina, and thus make for an easier target to pick apart.

How long would it take for them to figure it out? 

Turns out, just below thirty minutes. Naturally, the crooks are little less than pleased, but the storm is still brewing -- as per the two grunts of Taka. But where was the ring leader? * - Thu Nov 26 23:57:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka(Lolplz) ||

Little did they know, like predators, the two grunts stalked. It as odd how they could simply endure the stormy weather, and practically functioned as if there was no detrimental effects spawned from 'mother nature.'

But just as the team decides to rest, that's when the duo moved to act.

Coming from the east and west respectively, an ensemble of shurikens pierced through the skies. Each seem to have been tossed by seasoned shinobi, as the tools spiralled around like buzz-saws, easily ripping through the grains of sand. In addition, the currents spawned before simply seemed to be an enhancing agent, empowering the rate of speed in which the ninja tools moved ahead.

The attack seems to be aimed at no one in particular.

[For random grunts, 7 base stats.)* - Fri Nov 27 00:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka(Lolplz) ||
The sandstorm-like effects continue to roam even as the shurikens fly forward.

Many missed their mark, but the two grunts can tell that the attack had served it's purpose as the scent of blood fled into the air.

"Got 'em. . ." As the wind still served as cover, Momura would find that she actually -did- gain view of the grunt. It was a shadowy figure towards her right, just within peripheral vision. The spiky haired lad pushed forward, Kunai in hand, slashing at her rib.

Meanwhile, Toudou was just barely able to defend against the incoming Shurikens. Given his close positiioning, he had a decent chance of hearing the approach.* - Fri Nov 27 00:49:55 2015

There was no kill like overkill!

In hte knick of time, Momura had managed to intercept the bandit before a fatal strike could be released. The warrior's throat is grasped , and repeatily punched in, slowly but surely devestating that portion of the body and making it difficult to breath. The grunt would have gagged and coughed. Low and audible cries of forgiveness could be heard ---

Then came Tornado Fire. 

The chakra flow technique moves, overwhelming the punk and incinerating his body. As the grunt collapsed, his skin seemed forever scarred, every hair on his body body was reduced to ash. Like a sack of potatos, he'd fall.

The storm conditions were clearing before suddenly -- Behind PAine and Vi. This particularly degenerate utilized a tanto. A slash is given diagonally, intent on slamming right into an unsuspecting Yi's shoulder.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka(Lolplz) ||
The grunt taken out simply muttered almost incohorently. . 

"S-Sheesh. . . Still got shinobi like this. . ?" He was shocked, considering Sunagakure's strength even in this level of adversity.* - Fri Nov 27 01:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka(Lolplz) is still at the caravan.

There were about five people bound and gagged, each one apparently resource gatherers or craftmen. "Hm. . . Hm. . Many men. . . Many, many, many men. . ! Wish death upon me. . Lord I don't cry n--" He was singing a tune, until the hurried steps of a ginger were detected.

His hands manuevered along the goods, aiming to reattach them to the caravan in order to finish his looting and drive off. . Sadly, things don't go as planned.

Still a good distance away, Taka just stared to the woman, wearing a sly grin. "Oi. . . Aren't you a little young to be a shinobi? If you're smart, girlie, you'd turn back!" barked the rogue leader with a childish grin.* - Fri Nov 27 01:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka(Lolplz) ||
Paine proved just to be just a tad too slow.

The blade would have stabbed right into Yi's shoulder, going an inch or two deep, and probably making it difficult to move that arm -- if possible at all. Still, Paine and Yi certainly are able to bounce back, sending a counterstrike.

A mean elbow slams against his shoulder, along with a vicious punch to the stomach. . Of course, there was no way conceiveable that he was having a hole punched through his stomach. The grunt is sent packing, slamming right against the floor, blooding spewing his mouth. His body twitched as the pain effectively leaves him incapcitated.* - Fri Nov 27 01:42:49 2015

He forms a single seal as the woman is in the middle of the air. With a quick inhale and exhale, pellets of nearly invisible wind shoot forward -- eight in total. They aim to target the woman's torso, in hopes that the concussive damage would leave her feeling winded, perhaps even compromising her bone structure as well.

Hit or miss, Taka details additional skill.

With a quick first step, his body flickers forward, and his tanto is unsheathed. A diagonal slash is delivered, aiming to cut from Momura's shoulder to her the adjacent hip. "Eh. . . I need a hostage I guess. Didn't expect those bone-heads to lose to you wusses," the male stated with overwhelming bravado.* - Fri Nov 27 01:56:28 2015

The hilt is grasped, forcing Taka to abandon the weapon.

With a half seal, chakra flooded around ghis body, enable the use of shunshin. Flickering out of view, the male is displaced towards the west, lining up not only Momura  -- but also Paine -- right within his sight.

Three short handseals later, and yet another similiar technique is forced to grace the skies. It was an advanced variant of the wind bullet techniques, Vaccum Spheres.  "Ah. . I do like fiesty women. I'll give you all an option if you survive!" Taka roared as the piercing wind currents flowed through the skies. Ten in specific were unleashed, intent on cutting through their flesh.

Of course, if Momura and Paine had detected his location, they had a fair shot at evading due to the distance.* - Fri Nov 27 02:28:03 2015

As much fun as it'd be to contineu chasing after Momura, Taka's gaze falls back onto Paine. "So it looks like you're the stronger of the two. . I guess I could make you my captive? Mmm. . You all should have worked on your strategies before hand, to work in unison," Taka lectured.

His hands wove through three seals, and on the final the ground began to shift.

The sand seemed to shift into mud right under Paine's feet, and bind the appendage beyond movement. SLowly but surely, her body was being sunk -- and the initial blow would be un-avoiding.

Reason being? This was a mere illusion. Although, the question remained. . . Could Paine even determine she was in a genjutsu?* - Fri Nov 27 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka(Lolplz) ||
Paine was swift indeed-- but the blow didn't quite work as she had intended.

Diligently, Taka moved, parrying the blow with a single arm -- which is broken. However, given the shinobi's master of handseals, only a single hand is required. The previous genjutsu would have still gone on, without a hitch.

He's reeling back in pain, when Momura is coming out of nowhere. His head dips out of harms way, and a shit-eating grin is worn. He's in bad shape, however. . .Given that his ability to use any ninjutsu is a tad bit impaired. 

"Uh. . . Maybe we can talk about this toots?"* - Fri Nov 27 03:01:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka(Lolplz) would have blurred away.

The second blow had missed it's mark. Just as Paine landed, she was bound in the genjutsu, and he'd turn now to face Momura.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka(Lolplz) was hauling ass!

He could practically feel Paine closingi n, and just as the wind from here SevereHurricane is building up, the male's hand forms a half seal. His body flickers out of view, just narrowly evading capture.

However, this left the caravan full of material unattended, along with the hostage. Momura and friends could likely deal with that issue on their own.* - Fri Nov 27 03:31:12 2015

Of course, things weren't as they seemed.

The wind blew heavily, as predicted of from the land of wind. It forces the grains of sand to roll over, piling ontop of one another. But more importantly. . . the omnious traits of mother nature alluded to the incoming doom for the party of three. 

In the distance, as the sunrays restlessly beated against their heads, the trio would come upon the caravan in the distance. In this particularly area of the desert, the heat seemed to intensify. What more, the sand occasionally shifted around irregularly.

No doubt, at the caravan that could probably be viewed by those with heightened sight, there was actually a merchant. His ankle was dislocated, and he sat helplessly along the criminally hot flooring. What would the trio do?!* - Fri Dec  4 12:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka(Lolplz) ||
Stepping forward probably wasn 't the wisest of ideas.

With Mirai's kekkei genkai, she'd see a number of things -- some maybe concerning, while others were trivial. Albeit, with her lack of knowledge on sealing based ninjutsu, it's uncertain she could uncover what was wrong.

Beyond the grainy exterior of the desert, various items were buried underneath.

Most importantly? Stacks of explosive tags, each one fitted with a specialized seal. They seemed to be even distance around one another, forming an effective, square-shaped barrier around the region. In addition, towards the east of the caravan, the Hokuma would find that there was a presence, although it remain clouded by some strange smog. Thus, the mystery of what lurked there was un-solved.

The man simply shakes his head subtly, as if to warn the trio not to step further. But oddly, he's unable to scream.* - Fri Dec  4 12:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: They are all around the place. - Fri Dec  4 12:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka(Lolplz) ||
Specifically, clumped at four specific points.

The ground is just outside the border. . Had Mirai been knowledge-able in fuuinjutsu, she'd note something else.* - Fri Dec  4 12:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka(Lolplz) ||
Clones.

The culprit setting this all up had anticipated such. Indeed, just as Mitsunara had spawned a doppleganger, so too did the hidden Taka. 

From the disturbance under the ground, an entity swims along the earth, both hands jutting upward to grab along the Raiton bunshin's ankles to pull it inward. Hit or miss, the doppleganger leapt up, sporting a sick smile and gleaming armor.

Wordlessly, it stepped forward, closing in on the apparently injured merchant. . . Who never moved for one reason or another. "Geez. . . You guys aren't very smart, you know. .  Did you even plan this out?" the crooked teen taunted.* - Fri Dec  4 12:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka(Lolplz) thinks: Just need them to step forward. . .Could blow this place sky high. - Fri Dec  4 12:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Wait, the Merchant is probably not re- - Fri Dec  4 12:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka(Lolplz) ||
Smart!

At least someone was thinking with their head. Unable to forsee the utilzation of the hair binding, Taka can't quite interfere. In addition, the merchant is grasped, and being pulled backwards with extraordinary velocity.

At this point, the actual culprit leaps out, no longer feeling it necessary to remain hidden. At the same time, a single seal is spawned, prompting each of the tags to ignite! The jutsu in question proved simply to be a basic explosion seal barrier, where each of the four points were ignited, allowing the epic center to garner a greater, more potent explosion.

Naturally, given the sheer amount of tags, the radius was significant, enough to endanger the trio of kunoichi that came for the endeavor. The caravan also is exploded, with much of it's goods being incinerated. As the smoke lingers, a barrage of about twelve shurikens come flinging through, hoping to catch Mitsunara, CHikyu, and Mirai off guard -- assuming the explosions hadn't done the trick.* - Fri Dec  4 13:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka(Lolplz) ||
The explosion absolutely wrecked the area.

The carvan was easily turn asunder, and a massive crater was left along the ground -- the depression serving as a reminder to the wreckage spawned on this day. Of course, the smoke served as a screen or covering. . . 

Sadly, it does him no good, given that both of his opponents could partially defend. As Chikyu runs in, she;d find that she too was also detected with relative ease. Albeit, the covering of smoke made it difficult to detect where the swign was coming.

At the last second, Taka pivots to the right, allowing an evasion for the most part. His ribs are grazed, prompting some blood to trickle. Regardless, the teen wasn't exactly going to be denied. Using his sense of hearing, tjhe rogue lounged forward, sending a right handed haymaker to the kunoichi's general torso.

". . .Son of a bitch! Nah, this time I'll make sure you Suna shinobi learn now to mess with my operation. Last time, you jackasses broke my arm!" Yep, he was bitter rogue that suffered defeat at the hands of Sunagakure. The entire mission? Was due to his ploy for vengence.* - Fri Dec  4 13:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka(Lolplz) ||
There was a clan as the blade cut through is armor.* - Fri Dec  4 13:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Gameplay graphics, don't make up for your bad 20 hour story0 - Fri Dec  4 13:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka(Lolplz) grunted with the blow. His monstrous strength was certain to send his competitor skidding back --- In fac it worked a tad too well. With ease, CHikyu's form is sent skidding along the sandy surface, bouncing off the ground even. "Boom! Head shot! You shoulda just walked away, girlie!"

And in that moment, Mirai had stepped forward.

Naturally, Taka moved to defend himself, each time just barely being able to do so. Forearms jutted to the top, blocking the high-kicks, while on several occasions, he's laced or struck with low blows. The attack slams against his arm, denting the structure, but migitating much of the damage. 

Quickly, the brutish rogue conjures up a Tanto from a sealing formation on his arm. It slashes, aiming to cut at the woman'schest. Hit or miss, a palm thrust is fired off, intent on keeping the Hokuma at bay. In the event that any of this is a success, Taka sped off to the south, beelining to the merchant that was presumably unguarded "Alright! Fuck it, I'm at least killing this jackass if I can't kill you all easily!"* - Fri Dec  4 14:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka(Lolplz) says: OH - Fri Dec  4 14:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka(Lolplz) ||

Boom! Boom!

Concussive, air bullets seemed to manifest along Mirai's palms as they thrusted. As they come, Taka forms a single seal, sending bullets of his own-- yet color his surprised as the elemental technique is overwhelmed. The flow of chakra pushes through, dissipating the fuuton-based manuever, and targeting Taka's back. Given the nature of the gentle fist, even as the attack is airbourne, it works well, overcoming and bypassing any defense.

The rogue falls to a single knee, pain riddling his body.

"-- Fuck! This!"

Three handsigns are woven through, and with ease the wind currents again are manipulated. Empty vaccums of space are built and speared forward, intentn on poking holes through the Hokuma. "DIE!" Blood lust was apparent in the teen's eye, as he wanted nothing more than to make Sunagakure pay once and for all for trifling with his crooked affairs.

Naturally, Taka had been struck just a few steps away fromthe merchant, making his murderous desires fall short at that moment.* - Fri Dec  4 14:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka(Lolplz) cried out with anxiety as the Hokuma kept up with the pressure.

For a second, Taka was stunned given the painful sensation  from the air palm-- and before he knew it, a dangerous kick had been unleashed, sending his body flying upward. It was remarkable, in all honesty, just powerful the curavecous kunoichi proved to be. At first glance, you'd never guess it.

Thwap!

The kick would have certain done a number on his body, but at the last second, doton chakra was pumped to his skin, hardening it. No doubt, given Mirai's high level of physical strength, this was more than enough to crack through is earthly defenses and leave just a small amount of pain. ". . You little ass hole. . ! Alright, let's see you protect your friend and the merchant at the swam---"

Then heel drop to the top of the head. Just as with the last, his earthen shell serves as partial layer of protection, but even that fails against the physical might. His body slammed onto the ground with a thud, but the lad refuses to give up just yet, even if his frame ached. Abruptly, kunaui are summoned from symbols tattoo'd on his body.

Three are flicked to the merchant -- who still can't seem to move -- and of course Chikyu. ". . Must. . kill-- take one with me .. . "* - Fri Dec  4 15:12:12 2015
