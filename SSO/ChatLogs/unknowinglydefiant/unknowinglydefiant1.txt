<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tatsuyu, Yu(UnknowinglyDefiant) calls for the waitress, which happened to be a lady on the older side. As she approached the table, Yu bowed his head respectfully as he spoke "I was hoping to get a cup of herbal Tea, as well as an order of Sake Nigiri." He looked to Chikyu as he spoke "It's hard not to want to spoil you." He admitted with a light smile. As he leaned forward  resting his elbow on the table and his head upon his palm.* - Sat Oct 31 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tatsuyu, Yu(UnknowinglyDefiant) scratched his cheek as he spoke "You're pretty unique, Y'know that?" He stated lightly, following her gaze to the kitchen. They were elderly, so the food would probably be a minute, but they returned with their drinks after a few minutes.* - Sat Oct 31 22:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tatsuyu, Yu(UnknowinglyDefiant) did the same as he accepted his tea as he spoke "Most girls wouldn't mind being spoiled, in fact they count on it." He stated, raising his cup to his lips after blowing it as he took a sip as he added "I like it."* - Sat Oct 31 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tatsuyu, Yu(UnknowinglyDefiant) placed his cup down as he looked at her as he spoke "Sounds like a nice guy, Seems like he didn't want you to leech off of other people." He looked down for a moment as he spoke "That's something few parents teach their kids."* - Sat Oct 31 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tatsuyu, Yu(UnknowinglyDefiant) nodded his head as he spoke "Ain't that the truth." He stated, raising his cup of tea to his lips once again. Around this time their food would be arriving to the table.* - Sat Oct 31 22:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tatsuyu, Yu(UnknowinglyDefiant) also broke his chopsticks, picking up a piece of his sake nigiri which was also a type of Sushi, he raised it to his mouth before biting down, slowly chewing it in order to savor the taste as he looked to Chikyu as he spoke "I knew you'd like it~" He spoke,in a cheerful tone.* - Sat Oct 31 23:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tatsuyu, Yu(UnknowinglyDefiant) laughed subtly as he spoke "It definately is, I enjoy comming here after training for a while, It's nice to relax. And the food is good as well." He stated lightly, he was eating at a significantly slower pace, but once he was done. He looked to Chikyu and asked "So tell me about yourself?"* - Sat Oct 31 23:08:22 2015

I'd be more than happy to take you out." He stated with a warm smile, "But since that's out there...What about training later? Is that also out of the picture?"* - Sat Oct 31 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tatsuyu, Yu(UnknowinglyDefiant) looks at Chikyu as he simply spoke "That's the exact reason, I took interest in you." He stated, there was a faint blush on his cheek, as he scratched his cheek, his gaze was averted slightly. It was a very odd way, to tell her exactly why he was attracted to her after a short period of time. He was highly embarrassed by this and immediately regretted opening his mouth.* - Sat Oct 31 23:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tatsuyu, Yu(UnknowinglyDefiant) blushed heavily as Chikyu grabbed her breasts, followed by swallowing hard as he spoke "Y-Yeah...I think you're perfect as is.." He stated. His gaze was averted as to not meet her own. He knew now she'd probably never have feelings for him, but he was still fairly attracted.* - Sun Nov  1 00:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tatsuyu, Yu(UnknowinglyDefiant) sighed as she punched him he spoke "Man...Maybe I'll just give up." He stated, scratching his cheek as he spoke "I don't know...For now I'm just happy to have a good friend."* - Sun Nov  1 00:22:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tatsuyu, Yu(UnknowinglyDefiant) blinked as she head-locked him, definately wasn't what he was expecting but he didn't mind having his face shoved against her chest. His blush became more pronounced, especially as her hand began rubbing his head as he muttered "Chikyu..." Though muffled, he closed his eyes, wrapping his arms around her as well.* - Sun Nov  1 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tatsuyu, Yu(UnknowinglyDefiant) smiled a bit as he spoke "I appreciate it." Though he was sure he'd have a headache since she rubbed his head so hard. Flinching a bit as her hand connected with his back. As he spoke "I won't hold you up here...But I'd like to hang out again some time...If that's fine."* - Sun Nov  1 00:48:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tatsuyu, Yu(UnknowinglyDefiant) approached Amaterasu's side, taking a look at her a single finger was raised to scratch his cheek. Before he looked at who she was speaking to, and decided ultimately to wait, to introduce himself. He didn't want to interrupt any important conversation.* - Mon Nov  2 03:42:43 2015

"I-I'm sorry, I didn't wish to interupt your conversation with the man over there..." He stated keeping his head bowed for a small amount of time, he looked awefully embarrassed as he spoke:

"My...My name's Yu."* - Mon Nov  2 03:48:41 2015
