<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered towards Sanoke as he produced a scroll out if a thin air. She listened carefully as he briefed her on the assignment that she requested. After being filled in on the details by her fianc the lavender eyed beauty would speak. 

"I don't think you should've ended the chunnin examinations so quickly. I was actually pondering on joining the whole tournament thing it seemed pretty interesting. As far as the festival is concerned sounds like an interesting event that definitely should be held. I'm not quite sure if Shinobi from other villages will partake in this event, but sending out an event wouldn't hurt. During this festival, maybe you should incorporate Chikyu's idea or maybe that will be held during a later time." 

Mirai suggested before she stood up and made her way towards her mansion. 

Once she was inside of the manor she would head directly towards the printer placing the document inside of the scanner and scanning the contents of the invitations before she produced a mass amount of them. In a matter of seconds the woman would've produced a numerous of copies of said document. Being tasked with the mission, she would've personally placed the document around the village. 

Being quite familiar with the village, she would've placed the document in all the local areas such as the hungry ant, the training arena, the gates, and even upon the square where most of the Shinobi lingered when they weren't tending to their duties. It was a simple mission and as the current assistant of the Kazekage it was her duty to complete tasks such as these.

It didn't take long for the Hokuma to return and plant herself upon Sanoke's lap once again.* - Sat Dec  5 09:25:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiko(Lostlolidragon) says: I just know that is has something to do with Fuuinjutsu! - Sat Dec  5 09:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'll look into it. - Sat Dec  5 09:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiko(Lostlolidragon) says: Thank you! - Sat Dec  5 09:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: That stuff is so complex. - Sat Dec  5 09:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I don't see how you do it. - Sat Dec  5 09:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Eh. It's not too hard once you learn the basics. - Sat Dec  5 09:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Seems complex. - Sat Dec  5 09:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered towards Sanoke as he spoke and attempted to give an explanation of fuuinjutsu which only made her understanding of the area dwindle. She squinted as he began to speak one could tell that she was confused and didn't quite understand what he meant by his statement. Then suddenly she felt his hands upon her chest, squeezing her bosom. 

This was quite unexpected and the Hokuma would've never guessed that her fianc would've made such a bold move in public. Glancing towards the mansion for a second she would shift her gaze back towards Sanoke before a devious smirk formed upon her face. She would lean in towards the Shinobi before she whispered in his ear. "I'll meet you in your office lord Kazekage." Mirai said seductively before she strolled over towards the manor.* - Sat Dec  5 10:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) || by now Mirai would've been strolling towards the mansion taking her time as she approached the manor where the two of them would do the deed. Upon entering the manor she would peer towards Sanoke as he swiftly ordered each employee that was currently working within the building out. 

She watched them intently as the employees scurried out of the building clearly happy that they were free to go home early. Once each individual had evacuated the mansion she would allow Sanoke to lock the the place down so that the two of them could enjoy their time together without being disturbed. She peered towards Sanoke as he gazed at her as if she were piece of meat. She could see the desire in his eyes and this only aroused the Hokuka more.

If Sanoke were paying attention he would've likely noticed the grin that was upon her face, however, she allowed the Shinobi to take control. Being pulled into Sanoke she would allow him to unfasten the skirt that she adorned allowing him to pry off her clothing quickly. Then abruptly the Hokuma would've removed some handcuffs quickly latching them around Sanoke's wrist.* - Sat Dec  5 10:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) thinks: Oh shit! If I keep this up i'm not going to get any presents for christmas. - Sat Dec  5 10:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) || The sounds of the handcuffs being locked around Sanoke's echoed throughout the room and it was music to Mirai's ears. The grin that was plastered upon the beauty's face would've widened now as she peered towards her fianc who was now confined within the handcuffs. Leaning in towards the Shinobi Mirai would've whispered in his ear or was it Mirai speaking?

 "Remember or last little altercation. When you just exploded in pure pleasure and I wanted more? Well, that's not happening this time buddy! I'm calling the shots and you're not cumming till I say so. Got it?" 

Mirai inquired the tone of her voice was completely demanding and the usual sweet demeanor the that curvaceous Hokuma exuded would've seemed to diminish in that moment. Guiding the temporary Kage towards the seat she would allow him to be seated in the seat before she straddled him. Sitting upon his lap, she would begin to unbutton shirt quickly prying off his clothing so that he was in the nude within the office. 

Straddling him once again, she would begin to plant kisses upon his neck, leaving a trail hickies upon her lover's neck marking her territory. She would trail down his body planting kisses upon every inch of his frame until she was upon her knees. By now Mirai would've been under the Kazekage's desk gazing up into his optics as she was inches away from his member. Taking a hold of his member, she would begin to stroke his member, allowing to harden within her hand as she slowly stroked his member.* - Sat Dec  5 10:48:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I can give a simple mission to help strengthen the lower ranked shinobi. Head to the academy's ground and give a less on taijutsu and kenjutsu. Essentially, I want you and Chikyu to give a mock battle. A-K-A, spar. - Sun Dec  6 11:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Simple, yes? - Sun Dec  6 11:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sounds simple enough. - Sun Dec  6 11:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Once that's done, I have another task to be completed. - Sun Dec  6 11:10:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) Listened intently as her fianc briefed her upon the mission. Whilst the temporary Kazekage spoke visions of what took place between the couple yesterday while the two of them had privacy cascaded through her head. If he were to be paying attention he would likely notice that the Hokuma was nipping her bottom lip and her eyes were filled with lust. 

Suddenly she would've snapped back into reality several seconds after Sanoke had briefed her on the mission. Glancing towards Chikyu who had been assigned to aid her complete mission, she would gesture her head towards the Academy before she began to stroll over towards the building. Entering the building she would make her way towards the desk. 

Sitting behind the desk would've been a woman who worked at the academy. Parting her lips Mirai would address the woman. "Salutations! Me and my friend here would like to host a class on Taijutsu and Kenjutsu. We were assigned a mission by the Kazekage and figured it would be a good idea to teach the future generation of upcoming Shinobi about both of the professions. If you could arrange a class for us that would be great." Mirai stated peering towards the woman who remained behind the desk. 

The woman would've simply nodded her head before she responded. "I can do that for you two beautiful ladies." The woman said in a joyous tone before she picked up and her phone and began to make a few calls to arrange this whole ordeal. After a few minutes of waiting the woman would've called for Mirai and Chikyu directing them to the classroom that they would utilize to give their lesson.* - Sun Dec  6 11:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've entered the classroom glancing around at each individual that was within the room. She would've made her way towards the front of the classroom standing directly to Chikyu. Mirai was a social butterfly and she was never apprehensive when it came to speaking. 

She would've allowed the Chikyu to introduce herself and she would've chimed in right afterwards. "Good morning everyone pleasure to meet you all I'm Mirai. Assuming that everyone in this room is an aspiring Shinobi today will be exciting and a great day for you all. We will be teaching you all about Taijutsu and Kenjutsu areas that were are both very familiar with." Mirai stated starting off the lecture well. 

A smile would've been plastered upon her face and she spoke with more enthusiasm than usual.  One could tell that Mirai was quite comfortable about public speaking, especially since it was on a subject that she was knowledgeable about. 

"At a very young age, I knew that I was going to mainly specialize in Taijutsu. When I was in the academy I was often intimidated by other students who were skilled in Ninjutsu and other things. Today I am more skilled in Taijutsu than anything else and I've come very far. So if you're like me and already know that you want to dabble into Taijutsu go for it. You can achieve great things and become great with Taijutsu don't be intimidated by your peers or don't let anyone deter you from becoming a Shinobi just because you want to specialize in only Taijutsu." 

Mirai stated giving the students a bit of background information about herself hoping that a few of the students within the classroom could relate and that her words inspired them and encouraged them to pursue their dream. "Can anyone here tell me what Taijutsu is?" Mirai inquired wanting to test the students.* - Sun Dec  6 11:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) Glanced towards the students with her lavender shaded optics watching them all state what Taijutsu was at the same time. She was glad to see the students were actually being taught and that they were paying attention to their instructors. Remaining silent for a moment she would've allowed Chikyu to speak and give her explanation on Kenjutsu. 

She would've listened intently as the woman displayed her tanto and gave them a description of her broad sword. Seeing that Chikyu was being overwhelmed she would've came to her aid chiming in at that exact moment. "Chikyu is able to utilize that sword. As a Shinobi you'll have to improve your upper body strength and strength in general, unless you plan on simply utilizing Genjutsu which is fine." Mirai stated, trying not to offend the students who possibly wanted to dabble into Genjutsu.  Now that she knew that the students knew what Taijutsu was she would've began to give a full depth explanation on what it was. 

"You're right Taijutsu are maneuvers that a Shinobi utilizes with just their body. Knowing the dictionary definition is great, however Taijutsu is so much more than that. For example, my form of Taijutsu relies on striking people's chakra points and causes internal injury. It however restricted to members of my clan, but you call can create a fighting style of your own. Don't think that you're restricted to just basic techniques be innovative and create a style on your own. Who knows one of you could create a fighting style that will stand the test of time and will be used by countless Shinobi after you. It might even be more powerful than my clans or the other fighting styles that are out there. Don't just learn maneuvers because they are cool learn techniques that will be useful for you and that will be good in your Arsenal and if you can't learn from someone just create your own!"

 Mirai stated peering towards the students.* - Sun Dec  6 12:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered towards Chikyu as she began to give her explanation on Kenjutsu. The information that she bestowed upon the children was quite useful and she was familiar with it despite not being a practitioner of Kenjutsu. She glanced towards the students as the jotted down a few notes as they received the information. 

She was glad to see that they were In fact, paying attention and make scribbling the information down somewhere so that they could refer to it for later. She would lower her voice responding to Chikyu. "Sure, now would be a great time. " Mirai whispered before she snapped her finger and suddenly a trio of men would've entered the classroom. The individuals would've been holding a back that seemed full of something. 

"Well, seeing as we were all suppose to teach you about Kenjutsu and Taijutsu I have a surprise for you. Everyone present will be receiving weights a bokken. " Mirai stated before she pointed her index finger towards each individual student the volume of her voice raised as she screamed. "You get weights! You get a bokken! Everyone gets one! "

Mirai shouted as the individuals passed out the items to each student. This of course would've all been purchased with her allowance that she received from Sanoke occasionally which happened to be an abundant amount of money that she didn't really spend unless she was purchasing a skimpy outfit. Once the individuals had passed out the items she would've glanced towards the students. "Now we will be having a mock battle outside at the arena. Perhaps there will be more gifts in store for you all." Mirai stated before she began to stroll towards the arena.* - Sun Dec  6 12:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) watched as the kids accepting the gifts. She assumed it would be a good idea to provide them with bokken's so that they could practice their Kenjutsu without harming themselves. They weren't quite skilled enough to wield a real blade and could potentially hurt themselves and their classmates if they mimicked the actions of Chikyu or practiced on their spare time. 

Waltzing towards the arena Mirai would take her position not bothering to activate her Byakugan due to the fact that this was just a mock battle. Glancing over towards the pink haired shinobi as revealed her tanto. Mirai would've darted towards the Shinobi.  Before she was in close enough proximity she would've leapt into the air arching her right feet and extending her left feet out forward. Mirai would've shouted the name out of the technique she used something she never really did. "Dynamic entry!" Mirai said feeling a little bit corny for doing that but she didn't it for demonstration purposes.* - Sun Dec  6 13:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've began the battle with Dynamic which was a simple Taijutsu technique that the kids might have liked to be seen. Fortunately Chikyu had dodged the attack and didn't take any damage from attack. Recovering she would've landed upon be sand peering towards Chikyu as she darted towards her. Reaching for her backpouch she would've removed a single kunai clutching onto the hilt of the weapon with her hand. She would've voyaged towards Chikyu as well closing the distance between the two of them. Utilizing the weapon as an extensive of her body. With the kunai in hand the both of their weapons would be clashing giving the students a nice show to watch. Mirai of course would've utilized her body a bit more abruptly attempting to kick Chikyu in the stomach. She of course held back though.* - Sun Dec  6 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) casually was having a spar with Chikyu. The two of them were serious and it was relaxed throughout the entire process. Mirai would've utilized her body simply kicking Chikyu but of course their was barely any force behind the kick so Chikyu wouldn't have been harmed. Continuing to clash the woman she would've been taken of guard by the suddenly assault of kicks that had been launched towards her. Mirai would jolted as she was struck with the kick that had been launched towards her. Her acting skills were on par with insert famous actress here. By now the woman would've had enough and simply ended the spar. She would've said goodbye to the students wishing them a farewell.* - Sun Dec  6 13:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) entered the mansion.* - Sun Dec  6 14:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Hey Lera. - Sun Dec  6 14:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hey...Hm. Kidnappings? - Sun Dec  6 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright. - Sun Dec  6 14:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: One other thing. - Sun Dec  6 14:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Hrm? Badass. I'll keep an eye out for it. - Sun Dec  6 14:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Thanks. - Sun Dec  6 14:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Wonder what she would think when Mitsunara comes onto her... - Sun Dec  6 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) thinks: I wonder what she would think if she knew her advice made Mitsunara come on to me... - Sun Dec  6 14:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: ....... - Sun Dec  6 14:26:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) thinks: Cuddling...? - Sun Dec  6 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) thinks: Why does....This conversation...Sound so lewd? - Sun Dec  6 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Because we're hormonal teenage girls. - Sun Dec  6 14:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) was briefed on the mission quickly by the interim Kazekage. She would've accepted the scroll opening it before she read the contents of the scroll. Peering towards Lera she would simply nod her head remaining silent for a moment before she parted her lips to speak. "Sounds easy enough. First we will head to the area where the victim lips and do a little investigation. Then we will proceed to question the victims family and those that were close to the victim. With that being said Sanoke we will be taking our leave." Mirai stated before she casually strolled out of the mansion awaiting for Chikyu and Lera to join her.* - Sun Dec  6 14:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) thinks: God, I'm so hormonal right now! - Sun Dec  6 14:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alrighty, time to go. - Sun Dec  6 14:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) || Then the traveling began. After being briefed upon the mission the trio of Shinobi would've began to travel north of Sunagakure heading towards the area where the individuals had gone missing. Having read the scroll which contained the location of the area, it wouldn't have taken long for the kunoichi to locate and find the area. 

As the two of the travelled north of Sunagakure Mirai would've pondered on a few things as they made they traveled through the desert and sand swept across the area. Arriving at the area, she would spot a massive illustrious silver gate. Then the sound of a guard ordering them to halt resonated throughout the area. Squinting towards the guard, she would've halted signaling for her squad to halt as well. 

Parting her lips the Hokuma would've addressed the guard. "Apparently there has been a numerous amount of missing person reports being filled here. We were ordered by the Kazekage to investigate the incident in an attempt to resolve the issues. These two are with me will you allow us to enter the village and speak to members of the Hitomi clan about the incident?" Mirai inquired stating her reason of being here hoping to reassure the guard that they meant no harm.* - Sun Dec  6 14:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) thinks: Why does it look like they have more money than Sunagakure? - Sun Dec  6 14:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Similar to my neighbourhood...I better keep an eye on Kiyoko.. - Sun Dec  6 14:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) simply nodded her head peering towards the guard as he apologized for being hostile towards the trio of Shinobi. "No need to apologize it happens you're just doing your job. I'm sure after we investigate we will resolve the issue of the missing individuals." Mirai stated before she waltz through the gate casually. Halting as they came to a crossroads Mirai would've addressed the members of her squads. 

Being a member of the desert owls this was right up her ally and she knew how to go about gaining information. "Assuming that people were kidnapped I think it would be a bad idea to split up so we should remain together. I was worried sick when Chikyu was kidnapped so let's avoid splitting up. Your idea is great Lera, you should create a shadow clone and allow it to speak to the locals around here. According to Sanoke there were fourty-eight people who went missing. Try to find out what you can about those individuals such as things like their gender, age, occupation. We have to find out how they are all linked if that's the case. As far as your plan Chikyu sounds great, but let's get some more information on the victims such as appearance and things of that nature so we can properly draw them out." Mirai stated to her squad.* - Sun Dec  6 15:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: What plan? - Sun Dec  6 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: One of us could try to get kidnapped. - Sun Dec  6 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Draw them out. - Sun Dec  6 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: .... - Sun Dec  6 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: We're rather well equipped, most would think twice in touching one of us - Sun Dec  6 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) thinks: I...didn't actually think that was a plan. - Sun Dec  6 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: So, one of us should use henge. If we're going with that plan. - Sun Dec  6 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Mhm. - Sun Dec  6 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) thinks: How is that a plan? - Sun Dec  6 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Once you find out about the individuals who were kidnapped. - Sun Dec  6 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: If we do that though - Sun Dec  6 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: One of us could dress the part. - Sun Dec  6 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: We should get a good idea of who's been kidnapped. - Sun Dec  6 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Find a pattenr. - Sun Dec  6 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Of course. - Sun Dec  6 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Then we can make ourselves appear suitable. - Sun Dec  6 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Wait...well I mean why would they kidnap us anyway. Seems like they're going after rich wealthy targets anyways, like people of the Hotomi clans from what Sanoke said. We would have to be one of them to get any attention. - Sun Dec  6 15:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: ... - Sun Dec  6 15:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Uh...I am rich and wealthy you know.. - Sun Dec  6 15:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: We said we were going to dress the part Chikyu. - Sun Dec  6 15:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: That's why we are getting information on the victims. - Sun Dec  6 15:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Oh yeah you are rich! - Sun Dec  6 15:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: And, I guess. - Sun Dec  6 15:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I live in a neighbourhood exactly like this, only with less defenses. - Sun Dec  6 15:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Did you ask any of the Hotomi guys? - Sun Dec  6 15:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: We should go to them together. - Sun Dec  6 15:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: No. - Sun Dec  6 15:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: We can visit there next. - Sun Dec  6 15:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: That information can be used later. - Sun Dec  6 15:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I'm going to send a clone back, see if I can get some information on those names. - Sun Dec  6 15:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) Quickly jotted down the information that had been relayed to her by Lera. It seemed as though this information correlated to a numerous amount of individuals so Mirai assumed that it was noteworthy of writing down. Once she wrote the information down within a scroll she would've pocketed it storing it for later. 

"Let's us visit the Hitomi residence and learn about the most recent victims. We can get a description on how those individuals look and so forth. "Mirai stated before she opened the scroll that Sanoke had given her. Fortunately the interim Kazekage had everything written out for the trio of Shinobi. "I've got some information on a few relatives I suppose we can speak to them." Mirai stated before she strolled off. If they were to follow the trio Shinobi would end up at the doorstep of a relative of the Hitomi family. Mirai would simply knock on the door waiting for someone to answer.* - Sun Dec  6 15:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I can see if my clan has connections as well...bound to be a few. - Sun Dec  6 15:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: So it was the father... - Sun Dec  6 15:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) || it didn't take long for the door to be answered and upon the gentlemen opening the door Mirai would've simply glanced at him but didn't say anything. "How does he know we're here to investigate. No matter." Mirai thought to herself for a moment before she responded to the elderly man who opened the door to illustrious home. 

Parting her lips Mirai would address him. "Yes, we're here to ask you a few questions if you could summon up all of those involved in some sort of way that would make things easier for us." Mirai said before taking a step inside of the enormous home.  Instinctively Mirai would've glanced around the home taking notice of how well decorated the inside was. 

The marble floor and furniture seemed to have been imported from elsewhere, it was extremely lavish. "My aren't they living" Mirai thought to herself before she took a seat upon the extremely comfy couch and waited for the relatives to arrive. In a matter of time everyone would've arrived and Mirai would've gazed towards each individual jotting down their appearance, age, and gender.

The princess would've addressed the child who seemed troubled about something first though. "Before we begin the questioning. Child is there something troubling you? Feel free to tell me if there is." Mirai stated her lavender shaded optics fell upon the young girl. A look of concern was plastered upon her face.* - Sun Dec  6 16:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Lily..hm - Sun Dec  6 16:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: Please let me deal with the child.. - Sun Dec  6 16:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) Simply peered towards lily as she began to speak on the incident and answer the question. Mirai's gaze would shift between lily and her relatives as she spoke. Naturally the Hokuma would've noticed how uneasy they were as the child spoke, however Mirai didn't speak on it. 

Then the mother spoke for a moment and Mirai would've pondered a bit. She would've addressed the woman who decided to speak up. "Perhaps that is true. Speaking of money you guys live quite the lavish life or could afford to judging by this house. The source of your wealth where does it come from and who is the bread winner of this family?" Mirai inquired gazing towards the woman as she slowly jotted a few things. A numerous amount of things came to mind, but she wouldn't speak on it for now.* - Sun Dec  6 16:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Oddly suspicious... - Sun Dec  6 16:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) Simply peered towards the woman as she remained sitting on the couch with her legs crossed. Her facial expression would've remained the same displaying no signs of becoming upset or angry. After writing something down Mirai would've proceeded with the questioning taking into account how angry the woman seemed to have gotten. 

"I'm not insinuating that you had anything to do with your husband being kidnapped. I am simply doing my job I'm truly sorry if I offended you miss. " Mirai stated apologizing to the woman before she proceeded with questioning her. "So you said you had an intruder here. You speak as though you were present when your husband was kidnapped. If this is the case where was everyone when he was kidnapped?" 

Mirai inquired, clearly trying to get to the bottom of this whole ordeal. The beautiful Hokuma would've peered towards the woman showing little to no emotion as she questioned her.* - Sun Dec  6 16:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: ... - Sun Dec  6 16:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) Peered towards the woman as she answered the question. The more she spoke the more defensive she sounded, however Mirai still didn't speak on the situation. Her gaze occasionally shifted towards everyone as they spoke, giving their alibi. Then her gaze fell upon lily who didn't quite say anything and just started at the ground as if she were troubled. Addressing the child she would speak to her wanting to know where she was. 

"You look as if you want to say something child. Go ahead and say what's on your mind you won't get in trouble. Also were you present when your father was kidnapped?" Mirai inquired peering towards the child. Assuming that she was going to answer she would address everyone who answered the question. "I'll be checking up on all your alibi's so I hope you have someone who can confirm them. Miss you stated that you were working earlier, I speak to one of your employee's at the restaurant to confirm that. Is this fine?" Mirai inquired afterwards.* - Sun Dec  6 16:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: What time did you hear the noise? - Sun Dec  6 16:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've simply nodded her head before her attention soon diverted towards the child who had this outburst. It seemed as though this girl would be the one to deliver the information that was needed to solve this case. She would allow the girl to cry for a few moments before she addressed her again. "The intruder came here to save you? Save you from whom?" Mirai inquired peering towards true girl.* - Sun Dec  6 16:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered towards the teenage daughter who claimed to be doing her hair in the bathroom at the time of the kidnapping.

"You looked as if you had to more to say earlier. So you mean to tell me that you were up doing your hair while you heard something going on the kitchen and didn't go to check things out?" Mirai inquired.* - Sun Dec  6 17:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Thank god she understood that... - Sun Dec  6 17:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: If thats true...then their might be people still watching the household. If they got the wrong mark, they might come back for the child. - Sun Dec  6 17:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered towards the teenager as she spoke. a few things had quickly came to mind as she spoke.

"Does this family have any enemies and why would they want the child? What is so special about her?" Mirai inquired.* - Sun Dec  6 17:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: Use your eyes... - Sun Dec  6 17:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) activated her Byakugan at that very moment. Scanning the area to see if the home was being watched.* - Sun Dec  6 17:14:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I forgot that a sale is going on. - Sun Dec  6 17:19:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've went to another home particulary a relatives. Mirai had saw something strange with her Byakugan and wanted play things off by mentioning that she forgot a sale. She didn't want the strange thing that she saw clued into what she planned on doing. Once the group would've arrived at a relatives house she would've told them to remain at the home for the night and to not say a word.* - Sun Dec  6 17:24:28 2015
