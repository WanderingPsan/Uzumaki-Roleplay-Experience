"This kage guy. . is such a lazy ass. . ."* - Wed Oct  7 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) rose a brow.

"Huh. . ?" She says, keeping her distance. Fujitora was a recognize womanizer after all. . . But he was also recognized as the former kage of the village.

"What's up. . ? I've been needing a mission anyway," the young Hokuma stated calmly.* - Wed Oct  7 09:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) bites her nails. This entire thing was nerve-wrecking, but also exciting. If he could have chosen anyone for the task, he chose the right girl -- due to her ability to see much further than normal.

"Understood. . I will begin later today, once that pet of mine is one-hundred percent. Until next time?" Mirai states, giving a brief bow.* - Wed Oct  7 10:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Will that be all? - Wed Oct  7 10:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: Pick your comrades who will come with you wisely. - Wed Oct  7 10:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) smiles at the compliment. She takes the scroll, concealing it in her wardrobe and giving another bow. "Thank you."* - Wed Oct  7 10:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: Understood. - Wed Oct  7 10:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) ||Of course, as a developing Kunoichi of Sunagakure, Mirai had no qualms with working to progress her skill. Sadly, at this stage in the game, her level of skill was particular limited. Meaning. . . Mirai lacked heavily in the jutus department. It was fortunate, of course, that the young Hyuuga had been abled to learn to activate her clan's doujutsu. Furthermore, being able to use the clan's stance was also a gigantic advantage. . .

However, due to a particular ex-shinobi taking interest in her, she had suddenly been blessed to learn practical skills that were beyond the basics. That's right, she had finally progressed passed the Basic, E-rank techniques, and was learning skills an entirely different grading rubric.

The first? Was Kai. Thinking on her toes, her minds drift back to the first training session. The application of the jutsu was quite simple, prompting the beaut to garner a giant grin. Being in the middle of nowhere, she takes the time to settle down onto her ample bum. One leg folds over the other, allowing them to snuggly fit together, reminiscient of an old-school indian. Rather than form a basic seal, Mirai's hands press together. It made it appear as if she was praying.

Despite the low level of reserves, a warm, blue outpour of chakra came, and wrapped about her shapely form. In this trance, Mirai had essentially achieved a state of Zen. Quite visibly, due to her heritage as a Hyuuga, the girl could easily manuever and manipulate each of the tenketsu of her body, even if not as skillful as more experienced clansmen. Even without her doujutsu activated, in this mental plane, the Hokuma could visibly visualize each particle of energy course through her frame.

Yet. . . This wasn't the objective. Instead, the girl was going to systematically practice and refine the ability in which she could manipulate or will her own circulatory system to do her bidding. The act of releasing a genjutsu was quite simple. . You simply had to set your system on freeze, then once again reboot it. It was sort of like cleansing your computer of script glitches, y'know, when simply exitting out your programs won't work. 

That thought in mind, Mirai is swift to actually begin with the task. Her chakra flares upon her will being commanded. Each inch of that thick, condensed energy wavered, having shockwaves riddled throughout. Her flow, by now, was disobedient, and refuses to cease with it's insistent momentum. To think, her despicable chakra refused to relent to the will of it's master! . . .Or mistress. Imagine had this been in the scenario in which a genjutsu was actually placed.

An illusion that certain to send her mind into distress, and thus make it so that focus was neigh-impossible. In those types of situations, Mirai simply acknowledges that her current level of strength just quite simply wasn't enough. Even with the ability to see chakra heightening her overall awareness in terms of false illusions. 

With both hands still firmly pressed against one another, the beauty kept at it, forcing relentless cognitive efforts to will the river of chakra to her will. In time, despite the quivers, her flow was beginning to calm itself. Eventually, even as it fails to completely freeze in a timely fashion, the overall rate of movement is being slowed to a crawl, up until the point where the ethereal outpour no longer has ANY momentum.

Of course, this was a fallacy. It held just a tad. Grunting, and squealing with irritation, Mirai continued nevertheless. At once, her chakra flares once more, prompting a revitalization of the natural order of things. She's breathing in worn-out manner, her skin gleaming in the sunlight due to the sweat that had been worked up. The build up of moisture is only minor, of course, due to the lack of physical activity. The only reason it had even spawned was due to her insides being heated by the sheer concentration and movement of her own energy.

Evaluating  the poor outting, Mirai shakes her head. Even as a novice, the girl held great intellect, and thus could easily view just when or where she went wrong. Correct that issue, however. . .Now that was the hard part. Wasting no time whatsoever, the woman's hands remained pressed together, thus willing the energies inside to continue to be bent to her will. 

Mirai was a lot of things at the end of the day. Snobby, controlling. . . But also hardworking. She wasn't going to stop anytime soon, especially if you considered how little chakra the basic ninjutsu took. Immediately, her energy is again shaking around her core, as it's being commanded to slow down. On this occasion, it's far more smooth, albeit still rigid in the grand scheme of things. If anyone had kept an eye on her chakra system, they could see the overall level, or chakra potency, taking a stark declined due to the deceleration.

After bring it all to a stand still, she's more than able of pumping an external source of chi. This is prompts a dominoe effect, which inevitably force the chakra circulatory system to begin business as usual. Relieved, Mirai continously worked on the skill, and each time she gains greater experience. This was like medicine for the soul, even if the entire sequence was repetitive and tiring. . . As each time she went over the jutsu, the experienced forever was tattoo'd into her spirit. 

All through this, each aspect of the girl's spiritual prowess was on the incline; be it chakra control, ninjutsu proficiency, or ability to fight against genjutsu. It all was going to be effected positively. 

By then, the repetition was too much to bare. She falls over, resting in the sand, and not at all minding that the grains were lodged into her hair, and thus making her a tad bit unclean. For the moment, Mirai looked exceptionally cadaverous.* - Wed Oct  7 11:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) ||After some time resting, Mirai is back at it. Her chakra seemed to have recovered splendidly. Rather than being a worn out mess, she's like a spring chicken, ready and eager to continue the repetitive process. Genjutsu Kai. . . An annoying skill, but a necessary ninjutsu to be capable of using in the heat of battle. Based on the information she had been fed, it was quite possible to become skilled enough to release a genjutsu without any handseals -- that was a feat she desperately desired to achieve.

Again, her hands fall flatly against one another, giving the appearance of a prayer. Once in a meditation stance, the woman's chakra is being shifted around once more. Due to the endless repetition, she was growing more and more used to the repetitive process. This grants some sort of spiritual memory, which is what is essentially built by the endless, habitually repeated process. In time, she was going to grow capable or comfortable enough to do this without even focusing.

Much like the Suimen skill -- which Mirai had yet to learn for some odd reason. Considering her rapid improvement, she freezes her chakra at will, and without a hitch, applies additional chakra to reboot. THe process is seamless, one occuring less than a second after the other, thus giving the facade that she simply expunged  or practiced expunging a would-be 'chakra pathogen', otherwise known as illusions.

Settling down, she resumes the art throughout the rest of the day, each time becoming a tad bit better. Her mouth twitched into a grin after the end of the training regiment. No way Mirai was ever going to be a Sakura, simply because she had too much ambition, and wouldn't just sit about just to let some man become her saviour. By now, however, the Hokuma had exhausted her own will to continue with the training exercise. More could be done later.* - Wed Oct  7 11:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) remained sitting in her meditative stance. . . Then. . .!

". . Who goes there?" The Hyuuga questions, due to her doujutsu being activated, she was much mroe aware than you would assume. Her head cants towards the side, eying Mizora. For reference, Mirai's hands were pressed together, forming a prayer-like 'seal.' It's what she used to practice Kai.* - Wed Oct  7 11:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) ||The realization was mutual. Such was the advantage of being a wielder of the 'All-Seeing' Byakugan. "Hrm. . .I can see the flow in your body. You're a relative of mine?" Mirai's right brow shook, before rising at last. To think, one of her cousins would have been venturing within one plains of Sunagakure. It was as iff the Byakugan doujutsu was at last making a resurgence. This fact greatly pleased the woman's inner 'clanist.'

"Good evening," she says sweetly, charmed to at last see another relative of her gender -- at least since her mother's departure from the village.* - Wed Oct  7 11:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Greetings once more/ - Wed Oct  7 21:05:29 2015

"Our conversation was cut short prior. I never even got your name," the Hokuma states, her voice civil or peaceful.* - Wed Oct  7 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Mizora. - Wed Oct  7 21:08:03 2015

"As am I. I've recently began in my endeavor as a shinobi. . . Koji has been a bit slow to teach me further. You and I should spar, however. Would be great exercise and perhaps bonding time," Mirai suggests, eager to have an actual sparring partner that could be aroundher level.* - Wed Oct  7 21:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Well... this Koji guy's trained you regardless. I haven't received training from anyone. I'd drag you down in a spar. - Wed Oct  7 21:19:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) makes her approach, and bows.

"Sorry about cutting our convesation short the other day. I had to go handle something. . .Do you still wish to aid in the refinment of my ability?"* - Thu Oct  8 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Er... I just recently used lots of chakra trying to sustain our clan doujutsu for a little longer than I should've.. - Thu Oct  8 02:15:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) faintly frowns.

"You must be prepared. . . Mizora-chan. You realize how thirsty people are to attack members of our clan," the frown only increased. Her foot twists in the ground, digging up a small depression.

". . .Please. I do require actual experience. . . I've yet to battle someone htat was close to my level. . "* - Thu Oct  8 02:22:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) nods. That frown was turned upside down.

"Splendid! -- If your friend so wishes, she may observe us during our engagement. I have no issue," Mirai says in a proper tone, yet happy tone. She does a twirl, and moves towards the north to enable her body to reach a secluded area. There was nothing but sand and sandstones along the region. Assuming Mizora had complied, Mirai falls into a stance of her own, both palms opened and facing the opponent.

CHakra floods around her mits, giving a nice glow of blue and she gestures for the girl to prepare herself as well. "This should be good. . "* - Thu Oct  8 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) ||As they arrive, Mirai gets a bit more comfortable. Her cap and cloak are taken off and thrown to the side. Still, the Hokuma remains in her stance, staring fiercely to the fellow kunoichi. A leg slides along the ground, assisting or adjusting her balance. . "I'll let you commence the battle. Attack whenever you're ready," Mirai instructs, now wearing a neutral or expressionless face.

Chakra flared along her cranium, focusing in on the eyes. Due to this chain of events, veins popped around her face, lateral of her optics and thus improving her vision by far.  "Hopefully this can make us both far stronger than we were before this battle. . "
* - Thu Oct  8 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) nodded.

"Of course not! I'd never lay a harmful hand on a clansmen of my own. What advantage would there be to harming you. . ? And I can hardly locate tenketsu, nevermind attacking," she retorts, speaking truthfully. It took a highly skilled user of the gentle fist AND Byakugan to even think about striking a tenketsu regularly. Mirai, being just a rookie, could certainly only go after the chakra network itself to inflict internal damage.

Without another word, the beauty takes a step forward, closing the distance between the two with ease. As they're not in close ranged distance, chakra flared along her hands, clearly visible to anyone with specialized doujutsu. A simple, yet swift palm thrust is unleashed, holding enough velocity that it was on the fringe of being a blur.

It sails ahead, with the hops of striking the girl on the shoulder, releasing minor internal damage that could easily be repaired after battle. "Hyah!"* - Thu Oct  8 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) ||Hook. Line. Sinker.

The first blow had gone on perfectly, striking the intended shoulder. "Your hands are fast.  . . Like mine! And I'd prefer if we stick solely to clan abilities," Mirai instructs, after all .. . This was the whole point of the spar, to improve relations between clansmen. Sadly, before she can get out of range, Mizora had struck back.

Dexterously, just as the first blow was being unleashed, Mirai's wrist had been struck, sending a wave of pain through the appendage. But not even that was going to deter her training regiment. Legs sliding, her body pivots and repositions, making it more difficult to strike her, considering Mizora would have to readjust to attack at different angle. Three swift palms leave shortly after. One right handed towards the girl's waist, another to the hip,  followed by a third thrust onto her waist again.

This string of attack was with a bit more power, although still far from fatal. Why not wear the opponent down? If your waist and hip hurted, your mobility would suffer as a direct result.* - Thu Oct  8 03:21:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) ||". . .Punching would be fine. But you must master your gentle fist!" Mirai urges, charmed that her trio of attacks had hit it's mark, each time going further to weaken the black-haired kunoichi.

After the motion, Mirai is again adjusting her positioning, forcing the brittle grains underneath her feet to slide along the terrain. It sounded like sand paper being grinded against itself.  Wasting no time, the partially more experienced Hyuuga moved to take defensive measures. Her arms moved at an equally as swift pace-- making the battle gain an incline of intensity.

The first two blows find themselves deflected, yet the final lands right onto Mirai's shoulder, forcing precise chakra to seep thjough the body and attack her chakra network/muscle tissues directly. The collision is enough to force the Hokuma to grunt her teeth. Yet simultaneously with this, a left palm had been thrusted, all with the intent of attacking the largest source of chakra -- the belly. As per usual, this wouldn't be fatal, but could likely leave Mizora feeling a bit bad.* - Thu Oct  8 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) 's eyes remained fully trained on the young Kunoichi's fist. ". . What. . Is she trying to mix external damage with the gentle fist's style? Interesting concept, but no one that will be effective nevertheless," Mirai murmured to herself. Her body tensed, preparing for evacuation in the event that the blow actually forces her to do more than just a minor pivot of the body. 

As the jab comes through, her right arms swats forward, straying Mizora's blow right off course. It strikes the shoulder once more, unleashing internal hell onto the Hokuma's body -- but never once being fatal enough to hinder combat completely. By then, Mirai gets a bit enthusiastic or overzealous. Taking the punch in stride, both of her palms rush forward in unison.

A double palm thrust!

The blow aims to strike just above the stomach, but just below the vital areas in the chest. Chakra is used in excess, hopefully producing enough shock or damage to end the spar once and for all. Coupled with the strength being applied, this very well had the ability to throw the girl off course. "Double palm thrust! Take this!" Would this do the trick?* - Thu Oct  8 04:06:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've arrived at the location where most of the Shinobi in sunagakure seemed to hang out during their free time or when they weren't busy acting as Shinobi. In her arms would've been an unconscious Mizora. Peering around, she would spotted Sanoke and greeted him before she approached Koji. Parting her lips, she would speak in a fragile tone.

"I just had a spar with her. It seems we're about on the same level in terms of knowledge of our clan's techniques. When she wakes up we should all get together and do some group training and maybe bond if that's okay with you? It would be a nice step to take towards restoring the clan our ancestors worked so hard to build." Mirai muttered to Koji wondering if he would even respond or consider her suggestion after their last altercation.* - Thu Oct  8 04:26:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Gah. . .You sure you're ready for this? - Thu Oct  8 04:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: Mhmm. - Thu Oct  8 04:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Anywho. Let's go handle this thing then. - Thu Oct  8 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) || And so it began. Departing from Sungakure after being swept off of her feet into Sanoke's arms as per usual the Kunoichi would glance around as she was carried away as Sanoke sprinted rapidly. Coming to a halt for a second she would gaze around noticing that he stopped at a store to obtain some supplies that could be utilized during the mission. 

Being a rookie Mirai would've simply watched Sanoke pick out tools such as seals, tags, and weaponry. Once the two had stocked up on supplies she would've been swept off of her feet and into his arms once again in bridal fashion as the two of them began to move beyond the boarders of Sunagakure exiting the village. The sun would've gleamed upon them, causing both of the Shinobi to sweat profusely as they followed the map and headed towards the location in which they had to make several arrests and seal off the mines. 

Peering towards Sanoke as he kneeled down and conjured up a turtle. Mirai would take matters into her own hands, activating her Byakugan and extending her vision considerably. With her Byakugan active she would heed his orders and began to scan the area searching for an underground tunnel of some sort. 
Fortunately, her Byakugan granted her more than the ability to see the chakra network, but it allowed her to see the tunnel that was hidden underground. Parting her lips, she would speak in a delicate tone."Where you're standing. The tunnel is there and I see a numerous amount of people down there." Mirai muttered taking a step a back.* - Thu Oct  8 05:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) || "Hmm, that's right, you're standing on the entrance to the tunnel, " Mirai said, confirming that he was in fact standing above the location of the tunnel and it was right under his nose. She peered towards Sanoke as he summoned yet another turtle to assist the duo in completing the mission. 

She couldn't help but notice that the turtle possessed the same eyes as Sanoke however, she thought nothing of it being completely unaware of the Rinnegan and its abilities. Mirai watched carefully as both of the turtles began to dig into the ground hastefully so that the two Shinobi could enter the tunnel that was hidden underground. 

Nodding her head, she would listen intently to Sanoke as he conveyed the plan and how they would go about completing the mission. Being a rookie, she didn't question his judgement and found his plan to be legit. Being grasped by her wrist she would be guided into the dark caverns of the tunnel by Sanoke that had been created by his turtles. Thankfully, none of the workers who had been mining illegally had suspected them or taking notice to them for the time being. She would proceed to make her way through the tunnels in search of the bosses so that they could complete the mission without much of a scuffle and inconvenience.* - Thu Oct  8 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) was surprised that the plan was going so smoothly, but then again, they were Shinobi and they were trained to blend in and stealthy. With Sanoke still having a firm grip upon her wrist the two of them traveled deeper into the depths of the underground tunnel. Utilizing her Byakugan she would be scanning the area searching for a figure head or the boss of this entire operation as they travelled deeper into the tunnel. 

Lowering her voice she would speak to Sanoke ensuring that her voice was only audible enough for him to hear. Speaking amidst the individuals mining it would be difficult for them to hear what she was saying. "Don't forget to seal this place off. That is something else we were also tasked with." Mirai muttered to Sanoke reminding him that he had to seal off the tunnel. Pausing for a moment she would respond to his question as well. " I can likely knock them out without killing them. Hopefully this doesn't take long." Mirai said in a delicate tone. * - Thu Oct  8 06:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) was prepared to follow through with what Sanoke had suggested and would merely nod her head. Waiting patiently she allow Sanoke to prepare to release some gases into the air. After the scroll was withdrawn she would've waited for him to launch some bombs forward before they abruptly combused and gas lingered into the air. 

Once the gas would've lingered into the air obscuring the vision of the two leaders Mirai would've acted. With her Byakugan active she was capable of seeing both of her targets chakra network allowing her spot their location amid them being consumed in the gas that had been released into the air. Charging towards the duo Mirai's footsteps would've remained unaudible as she charged towards them. Once she closed the distance between herself and one of her targets she would've utilized her clans fighting style striking her target multiple times in a quick succession. Her movements were fluid and quick as she closed off the chakra passageway knocking one of the leaders unconcious. A thud would be heard as his body dropped to the ground. * - Thu Oct  8 06:33:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered towards Sanoke wih her lavender shaded optics. It seemed as though the shinobi felt guilt for making use of the eyes of someone who was already deceased. 

"Aslong as you weren't the one who murdered that person for their eyes. I'm not sure why but i'm not entirely upset or bothered by it. " Mirai muttered as he activated his Dojutsu causing two extra appendages to sprout from his body. She watched in awe as he effectively displayed this new ability he accquired after merging his eyes with someone elses. A smirk formed upon her face before laughter ensued after the joke was told. 

"Interesting. You've never mentioned to me that their were other individuals who possess the same eyes that you do. Our eyes are so precious and valueable we should be careful" The kunoichi explains in a fragile tone. * - Thu Oct  8 20:07:02 2015
