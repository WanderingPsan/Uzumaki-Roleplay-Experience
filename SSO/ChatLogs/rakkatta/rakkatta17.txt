"Nice to see that you are in good health. We should talk later. . " She says casually. Her body moving a bit towards the north to enter the plaza.* - Sun Nov  8 03:27:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) arrives in the local, Sunagakure plaza.

Her arms are held gently behind her back, lavander eyes go to examine the area. It's there that she notices two familiar faces, both related to her clan -- the Hokuma.

"Mizora, Koji. How are you both?"* - Sun Nov  8 03:30:46 2015

"I am your cousin, and more over, a leader. You can tell me anything, you know."* - Sun Nov  8 03:40:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: I've made progress with a few things... but not much in terms of our clan's techniques.. - Sun Nov  8 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) nods.

"Tell me then. Do you feel powerful enough to defeat me in combat now?" She asks with a brow perked. Mirai had been slacking as of late, and really needed to work off on the rust.* - Sun Nov  8 03:50:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) nods. She turns towards the south and motions Mizora to follow after. If not stopped, the two briskly head to a local diner.* - Sun Nov  8 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) ||And how convenient, the diner was just right of the square.

With model-like gait, she pranced down the sandy road, before pressing a hand against the door. The door squeaks open, prompting a diligent entrance.

Mirai paused, placing both hands onto her hips, to survey the spacious area. "Hrm. . . " Eventually, her lavendar eyes settle onto the area towards the right. In the same, casual manner, the woman takes a seat towards the wall. She fidgets, getting onto a comfortable position and thus resting both hands onto the fine, wooden table.

"Waiter. . ?"

And on call, one of the employees rushes over, granting two menus for the party of two. Welcoming smiles are exchanged before her eyes fall onto Mizora, a Hokuma that often was troublesome. "So. Tell me, what have you been up to? In detail. Also, feel free to order what you'd like."* - Sun Nov  8 04:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) sighs. 

She interjects, giving a glance to the waitress. "For me. . .A simple bowl of Veggie Ramen. Mmm, and a dumpling as a side. Get the same order for the girl, except make her's Meaty," Mirai comments. She speaks in dignified, yet gently demanding tone, before her gaze falls onto Mizora.

There's a brief period of quietness, but it lacks any awkwardness.

Mirai would simply look at her, pupils moving up and down to examining the troubled kunoichi. Each look gives Mirai a better idea, and the fact that Mizora was uncomfortable was undeniable.

"Hrm. . .You seem uneasy."

She leans forward. "Speak to me. You know, there is nothing you'll have to hide. After all, someday I may very well be the leader of the Hokuma. I want to have a good relationship with my kin."
* - Sun Nov  8 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) taps her fingers impatiently along the table.

Why was Mizora so insistent on beating around the bush -- Or so she thought, until the girl finally spoke up.

"Ah. You have mental issues? It is nothing to be ashamed of, dear. As you'd know, so did my twin sister. But Icherished her all the same. You don't have to hide anything from me, you know," the Hyuuga clanswoman stated. By then, the order was just about done. In the time that the two had been speaking, several platters of ramen were brewing. The liquids were bubbling, each time popping once enough heat had been produced.

This gives rise to a steady flow of steam, and forces the aroma -- the seasoned, salty aroma -- to flow through the air. With a gentle sniff, Mirai hums, pleased by the smell. "I think the food is about done. So tell me -- Have you been getting into any trouble due to these. . 'issues'?" She asks gently.

By then, the waiter returns, setting the bowls onto the table. Two dishes of dumplings follow shortly after, with complimentary, sugary cream to serve as dip.* - Sun Nov  8 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) calmly looked down, grabbing a pair of chopsticks.

It goes to gather up a good chunk of noodles, each strand flavorable after having been marinated in the liquids. In a regal fashion, Mirai slurps it up, before wipingh er lips with a napkin.

Upon taking note of Mizora's gesture, the 'elder' Hokuma leans inward, brows perked. 

"And what did you do?"* - Sun Nov  8 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) continued to gathered additional noodles.

She sighs, before gesturing the waiter to bring some drinks.

"When you left the village? And I'm surprised you're unharmed. Going rogue is a serious offense."* - Sun Nov  8 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: I stayed in Konoha.. the village I was born in. - Sun Nov  8 05:43:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: What if I could combine Lightning and Wind? They're both "quick" elements. - Sun Nov  8 05:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Do-able I suppose. I wish you the besto f luck in your endeavors. - Sun Nov  8 05:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Same with your medical ninjutsu.... - Sun Nov  8 05:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) blinks. 

She didn't want the conversation to end. After a second, her digits move, grabbing one of the dumplings and taking a bite. After nibbling, she looks ahead. "So tell me. We're cousins, yet no so little about one another. Tell me of yourself."* - Sun Nov  8 05:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) thinks: My likes and dislikes are all that came to mind... nnnh.. - Sun Nov  8 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) nods.

In time, the bulk of her ramen had been consumed, leaving only a single dumpling in place. "Ah. Then me ordering those dumplings was a wise idea. You do like sweets," she replies casually.

Once more, Mirai falls silent, again waiting for the fellow Hokuma to finish.

"Ah. That's odd. For what reason do you continue to live in an apartment? I may be willing to offer you a space at my home. . . And yes, I do wish there were more social events in Sunagakure. A festival sounds nice," Mirai replies with a smile. 

"Our likes are similiar. Although, in addition, I do love to be pampered. I like shopping as well as looking good. I dislike. . . Mmm, dirty things, rude people,  and so forth. "* - Sun Nov  8 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Treatment doesn't matter to me as long as I'm not being abused. Shopping isn't a big deal either.... - Sun Nov  8 06:16:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: The fact that it seems that I'll never experience it.. I guess. - Sun Nov  8 06:21:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) shifts her gaze to the two that just came in.

"I wasn't aware they worked here," Mirai notes offhandily. Her attention falls onto Mizora shortly after, and a defeated shrug is given. "I can't force you. But I implore you to at least try. All you need is the positives to outweigh the negative, than you'll be a shoe-in."* - Sun Nov  8 06:25:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) ||She quickly falls into a stance just as Mizora does.

Chakra billowed towards her eyes, just as the stance is obtained. Quickly, her body dips towards the right, allowing for a narrow evasion. Her finger tips moved, allowing Mirai's hand to potentially make contact with the Hokuma's shoulder. On cue, this meant an unleash of chakra.

"On second thought. . .It may be a bit late. You seem fatigue. We can have our battle later."* - Sun Nov  8 07:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) pulls back given the brief exchange.

"Ah. . I forgot about that. You're injured."

A brief bow is given, granting Mizora a farewell. "I'll let you go take care of yourself."* - Sun Nov  8 07:50:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sure. - Wed Nov 11 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've arrived at the destination that Sanoke had desired so that the two of them could train in seclusion. Jumping out of his arms she would allow her feet to touch the surface once again before she peered towards her fiance as he began to explain the method of how to perform the technique that he was teaching her. 

Listening intently she would nod her head occasionally as she absorbed the information on the technique that she was learning. After Sanoke had finished explaining the technique in detail she would simply nod her head before she mimicked the demonstration that he did a few moments. Being a Hyuuga she was familiar with Yang release since some of her clan's techniques utilized that form of chakra. 

Recalling what Sanoke had said moments ago she would amass a significant amount of chakra. Feeling the chakra that she had mustered up coursing through her body she would then guide said chakra into each individual strand of her long ravashing hair. Infusing chakra into her hair she would begin to manipulate it's properties causing it to gradually grow longer at her will. Despite performing the technique she was still a rookie and wasn't utilizing the technique to it's full potiential.

"Sounds like a rather useful technique and I can bet people won't be expecting me to utilize my hair in combat. I'll be making this technique my signature my move it no longer belongs to you it belongs to me." Mirai muttered clearly enraptured by the technique and the fact that she could use her hair in combat.* - Wed Nov 11 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) noticed Sanoke roll his eyes and she rolled hers in return.

Peering towards him as he boasted she would merely watch him perform another technique which seemed like one that the technique he had shown her derived from. She watched in awe as he displayed the jutsu for her and noticed that his mane became more durable and placed dents within the terrain that was nearby. Parting her lips she would speak in a serious tone. "Wow! so you teach me the lesser version of the jutsu. You're so selfish and you're ego is so huge you need to humble yourself you little twit!." Mirai muttered to Sanoke clearly jealous that he had taught her a lesser version of a stronger technique that he knew.* - Wed Nov 11 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's a badass technique, though. Right? - Wed Nov 11 04:41:10 2015
