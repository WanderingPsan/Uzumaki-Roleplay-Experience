<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've held the orange within the palm of her hand. removing a scapel from the kit Mirai would begin to cut into the orange cutting the skin a bit so that fruit's flesh was exposed. Once she had done that she would tie a knot at the end and begin to complete the first stitch at the very end of the area where she cut the orange. 

Like Kiyoko had instructed she made sure that it wasn't to tight and also made sure that it was straight. Her hands would move in a circular motion as she followed Kiyoko's instruction on how to properly motion her hands in order to properly stitch. She was a bit sloppy however she was doing well for someone who had never done this before. Her hands would curve down and then forward to underneath the skin of the fruit before she came back up. Mirai would repeat this process until she had successfully stitched the entire orange back together.* - Fri Nov 13 07:39:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've arrived at the usual training location alongside Sanoke and Paine. Mirai was prepared to begin her training and work on the move that her and paine had previously been working. Mirai had been in the process of improving her skills in every area. She had even been working on becoming a medical shinobi and now she was going to work on her Taijutsu with someone exceptionally skilled in that area. 

Having already had some experience with performing the technique she assumed it require much effort of time to perform correctly. Taking a running start the Hyuuga would dash towards Paine before she leaped into the air. Amid being in the air she would extend her right leg and would remain balanced whilst she soared through the air. She recalled what Paine had said to her the last time they were working on the technique. Mirai's posture would've been nearly perfect as she soared the air and her leg clashed into the palm of Paine's hand

"How was that?" Mirai inquired wondering how she did. She had performed the technique incorrectly twice before so she wasn't certain if she did it correctly this time.* - Fri Nov 13 08:25:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've glanced towards Paine as she stood on the opposite side of the Kunoichi. She wanted to test her Taijutsu skills and she figured a spar with Paine would be interesting since they both utilized Taijutsu and she knew that Paine would be a formidable foe.  

Channeling chakra to her optics veins would pretend her temples as she activated her Dojutsu empowering her significantly and granting her the ability to see Paine's chakra network. With her Dojutsu activated the woman felt empowered and with her vision expanded she was ready to fight with Paine. Gazing towards the woman as she charged towards her Mirai would pivot on her heel spinning rapidly. 

Utilizing a technique that was devised by members of her clan to defend themselves she would release chakra from each Tenketsu in her body forming a dome of chakra around her in order to defend herself and repel Paine away from her. The woman was strong and she couldn't afford to be struck by the woman's leaf whirlwind. 

Should she succeed a giant crater would've been left within the earth after she ceased her spinning. She was aware of how strong the woman was and wasn't sure if she was durable enough to withstand several hits from the woman however she was willing to spar her to assess her fighting ability.* - Fri Nov 13 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) ||Admist her spining she would've noticed that her rotation was being detroyed as the woman's feet was planted upon the dome of chakra. Mirai had never had her rotation destroyed and she always assumed that it was strong enough to defend anything even the strongest jutsu. 

Mirai would've eventually came to halt as Paine would've retacted backwards distancing herself a bit away from the Hokuma. She peered towards the woman as she charged towards her once again with an immense amount speed. Fortunately, her Byakugan allowed her to keep up with her movements which would help her significantly when it came to contending with the Taijutsu expert. 
Being able to keep up with her movements do to her eye Mirai would backflip away from Paine in order to evade the strike and avoid being launched within the air. Once she had distanced herself she would sprint towards the woman before she leaped into the air. 

Retracting her right leg and extending her left. Her left leg would've been aimed directly towards Paine's chest as she executed the technique that Paine had recently taught her. "Dynamic Entry!" Mirai called out as she attempted to strike her sensei.* - Sat Nov 14 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) Can an admin give me medic?* - Sat Nov 14 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've successfully evaded Paine's attack. Unfortunately the woman had actually assumed that she would avoid the technique and she fell right into the woman's trap. Whilst she was in the air, she would've noticed the woman had appeared  near her and began to assault her with a various measure of quick kicks. 

Although she had seen the woman coming she wasn't capable of dodging and contending with the Taijutsu expert. Being a subject to an overwhelming amount of kicks she would be sent flying in the opposite direction away from Paine. Mirai wasn't very durable thus the kicks would've taken a toll on her and would've caused her an immense amount of pain, however, she will wouldn't allow her to give up so easily. 

Contorting her body whilst in midair, she would land on her feet once more glancing towards the woman. A fearsome gaze would've been fixated upon Paine before Mirai sprinted off towards the woman at a brisk rate. Once she was in close enough proximity Mirai would begin her attack. 

Crouching down, she would enter her usual position when she prepared to utilize her clans fighting style one that was notorious in Konohagakure. Extending her palms forwards Mirai would deliver a series of palm thrust. Her palms would've remained opened as she aimed to strike the woman's chakra passageway system directly by utilizing the style known as gentle fist.

 If her attacks were to land Paine would feel an immense amount of pain and the flow of her chakra would be disrupted a bit. Mirai moved gracefully as she performed her clans fighting style demonstrating her ability to not only perform the fighting style, but accuracy when it came to striking chakra points and ability to utilize her Byakugan.* - Sat Nov 14 01:03:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've arrived at the hospital and noticed that Kiyoko was already working on tending to Nina's wound. Nina had sustained a grievous injury that could've ended her life during a spar. After hearing Kiyoko's instructions Mirai would simply nod her head exiting the room to obtain a robe and some gloves. 


Once she had placed on the robe and gloves and was in the proper attire she would retrieve the stitching kit and return back to the room handing Kiyoko the stitching kit. Fortunately, Kiyoko had shown Mirai how to properly stitch up wounds so aiding the woman in the surgery wouldn't have been too inconvenient for the Byakugan princess.  After she had handed Kiyoko the stitching kit she would depart the room once more before she returned with three heat packs and a blanket. Taking initiative Mirai would place the heat packs around her arms once Kiyoko had removed the Gauze of course.* - Sat Nov 14 07:58:43 2015

Once she had removed the tourniquet she would inject it into the IV just as Kiyo had requested. Listening to the woman Mirai would take a mental note making sure to retain the information since she planned on dabbling into the medical field. Parting her lips the Byakugan Princess would speak in a delicate in tone.

"I'll get her cleaned and changed Kiyoko." Mirai said before she got a cotton swap and ran cool water on and utilized mild soap. Mirai would begin to clean the area, removing dirt, debris, and any bacteria in order to prevent the wound from becoming infected. (dats nasteh) . Once she had done, she would proceed with changing the child into a hospital gown. Being mindful of her injury Mirai made sure to be gentle.

"Not sure who she is related to, but she mentioned Lera. You should inform her." Mirai suggested recalling what the child said amid her being tended to.* - Sat Nov 14 08:25:10 2015
