<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) ||It wasn't long until she had returned home from Sunagakure.

Now? There was the small task of completing the delivery mission that had been assigned day's prior. Thankfully, it seemed that Hassan wasn't too annoyed, nor irritated considering her inability to complete it in a timely fashion. Diligently, the Hyuuga rushed ahead, moving into the outskirts to perform the mission at long last.

It would take rough twenty minutes of sprinting -- which was done nonstop, in order to reach the mission area. As a shinobi, her conditioning was exceptional, on par with the finest olympian atheletes. Thus, upon arriving, there is hardly any sign of fatigue, although Mirai does huff and puff a bit heavier than youcould anticipate. After taking a brief moment to gather her breath, the young kunoichi is moving on, taking the supplies from the dispatch area and heading onward from into the distance.

As a genin, it was very unlikely that she;'d have to deal with an out of village mission. THus, upon reading the scroll, Mirai heads right on towards the south. The vilalge was as hot as could be, yet by now, the young Hokuma had grown used too, or acclimated to the rough climate. At a brisk pace, the white-haired beaut menadered to the south, her arms barely able to force the large cart of items to follow behind her.

In time, however, the designated area s reached. She neatly sets the cart by the bustling building, one at the still-in-construction colosseum. The workers give their thanks, prompting Mirai to bow herself. With a smile, the teen waddles off, prepared to accept the mission completion.* - Tue Oct 20 05:09:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've arrived at the training grounds alongside Sanoke prepared to learn the technique known as Shunshin. She thought the technique was useful and would be a great addition to her arsenal of jutsu. Unfortunately her training with Sanoke had been delayed due to him spending time with others rather then with her. 

Peering towards him she would observe him as his hands came together forming a single seal- the Ram seal. As she listened she assumed that the technique would be easy due to the simple fact that most of her clans technique revolved around building up an abundant amount of chakra. Once Sanoke was done elaborting on how to perform the jutsu Mirai figured it was best she attempt to perform the technique that he had just exhibited for her. Clasping her hands together she would form the ram hand seal amassing a considerible measure of chakra guideing her chakra into her cells efore she kicked off of the ground to perform a fast paced sprint. Mirai however didn't sprint very far and will feel the drawbacks of performing the technique especially since she wasn't a skilled practioner of the technique just yet.* - Tue Oct 20 17:28:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: You know the drill my love. - Wed Oct 21 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've been swept off of the ground and into Sanoke's arms bridal style before the two left and went to the training grounds so both of them could train in seclusion. Once the two arrived at the training grounds she permitted him to set her down on the ground allowing her feet to touch the surface. A smile framed upon her face as she looked towards Sanoke before she separated her lips to talk in a genuine tone. "In light of your absence of aptitude in Taijutsu this is going to take us a long while till you perfect this technique, however, i'll have you know I don't have time for any babble and i won't permit you to slack on your training. You will learn and master this technique or you will die trying maggot!" Mirai mumbled in a genuine tone seeming like a drill sergent. The typical sweet persona that she displayed would've appeared to vanish in a moment as she spoke with Sanoke. 

taking a step back away from Sanoke Mirai would get ready to display the procedure and further clarify the points of interest of said method. "A practitioner of this technique dispatches a progression of high kicks and low kicks. The high kick should be executed swiftly and fluidly subsequently enlarging the chances for the low kick to hit the mark. " Mirai said to Sanoke as she prepared to exhibit the technique separating it into steps. 

Lifting her leg off the ground the Hyuuga would release a high kick into the air showing her physical ability and general expertise in Taijutsu. "One" Mirai murmured before she followed up with a leg sweep dropping to the ground and turning a whole 360 degrees with her leg stretched out. "Two." the Hyuuga said successfully separating the steps required to perform the method in pieces. 

"I want you to perform those progressions in pieces for me then I need you to chain the movements together. Keep in mind that the first assault ought to be significantly quick and is used to ensnare your foe and increase your chances of the low kick to land" Mirai said before she removed a whistle from her cleavage blowing it signalling for Sanoke to start his training.

In Between her blowing the whistle she would pause for a bit to yell demands at Sanoke. 

"Cmon Zaddy!"
"Faster!"
"Kick!"
"Everyone was kung-fu fightingggg!"

Mirai shouted watching him as he trained clearly enjoying watching the love of her life.* - Wed Oct 21 03:36:44 2015
