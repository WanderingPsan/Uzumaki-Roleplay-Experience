"All you've managed to do is multiply what little drama in my life by tenfold. I don't want to be associated with any of that. Are you -seriously- trying to kick my emotions in the shin when they just barely got back on the train of stability? It's not like you cared about me back when I was suffering anyways. Fuck off. Don't talk to me until you decide to stop being a melodramatic, uptight whore. 
PS: On second thought, don't talk to me -ever- again. ''

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) arrives.* - Fri Dec  4 11:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've flickered into view of her comrades and the individual whom she didn't know through the use of shunshin. Fortunately for the Hokuma she was capable of locating the individual along with her comrades by activating her Byakugan. 

Peering towards the individual before she diverted her attention towards Mitsunara she would simply nod her head before she began to scan the area utilizing her Byakugan to search for anything out of the ordinary. Once she scanned the area, she would approach the merchant who sat upon the ground helplessly. 

"Greetings we were sent by the Kazekage to come to aid. Mind telling me what happened?" Mirai inquired peering towards the individual. * - Fri Dec  4 12:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) || Through the use of her Byakugan the Hokuma was able to spot a numerous amount of things. Halting, she would reach for Mitsunara's attempting to hold the woman in place, preventing her from venturing closer towards the merchant. She would squint towards the merchant as he shook his head, attempting to stop the trio of Shinobi from venturing any further. 

"It seems as though you were correct Mitsunara. In fact, this is a trap and the individual who attacked this merchant seems to be skilled in fuuinjutsu. Unfortunately, I lack knowledge in the area and I'm not quite sure what the seals on the explosive tags buried under the ground mean. For now be cautious you two." Mirai muttered to her comrades as she remained where she was not taking a step closer towards the individual.* - Fri Dec  4 12:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: They are all around the place. - Fri Dec  4 12:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka(Lolplz) thinks: Just need them to step forward. . .Could blow this place sky high. - Fri Dec  4 12:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered forwards watching an individual burrow underground at a quick pace as they attempted to rob Mitsunara's clone of its freedom and drag it underneath the surface. Her gaze was fixated upon the individual for a moment as his armor lustered as the sunlight shined upon it. 

Without hesitation Mirai would've began to knead chakra into her hair follicles effectively increasing the speed of her hair growth. By now the Hokuma's hair would've increased by a considerable length. Strands of her silver hair would've jutted forwards towards the merchant who was incapacitated.  Her beautiful strands of hair would've coiled around him before she  hoisted the merchant into the air utilizing her hair to capture the merchant and bring him out of harms way.  

"Picking on helpless merchants. You must think you're so cool don't you?" Mirai inquired peering towards the individual whom had revealed themselve.* - Fri Dec  4 12:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Wait, the Merchant is probably not re- - Fri Dec  4 12:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) Peered towards the individual whom had revealed himself. Mirai would get a glimpse of the individual as she evacuated the merchant to safety. The. Abruptly an explosion would've occurred causing smoke and debri to form in the atmosphere. 

She would grit her teeth as she suffered minor burns from the explosion. Gazing forward, she would notice an array of Shuriken traveling towards her. The smoke, of course obscured the vision of her comrades, however the Hokuma was capable of seeing everything that took place whilst the smoke had enveloped their bodies. Reaching for her back pouch she would attempt to evade the Shuriken that had been launched towards but unfortunately several land leaving deep lacerations upon her skin. Crimson red began to spill from her flesh as the Shuriken struck her.

* - Fri Dec  4 13:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered towards Chikyu as she advanced forwards towards the rogue Shinobi. The Hokuma would've sprinted forwards as well, attempting to aid the Kunoichi now that Taka had revealed himself. She couldn't help but notice that the individual adorned armor, which made her fighting style completely useless during this fight, however, she was still exceptionally skilled at Taijutsu and didn't need to solely depend on attacking his chakra network. 

Once she was in close enough proximity the Hokuma would've extended her leg forward sending a series of kicks towards the Rogue Shinobi. Her low kicks were aimed towards his abdominal area and her high kicks were of course aimed towards his head since it was the only area that was shielded by the armor. Mirai would've chained together each individual kick swiftly executing the kicks one after another displaying that she was proficient in Taijutsu. Behind each kick would've been an immense amount of force.* - Fri Dec  4 13:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Gameplay graphics, don't make up for your bad 20 hour story0 - Fri Dec  4 13:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've chained together a series of kicks that were only blocked by the Shinobi and his armor. Unfortunately the Hokuma would've been slashed along her chest, leaving a deep laceration upon her beautiful skin. Despite this she wasn't going to give up and allow him to get away with possibly leaving a permanent scar upon her frame. 

Peering towards him as he rushed towards the merchant who wasn't being defended she would've rolled her eyes before she extended her palm forward and began to knead chakra to her palm. Suddenly a significant amount of air would've been discharged from her palm in the form of a compressed air bullet. 
The attack would've been condensed of air and would've been discharged towards the individual at pinpoint accuracy with the help of her Byakugan.  Mirai aimed to strike the individual with her technique attempting to stop him from closing the distance between himself and the merchant who they were sent to protect.

"What a fucking corward." Mirai thought to herself watching his attempt to flee the fight and attack a defenseless merchant.* - Fri Dec  4 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka(Lolplz) says: OH - Fri Dec  4 14:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered forwards as her technique travelled forwards towards the rogue Shinobi striking him and effectively knocking him away from the helpless merchant for a bit. Due to the nature of her futon, based techniques they were undetectable to the naked eye, however the Hokuma was prepared for seeing the little vacuum shells of compacted air that had been discharged by Taka because of her Byakugan. 

The Hokuma intuitively would've sprinted towards the maverick Shinobi. She would've ran towards him in a capricious way, obviously sporadically transforming her course trying to avoid the shots of packed air that was released towards her.Should she succeed and close the distance between them she would start to release a few kicks towards Taka. 

This time, however Mirai's assault was distinctive she began with a low kick before she fastened together her methods in a succession. Once she conveyed her low kick she would've executed a center kick and afterward a high kick endeavoring to knock Taka into the air. 

With each individual kick Mirai would contort her body and as the rotation accelerated she would've gained buoyancy, which permitted her to move into bit by bit higher kicks. Every kick was timed and once one landed another followed shortly after. Once both of them were sufficiently high enough into the air the Hokuma would've finished off the combo with a heel drop endeavoring to send Taka plunging down towards the surface with concussive force.* - Fri Dec  4 14:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) Was growing quite frustrated with Taka's antics and attempts to murder both the merchant and Chikyu. Both of them were helpless at the moment and couldn't seem to defend themselves at the moment. Framing a single seal she would create two  doppelgngers. 

Both clones would extend an open palm forward releasing a compressed bullet of air towards the weapons launched towards Chikyu and the merchant in an attempt to change the trajectory of the weapons and knock them off course. If this were to succeed Mirai simply hit Taka in the temple with her elbow attempting to knock him out. She felt bad for him and wasn't a fan of brutally murdering people.* - Fri Dec  4 15:22:27 2015
