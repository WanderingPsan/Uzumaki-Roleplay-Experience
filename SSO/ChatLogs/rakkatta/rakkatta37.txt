<br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: No one is allowed upstairs, but I see your point. - Wed Dec  2 07:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sure. - Wed Dec  2 07:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Strip. - Wed Dec  2 07:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered towards Sanoke as he placed his hands together and formed a single seal causing a plume of smoke to envelop his frame. As the smoke dissipated, she would've noticed that Sanoke had removed every article of clothing except for his boxer shorts. Naturally the Hokuma would've been mesmerized and her gaze would've instantly been fixated upon his muscular physique. 

Her cheeks would've flushed almost instantly and her cheeks were a bright red. She would've simply gazed at his well sculpted body as if she was in a trance. Seeing that he had changed into the proper attire Mirai would form a single hand seal as well, causing a plume of smoke to envelop her as well. Once the smoke had subsided the Kunoichi would be standing before her Fiance in lingerie. 

The Lingerie would've clung to her curvaceous frame accentuating all of her curves and even exposing a bit of her cleavage. The fabric was made of lace and was a bit transparent, allowing the Shinobi to get a glimpse of all of her womanly parts. Upon her legs would've been stockings that were extended to her thighs, which showed off her long legs. 

After she had changed into the appropriate attire the woman motioned Sanoke to the bed. Guiding her fiance to the bed, she would've peered towards him as he rested upon the mattress. Without hesitation, she would've opened a drawer and removed a bottle of massaging oil from it. Removing the nozzle from the bottle she would pour some of the oil into the palm of her hands before she rubbed her palms together coating them in the oil. 

Approaching Sanoke she would extend her palm out towards the shinobi as she began to knead the oil into his back. She attempted to stroke all the stress out of his being with the palms of her hands. Mirai would part her lips occasionally speaking to her husband whilst the two of them were in the moment.

"I'm sorry if I've been acting strangely lately. I just haven't been getting the time that I'm used to getting to you before you taken on the role as Kazekage. It's something I'm not quite accustomed to. I want to be special in your life, and I want to share things that no one else shares with you." Mirai stated as she continued to massage the Shinobi.* - Wed Dec  2 08:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) listened intently to her fiancé as he spoke. His words seemed to put her at ease and she was less tense now that the two of them were enjoying each others company and seemed to have an understanding making their bond that much stronger. Parting her lips the Hokuma would speak in a delicate tone responding to her fiancé s statement. 

"I get carried away at times, but it's only because I care. It's a bit selfish, but I don't want to share you with anyone. I'll attempt to be more understanding and less hostile about the situation, but I must admit I like arguing sometimes." Mirai muttered peering down towards his back seeing that he was glistening with the massage oil. 

Mirai would've been hovering over his back, gazing down towards him in awe. Her cleavage would've shook a bit as if they wanted to be freed from the confinement of the fabric of the lingerie. Her teats would've been erect leaving an imprint upon the bra. 

Strands of her gorgeous silver hair would've framed upon her face as she began to massage the oil into his skin in a circular motion. Mirai made sure to be gentle and whilst she caressed her partner's flesh delicately massaging him. She would've worked her way down his back, leaving no area unscathed as she worked her magic.* - Wed Dec  2 08:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered towards Sanoke as his extended towards her chest. Peering down towards his hand her cheeks would be completely flushed as he began to fondle her breast. Peering into his optics, she could see the desire as the two of them were in the midst of having an intimate moment.             

"I've never taken a class for this I've given a few massages to Madelyn before but I don't recall ever practicing. It's just something that comes naturally I suppose." Mirai stated as she continued to knead the oil into his flesh. Now his entire back was glistening with the oil that she had poured into the palm of her hands. By now the Hokuma would simply be trailing her hands up and down along his back slowly.* - Wed Dec  2 09:00:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: How did you do that? - Wed Dec  2 09:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Well, start by controling your chakra. Let it flow through the body and into your palms.  - Wed Dec  2 09:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: It's easier using the stance I just used. - Wed Dec  2 09:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Let me mke another clone. - Wed Dec  2 09:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) || After arriving at Koji's usual training area the Hokuma would stand directly next to her relative peering towards him as he began to exhibit the technique that he would be teaching her. She watched him intently as he activated his Dojutsu and expelled a burst chakra from his hand, causing a massive amount of air to be expelled from the palm of his hand. 

After the exhibition that Koji had displayed for her and the explanation the Hokuma would simply nod her head before her body shifted and she entered her stance. Parting her feet a bit the Hokuma would position herself so that she was in her stance. Much like Koji had done moments prior she would extend her open forward before she began to Amass a significant amount of chakra through her palms. 

This was an easy feat to accomplish for the Hokuma since she had been doing this practically her entire life and her clans fighting style consists of individuals kneading chakra to their palms.  Abruptly a vacuum shell compressed of air is formed and is launched towards the wall, causing dirt and debris to rise into the air. 

Once the debri and dirt had subsided Mirai would've peered towards Koji after her attempt to perform the technique. Despite performing the technique, it wasn't controlled and didn't pinpoint an exact target like the technique was supposed to however Mirai was still a beginner and needed to practice more in order to learn how to utilize the technique correctly and effortlessly.* - Wed Dec  2 09:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Flow like water. - Wed Dec  2 09:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) glanced towards the clone that Koji had created before she would simply nod her head. Distancing herself from the clone she would peer towards it. With her Byakugan active her perception was increased significantly, which would likely help with her aim. 

Extending her palm forwards the Hokuma would confidently began to knead chakra into her palm. Amassing chakra into her palm a surge of chakra would expel from her hand creating a vacuum shell. The compressed air would be launched directly towards the clone and upon collision would cause the clone to disrupt and create a plume of smoke. Mirai was quite surprised that she had managed to strike the clone with the technique, but then again, she had the help of her Byakugan which made things less troublesome for her.

"Still not great but I plan on practicing a bit more before I even consider performing it in combat. I'd hate to hit a comrade with this technique." Mirai muttered being mindful of how powerful the technique was and how it could effect her and her comrades if she didn't learn how to properly perform and utilize the technique correctly.* - Wed Dec  2 09:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: That's wise! But, you did well. - Wed Dec  2 09:55:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) sighs.

She gives an obedient nod. "I'd suppose it would be worth a try. You are the master here. . . And I am the student," Mirai says, relenting with some hesistance. "Thank you for the tutelage, by the by," the Hokuma continued with a smile. With a quick step forward, she's upon the kawaii-looking rock. 

Her legs or feet plant firmly within the sand, allowing her upper body to dip and her lower body to casually take a crouch. Regardless of the positioning, it made things apparent that Mirai's center of balance had never once been compromised. To the contrary, using her taijutsu knowledge, the young adult was in perfect positioning to perform the sweeping kick motion.

"Leaf Whirlwind!" 

After the declaration, her body breaks off into a spin, so swift that her form was borderline breaking into a swirl. Amidst the rotation, one leg is sent out, while the other serves as the only agent to balance her center of gravity. Building up the momentum, a kick lands onto the silver-colored rock, the collision enough to produce a thunderous sound effect. . . But the rock never moved an inch, showcasing less than adequate physical strength.

THWAP!

Thankfully, despite her curved and fragile appearance, Mirai's body was remarkably sturdy, making only a slight amount of discomfort able to sprout up. Having completed the motion, she does again, two additional times, before giving a glance onto Paine. 

"Phew. . .How was that?"* - Wed Dec  2 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) nodded.  She wore a smile, proud that Paine had some words of encouragement to give. She wasn't exactly off by a long shot either, as the speed was there. . . All that was missing was control. Her beautiful, lavender eyes narrow, staring to the earthly opponent as if it had stolen her money. "Alright! I'll try this again. . .If I can do my Heavenly Rotation skill, certainly. . . I can do this!"

Confidently, the woman crouched again, and reassumed the stance from before. Her thick, shapely legs were firmly pressing against the ground, each appendage shouldering an equal amount of weight. This made it certain, her center of balance would never be off, save for an earthquake or someone attacking with suffficient force. BUt that wasn't the issue. . . 

It'd be to balance one's self with a single leg. Naturally, with her heart racing, the woman proceeded to spin, each revolution granting greater momentum and thus power. In two seconds flat, Mirai had broken off into a rapid circling, her body being nothing short of a blur -- comprised of black, red and silver. Her hair elegantly fluttered through the air, and of course, wind was becoming apparent.

No doubt, as a Hokuma, speed and precision is what she excelled in. . .Although, judging by the athletic and tone build sported, she could also take a hit and dish it out. For about five seconds, the spinning continued, as the woman was determined to ensure that she was in complete control of her body -- all of this occuring on one leg. Before long, the secondary leg is jutted out, with the base of the foot being the epic center.

Leaning close, a vicious kick again is landed onto the rock. This time, the construct jolts back and forth, just barely moved by the force the young teen could generate. "HIYA!" Mirai shouted aloud, the  battlecry being sort of a motivator in ways.  Her leg hurted a tad, as some of the force was transferred back, but generally the Byakugan wielder is okay.

With slight sweat, she sweetly looks on over to the COncealed Figured. "How. . . How was that?"* - Wed Dec  2 22:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: 9qq - Wed Dec  2 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) stepped back, smiling that her work had been praised at last.

A quick bow is performed. "Thank you. . . This was hard, work. But I can already feel my kicking power becoming more potent, Paine. May you have a safe trip," the Hokuma stated sweetly. She was a bit tired, of course, and opted to just linger on as the Concealed Figure move to exit the village.* - Wed Dec  2 22:58:08 2015

Also since it would be impossible for Mirai to accept otherwise, I'm giving her and Sanoke special seats that way she can dress as the maid to serve Sanoke alone.

"Got to get stronger. . ." Mirai muttered to herself.

She kicks off the ground, allowing her curved form to rush through the air. It was like watching a speeding bullet, as the Hokuma rushed to find a more private location.

In time, she does jsut that. Remarkably, the training region was devoid of most life, but still possessed  many rocks. One even manage to rival the size of Paine's traditional training rock, fitted with 'faces' drawn on by paint. She pressed ahhead, and once in the distance, began to write a series of diagrams along the rocky structure of the boulder.

Very dots, some the size of a nickle, others as small as a pin, were written about. The point was to properly mimic chakra points, or even pressure points that naturally existed on the body. For her training, the point was to be continued ascent in terms of precision, as well as working on her overall attack speed. Not to mention other attributes.

"I have to get stronger with my gentle fist. . . And I have to become faster. If I can work on increasing the amount of chakra I produce in a single blow, it could make my gentle fist more potent. But the problem lies in this, if I use a higher quantity, it becomes impossible to control in single bursts. I won't be able to use it to accurately assault my on their insides. . ."

Regardless, even if the hurdles were as clear as day, Mirai had relented to overcome them. Once in place, chakra is kneaded from her belly and guided to the eyes. Without any hesistation, her unique biology reacted to the flood of chakra. It forces veins to laterally spawn around the side of the female's face, and of course grants enhanced sight. The enhancement came in both seeing distance, as well as the sheer amount of angles that could be targetted.

With that activated, her attention to detail is enhanced. Mirai's arms routinely thrutted through the air. This time around, she was going max capacity from start to finish, to aid in building upt he necessary muscle memory to target those pin points on a daily basis.  Her hands to the naked eye would be simple blurs, each one hitting their mark and sending a burst of chakra onto the poor, earthly substance.

The second the energy crashed against the minerals, it discharged, sending cracks along the exterior. Repeated assault only sprouted more cracks -- which wasn't what had been intended. She was looking to only strike the dots previously scribbled. For the next half hour, that's all Mirai did. She kept on with the endless assault. On roughly three percent, the goal or intent had been reached.

". . Not consistent enough. ." Given the tireless training, she eventually goes to rest, having enough training for the day.* - Thu Dec  3 04:40:19 2015

She would've gazed towards each combatant observing them before she placed her hands together and quickly contorted her digits forming a single hand seal. After she had formed that single hand seal veins would begin to sprout upon her face around her temples. Her lavender shaded optics would've been fixated upon the opposing team as she activated her Byakugan which expanded her vision and perception considerably, allowing her to see the chakra network of each individual who was present.* - Fri Dec  4 00:29:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) granted Hideo the opportunity to make the first move during their spar. Peering towards him with her lavender shaded optics Mirai would've waited for the Shinobi to make the first move. She had never fought him before and wasn't quite sure how skilled he was in combat, however she wasn't going to underestimate him.

With her Byakugan active she was more than capable of keeping up with his movements since it did In fact increase her perception making tracking his movements and even contending with him in combat less troublesome. Once he was in close enough proximity Mirai would've acted utilizing her swift reflexes to discharge an attack of her own.

Following up with his attack, she would've delivered a right roundhouse kick causing the two of their feet off to collide and crash into one another. She would mimic his movements, allowing the two of them to exchange blows without either of them sustaining any damage.* - Fri Dec  4 00:58:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've went blow for blow with Hideo as the two of them were currently engaged in a spar. Peering towards Hideo as he slipped underground a smirk would've appeared upon her face as he burrowed underground. Fortunately for the Hokuma her Byakugan was activated and granted her a numerous amount abilities. 

Once Hideo attempted to grab her the Hokuma would've leaped into the air contorting her body whilst in the air executing a backflip to effectively avoid being dragged underground by Hideo. This was an easy feat for the Hokuma due to the fact that she could see him unlike most individuals who fall victim to the technique and don't know when to evade because they can't locate their opponent.* - Fri Dec  4 01:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) thinks: Is he trolling me? - Fri Dec  4 01:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) thinks: Is he fucking trolling me!? - Fri Dec  4 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) Peered towards Hideo as he had resurfaced from underneath the ground. Glancing towards him she watch him reach into his back pouch to retrieve a smoke bomb. She would merely watch him toss the smoke bomb onto the arena, allowing smoke to consume the area. 

Despite being completely shrouded by the smoke the Hokuma was still capable of seeing Hideo due to her Byakugan. She wasn't quite sure if Hideo was trolling her or he just silly, didn't know the capabilities of her clan or her Dojutsu. Deciding to take the fight into her own hands Mirai would sprint towards Hideo quickly closing the distance between the two. Once she was in close enough proximity the Hokuma would've entered her usual stance before her hands were soon imbued chakra. 

Should Hideo aim to write hook her, she would've simply struck his wrist to change the trajectory of her attack before she launched one of her own. A blue emanation would've enveloped the Hokuma's palms before she extends her hands forward delivering swift palm strikes towards his upper body area. 

The Hokuma would've moved gracefully as she endeavored to strike him in his upper body. Mirai would've attempted to use his smoke bomb against him since she assumed that he thought it would obscure her vision during the fight. If this were the case he would likely find out that she knew his exact location and was definitely capable of fighting under these circumstances.* - Fri Dec  4 01:25:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) squinted towards Hideo as she had struck and seemingly missed him. "Fast one he is." Mirai pondered internally watching Hideo emerge from the smoke. Mirai would've sprinted towards Hideo before she leapt into the air and extended her right foot for forward and arched her left foot. The Hokuma would've attempted to strike Hideo in the chest with a blunt attack as she emerged from the smoke before it subsided.* - Fri Dec  4 01:39:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've managed knocked Hideo back a considerable distance, however, he managed to catch her feet and send her hurtling through the air. Mirai would've been tossed in the air and would've been left completely vulnerable and was struck in the back by the blunt force of Hideo. The kunoichi would've been sent skidding across the dirt. It wouldn't have taken long before the Hokuka rose to her feet again though.* - Fri Dec  4 01:54:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've been struck by his assault but had risen to her feet again, but unfortunately Hideo had made his way over towards her and was launching yet another attack. With less time to react the Hokuma was subject to being struck in the ribs by Hideo. 

Groaning in agony the Hokuma would've tried to keep her composure so that the spar could continue. Mirai would've quickly recovered from being struck and extending her arms forward delivering two palms strike to Hideo attempting to cause some internal damage to him and finally land a hit upon the blue haired Shinobi. Her fiancé was watching and she was entirely too prideful to be defeated whilst he was present.* - Fri Dec  4 02:08:00 2015
