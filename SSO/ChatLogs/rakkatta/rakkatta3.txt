<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) makes her approach to the Kazekage.

"Excuse me, sir. I would like to complete various missions today. May I have some?" She asks kindly, as a fledgeling shinobi, she needed as much work experience as possible.* - Sun Oct  4 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Sir... do you know how I can find my perfect match? - Sun Oct  4 23:44:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) nods. This was a mission she'd have no trouble accomplishing. After giving a bow, Mirai turns about face, and heads off into the distance.* - Sun Oct  4 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) she glanced on over to the scroll's contents. The mission, more or less, was a simple delivery mission. Due to the rank, even without actually reading, Mirai knew one thing for certain -- there was no risk of actually having to go outside the village, as such, the village was very unlikely to involve fighting. Thinking back to her desire to acquire more than enough strength to extract vengence on those that persecuted her kind, the young Hyuuga speds away. 

As the scroll is opened, the contents are casually read. "Alright. . .So I have to run on over to the post office, and pick up a letter for Lord Kazekage. Simple enough. . ." The scroll even provided a map, even if the directions were still a bit confusing. Sunagakure was still a developing nation, after all. To aid in the conquest, chakra funnels around Mirai's eyes, eventually siphoning into the muscles themselves. 

The sudden application of chakra is swift to induce her doujutsu. Veins popped up in abundance, and her pupils grew far more noticeable. With this doujutsu active, the curved beaut is able to scan around the area, and view several meters ahead -- even beyond buildings that posed as obstacles. The all-seeing eye takes note of various landmarks, constructed buildings, and of course heaps of crowd traveling along the desolated land known as Sunagakure.

Speedily, at least by normal human standards, the girl raced ahead, each movement enough to make her voluptous body move in just the right way. Of course, each body part was contained or compact. Those looking were dazzled as per usual, even if the bulk of her body had remained covered in strange clothes, concealing most notable facial features.

For the next fifteen minutes, Mirai continued to juke and contort, evading traffic and hoping to reach the postal office in a timely fashion. Upon reaching the designated area, she moves to one of the employees, wearing a bright smile. Her cap is momentarily pulled down, showing off her luscious black hair. "Good evening. I came to pick up a message for Lord Kazekage? I won't open it, I promise."

Graciously, the postal worker searches through the archives, and retrieves a single letter. It's titled 'To Hassan.' Once given, Mirai -- while resisting the temptation to open and take a peek -- stuffs the sheet into a pocket. It isn't long before she's heading off, retracing her steps. The mission, no doubt, wasn't too exciting. But as a grunt, rookie shinobi, what more could she expect?

Hopefully with enough petty missions being done, she'd graduate to something a little more worth while.* - Mon Oct  5 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) returns after half an hour. She's a bit sweaty, and has a bottle of water in hand. Fuck this Sunagakure weather.

"I've finished."

The letter is in hand, and held right towards Hassan.* - Mon Oct  5 00:05:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) ||it wouldn't have been long before Sanoke and Mirai arrived at the prison cells. Once the two arrived she would scan the area gazing around at the numerous amount of Shinobi that had been imprisoned for committing crimes. She would gaze towards Sanoke as he retreived his key and inserted as he prepared to entered the cell. Her ears perked up as he began to speak on getting her and Koji to mend their issues. Parting her lips the Kunoichi would speak in a delicate tone as she followed behind Sanoke entering the cell with him.

"I'm not interested in mending issues with Koji. He always has an excuse and I can become strong without his help. I don't mind learning the secret techniques created by members of my clan without any help from him. I've managed to master my clans fighting style without his help so i'm certain learning without him won't be to inconvenient." 

Mirai muttered as she followed Sanoke lead. Finally the duo would've arrived at the location where the prisoner was being held. Once she entered the room her gaze would've been fixated upon the prisoner. She would observe his physical features as she stood in the corner directly next to Sanoke as he opted to retrieve some files that held some possible information on why the prisoner had been incarcerated and some background information on him.  Gazing towards him she would remain silent as searched for the files occasionally gazing at the prisoner and Sanoke.* - Mon Oct  5 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) gaze would've now been diverted towards the prisoner known as Tetsumo as he began to dish out insults towards her and Sanoke. Naturally the Hyuuga took offense and was eager to assault him for disrespecting her and comrade. Fortunately, she was able to keep her composure and not allow her emotions to cause her to do anything rash that might endanger her and Sanoke. 

Clenching her fist for a moment the Hyuuga would glare towards Tetsumo her lavender shaded optics would've shimmered in the light. Parting her lips, she would speak in a low tone. "Seems like the list of crimes he has committed is extensive," Mirai muttered as she peered towards him as Sanoke motioned to receive a scroll. 

Despite him opting for her to close her eyes, she chose to watch the scene carry out. Killing people was in her job description and was something that she would have to comfortable with if she chose to continue the path of the shinobi and restoring her clan. Despite the prisoner fidgeting she thought nothing of it and remained by Sanoke's side completely unaware of what Tetsumo's intentions.* - Mon Oct  5 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) dodges the nails that had been discharged towards but of course that was after she had told Sanoke that they were being attacked. By now the hyuuga was making her way towards the prisoner.* - Mon Oct  5 05:59:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) understood that this mission would be hazardous when she accepted to accompany Sanoke to complete it and was anxious from the moment that she entered the cells with a prisoner who was to an extraordinary degree dangerous. With her Byakugan activated she could see the incoming projectiles despite the cloud of smoke that lingered in the air. Fortunately, she would've managed to dodge two of the incoming and was grazed by the third causing blood to spill. 

Despite his size and his extensive list of r of criminal acts, the Hyuuga dashed in valiantly and without trepidation. Once she was in close enough proximity the Hyuuga would've dished out her own attack in an attempt to cease the flow of his chakra and cause some internal damage. By now Mirai was attempting to strike the prisoner whom had threatened to harm her and her companion. Motioning her hand forward the Hyuuga would  propel her hands forward. 

Her palms would've been wrapped in a blue emanation as she released a development of strikes towards the criminal an attempt to completely close off his chakra pathway. regardless of her not being as skilled as most Shinobi her families taijutsu-style was still fearsome and she was especially capable at using it. Her movements were graceful and fluid as the Hyuuga was  in the midst of assaulting her assailant. On the off chance that she would succeed with her attack she would keep on assaulting Tetsumo attempting to overwhelm.* - Mon Oct  5 06:25:42 2015

For the time being the Kunoichi would stand by not wanting to rush in recklessly seeing as it didn't benefit her after the first attempt........* - Mon Oct  5 06:37:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) was fortunately protected by Sanoke. Despite being saved from the grasps of the criminal the Hyuuga was relunctant to charge in.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) || As usual would depart with Sanoke to do some sort of activity. After coming to the mutual decision that they both should visit the local hot springs Mirai would be scooped off of her feet and into the arms of the turtle sage. In a matter of seconds, the two of them would've arrived at the designated area. Glancing around Mirai would observe the area as Sanoke proceeded with speaking with an employee. Listening intently as the woman explained the various measure of services that they offered Mirai would ponder on which one she was interested in doing. 

After several seconds of thinking, she had come to a decision. Leaning in towards Sanoke she would whisper in his ear so that it was audible and the clerk couldn't hear her. "Let's just get in the hot springs together and make out and afterward you can give me a massage or something Sanoke-kun. I'm likely going to be barely clothed if we do decide to get into the hot springs  so control yourself. Your nose seems to bleed considerably everytime you see my body. There aren't any medics around her. " Mirai whispered to the turtle sage hoping that he would relay the message to the clerk.* - Mon Oct  5 10:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) as usual was straightforward and wasn't shy when it came to expressing her desires to Sanoke. Peering towards the clerk she listen intently as the woman finally disclosed the price to Sanoke. Her eyes widened the instant she heard the price and couldn't' fathom spending so much money just to visit the hot springs. 

Fortunately, Sanoke had enough ryo and was capable of paying the clerk the fee to utilize the hot springs. Accepting the free bikini she would follow Sanoke trailing behind to head into the changing room. In a matter of seconds, the Hyuuga would've stripped and placed on the bikini.Mirai was well endowed and was quite voluptuous causing the bikini to be rather small and tight which unfortunately for Sanoke only exposed her curvaceous more. Placing her clothing in the locker she would insert the key locking it to ensure that her clothing stolen wasn't stolen on this outing. 

Exiting to the hot spring she would quickly submerge herself in the warm water. She would groan in pleasure feeling the warmth of the water envelop her figure. She couldn't help but notice that Sanoke had removed that shell that he adorned. It was her first time seeing him without it since the two of them had met. "Hurry up and get in" Mirai muttered as she soaked in the warm water. Her massive breast would've been shimmering now completely drenched as droplets of water trailed down her breast.* - Mon Oct  5 11:11:34 2015
