<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: We will return as the family. - Sun Dec  6 17:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Your clone will go to the kitchen as if trying to get a cookie. - Sun Dec  6 17:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Right...are we using the clone or not? Either way, I would like to b- Right. - Sun Dec  6 17:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sound good? - Sun Dec  6 17:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I'll know immediately if something happens to my clone. As well as where it was. - Sun Dec  6 17:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) had quickly devised a plan intent on capturing or coming in contact with the assailant. Several hours would've passed and by now the sun would've completely gone down. Assuming that everyone comply and henged as a member of each of family member the trio of Shinobi would've returned back to the home. Entering the door Mirai would've made her way upstairs to mothers bedroom playing along as if she were this woman. If things went according to the plan Lera and Chikyu would play along as if they were the individuals who they were henged as. Mirai would remain alert waiting for something to pop off of course.* - Sun Dec  6 17:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Shit.. - Sun Dec  6 17:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Stay alert... - Sun Dec  6 17:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) Would've been in the mother's quarters the master bedroom which was fit for a queen and something that she could get used to. With her Byakugan activated the woman would've detected the presence of the being that she had spotted earlier. 

Fortunately this was all planned and hopefully Chikyu would go along with the plan. Whispering into the radio she would alert Chikyu to go to Lily's room. With her Byakugan activated the Hokuma would've darted through the enormous home rushing into the room. Mirai would spot the strange entity and would act as Chikyu's eyes at this point, assuming that the kunoichi had followed up with the plan.  She would address the entity speaking  sarcastically. 

"You didn't think we would miss this, did you? Picking on little kids and using Ninjutsu to terrorize a little girl. Aren't you just so big and evil?" Mirai said sarcastically clearly taunting the individual. This of course would've been followed by an air palm. A compressed bullet of air would've been discharged directly after this statement, not even giving the entity a chance to retort or do anything.* - Sun Dec  6 17:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered towards the entity as it dispersed into nothingness after being struck by her air palm. Unfortunately it was just a clone and there seemed to be more of them spawning around the clones. Mirai would clasp her hands together forming clones of her own to combat the entity. Spawning four clones into the room the clones would've voyaged over towards the opposing clones. 

Mirai's clone naturally would've attempted to infuse chakra to the  opposing clones attempting to disperse them. Mirai would've remained a considerable distance however not wanting to find out the extent of the assailants abilities. She was cautious and would act as Chikyu's eyes. She would occasionally direct the kunoichi in the direction of the clones so that she could combat them. Her clones would've ruthlessly began their attack swiftly thrusting their palms outwards towards the entity's clones.* - Sun Dec  6 18:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered towards the clones as they crumbled at the might of her clones and Chikyu. She would've watch each clone be taken down and disperse into nothingness but only one remained. She wouldn't have uttered a word peering towards the cloak individual who had decided to show himself. She would've gotten a good glimpse of him before his technique landed and took effect draining her of her energy. The woman was to exhausted to make one of her witty retorts and thus he would likely be able to retreat without being struck. * - Sun Dec  6 18:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Dammit! - Sun Dec  6 18:54:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Who even maintains a mountain? - Sun Dec  6 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) strolls into the mansion accompanied by Lera and Chikyu. The Hokuma would've placed her hands over Paine's eyes. "Guess who ?" Mirai said in a joyous tone before she peered towards Sanoke who remained behind the desk. "That was an odd mission Sanoke we have a lot to report and I'm sure we will be tasked to visit that area once again." Mirai stated.* - Sun Dec  6 19:26:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) Peered towards Sanoke before she began to give her report on what took place with the trio were out on the mission. Parting her lips, she would address Sanoke speaking in a delicate tone as she filled him in on the details. 

"We went to the area where we were tasked and did an investigation and began to ask members of the family who kidnapped the most recent victim which happened to be the head chef family. After the investigation had been completed, we had been told that someone broke into their home and kidnapped him in an attempt to kidnap their daughter Lily. Not quite sure why they are eager to capture her at the moment, however, we devised a plan to set the individual up. Me and Chikyu henged as the relatives of the Hitomi and waited for them to strike. Like suckers they took the bait, however the individual seemed to have known because they sent clones. The individual is also capable of using some sort of strange Ninjutsu that allows to not be seen by the naked eye. Was quite a fascinating mission and I'm sure it's not over" Mirai stated peering towards Sanoke.* - Sun Dec  6 19:36:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've entered her home accompanied by Paine. Making her way towards the table Mirai would take a seat waiting for Paine to join her. Peering towards the woman she would part her lips speaking to her Sensei. 

"I'll be required to learn this stuff since people often view me as the leader of the clan. I'll have to teach the younger generation and those who aren't quite familiar with our skills. So I'll be what you are to me to them and that's a Sensei and a mentor." Mirai stated before she retrieved a scroll that contained the information on the technique that she was going to work on learning first. 
Learning Jutsu was a difficult process, but it was something Mirai had grown accustomed to during her years of being a Shinobi. Opening the scroll Mirai would begin to read the contents of the scroll absorbing the information and reading it carefully making sure not to read over a word. As she read the scroll her knowledge and insight on her clan's ability was increased and she curious about what else members of her clan was capable of. 

As she continued to read she would've come to the conclusion that the technique was similar to that of the one she had recently learned known as air palm. Addressing Paine, she would part her lips to speak to her. "This technique is similar to one that I already know fortunately. It shouldn't be that difficult for me to learn, however, we will have to go outside in order for me to practice a bit." 

Mirai suggested suggesting that the two of them go outside so that she could actually practice the technique. She didn't want to ruin her home whilst she was learning the technique so she figured it would be best to evacuate her home.* - Sun Dec  6 23:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) was in the process of learning this new technique called body blow. She had seen it displayed to her and with the information that she had retained after reading the scroll she was sure that she was capable of honing the skill and utilizing it to its full potential. 

Exiting her home alongside Paine Mirai would've headed to a secluded area so that she could practice the technique in privacy without being disturbed by her fellow Shinobi. Peering towards Paine, she would respond to the woman's comment about her being the clan leader. 

"It is a difficult job, but someone's got to do it. I'm not sure if the best let alone a good clan but I always make them a priority and will always have their best interest. I'm just trying to restore my clan to its former glory before they were brutally killed. I don't want what happened years ago to happen again. I will stop at nothing to prevent them from being hunted for their eyes." 

Mirai stated to Paine before she peered towards a wall. Amassing up chakra the Hokuma naturally would've built up chakra releasing chakra from tenketsu in her body. After she amassed an abundant amount of chakra she would've extended her palm forward sending a massive Shockwave towards the wall. The Shockwave would've collided with the terrain causing it to shatter a bit due to the sheer force behind the technique.* - Sun Dec  6 23:39:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered towards Sanoke squinting towards the Shinobi noticing that he was acting quite strange. Despite his actions the cornice would remain silent simply gazing at him before he abruptly motioned his hands forwards placing them around her hips before his hands began to trail down her bodacious figure and he firmly gripped her ass. 

The Hokuma's cheeks would've instantaneously turned into a red hue and she was completely flustered and taken by surprise by her fiancs actions. Being pushed back the Hokuma would allow her fianc to push her body backwards, causing her to be pressed up against the furniture. Parting her lips the Hokuma would of course speak. "What is your idea of "hanging" out love? "Mirai inquired speaking to the Kazekage.* - Mon Dec  7 04:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've been pushed up against the furniture before Sanoke extended his neck forward, allowing his face to meet her neck. Before she knew it his lips would've been upon her neck and as he lewdly began to suck upon her neck, sucking noises would've reverberated throughout the emptied room drawing the attention of the employees who were currently at work. 

Mirai would of course be releasing groans as the Kazekage left a trail of hickies upon her flesh marking her temporarily. Peering towards him as he spoke the Hokuma was in awe and her eyes were filled with pure lust. She would soon feel him searching for her zipper so that he could remove her garments. It didn't take long for him to remove her clothing revealing her shapely figure. 

The Hokuma's shapely figure would've been revealed as her clothing cascaded down her curvy frame and fell upon her frame. The Hokuma possessed the body of a fully developed woman. Wide hips, thick thighs,   And a plump derrire. If Sanoke were to get a good glimpse of her he would've noticed that the fabric of her thong was moist and practically transparent.* - Mon Dec  7 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would have been planted upon the wooden table. Lying on her back the Hokuma would've been gazing up towards the ceiling for a few moments as Sanoke removed his garments freeing his member allowing it to hang between his thighs. 

With her legs parted as she rested upon the table her sex would've been exposed to the Shinobi and given their closeness she would feel his member pressing against her entrance. Peering up towards Sanoke as he leaned over her body, she would feel his member repeatedly slithering along her snatch allowing her womanly fluids to coat his member which only aroused the Hokuma even more. 

Peering into eyes which were filled with lust and adoration her cheeks would've turned a bright red hue due to being a bit embarrassed. With her breast being freed it was only a matter of time before she felt his lips latching around her gorgeous teats. As the Shinobi gave relentless suckles sucking up her nipples the Hokuma would've released moans from her lips. Whilst this was going she could of course, feel his member gliding over her snatch practically teasing her for what was to come.* - Mon Dec  7 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) || by now Mirai was crying out in pleasure as his tongue flickered across her nipples and he gave both of her teats some attention and utilized his tongue to orally pleasure her. Mirai was aware that Sanoke enjoyed playing with her breast due to how much he loved fondle her. 

After several minutes of him utilizing his tongue to pleasure her, she would've peered towards Sanoke as he withdrew from her and seemed to be breathing heavily. Despite this it wouldn't have taken him long to line his erect member up with her entrance. Peering down towards his member she would've watched him intently as he parted her legs and pulled her panties to the side providing him access to her snatch. It didn't take long for him to line his member and gradually slide the head of his member inside of her. 

Waiting in anticipation the Hokuma would've felt the head of his cock penetrate her and at that very moment Mirai would've released a moan. With the tip of his cock inside of her, she could feel the remainder of his shaft penetrating her gradually. Sanoke would soon feel his shaft encased in the warmth of her snatch as her walls constricted tightly around his member like a vice grip once the entire nine inches of his erect member was buried inside of her. 

The Hokuma was obscenely wet and her womanly secretions would've trickled down his shaft. Peering into his eyes as Sanoke hovered over her Mirai's facial expression would've contorted as she released a moan. Her lips would've been parted and her eyes would've been lulled clearly enjoying the sensation that she felt at the moment. 

Then Sanoke began to thrust his hips casually burying his cock into the depths of the beautiful Hokuma. Her breast would've shook violently heaving up and down upon her chest each time his hips were jolted forwards and his cock was buried inside of her. Loud clapping sounds resonated throughout the mansion that could be heard by just about anyone who was within the building. "S-Sanoke!" Mirai cried out her breathing was  heavily as her body shook violently.* - Mon Dec  7 06:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) walls would've gripped tightly around Sanoke's member attempting to milk his member of his semen. The woman would've been wailing and crying out in pleasure like a deranged woman by now as Sanoke continued to jolt his hips forwards submerging his cock into her eager vagina with each thrust. 

As Sanoke's hands swatted her rear end the Hokuma would've yelled as he left his handprints upon her flesh as he occasionally slapped her ass whilst he was thrusting inside of her and ravaging her bodacious body. By now both of their bodies were consumed in sweat. Mirai could feel his member throbbing inside of her meaning that he was going to release his load at any given time. By now the Hokuma was about to reach her climax as well.

 Peering into his eyes Mirai would place her hands you her chest fondling her massive breast before began to pinch her teats darting her tongue out of her mouth flicking across her erect teats. Mirai  Abruptly began to shudder. "S-Sanoke I'm cumming!" she cried. her pussy spasmed around his cock and she wrapped her legs around his waist. Her quakes finally subsided as she came down from one of the greatest orgasms. This of course happened after Sanoke had reached his climax .* - Mon Dec  7 06:55:08 2015
