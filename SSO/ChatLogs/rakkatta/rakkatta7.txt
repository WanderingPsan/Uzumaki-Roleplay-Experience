<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) blinks. She finally pulls herself off the sand, and turns to walk on over to Bryson. Head tilted, Mirai speaks, showing some interest in the topic -- it involved her clan leader. 

". . .Hrm. . . Why do you require Koji-sensei?"* - Wed Oct 14 15:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) scratches his her head. She doesn't seem all to pleased of the news, but also doesn't appear to be to against it.

"Indeed. . .I am Mirai Hokuma, second in command of the family. I hadn't been informed that we would be partaking in church-y activities. I'd be a liar to state that I'm a religious person. . . So what will our participation entail?" Mirai asks, a hand setting on her hip. 

Her silver-haired brow raises as the question is delivered.* - Wed Oct 14 15:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: I need to speak with Koji so we can make solid ground, there should be some middle ground to stand on where everyone can benifit - Wed Oct 14 15:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) 's face remained stoic.

As Bryson spoke, explaining the nature of he and Koji's agreement, Mirai simply nods -- not out of agreement. . . But simply to show that she understood. Although, the Hokuma couldn't quite grasp the point of the religion. What was there to even gain? Her hips pivot a bit, as her hands moved to get into a more comfortable position. From start to finish, the woman's tranquil, lavander gaze never wavered, and remained on Bryson's face throughout his lengthy conversation.

"Mm. . .? I see. I do recall him speaking of being baptised. . . Although, what purpose is there of your religion? I suppose there -has- to be some reward, no?"* - Wed Oct 14 15:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) manages to avoid rolling her eyes.

Bryson's comments had made sense, as it properly explained why people would ever bother serving a religion. You didn't need to be religious in order to be a good person, after all. "I see. . .So you're able to deal with Necromancers, or other dark arts. That's good to know," she replies, keeping her opinion of the other aspects of christianity hush-hush. Turning about face, she makes a stride to the bench, and plants a seat there.

"Thank you for the information, however."* - Wed Oct 14 15:57:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) presses her hands against the bench. She uses the leverage to push herself curvy frame up, and begins with her casual gait, her hips subtly moving like a pendulum. 

In little time, she would have led Izutora off to the southern area, one enclosed by mountains.* - Wed Oct 14 21:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Oi. Taken. - Wed Oct 14 21:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: The left works just as fine. - Wed Oct 14 21:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) presses her hands together. The seal gives her a much higher degree of control, allowing the Hokuma to easily send chakra towards her eyes. The leisure onflow is enough to activate the woman's genetic structure, thus bringing her bloodlimit to life -- the almighty. . . All-Seeing Byakugan. Veins grow more apparent along the side of it's face, appropriately due to the increased efficiency of her eye muscles, and of course the nifty abilities that came with this state of strength.

"I warn you, if you've never faced me before, you may find that my style of combat is a bit unorthodoxed," she warns. Rather than balling her hands into fist, each mitt remains stretched out, allowing her smooth-skinned palms to be fully exposed.  The right hand is pointed directed ahead, while the left arm is arched a bit, forming a ninety degree angle along the elbow.  It's held a bit lower than you'd anticipate, perhaps to serve as a defensive crutch if the going got tough?

Finally, she rounds out the stance, dubbed 'Gentle Fist.' The name was accurate, yet misleading at the same time. While the motions lacked actual momentum, the impact was -anything but- gentle, as it caused significant pain on the inside. The final portions simply forces Mirai to enter a crouch, her knees tensed and buckled, thus being ready for movement should evacuation call for it.  Lastly, the right leg had been placed a bit forward, while the left lagged behind, to round out her balance.

"Your move."* - Wed Oct 14 21:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) remained in her position through all of this.

She's wearing a rare facial expression, a giant grin, due to Izutora's ridiculously naming scheme! As well as his penchant for announcing the attack, thus making her more aware of how to react to the blow. Standing her ground, Mirai looked ahead as Sunagakure's residential Green Beast made his fast-paced approach. 

"Interesting. . . Judging by the way he's leaping through the air, his entire method of combat is using explosive strikes. . .Ones meant to take advantage of his physical prowess," Mirai notes verbally to herself. Of course, she wasn't about to just sit there and -take- the hit. Instead, at the last second, her body dips towards the right, showcasing an impressive amount of speed. As she's moving, her body never once seems rushed, as each step was calculated, and wasted the minimal amount of energy.

Narrowly being out of range, chakra coats about her hand, prompting them to flicker through the air. By normal standards, they're literal blurs, and repeatily strike against Izutora's hips and thigh as he sails before landing. Of course, given the nature of this 'bout, Mirai had no intent on bringing true harm, and thus held backi greatly on her Gentle Fist's power. (5 damage). . .That is, if it even lands.

Hit or miss, she's taking cautious steps back, under the firm belief that the best offense was a great defense.* - Wed Oct 14 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) thinks: Impressive! She must have physical capabilities if she bypassed my trained body! - Wed Oct 14 21:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) ||She continued to slide along the ground, her small foot leaving trails where ever they went. Curious, she seems to greatly wonder just how powerful the male's taijutsu ability proved to be. . Thus, in arrogance, Mirai stays put, taking the damage head on, allowing the first kick to land against her shoulder! She'd grunts, irritated by the pain that riddled along the appendage, but it wasn't quite enough to put her out of the battle.

In an instant, as then next kick is going, chakra discharges from every point of her body, sending a strong current of wind about the area. It pushes, sending Izutora's body back in recoil presumably. . 

But to build up upon this, the Hokuma's body begins to spin around rapidly, allowing the flow of chaakra to take shape, forming an impenetrable sphere. The rapid spinning hopefully is enouggh to send the taijutsu specialist's body flying back, and crashing against the floor, while also giving Mirai more than enough room to breath. It was becoming increasingly clear, while Izutora was a physical specimen, he wasn't quite on her level when it came to overall taijutsu ability.

Still, this was great practice and granted her a wealth of experience, as needed to progress along and eventually become leader of the clan. "You hit quite hard. . . However, is this the extent of your youth's power? Tch. . .Pity, I had expected greater," the woman taughts playfully. There's a faux-snide grin worn, as she beckons the Green Beast forward for more practicing.* - Wed Oct 14 21:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) grinned. She took some amusement in how enthusiastic Izutora remained, even as he was outmatched.

Both of her legs were still tensed, and the second he's within range, her body is preparing to move. Her stomach leans inward, prompting the strike to narrowly miss. And again, Mirai took the opportunity, turning the offensive miscue into an opportunity for her own strike to work. 

Quickly, her hands again flick, being mere blurs and striking along the male's forearm. Three swift strikes go around seamlessly, attacking with a bit more power and hopefully subduing a few tenketsu along the way. Hit or miss, Mirai dances about, her feet sliding along the ground again, although never once having her balance compromised. Her lower body remained prepped to spring about, continously on alert.

(Damage would be about eight, at different points)

"Swift! Although, hnot quite fast enough. Keep at it, I'm feeling pretty good with this training session thus far!"* - Wed Oct 14 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) ||It was a good try. . .But from the looks of things, Mirai was a bit to presumptious to believe that she and Izutora were on the same level. Her head swiftly dips to the right, allowing the haymaker to miss it's mark completely. 

Considering her graceful movement, Mirai is still well within position to take advantage of the missed attack. Both palms strike together in unison, aiming to crash against Izutora's stomach and release a heightened jolt of chakra. Along with the jolt came a great deal of concussive damage, enough to hopefully send the boy's frame flying backwards.

Assuming the dual attack had worked, Izutora would feel a strange sensation in his stomach as the chakra in there is being cut off. ". . .Mmm. You fight well, yet you have to continue working. For now, it would seem that your youth isn't developed enough to take on the likes of me," the Hokuma replies. With a single thought, the flow of chakra in her eyes come to an abrupt stop, and she takes a step back.

"Are you well?" Mirai could only hope she wasn't overzealous. Albeit, the strikes weren't enough to be anymore more than moderate discomfort. Pain from them would fade in an hour at the most.* - Wed Oct 14 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) smiles. It was a decent work out, that was for sure.

"Good. I enjoyed the battle, and I think I've learned a lot from it. . . I just need to work on this taijutsu scroll now. It's a similiar kick to what you've used on me. In fact, I believe it's the exact same technique actually."* - Wed Oct 14 23:06:14 2015
