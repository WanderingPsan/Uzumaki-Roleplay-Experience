<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Mhm. - Thu Nov 12 16:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) wasn't quite having good luck. Instead of moping around, the ambitious Kunoichi manuevered off. She was finally prepared to begin chasing that dream, the dream to be classed a medical kunoichi. The desire spawning from her need to gain prominence, and growing urge to be capable of healing her comrades who's suffered in the thick of combat.

Once in the safety of her arm, the white-haired kunoiuchi began working. Considering she had no actual ability in the art of conventional medic skills -- things such as diagnosing, bandaging, stitching -- she'd opt to refine those skills first. After all, was a medic truly just a shinobi with healing capabilities? Nay! It was a person that knew the ins and out of the human body. A person that could solve the issues conventional healings perhaps would not be able to.

Her tush is seated onto a comfy chair. For a few moments, Mirai moved about, ensuring that she could get into a far more comfortable positioning. Once prepared, delicate digits proceed to flip through the large ensemble of books. From the looks of things, it was as if the Turtle 'Sennin' that she lived with was an avid reader, as there were booklets revolving around a slew of topics. Ninjutsu theories, religious text, and of course. . . articles for budding medics.

Comically, the textbook was titled 'Medics 101: For dummies!' "Hah!" Mirai howled in laughter, charmed at the endearing book that had stumbled onto her bookcase. She was excited -- that much was clear, as her body shook and gyrated with growing anticipation. After all, who else wouldn't be delighted to go onto a next journey, one that could potentially save many down the line? With a thumb, that hard-covered book is slammed onto the table, the force making the entirety of the furniture shake in recoil.

Idle objects, things like pen trays, and the like were jittering about as well. Some cascaded onto the floor, but in the endn ot much really was relevant to her. Who cares if the place was a mess? Not Mirai, as she remained too engaged in uncovering the wealth of knowledge. A hand rises, allowing a finger to be licked and covered with saliva. That covering is what's used to turn about the pages. Lavender, wide-eyes proceed to scan the contents.

Like a sponge, as the information is transfered, her mind is absorbing it. ". . .Alright. . . I understand the basics. Cells form organs, organs form organ systems. . . And of course, bodies are formed from a group of these. ." Naturally, being a -basic- book, she was forced to go through basic information. The beginning is a bore, sure enough. But that doesn't stop the woman from perserving. After half an hour, she had mowed through the bulk of the boring content, and now got into the thick of things.

That's right, things went further, going into more intensive details. The next portion was revolving sollely about other basic trainings. The aforementioned bandages, yet it also depicted informaton and techniques revolved in stitching. '. . .Both requires a steady, yet firm hand. It also beckons for attention to detail and precision. If you're a nervous wreck, your chance of failure takes a stark incline. ' 

Below would be pictorial diagrams, showing the proper sequences. Sadly -- at least for the moment -- Mirai lacked a person to practice or train on. Thus, the beaut of a woman continued reading. On several paragraphs, she's forced to backtrack, finding that while she read, her mind had wandered off. Essentially, shje was reading. . . But not actually processing the words. On other occasions, the lass was prone to just going through repetition to simply ensure that she wouldn't forget the second the study session had been done.

And this was a repeated sequence. In no time, about two hours had rolled by, forcing Mirai to come to a hault. After all, what good was a brain if it had been overworked? However, all of the hard work was well-received. In this, she's learned all of the basic techniques, such as diagonises for -simple- injuries. Or well, ones that were common in battle. This being cut veins, suffocation -- which would be solved via CPR --, burns. . . of varying degrees (and how to determine them). . . And the list goes on.

Nevertheless, it's clear that she's spent and goes to take a rest. After a good ol' nap, and a quick snack break, the Hokuma is back to the old grind. Yes, she was a woman determined and would never faulter or give in until she got what she wanted, and Mirai -always- got what she wanted. One way or another. However, reading was growing a tad bit dull. Due to the lack of interest in simply reading, she shuffles on off, making a quick stop to the local conveniency store.

After a brisk walk, and short shopping, she's back. A dummy, a roll of bandages, and other medical appliances had been retrieved. Eagerly, Mirai proceeded with the basic training excerises. As a kunoichi, she knows the importance of walking before she could crawl -- as evident by her need to go through the academy, and the patience required to endure the reptition curriculum. Due to this knowledge, the curvaceous woman proceeded to start with the easily task of them all, bandaging.

Despite the ease of the nature, there were still several techniques that could be employed. Ones meant not only to accurately seal wounds, but to also ensure that there was minimal discomfort, and added protection. After a short practicing sequence, Mirai had successfully done about five different rounds of thorough bandging. She moves now, practicing more refined arts.

For the next hour or so, this feminine byakugan wielder tirelessly worked to perfect her craft. On the dummy, a needle and thread are utilized. Initially, her hands is shaky, due to nervous jitters. But as eveeryone would know. . . Being a Hyuuga and using the skills was based primarily on chakra control AND precision. Precision that required the user to remain calm and have innate focus. So it's no surprise that with enough work or effort, she's able to calm those shaking appendages, and get the job doone. Albeit, there was clear room for improvement. After all, had that been an actual patient, there was no doubt that some complaints were going to be dished out, revolving around needles going too deep.

And thus Mirai was now on a daily training regiment. Day in and day out, she was going to be back to the old grind.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sure. - Thu Nov 12 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Okay.. sorry.. bye. - Thu Nov 12 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: It's fine be careful. - Thu Nov 12 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: I will.. - Thu Nov 12 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) thought now was the ideal time to refine her skills and work on improving her combat ability. After receiving the scroll from the Kazekage she would depart from the square after reading the contents of the scroll. Unfortunately, there wasn't anyone present who was willing to spar her and Mizora had refused, so she figured that she would do some individual training rather than sit around and do absolutely nothing. 

With the events that had taken place recently and the attacks launched on the village it was best that she practice her abilities and attempt to create some new ones. Once she arrived at a secluded area, she would activate her Byakugan expanding her vision considerably before she glanced around to make sure she was alone. Once she had realized that she was alone, she would begin to pivot on her heel spinning an entire 360 degree's. 

Amid her spinning, she would release chakra from every tenketsu in her body causing a blue emanation of chakra that was in the form of a sphere to surround her body. After she came to a halt a giant crater would've been upon the surface of the ground. Mirai had been working on improving her ability with the rotation and she assumed, that could make a massive rotation if she mustered up enough chakra. 

Once she was done performing the technique she would proceed to do her other training working on her Taijutsu. It had been quite some time since she worked on her taijutsu and as a Hyuuga she was required to be exceptionally skilled in that area because her Taijutsu style depended not only on her Dojutsu but her Taijutsu skills.* - Thu Nov 12 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) once Mirai had practiced her Rotation the Hyuuga would take a break for a mere moment before she proceeded with the rest of her usual training. After taking a quick break Mirai would crouch down getting into her usual position before she attempted to perform the gentle fist style. 

The style wasn't complex due to the abilities that her Byakugan granted her, however, she wanted to improve her prowess when it came to performing her clan's fighting style and she knew the only way to do this was to constantly practice the style. Out of the current members of her clan, she was the fastest and seemed to have the best reaction time. 

In her stance the Hyuuga would begin to shadow spar extending her hands out towards the air repeatedly. Her palms would be open as she thrust them forward rapidly. Veins would be protruding her temples due to her Byakugan being activated. Admist her training, she would've noticed that Mizora had arrived and she would've came to a sudden halt diverting her attention towards her cousin. 

"So how did it go? I can't help but think you'll miss being a Shinobi and if you no longer have that status you won't be able to benefit from the perks that come with it. I'm not fond of how the system works here either, but I think I'll keep my status as Genin just in case I need the benefits to protect the clan. I've also heard something about the private exams so I may take a shot at doing those in the near future." Mirai muttered to her cousin.* - Thu Nov 12 22:54:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) arrived at her home accompanied by Shira. The Hyuuga had a surprise for the child and was eager to tell him the news. Once the two arrived at her home she would take a seat on the couch before she peered towards him with her lavender shaded optics. Parting her lips, she would speak in a fragile tone to the child. 

"You've been causing a numerous amount of trouble of lately. I'm only going to say this once quit the shit. Now you're probably wondering why I've brought you here. I've asked you to come along here because I want to begin your training immediately. Since you do in fact possess a Byakugan there will be individuals that you come across that may seek to claim it for themselves to figure out the abilities the Byakugan grants the user. From my understanding Kirigakure is known for killing a various measure of members from my clan to obtain their eyes. You will likely be a target in the near future and it takes quite some time to master my clan's fighting style and how to properly utilize your Byakugan. I will begin teaching you, but you have to promise me that you won't put yourself in any danger by doing childish idiotic things." 

Mirai muttered to the child as she sat on the couch for a few moments awaiting an answer. She wasn't exactly sure if it was a good idea to begin teaching him immediately due to what she had heard about the child, but she was willing to give him a shot to prove her and the others wrong.* - Fri Nov 13 02:28:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've listened intently to the child. It seemed as though Fujitora had sealed his arms and chakra for the time being. Pondering for a few moments the Hokuma would begin to think of something.

"I'm sure Sanoke can remove the seals that he placed upon you. He is exceptionally skilled at Fuuininjutsu as well and should be here in a few moments and then we can begin your training. The training will require you to utilize your hands and it requires you to understand the process of utilizing your Byakugan effectively in combat." Mirai muttered as she sat upon the couch simply awaiting for Sanoke's arrival. She make conversation whilst the two waited though rather then sitting there quietly. That would be extremely awkward.* - Fri Nov 13 02:34:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) smiled after seeing that Sanoke had successfully managed to break the seal that Fujitora had placed upon Shira. Arriving at their usual training location she would peer towards the child before she began to speak. 

"The Byakugan is a magnificent gift. You're lucky to have  bestowed the great Dojutsu. The Byakugan not only expands the user's vision significantly, it allows the to see the chakra passageway system. Due to the Byakugan granting the user this ability memebers of my clan have created a fighting style known as gentle fist. This fighting style is comprised of a series of palm strikes towards the enemies tenketsu which will not only disrupt the flow of their chakra but it will cause internal damage to that individual. If you become skilled enough, you can even stop the flow of an individual chakra for some time." 

Mirai muttered to the child before she approached him. She would simply remove the mask from his face that hid his lavender shaded optics. Parting her lips, she would speak again, this time she sounded upset. "Didn't I tell you to remove that mask. Are you ashamed to posses the Byakugan? Like I said you're very fortunate to even have the Dojutsu. If you stay out of trouble and live long enough, you can probably learn how to properly utilize your gift." Mirai muttered peering down towards the child.* - Fri Nov 13 03:41:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) assumed that the child wasn't familiar with the fighting style known as gentle fist. Fortunately, he seemed to be adept at this fighting and was capable of utilizing it in combat. She figured that it was best to teach him rotation so that he could effectively defend himself and repel incoming projectiles that were discharged towards him. Parting her lips the Byakugan princess in a delicate tone. 

"I wasn't aware that you were capable of utilizing my clans fighting style When you spoke to me and Koji you made it seem as though you didn't know anything. Fortunately, I don't have to teach you  you, gentle  fist because it could take months or even years to master. Remember to practice diligently and on your spare time it is important to practice the fighting style every now and then." Mirai stated before she activated her Byakugan causing veins to protrude her temples. As the veins spread around her face the Hyuuga would've felt empowered the instant her Dojutsu was activated. 


"The technique that I'm about to demonstrate is called Rotation. It is fairly simple to perform. You will pivot on your heel and spin an entire 360 degrees. Amid you doing this you have to release chakra from each tekentsu within your body. If you do this correctly chakra in the form of a dome will envelop your body. This technique is extremely useful because you can attack and defend at the same time. With your Byakugan activated your vision will be extended considerably so you will know when to utilize the technique and the odds of being caught off guard are slim to none."

Mirai muttered before she prepared to exhibit the technique. Spinning on her heel, her ravishing long silver hair would've swayed as she began to spin rapidly. Admist her spinning, she released chakra from each Tenketsu and an emanation of chakra would've manifested around her figure in the form of a dome. Her chakra would've been blue in hue and a giant crater would've been left within the surface of the earth, which was a testament to the strength of the technique.* - Fri Nov 13 04:05:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) || After she had successfully demonstrated the technique she would deactivate her Byakugan before she took a step back away from Shira as he prepared to perform the technique that she had just exhibited to him.  She watched him intently as he began to rapidly spin and go through each individual process of performing the technique just like she had explained.

Fortunately, he had managed to perform the technique however Mirai wasn't impressed easily and was a rather demanding teacher. Despite him performing the technique correctly she wanted him to perform it once more.

"Perform the technique once again. You might have just gotten lucky. I want you to be able to perform the technique on the fly. This technique can potientially save your luck and you need to become accustomed to performing the technique. So i'll require to perform it once more whilst i'm present and i'll need you to pracice the technique on your spare time." 

Mirai muttered to the child folding her arms. She noticed that Mizora had arrived on the scene and was simply observing the situation without saying a word. She would merely wave towards the Hokuma before she approached her walking over towards her. She lowered her voice whispering to her cousin whilst she watched Shira trained.* - Fri Nov 13 04:28:22 2015
