<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) looked towards Sanoke as he uprooted the turtle shell that was upon his back and hurled it onto the ground bringing on a gigantic tremor implying that it was to a great degree heavy. An egotistical smile shaped upon Mirai's face seeing Sanoke at long last uproot the shell that was bound to his back. She noticed that he seldomly took it off and she was honored that he took it off in order to spar with her.

"It is safe to say that you are certain? I don't plan on holding back and on the off chance that you think you can defeat me while just utilizing Taijutsu you unmistakably have no clue of what individuals from my clan are capable of but believe me when I say you're about to find out ." She says assuredly watching him enter his stance. As he entered his stance Mirai used this opportunity to initiate her Byakugan. Framing a solitary seal the Kunoichi would initiate her Byakugan causing viens to protude her temples as she enacted her Dojutsu. With her Byakugan initiated the Kunoichi could now see his chakra network and was fit for using her clan's fighting style known as the Gentle fist. Crouching down and entering her stance she would motion her fingers coaxing Sanoke to charge at her.* - Sat Oct 10 06:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) had effectively managed get Sanoke to charge in towards her. She noticed how quick he was yet luckily her Kekkei Genkai expanded her peception fundamentally and accordingly she was fit for keeping up with his movements in spite of how quick he was. As Sanoke voyaged towards her rapidly the Hokuma was arranging her attack. Turning on her heel she would discharge chakra from each tenkutsu in her body. Spinning quickly her chakra would manifest and an arch of chakra would erect around the Hyuuga.

A sphere of blue chakra emanated all through the zone and enlightened the territory and was totally noticeable. Reviewing the data she read in the parchment in regards to the technique she used this technique effectively to both assault and shield herself from Sanoke's attack Mirai had baited him into charging towards with her in an attempt to utilize her new technique to strike him. On the off chance that her endeavor would succeed the Kunoichi would cease spinning before she charged towards him taking the offensive now.* - Sat Oct 10 07:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) had apparently managed to snare Sanoke into her first strike amid their fight. In addition to the fact that she was reckless, she was strategic when she needed to be.By now the beauty was charging towards Sanoke closing the distance between the two so that they could engage in hand to hand combat an area that she was talented in and she was confident about her capacities when it came to taijutsu. Closing the distance between the two the Hyuuga would've started her assault rapidly sending a various measure of strikes towards Sanoke. Thrusting her hands forwards, her palms would've remained opened as she quickly conveyed a progression of strikes towards Sanoke. 

Mirai endeavored to close off a few of her chakra passageways and cause some internal damage to him. Mirai moved smoothly as she regulated her strikes showing her mastery over her clan's fighting style and her prowess when it came to taijutsu. Her hair swayed back and forth as she moved sleekly. A piercing gaze would've been set upon Sanoke as her lavender shaded optics were focused upon him. 

"Remain focused Mirai, You can win this." She thought to herself internally as she administered her attack. It was evident that Mirai was set upon winning this spar despite Sanoke being a far more experienced Shinobi. She wanted to impress Sanoke with her combat ability and prove to him that she was more than just a pretty face.* - Sat Oct 10 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) conveyed a progression of assaults that were easily avoided by Sanoke. It appeared as if with the shell evacuated his reflexes were enhanced dramatically. As her chakra claded palms were sent towards the shinobi in a brisk progression she watched him eagerly as his body distorted and he spun to evade her strikes without much inconvenience. Her face scrunched up the moment she heard his voice as he taunted her in the midst of evading her attack. 

Unfortunately, she wasn't prepared for his assault nor was she sufficiently quick to avoid his assault and subsequently was struck in the neck  as Sanoke sent a cross chop to her neck at a relative speedy pace. Scowling a bit in the wake of being struck the decided Hyuuga to keep on fighting regardless of the ounce of agony she felt subsequent to being struck. 

"Heyahhh!" The Hyuuga articulated  enthusiastically as chakra exuded from her palm and she endeavored to strike Sanoke in his abdominal area. The velocity in which she conveyed her assaults expanded a bit once she realized that Sanoke was fit for dodging her assaults easily. This just spurred the Hyuuga to invest more energy and that she did as she endeavored to land at least a solitary hit on the turtle sage.* - Sat Oct 10 08:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) strike didn't land where she had intended yet she estastic that she atleast managed to hit Sanoke. Mindful of her capacity to send a surge of chakra through his body and assault his chakra framework directly she was grateful that she struck him realizing that one hit could impact the battle's result significantly. Regardless of at long last landing an assault on him and seeing that it was effecting Sanoke she didn't become too haughty. 

Charging towards Sanoke seeing as he endeavored to move in an opposite direction from her the Hyuuga was voyaging towards the tutle sage selecting to use this opportunity to overwhelm Sanoke. Mirai was in feral mode and the focused Kunoichi was determined to win this fight particularly after all the junk Sanoke talked before they began the fight and the constant taunting that occurred as both of them were occupied with a battle. Typically Mirai would've reacted with a witty comment however she was far to centered around defeating Sanoke to even respond to him. Once in sufficiently close enough proxmity again her palm radiated in chakra and was sent towards the turtle sage. Mirai showed no signs of letting up especially after seeing the effect that her attack had on her opponent.* - Sat Oct 10 08:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) was focused on sending a surge of chakra through Sanoke's body and causing internal damage to his body until she was the victor of the spar. She was fortunate enough to possess an ability that would cause an extremely significant amount pain as long as she landed a hit. Things seemed to be going well for the Hyuuga however Sanoke changed the course of the fight. He was quick but of course with her Byakugan active and him being unaware of the blind spot she was able to track his movements and aware of his location. Unfortunately, she was quick enough to react and was bound by multiple wires that came whirring out towards her. Gritting her teeth after being binded and rendered immobile the Hyuuga would speak.

"Hey! You said we were only going to use Taijutsu i'm sure that is Ninjutsu. Therefore, you lose because you've broken the rules and I win." Mirai said clearly annoyed that Sanoke had broken the rules that he had set. * - Sat Oct 10 08:46:04 2015
