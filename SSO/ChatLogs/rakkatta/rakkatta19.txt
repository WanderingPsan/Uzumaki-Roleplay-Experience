<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) was clearly frustrated after the events that took place today. Her usual sweet persona had completely disappeared and she was filled with anger due to how Marrisa disrespected members of her clan and considered them criminals. Lowering her voice she would speak in a fragile tone. 

"They said that Shira had transformed into Jiki and threatened people. Jiki performed the integration, justice that doesn't allow the individual to lie when they are under. Jiki had Shira enveloped in iron sand so I told him to release him. So Marrisa interrupted me and insulted Mizora saying she was a criminal not knowing Mizora has personal issues which pissed me off further. She was just spouting out  a bunch of nonsense that made me upset and if we weren't in the Kazekage's presence I would have probably beat the living shit out of her." Mirai said nonchalantly she was clearly still very much upset about the incident.

"Mizora has made mistakes, but we all do is she struggling with issues like we as humans all do. Marrisa comes off as bloodthirsty to me and she's always running off to higher ups and crying once she doesn't get her way." Mirai muttered speaking on the situation.* - Thu Nov 12 04:53:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Let's head to the housing plaza. - Thu Nov 12 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered towards the individual who had requested to accompany them on the mission. She looked the Shinobi up and down, taking in all of their physical features before she was scooped up off of her feet into the arms of Sanoke bridal style. It didn't take long for the trio to arrive at the housing distract due to the utilization of the shunshin technique which allowed them to travel at incredible speeds. 

Before she knew it the third individual would've disappeared and was no longer in sight. "Guess he wasn't interested in doing this mission it is quite a boring one." Mirai thought to herself internally before she jumped out of Sanoke's arms allowing her feet to touch the surface once again. Listening intently to Sanoke as he briefed her upon the mission, she would nod her head occasionally as he spoke. 

She assumed that the mission would be easy to complete since it required her to make use of her people skills rather than most missions she was assigned on. Peering towards the two individuals that they were assigned to give a tour of the village a smile would form upon her face before she parted her lips to greet them. 

"Greeting I'm Mirai Hokuma me and my Fiance here were assigned to give you a tour of the village. Like he said Sunagakure has a lot to offer and by far has some of the best housing that I've seen. As a Shinobi I've been to a various measure of villages and none of the homes quite measure up to the ones that we have here." Mirai muttered with enthusiasm as she spoke to the two individuals boasting about the village that she deemed to be her home.* - Thu Nov 12 06:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) couldn't believe that Sanoke had told complete strangers, their personal business, but this was in fact a mission and he was simply trying to complete it by showing them where the locals and Shinobi dined. Despite being upset by this she didn't allow her emotions to get in the way of completing the mission and continued to put on a smile for the two individuals. 

She peered towards the local diner as Sanoke showed them where it was located and made conversation with them as the two of them proceeded to show the clients the village. Parting her lips Mirai would speak to the redheaded woman as she made a comment about the heat. 

"It is quite hot here, but the other villages don't have the best climate either from my understanding. Kirigakure is shrouded in mist and if you aren't a trained Shinobi or adjusted to it, it's quite difficult to see and travel through the village." Mirai muttered, trying to take the woman's mind off of Sunagakure's climate which she found terrible. 

Nonetheless, she was trying to sell Sunagakure as the best village and that is what she intended to do. Walking around the village she would've noticed the prison. Arriving in front of the prison, she would halt, allowing the duo to observe it for a few moments before she spoke. 

"This is the prison. You can come here and file any report that you may have and myself or a relative of mine will handle it. Sunagakure has the best police force and we investigate everything. So you'll be safe and secure within the village if you choose to live here." Mirai muttered as she spoke about the security that the two of them would acquire if they chose to reside in Sunagakure.* - Thu Nov 12 07:24:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sounds good. - Thu Nov 12 08:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Can we do that at home though? - Thu Nov 12 08:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: That works. - Thu Nov 12 08:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Hrm. - Thu Nov 12 08:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: This is much better. - Thu Nov 12 08:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: So what am I doing wrong? - Thu Nov 12 08:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would listen to Sanoke as he explained what he assumed that she was doing wrong. She had managed to perform the technique during their last session, however, she was far from a master at the technique and would require a lot more practice if she planned on learning the stronger variant of the technique. 

Being a teenage girl this was easily one of her favorite jutsu and loved the fact that she could utilize her hair as a weapon. Nodding her head the Hokuma would begin to amass a significant amount of chakra allowing her chakra to build in up in her body. She would then infuse the chakra into her hair stimulating it this granting her ability to freely manipulate. 

Manipulating her hair several strands of her hair would extend towards several items that were placed around their home. Her hair would constrict around a jar, a lamp, and a vase. With her hair entangled around the items she would manipulate it, causing the strands of her hair to retract bringing the items closer to her and Sanoke. Mirai was fascinated with the ability to utilize her to do these sort of things and due to the volume of her ravishing long hair, she capable of doing a various measure of things with it.

"How was that Sanoke?" Mirai inquired wanting to receive some feedback from her fiance. She was enjoying the session whilst they were in the comfort of their home. She was even contemplating on having all of their training sessions here. She would've remained seated on the couch and her hair would've unbinded itself from the items and returned back to it's original state for the time being.* - Thu Nov 12 08:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) rolled her eyes the instant she heard Sanoke utter the words "Don't get ahead of yourself" something he often did when he boasted about all the jutsu in his arsenal. A smile would've formed upon her face despite her being upset and she would've listened intently as her Fiance would've proceeded to explain and further clarify how to perform the technique to her once again. 

With the information she had just received she was certain that performing the technqiue would be effortless this time around. Heeding Sanoke's instructions she would conjure up an immense amount of chakra allowing it to be channeled along her chakra circulatory system allowing the chakra to be infused in her hair follicles. 

Once this process had been complete and she had infused chakra into her hair, she would manipulate her hair, causing it to grow in length and gain a level of elasticity much like Sanoke had expressed during his explanation.Her hair would've seemed to be a living thing as it snapped into action. Manipulating the length of her hair, she would extend it considerably allowing it to reach the edge of the couch and coil around Sanoke binding him. She made sure to cover his lips with her hair. Once this was done the smile that had been upon her face would've disappeared and she would've been glaring at him with her lavender shaded optics.

"I wasn't getting ahead of myself either. I was simply trying to impress you and show you that I did in fact pay attention to what you told me during our last session. Me and you are completely different people I don't brag about anything unlike you." Mirai muttered before she manipulated her hair once more removing the strand from his lips and freeing him allowing him to speak. It was evident she was upset about his comment, however, she would proceed to manipulate her hair wanting to master the technique before she utilized it in a combat situation.* - Thu Nov 12 09:01:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: More than one that's not lacking you're actually progressing really well. - Thu Nov 12 09:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've arrived at a secluded area so that she could refine her skill and master the technique she had recently learned. Peering towards Sanoke she would utilize him as her training dummie sense nothing else was in close enough proximity that she could use. 

Mustering up chakra and sending into it her hair follicles she would allow the chakra to seep into each individual strand of her gorgeous silver locks which allowed her to be able to manipulate it freely. Due to her hair having volume and not being thin like most of the girl's in suna she was capable of a numerous of things. Manipulating her hair, she would quickly extend it increasing the length of her shoulder length hair before she ensnared the turtle sage. 

With her hair constricted tightly around Sanoke she would retract her hair a bit before she extended it forward at a quick speed before she released her grip around him sending him hurtling into the air. Sanoke was of course a ninja so she expected him to land on his feet uninjured. Peering towards him as she sent him hurtling into the sky, she would part her lips to utter one something thing.

"Weeeeeeeeeee!" Mirai said sound like a mere child as a smile appeared on her face. Once Sanoke landed, she would repeat the process sending soaring into the sky repeatedly until she grew tired. She hoped that he was enjoying this as much as she was.* - Thu Nov 12 10:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: That was fun wasn't it? - Thu Nov 12 10:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta)  || Everyone could benefit from daily training. . . Yet it was especially important for someone that worked as a trained, and paid shinobi or kunoichi. For the weeks that preceded today, the bulk of Mirai's training had seemingly been centered about spiritual training. Things involving the refinement of chakra control, or the improvement of her reflexes. But any good warrior would tell you. . . To truly grow into a fearsome combatant, one not only had to gain proficiency in the spirit, but also in the body.

Fast forward a few minutes after awakening for the day.

She's at a secluded region of Sunagakure, wearing a comfortable track-suit. Before beginning with the exercise, the young kunoichi proceeds with thorough stretching exercises. Each one limbers her muscles up accordingly, and limits the risk of any injuries being earned or aggravated. Of course, this also rid the body of any stiffness, and thus increased the range of motion for your limbs. That settled, Mirai wasted little time, speeding ahead, at a brisk pace. The goal of the exercise was simple, to improve muscle endurance, stamina, and overall leg power.

For the few half hour, she remained sprinting, although never once moving to go at top speed. Each step or pace around the goal is one that expends a steady or even amount of physical power. A miniscule amount of sweat builds up, providing a small amount of moisture to her flesh, although this is easily noticeable. Despite the beginnings of fatigues, Mirai's impressive work ethic forces her to continue with the task at hand. As the continued calisthenics ran it's course, additional evidence of fatigue began to creep out the woodworks. 

Minutes eventually develop into an hour, and before Mirai knew it, a good chunk of her morning had already been put towards training. Towards the end of the jogging exercise, she picks up the pace, speeding along the track in a circular fashion at the maximum speed her exhausted muscles could muster. The fully powered sprint is just short of three minutes, and at the end, the hardworking warrior hunches over. Both  are pressed against her knees, and she's heaving as if someone had just forced every ounce of oxygen in her body out. Vision is a bit hazy, and as  a form of precaution, Mirai takes a seat, and drinks a canteen of chilling water.

"Phew..."* - Thu Nov 12 10:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Shut up. - Thu Nov 12 10:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) ||
Cue resting ten to fifteen minutes after the exercise. Before the eventual rest, her heart was beating at an almost inhuman rate, it thumped harshly, and at times felt as if it had given up on life. The sensation gave the impression that perhaps her own heart would simply leap from her body, so that it would no longer be subjected to consistent overworking. 

Nevertheless, with enough time to recooperate, her heart would settle down, and her muscles too would have recovered. "Alright. .  Got my cardio in. Now, I gotta work on my close-quarter-combat." 

Looking around, and realizing she was all alone, Mirai began by using a common method of hand-to-hand combat -- shadow sparring.  Her knees buckled a tad, allowing for a crouch to be entered. Her hands come upward, and while they often served no offensive purpose, each mitt would be well-positioned as to aid in defensive measures.Indeed, after falling into her basic stance, the woman's mind entered a state that allowed her to imagine an actual opponent being before her presence. After taking a step forward, the training began!

The training sequence was simple. Mirai starts off, performing basic kicks. Simple shin-checks, 'Big Boots' -- which is basically a heavy, straight-forward kick with the intent of planting a boot into your foe's chest -- and of course, the patented roundhouse and axekicks. Initially, they were done with repetition and of course are performed by each legs. After doing about a hundred reps each, Mirai opts to shift the sequence up just a tad. After all, in combat, your opponent wouldn't just allow the same, repeated strikes to go on without reacting accordingly.

The second half of the hand-to-hand exercises were made up of working on combinations. Each string of attacks were timed, to better measure how quickly and efficiently Mirai could switch things up. Roundhouse kicks often were re-directed while in the air, and converted into shin checks and so forth. Admist the repeated strikes, the Hyuuga's body pivots. At times, this meant her shoulder slanting forward, other times this meant that her head would duck downward. Why? To practice the motions that would be needed to perform an evasion.

The shadow sparring was kept up for a good fourty-five minutes. Afterwards?* - Thu Nov 12 10:30:36 2015
