<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) instinctually actuated her Byakugan in light of the fact that she realized that it would be valuable to learning this technique that Sanoke was I the midst showing her. Veins would protrude her temples as she enacted her Byakugan which conceded her a various measure of capacities. 

Mirai would listen eagerly to Sanoke's clarification in spite of it not being his best she would retain the data and keep on watching him as he continued to further elucidate how to perform the technique. With her Byakugan active, she could see his chakra fluctuating all through his body as he amassed a vast amount of chakra permitting it to course through his body through his chakra system. 

Mirai was familiar with the technique having seen a few forms of the technique and having seen Sanoke himself use it. She didn't know about the points of interest however and had taken in a bottomless measure of things in regards to the jutsu that she was currently learning. After Sanoke had given her a clarification in full detail the Hokuma sought to perform the technique before him. 

Shutting her eyes strands of her silver hair would fall over her eye shaping her beautiful face. With her eyes shut the Hokuma would invoke a monstrous measure of chakra permitting it to move through her body. Once her chakra was fluctuating all through her body and beating sporadically. 

Mirai would split her chakra apart and manipulate the appearance of her chakra permitting it to take on an appearance that was indistinguishable to hers. Once Mirai had done this she would evenly convey chakra among every individual clone, giving every clone an equivalent portion of her general power. 

Once Mirai had done this the technique is prompted and a tuft of smoke would cover her figure for a minute. When the billow of smoke subsided standing by Mirai would be two clones of herself that had possessed her facial components and physical components. Each clone would have an equivalent portion of her chakra and would be half of her quality.* - Wed Nov 18 06:54:43 2015
