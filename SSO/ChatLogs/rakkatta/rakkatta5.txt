<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've eventually complied pivoting on her heel and turning around to face Sanoke. Unaware of what was to happen shortly after she turned to face him only to fall victim to his Genjutsu. Due to the lack of knowledge of Genjutsu and never experiencing being trapped in Genjutsu. 

Metamorphically the woman would find herself in a massive hole and an unknown individual with a shovel stood before her hovering over the hole. A few seconds later the individual would begin to shovel dirt in the hole burying her alive revealing that her biggest fear was being buried alive. Gazing up towards the individuals the Hyuuga would scream in agony as the hole slowly began to be filled with a numerous amount of dirt.* - Thu Oct  8 23:47:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) proceeded to scream extremely loud amid being trapped in Sanoke's Genjutsu. Unfortunately, she fell victim to a Genjutsu that made her experience her deepest fear which, of course, sent her into a shock. By now the Hyuuga was envisioning being buried alive by an unknown assailant. After several minutes of screaming she would have instinctively activated her Byakugan helping her determine that the entire thing was, in fact, a Genjutsu.  

Placing her hands together, she would contort her digits in haste before she went through the process of performing the technique known as Kai. Remembering the instructions that Sanoke had taught her she would cease the flow of her chakra before she sent a surge of chakra through her body. After performing the technique everything that she envisioned dispersed and thus she would've been freed from the Genjutsu that had been cast on her. Despite having practiced the Jutsu, it seemed as though she still had trouble figuring out when she was in a Genjutsu without the help of her Byakugan.* - Fri Oct  9 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Can we do this elsewhere? - Fri Oct  9 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: It's crowded here. - Fri Oct  9 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Alright. - Fri Oct  9 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Can I learn both? - Fri Oct  9 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Sure. Which would you want to learn first? - Fri Oct  9 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Doesn't matter. - Fri Oct  9 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) followed Sanoke to a new area so the two of them could train alone and in seclusion. Arriving at the new location she would peer towards Sanoke as he began to inform her on how to perform the first technique he would be teaching her. Mirai would merely nod her head several times amidst his explination to signal to the turtle sage that she was paying attention to the information being given to her.

 After listening to his detailed explaination she watched him exhibit the Shurikenjutsu-based technique. Activating her Byakugan the woman would peer towards Sanoke as she prepared to utilize her Dojutsu to increase her perception and further increase her understanding of how the technique actually worked. Complying she would peer towards him as he removed a shruken and sent the first shuriken soaring through the skies. 

Following the first shuriken she would await for him to discharge the second shuriken which happened shortly after. Through the use of her Byakugan she was able to see that the speed of the second shuriken was much faster then first so it could catch up to the first shuriken. She was capable of seeing both shuriken due to her Byakugan being active but she realized that this wouldn't have been the case if it weren't for her Dojutsu being activated.

"Seems simple" was all the teen replied.* - Fri Oct  9 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) was fortunate enough to be blessed with a Dojutsu that could help her track the movements of the shuriken effectively and precisely which not only helped her with seeing the demonstration but clarified what was required of her in order to perform the Jutsu successfully. Accepting the two Shuriken that had been given to her by Sanoke. 

With the Shuriken in hand, Mirai was prepared to practice the technique for a bit in order to grasp the momentum and speed of which she was supposed to toss the Shuriken. Without hesitation, the Hyuuga would've flicked her wrist sending the first shuriken whisking through the air at a decent pace. 

Clutching onto the second shuriken Mirai would've discharged the second shuriken at a speed superior to the first so that it could catch up. Mirai threw the second shuriken in a particular fashion and in accordance to where the shadow of the first shuriken was so that it could blend in accordingly. By now both Shuriken would've been tossed by the Hyuuga and the second shuriken would've been blending in perfectly with the first shrouded by the shadow making it undectable to even the finest shinobi.

After her first attempt the Kunoichi would go dislodge both shuriken from the cactus that they had been embedded upon and practiced the technique multiple times until she was ready to move onto the next technique that was going to be taught to her.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) ||She could feel it. All of her hardwork was paying off at last. . .

Just recently, the beauty had learned a new technique. No, it wasn't anythign too flashy, hell the technique wasn't even related to her clan's kekkei genkai. Nevertheless, learning was still invaluable as it would provide much needed experience and  versatility. After all, only a fool of a shinobi would ever dare to pigeon-hole themselves into a single art form or battle style. What if in the future, an opponent just simply wasn't approachable by means of close-range?

"Alright. . . Time to practice my Shadow Shuriken technique. . ." She murmured, at last making an allusion to the skill that had be graciously taught to her by none other than Sanoke, her boyfriend.

Having arrived in an isolated field. the woman's chakra flares, allowing the Byakugan to be awoken. In this state, her perception took a nice incline, due to the Byakugan allowing for precise view of very. . . obscure locations. Read: Tenketsu, and other weak points or entries. That said, equipped with a scroll, she's enabled to summon a vast quantity of shurikens, each being perched or settle onto a nearby platform.

All shinobi knew how to do one thing -- and that was how to throw a weapon. The skill was fundamentally taught while in the academy, at least it was while Mirai was in attendance. Thus, it's clear to see that the young Hyuuga actually is quite adept in the art of weapon tossing. With several shurikens now in hand, she takes a quick first step forward, while whipping her wrists forward. Her digits release their grip of the shurikens mid-stride, allowing the force generated to carry the two tools ahead.

Considering the amount of momentum that went through this all, the two basic ninja tools rotate, completing countless revolutions up until they were crashing into an obstacle. Quite frankly, she had performed admirably in the attempt. .  . Yet tossing singular shurikens wasn't going to be enough. Who the hell would ever succumb to a single shuriken strike? 

For the next half hour, the girl is relentless in her ambitious training endeavors. Every few rep, she's adding an additional shurikens, so that the weapons can be sent in mass of even numbers, thus making more and more of those metallic weapons of death concealed at any given time. Sadly, the training isn't without fault. As a novice in the skill itself, she often screws up when using more than two shurikens solely.

Instead of screeching through the skies, they occasionally hammer against one another, knocking their travel off course or trajectory. Nonetheless, each time she practices, Mirai is gaining a heap of experience and further cementing her status as one of the more promising genins that Sunagakure has to offer. The minutes tick on, prompting the training regime to eclipse the hour mark, yet the Hokuma refuses to cease in her practices. . .

Due to the endless grind, she's able to now use four to six shurikens in one throw, making evasion of the potential sneak attack all the more difficult. Considering the climate, there's a light layering of sweat and that forces her form to glisten in the light. Her arms are also a bit sore, yet given all of the valuable experience earned, Mirai figures that the pain was worth the gain. She turns now, planting her ample rear onto the floor and pressing her back against the tree.

A hand drifts onto her side, retrieving a scroll for the Heavenly Rotation skill . . .This was going to be difficult.* - Fri Oct  9 11:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) ||
Given all the physical and spiritual exercises that had done as of late, it was now time to go over her knowledge and technical skill. Excitedly, the subject for today's lesson actually was governed around her clan's ability.

As a descendent of Hamura, and a proud member of the Hokuma (or Hyuuga) clan, Mirai possessed one innate ability. A greater level of skill to use each and every one of those tenketsu in the body -- three-hundred-sixty-one in total. Indeed, releasing the uncommon tenketsu was something that any shinobi could learn to do if given enough dedication or practice, although most likely years.

However, in her case, the usage of these chakra nodes came more easily. Although. . . it was far from perfect. Wasting no time, the contents of the scrolls are unraveled, allowing her lavander optics to read the information vividly. Upon first glance, it's clear that the male who had written the document knew precisely what he spoke of. It was filled with various detailed explanations, along with picture diagrams in order to help visualize the true nature of the jutsu.

'Heavenly Rotation. . . A 'basic' or instrumental technique for all of those who bare the Hokuma name, and seek to truly refine their ability with the gentle fist. This technique is believed to be an absolute defense, considering the fact that nearly nothing can break through once the circulation has began,' the scroll articulates. This brings a giant grin onto Mirai's face, her heart swelled with pride, and her soul sang with joy. At last, it was time for some actual progression to be made.

Reading ahead, her lips remained pursed, only occasionally moving as she absentmindedly mouthed the words. At times, the woman hardly even blinked as the information was just to captivating or exciting to look away from. '. . .The technique is a staple for a Hokuma's defensive capability. It works by taking advantage of the clan's ability to innate or more easily tap into the various tenketsus on the body. As you would expect, using just one of these chakra points on a different area of the body is simple enough. . .What makes this technique so difficult and unique is that. . '

She looks ahead, wide-eyed. 

'You must utilize all of them simultaneously. Naturally, this is quite taxing on your chakra reserves. In the end, the jutsu -- in explanatiion -- is simple. From each point of your frame, those needle-like chakra nodes are to emit powerful bursts of energy. To do so requires the utmost mastery of your internal systems, thus making you able to multi-task and release from these points simultaneously. . . yet still at the max efficiency possible.'

From here, a diagram is finally shown. It showcases an elementry illustration of a basic human body. Along it's frame are hundreds of blue dots, representing the chakra points or tenketsu previously discussed. The shinobi, using no hand seals mind you, begins to manipulate such.  From there, the picture splits off into two different directions, as depicted by the arrows. Each arrow is colored in different colors, one blue, the other red. The red arrow was to show the incorrect process, while the blue arrow had to showcase the correct sequence.

For the former, the shinobi begins to release chakra irregularly around his body. Some portions had a powerful current flowing outward, while other parts of that diagram's body was unable to truly exercise his full spiritual might when his focus had been divided to such an extent. A caption is left around or under the pic. "As you can see, it's imperative that you can be consistent with the release of chakra as anything else will only hinder the jutsu. Likewise, to begin with the training sequence. . . Make sure to practice opening up more than one tenketsu and forcing out chakra. Gradually add onto this limit as you go on."

Looking down onto the next picture, it's shown vividly and correctly just how to perform this rotation technique. More or less, in this example, the shinobi is more than capable of releasing enough chakra from every point of his body to reach a state of equality, an equilibrium if you will. This was imperative no doubt. Feeling compelled, Mirai seeks to mimic this herself.

As you would expect, she's failing miserably. Certainly, chakra from her hands and forearms react accordingly, unleashing a decent surge. However, the release is weak. . . feeble even. On top of this, there's only about twenty or so different tenketsu in total that are being accessed. As she aims to add more, notably targeting the chakra emissions around her shoulders and back, the entire process screws up. Whenever another was being added, one of the tenketsu in a more clustered area flickers out like an old light bulb.

After some more time of aiming to emulate what was being taught, the female shinobi eventually ceases, feeling that it's best to continue keeping her mind focused on the scroll. After all, once this had been finished being analyzed, she could resume with her training, and hopefully reach a level of skill that was presentable to the current, psuedo-clan head, Koji. "Gah. . . Just wait a little more. Even if this reading is starting to irritate me. . . " Despite her words, Mirai remained very much interested in seeing just how far she could go with this scroll. Even if the process of reading an analyzing every bit of information was irritating or repetitive.

Before long, the reading process was again underway, prompting the ambitious woman to continue with her subtly mumbles as the words flowed from her mouth. 'In addition to all of the information shown. . . the next step is just as important. In the event that you reach a level of skill that allows you to release an equal amount of chakra with equal force. . . The next process is building up velocity. Indeed, for this jutsu to be flawless, the user must be able to spin at a fast enough rate.'

'Once a proper level of speed is updated, the chakra will form a sphere meant to protect and repel anything that comes in contact. This process requires impeccable conditioning to actually achieve the desired speed.  Once this is produced, you should be able to flawlessly execute the technique.'

Of course, no explanation was complete without a pictorial sequence. Bluntly enough, the shinobi depicted from before is right back at it. He spins rapidly, moving at a fast enough pace to send back any of the items or ninjutsu that dare comes in his direction. That settled. . . Mirai finally understood the technique perfectly.

Now, it was just up to her skill and drive to actually be able to reproduce the effect. Considering the level of skill needed, this wasn't going to be something that was done over the course of an hour -- like the Shadow Shuriken. No, for weeks on end -- almost a month even -- Mirai was hard at work. The process of mastering the release of each tenketsu was a trying one, yet it was still something she greatly desired to accomplish.

During the first weeks, the girl showed clear struggles. No matter how hard she tried, there was no clear improvement. Never one to be deterred, Mirai would have persevered, still training rigorously even with the lack of significant progression. Her mind would always drift off, allowing the girl to enter her own world in a sense. In these trances, it felt as if she could feel out each of the small, yet numerous nodes along her body. And with this? She propelled to new heights, learning how to activate each of them in an increasingly simultaneous manner.

Every few days, ten more in total was being added -- ten more total tenketsu mind you. It was a tedious sequence, but with enough attempts, she was reaching the pinnacle of the technique. It takes about three weeks in total to finally be able to release each of the chakra nodes in her body in one go. The outpour is fairly power, no doubt. It comes out of her petite frame like a roaring river, and distorts the winds in the nearby vicinity. Wasting no time, Mirai goes to do the 'easy' part considering her impressive physique.

After spinning, a proper Heavenly Rotation is produced. Although there's still much work to be had, as she requires far too much focus to use this regularly in battle.	* - Fri Oct  9 13:10:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) thought now was the ideal time to do some training. Having learned another technique a couple of days back, she wanted to refine the ability and guarantee that she could perform it freely. Departing from the village square she would discover a region where she could prepare in disconnection. Arriving at her typical training area she would look around examining the region to check whether anybody was present. 

Once she scanned the region she would continue with her training. Mirai would enact her Byakugan causing veins to protude her temples and her vision to augment significantly. Once her Byakugan was actuated she would endeavor to perform the technique that she had learned as of late known as the Heavenly Rotation. "This technique will permit me to both attack and defend" Mirai contemplated internally as she arranged to execute the technique. 

In a matter of seconds, the Hokuma would be spinning on her heels. In the midst of her spinning she would discharge chakra from each tenketsu in her body creating an arch of chakra. The sphere of chakra that had concealed her figure would've enlightened the territory as her chakra manifested and was presently noticeable. Turning quickly the Hokuma would stop in the wake of rehearsing the system.* - Fri Oct  9 22:13:45 2015
