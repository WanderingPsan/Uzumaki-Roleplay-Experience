<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) was completely busy with endeavoring to master the shadow clone technique alongside a manoeuvre that Koji had taught her as of late. Luckily, Sanoke had a various measure of Jutsu in his repertoire that she was interested in and didn't mind learning so that she could utilize it for herself during combat should she need too. 

Nodding her head Mirai would place her hands together contorting them rapidly before she framed a solitary seal. Closing her eyes for a minute before she would activate her byakugan causing veins distend around her temples as she actuated her Byakugan just as Sanoke had instructed. Once she actuated her Byakugan she would listen intently to the shinobi as he clarified the basics of the technique. 

All of a sudden a surge of chakra would transmit from Sanoke. The uncontained flares of chakra would've lit up the zone as he evoked a various measure of his chakra permitting it to manifest and become visible to the Hokuma. His chakra kept on surging through his body before he merged his spirtual vitality into her body.

 After the display and the explaination given by her life partner Mirai was sure that she could perform the technique. She had adapted more perplexing techniques and this one appeared to be simple and less troublesome then the other techniques that she learned. mimicking and regarding sanoke's actions and words the Hokuma would start to evoke a tremendous measure of chakra causing about her chakra to flare about and shroud her body.

Her chakra would emanate from her body now that she had evoked an inconceivable measure of it. The Hokuma would start to channel her chakra endeavoring to empty her spritual energy into Sanoke. Being a Hyuuga and a practioner of the gentle fist style she was very familiar with infusing chakra into people. Her chakra would pervade Sanoke covering his figure as she had managed to transfer her chakra into him.* - Wed Nov 25 06:12:28 2015

Fortunately the deranged individual who had been going to each village to wreck havoc upon the civilians and  those who lived there had been defeated and didn't escape this time. 

Arriving at the location where the Shinobi and civilians  had been slain Mirai would peer towards the numerous amount of individuals who had laid in the soil lifeless. Their corpses had been mutilated and blood had completely covered the area. The sight of this had discouraged Mirai she was sad that Suna had experienced Casaulities however, she knew that during every war there was going to casualties. 

After several moments of pondering Mirai would clasp her hands together and begin to weave through a series of hand seals. Forming the last hand seal Mirai would muster up a numerous amount of chakra. A cloud of smoke would've soon shrouded her body enveloping her completely. One the cloud of smoke had dissipated standing next to the Kunoichi would've been multiple clones of Mirai. 

A grin formed upon her face as she peered towards Sanoke demonstrating her ability to utilize the technique that he had taught her.  Along with her clones Mirai would begin to channel chakra to her hair follicles stimulating the growth of her hair and allowing her to manipulate it. Her hair would soon be imbued in chakra for a bit as she mustered up a numerous of chakra to each individual strand of her hair. 

Her chakra would emanate for a moment before it would fade. Once she had kneaded chakra to her hair follicles Mirai along with her clones would begin to pick up the bodies. Strands of Mirai's silver hair would ensnare the corpses of the slain Shinobi and civilians utilizing her hair to pick them up. Mirai and her clones would do this repeatedly taking each corpse to the hospital so that they could be buried later.* - Thu Nov 26 07:57:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered towards Sanoke as he removed his glasses which rarely happened. She peered into his optics for a moment as he began to speak his Dojutsu. She wasn't quite familiar with it or the abilities he poessessed however she was aware that whenever he accquired another users eyes he would gain an ability that would benefit in combat. She would approach the turtle garu gazing into his eyes as if she was looking for something.

"That's the attitude that you need to keep. Stop being so negative and think positive. You've known for a while that you would have to battle him for those eyes and now that you finally defeated him and obtained his eyes you're sad. We get to finally plan our future together and you're completely bummed out. With war there will be casualties and we will just have to rise the occassion each time someone tries to bring harm to the village and our loved ones. I'm proud of you and you should be proud of yourself. "
