At first Mirai wasn't quite fond of the technique and found it to be useless but as she progressed as a woman and shinobi she realized how useful the technique could be if utilized correctly. Forming a single hand seal the Hokuma would amass chakra to her eyes activating her Byakugan so that she could see the flow of his chakra and how he kneaded it into the wire that he utilize to bind individuals. Accepting the wire that had been tossed towards her. Peering towards the shinobi with her Byakugan she would watch him knead chakra into the wires to allow him to manipulate them. Mirai would do the exact same. blah blah blah (lazy rp)* - Thu Nov 26 21:43:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: We can just go in there I suppose. - Fri Nov 27 00:21:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: While, you don't want to talk to Sanoke. The both of us can hang out, until you decide to forgive him. - Fri Nov 27 00:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) wasn't quite interested in this mission and didn't want to go into the sewers which smelled terrible and probably was full of bacteria. Being the individual that she was Mirai cringed at the thought of entering the sewers. 

Once she pulled herself the Hokuma would amass chakra to her optics causing her Byakugan to activate which would expand her vision considerably. Due to the fact that it was going to be difficult to find the crew that had been deployed into the sewers without her Mirai figured that it was ideal that she went into the sewers to help find the gentlemen to complete the mission. Peering towards Chikyu for a moment she would part her lips responding to the girl's suggestion.

"I don't want you to go down there by yourself. If I'm down there the odds of us finding them will increase and we can likely finish the mission quicker if we both go into the sewers." Mirai muttered peering towards the swordsman before she approached the hole which lead to the village's sewage system. 

Without hesitation the Hokuma would leap into the giant hole descended down into the depths of the sewers. Whilst she waited for Chikyu to join her, she would peer around towards the area utilizing her Byakugan to search for the individuals that had been sent into the sewers. The odor was overwhelming and almost unbearable, however Mirai managed to keep her composure and refrain from vomiting.* - Fri Nov 27 00:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've landed in the sewers and was accompanied by her comrade Chikyu. With her Byakugan active her vision was expanded and would aid her locating the individuals that had been sent into the sewers. Glancing around, she would've noticed a various measure of things such as blood, strange symbols of glyphs that had been written along the wall, and of course chakra. Peering towards Chikyu the Hokuma would speak in a fragile tone.

"I see a numerous amount of strange things. The thing that strikes me as odd is that there is blood down here. I'm not certain if it was here before, or if it's fresh however, I'm going to assume that something happened recently down here. I don't know a Shinobi in the world who even think about coming down here so it leads me to believe that something odd is happening here. It's best that we head to figure out what's been going on down here. Also, be on alert like I said I saw blood so there may be a chance that we might have engage in combat." 

Mirai said before she began to head east guiding Chikyu through the depths of the sewers. The stench would've intensified as the two of them traveled further into the sewers. The Hokuma would've been on alert as she traveled through the dimly lit area occasionally gazing around to see if she could spot anything else unusual.* - Fri Nov 27 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've proceeded to travel further into the sewers. As she continued to venture deeper into the caverns she could sense a foreboding aura one that was unusual and omnious. It was something that the Hokuma had never experienced before during her long years of being a Shinobi. 

Despite this feeling she continued to venture off into the sewers and it appeared as though she and Chikyu had taken the right route because they hadn't encountered anything along the way and seemed to be headed in the right direction. Noticing the array of glyphs and symbols that had been drawn upon the sewers, she would've assumed that they were on the right path to finding the individuals whom had drawn them. 

Lacking knowledge in fuuinjutsu she couldn't dechiper any of the symbols or what they were going to be utilized for. Once they came towards an open area she would notice that a barrier would've been erected around the area and she wasn't able to see through said barrier even with her Byakugan active. 

"Unfortunately, I can't even see through the barrier. Whoever erected it must be powerful, especially since I can't see through it. I usually can see through anything even mist that it is condensed of chakra, however, I can't see through this mere barrier. We need to be extremely cautious and mindful of our actions at this point." 

Mirai stated before she proceeded forwards attempting to enter the barrier. Should she succeed the women would venture forward passing through the barrier. She couldn't help but powerless in this entire situation due to being forced to do the crappy mission that was assigned by her terrible fiance who set her up to do something she wouldn't ever dare to do and her Byakugan failing to allow to see through the barrier.* - Fri Nov 27 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) ||After several seconds attempting to phase through the barrier Mirai and Chikyu would've successfully managed to pass through the barrier. During their attempt they would've endured a bit of pain and sustained minor burns, however, now the two of them managed to pass through the gaseous barrier that had been created within the sewers. 

Beyond the barrier would've been an ethereal wall and yet another opening. Mirai assumed that the two of them would be getting to the root issue at this point having passed through the barrier and travelled through the depths of the sewers for a considerable amount of time. Venturing forward, she her ears would've perked up as she heard the sound of cries of agony resonating throughout the area. 

Standing in a cloak that shrouded their figure would've been an individual whom Mirai assumed to be the culprit behind the workers going missing. Seals would've been plastered along the walls and the room would've began to glow illuminating the area and forcing the waste to seep through the cracks that had formed upon the surface as the flooring was cracking.

"I don't know what's worse the stench of this place or your horrid fashion sense. You're ugly and demented. Who in their right mind would choose to harvest people in a place like this. Just filthy and I'm going to beat the crap out of you for making me come down here." Mirai bantered clearly still upset that she was tasked to come down to this place.* - Fri Nov 27 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered towards the woman as she retorted her comments with her own* - Fri Nov 27 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) looked towards the woman as she retorted her remarks with her own. Mirai lacked information on Mana and wasn't exactly certain what the woman was capable of doing with her Mana, however, she was tasked with bringing the individuals who had wandered into the sewers to back to safety. She watched the woman eagerly noticing that she didn't even bother to face her and Chikyu. 

"Is she mocking us?" Mirai mumbled assuming that woman was underestimating her and her comrade. Having her back turned particularly towards somebody who specialized in Taijutsu was presumptuous and idiotic. Watching the cloaked individual she would see a surge of vitality coursing through her veins. A little while later a pool of dark energy would've permeated her whole figure as her dark energy flowed through her veins before she invoked a staff out of nowhere. 

The staff would've been made of crystalline material and was a dull orchid shading as far as tint. The moment the woman tapped the staff against the ground surging her mana energy into the ground, it would start to tremor causing a segment of the ground to be destroyed. The glyphs that were put upon the walls of the would've lustered brilliantly as they shined before a beam of energy exploded from the composed images. 

The rush of energy would've been sufficiently effective to knock the Hokuma back a considerable distance. Since Mirai had voyaged pass the barrier she was fit for seeing the trapped individuals that were beyond the walls of the lady's sanctuary.* - Fri Nov 27 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) was impressed as the woman had managed to conjure up a creature to do her biddings for her. She had never met an individual that could summon a creature like this one. Despite her Fiance being able to summon turtle it was nothing compared to the creature that this woman had summoned. (Shots) 

She observed the creature taking in all of it's physical elements before she peered towards the woman who had called her out. Peering towards the woman she would listen to her chanting an assortment of things before a ray of energy moved through the air. 

With her Byakugan activated she was capable of seeing the energy that  manifested after the woman had completed her chants. Leaping into the air the kunoichi's body would distort whilst she was in the air as she adequately evaded the influx of energy that coursed through the air that aimed to detain her. Landing on the surface of the ground once again the Kunoichi would dart towards the woman leaving Chikyu to deal with the creature she had conjured up.* - Fri Nov 27 03:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) proceeded to close the distance between herself and the woman as she lazily maneuvered her staff as an assortment of spells were chanted. Dark purple energy would've illuminated the magical staff as shot forward this time much faster than previously. 

Once again the agile Shinobi would've utilized her swift reflexes contorting her body amid being in the air. This would've went on for several seconds and the Shinobi would've flipped around as if she was an acrobat for a moment as spell after spell had been discharged towards her. Once Mirai was in close enough proximity to the woman would've envisioned an eight trigram circle. 

An eight trigram seal would've appeared beneath her and the woman's feet. Within the eight trigrams seal would've been a various measure of different seals and a green emanation would've emitted from the circle. With the woman in range of her attack Mirai would've entered her stance before she brutally assaulted the woman. Chakra would've claded the Hokuma's hands before she began to strike the woman viciously. 

Being a master of this fighting style the Hokuma would've moved fluidly quickly striking each tenketsu within the woman's body. Behind each individual strike would've been an immense amount of force.  Surges of chakra could be seen being infused into the woman's body each time Mirai struck her. The chakra would've pierced through her figure as she repeatedly struck her. Whilst Mirai was attacking the woman she would've been doing a chant of her in Japanese.

"Hakke ni shou, Yon shou, Ha shou, Jyuu roku shou, San jyuu shou!" Mirai stated clearly stating the number of palms, she had utilized on the woman which happened to be sixty-four. * - Fri Nov 27 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) was in the midst of striking the sorceress with a various measure of palms. Having recently mastered the technique was was eager to employ it in combat and this was the perfect opportunity to utilize the technique Koji had taught her. Assuming that she had won the fight, she would've been caught off guard and was struck by a power blast that sent her hurtling in the opposite direction. 

The injury she would've sustained would've been grievous causing her severe burns and burning through the fabric of her new outfit. Her body would've been drenched as she lay in the sewage for a moment before she recuperated. Rising to her feet, she would knead chakra into her follicles allowing her to effectively speed up her hairs natural growth rate and grant her the ability to manipulate it. 

Her hair would lash out towards the woman attempting to coil around the woman ensnaring her in hair. Should Mirai succeed the woman would've been entangled in her silver hair, her mouth would've been covered by an individual strand of hair preventing the woman from chanting out another powerful spell. Mirai's massive breast would've partially been exposed at this point the top of her body suit had been burnt through furthering exposing her enormous cleavage. A look of disgust would've been plastered upon Mirai's face, she was clearly infuriated. One word would've been uttered from the Hokuma's mouth as she shot a glance towards the cloaked woman.

"Bitch." Mirai muttered gritting her teeth.* - Fri Nov 27 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) formed a single seal creating a clone. Said clone would've began to spin rapidly releasing chakra from each tenketsu. Chakra would begin to pour out of the clone and a blue hue would've shined brilliantly illuminated the area momentarily as the clone performed the rotation technique to shield Mirai from being struck by a powerful spell once again. 

The Hokuma wasn't very durable and likely couldn't withstand being struck by a spell of that caliber again. Should the clones attempt to shield the Byakugan princess another strand of hair would lash out towards the woman attempting to completely bind her. Due to one of her legs already being ensnared the odds of evading and avoiding being entangled within her hair would've been slim to none.* - Fri Nov 27 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would contort her neck slinging her head before she released the Sorceress sending her hurtling towards the nearby wall with an immense amount of force. However the Hokuma wasn't done just yet and would begin to amass chakra to her scalp she would increase the volume and density of her hair. 

As chakra began to flow through her the lengthened hair the hardness of her hair would've now been comparable to that of steel wire. By thickly bundling her hair together, it's strength is further increased also increasing its destructive power. Manipulating her hair Mirai's hair would've quickly began to construct itself as it was bundled up together, taking on the form of a lion's mouth. 

Should the woman open her eyes, she would've seen a massive amount of hair in the form of a lion's mouth hurtling towards her. Should Mirai's attack land the woman would've been smashed into the nearby wall by her hair likely knocking the woman unconscious and causing severe damage.* - Fri Nov 27 05:42:36 2015
