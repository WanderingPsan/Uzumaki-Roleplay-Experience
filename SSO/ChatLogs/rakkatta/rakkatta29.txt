<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've withdrawn from the training fields and made a beeline for a more secluded area so she could train with Paine. In spite of her fighting style comprising of striking each tenketsu in the body to bring about the adversary internal damage and disrupt the flow of their chakra and prevent them from using chakra she assumed that it is perfect to learn other Taijutsu techniques so she didn't need to dependably rely upon her factions fighting style and had different strategies and approaches to defeat an enemy. 

Once both of them arrived at a secluded region she would look towards Paine watching her intently and how she situated her hands. Nodding her head Mirai would imitate her sensei. Her right hand was shaped into a clench fist and her left hand stayed opened. Both were soon united and brought down into a level position before her midsection. 

Once Mirai had done this the Kunoichi would peer towards the rock for several moments. She was clearly a bit hesitant about striking the rock, but she wanted to learn the technique and also didn't want to disappoint Paine since she was one of her prized pupils. 

Approaching the rock she would slam her elbow into the rock with an immense amount of force. Mirai made sure not to strike her funny bone to prevent herself from going into shock. Once her elbow came in contact with the rock it would've been enough to leave a crack within it.* - Fri Nov 20 08:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) was currently training with Paine. She had become acclimated to how Paine taught and was sure that she would need to make a few endeavors in the event that she anticipated learning this technique. When it came to learning techniques and jutsu it was uncommon if one learned it on the first endeavor and she was sure that this technique would take a few endeavors. 

In spite of having made a crack inside of the stone Paine had instructed her to strike it yet again. Without hesitation, she would pull back her arm from the rock before she would hit it yet again with her elbow. Mirai wasn't exactly sure what was required of her, however, she had come to the conclusion that performing the method effectively required the client to administer a huge measure of strength into a solitary blow. 

With this in mind once she conveyed her next strike she would assemble up an immense amount of strength before she struck the stone causing it to crack further and the splits that had been inserted inside of the stone would grow and extend upon the rock. After this strike the enormous rock would've appeared as though it was going to break at any given minute.* - Fri Nov 20 08:57:36 2015
