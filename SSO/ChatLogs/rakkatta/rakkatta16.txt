<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) hadn't had a spar with Koji in a long while and she was eager to show her development and how far she had come following the last time fought. Peering over towards her opponent her gaze would be focused upon Koji as he prompted her to make the first move. Shaping a solitary hand seal, the Hokuma would activate her Dojutsu causing veins to protrude her temples altogether enhancing her vision and permitting her to see Koji's chakra network. With her Byakugan enacted she felt empowered and was confident due to her Byakugan being activated because of the capacities and force that it conceded her. 

Without a second thought, the Hokuma would run towards Koji closing the distance between the two so she could start her assault. Voyaging towards Koji the Hokuma would've given him a fearsome look one that would appear to be puncturing through the spirit of her clansmen. Once she closed the distance between herself and Koji she would start her attack crouching down into her typical position Mirai's hands would be claded in chakra. A blue radiation would've encompassed the entirety of her hands as she started to quickly convey a progression of strikes towards Koji. 

The rate of which she conveyed every palm would've been quick and she moved abruptly making it troublesome for even the most fearsome shinobi to contend with her however Koji was blessed with the Byakugan which expanded his perception? so she was sure he was capable of contending with her or even defeating her.* - Sat Oct 31 07:21:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I want to see this battle. - Sat Oct 31 07:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) was resolved and fairly centered around defeating Koji and demonstrating to him her ability when it went to their clans capacities. With her Byakugan actuated she knew that Sanoke was watching and this just impelled the Hyuuga on and made her invest more energy into attempting to defeat Koji in a fight. Mirai would've moved effortlessly as a blue surge of chakra discharged from her palms with every blow she exchanged with Koji. 

Her lavender shaded optics were focused upon Koji as he fought with her and exchanged blows with her adequately as both of them continued to battle showing their clans fighting style known as the gentle fist. As both of them were occupied with hand to hand combat Mirai saw that Koji still managed to keep up with her despite her developing in strength over time. The Hokuma's movements would've been precise as she planned to disrupt the flow of Koji's chakra. Her ravishing silver hair would've swayed forward and backward with her developments as she sent a series of palms towards Koji. The Hyuuga's movements wasn't the only thing  that was graceful so was she. * - Sat Oct 31 07:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) couldn't help but overheard Sanoke cheering her own from the sidelines. The support from her fiance only incited the Hyuuga to push harder despite her becoming quite tired as the fight continued. With each palm she delivered a surge of blue charge would've been visible as her chakra claded hands voyaged towards Koji. Listening to Sanoke's suggestion the Hokuma would attempt to strike Koji in the arm to render one of his arms immobile and thus decrease the chances of him striking her and him winning the fight. 

Fortunately she was quick enough to evade the strike to her shoulder however she was struck in the torso which caused an immense amount of pain. A single tap by a Hokuma could cause grievous damage due to the nature of their fighting style and unfortunately she was struck. 

Despite being struck Mirai proceeded to fight through her injuries ignoring the pain she felt for the time being. Mustering up a significant amount of chakra Mirai would deliver a strike directly towards his abominal area. Once her palm made contact with his flesh a surge of chakra would've manifested and pierced through him. Her palm would've remained planted on his abominal area once she made contact as awaited for a reaction from Koji.* - Sat Oct 31 08:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) was unfortunately in the range of Koji's attack and was vulnerable to Koji's attack. Assuming that she won the match Mirai would've been victim to a series of strikes that were executed by Koji at a quick pace. Despite having better reaction time and attack speed it seemed as though Koji's speed and overall fighting ability had increased in that moment. Her body woulld've been covulsing with each palm as he effectively closed off her tenketsu disrupting the flow of her chakra and causing a signifcant amount of damage. 

"I lost" Mirai thought to herself internally ignoring what Koji had said. To her she had taken yet another lost despite displaying how far she had come it still wasn't enough to defeat Koji.* - Sat Oct 31 08:55:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've arrived on the scene and noticed that Koji was coated in sweat as he repetitively struck the tree a various measure of times. She couldn't help but notice that he was in his stance so she assumed that he was utilizing the gentle fist to strike the tree rather than mere Taijutsu. Mirai would remain quiet for a few moments simply watching him train before she decided to speak although she was completely aware that he could, in fact, see her.

"Hey, Koji, How are you?" Mirai said greeting him. The tone of her voice was completely different and wasn't the same joyous tone that she usually spoke in. She couldn't help but recall her defeat yesterday which took a toll on her already low self-esteem.* - Sun Nov  1 00:55:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Trilliam I'll see you soon. - Sun Nov  1 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) knew that she was going to have to expand her arsenal of Taijutsu techniques outside of her clans technique if she planned on becoming a more versatile and overall a better shinobi. Peering towards Paine she would simply nod her head before she parted her lips to speak in a joyous tone. 

"You're strong I witnessed you fight Sanoke and you're quite a formidable foe and exceptionally skilled in Taijutsu hopefully we can have a spar one of these days once I become stronger. I'm still quite new to this whole shinobi thing and I haven't had much of a chance to grasp my abilities and learn more about my clan to develop more techniques." Mirai muttered before she took a few steps back away from Paine. 

A devious grin formed upon her face before the girl would contort her body crouching down a bit before she extended her leg outwards executing a quick leg spin exhibiting the technique known as leaf whirlwind one that she had practiced and mastered quite some time ago. After she had successfully demonstrated the technique she would peer towards Paine. 

"I'm quite familiar with leaf whirlwind it's one of the first techniques that I learned once I become a shinobi. I even learned it before I learned a few of my clans techniques. " Mirai muttered peering towards Paine waiting for a response. She was hoping that the Taijutsu practioner would teach her another move that she didn't already know.* - Sun Nov  1 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sure I don't know what that is. - Sun Nov  1 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Care to explain what it is and demonstrate? - Sun Nov  1 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: u-uhh...u-umm t-thats right..i-i should...d-do that.. - Sun Nov  1 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered towards Paine as she began to demonstrate and explain the technique she would be teaching her in further detail. Mirai's gaze was fixated upon the Taijutsu practitioner as she began to speak and elaborate on how to perform the technique and where the user usually should aim to strike the foe. Absorbing the knowledge Mirai would keep a mental note of the important pieces of information that Paine conveyed to her. 

She couldn't help but notice that Paine seemed quite nervous as per usual, but the Taijutsu practitioner managed to effectively display the technique for Mirai. Parting her lips, she would speak in a fragile tone. "You shouldn't be so nervous all the time Paine. You're great in Taijutsu it is your specialty have a bit more confidence in yourself and in your abilities. You're one of the strongest Shinobi I've come across since I've been in this line of work." Mirai muttered suggesting that Paine should be more confident in herself and her overall abilities. 

After witnessing Paine's exhibition of the technique, Mirai figured it was ideal that she practiced the maneuver herself. Since she was a beginner Mirai would take a running start. Sprinting at a quick rate the Hyuuga would leap into the air before she extended her left leg forward, making sure to arch and point her toes forward. The maneuver was simple enough and being a practitioner of Taijutsu herself learning the technique wasn't inconvenient for Mirai.* - Sun Nov  1 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) "I know it's not as easy as it seems. My cousin is going through the same issues she isn't confdient. Hopefully, you become more confident in yourself over the years." 

Mirai muttered before she would simply nod her head taking a step back as she prepared to demonstrate the technique for Paine once again. Unfortunately, she didn't quite seem to execute the technique correctly the first time. Despite failing she was eager to try again and perform the technique until she performed it correctly. 

Sprinting off Mirai would leap into the air once more before she extended her leg forward. She would be mindful of her posture and be sure to keep her knees slightly bent so that her leg would be straight. Once she performed the technique she peered towards Paine before she parted her lips. "How was that?" Mirai inquired wondering how she did this time around. She wasn't certain if she was performing the technique right.* - Sun Nov  1 04:20:41 2015
