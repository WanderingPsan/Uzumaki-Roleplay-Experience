<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've remained on the inverse side of the training area as she looked towards Izanami as she arranged to fight the kunoichi. Mirai had no clue what she was capable of or what her skillset was anyway she was keen on seeing what the granddaughter of the Kazekage was able to do. 

Acting off mere instinct the Hokuma would rotate on her heel turning a whole 360 degrees the minute the youthful tyke tossed a small ball of fire straightforwardly towards her. Turning on her heel an immense transmission of chakra would've concealed her figure in the form of a sphere. Adequately discharging a tremendous measure of chakra from all the chakra points in her body Mirai would've intended to repel the assault, creatig a shield of chakra around herself and repulsing the attack back towards Izanami. Once she had successfull protected herself from izanami's assault Mirai would've come to a halt ceasing her movement. Opening her eyes, she would've enacted her Dojutsu causing viens protude her temples and expanding her general observation, significantly enhancing her span of vision, and permitting her to see Izanami's chakra network.* - Wed Oct 28 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) thinks: I hate fighting people who utilize Ninjutsu. - Wed Oct 28 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) had managed to successfully thwart Izanami's attack and defend herself from being struck by the Katon technique that had been utilized by Izanami's. As smoke and debris filled the air the moment the ball of flame explosion occurred Mirai decided that it was best to close the distance between herself and Izanami and quickly.

"She's quite skilled in Ninjutsu better get closer to her and fast." Mirai thought to herself. With her Byakugan activated she could see through the smoke and debri that had enveloped Izanami's tiny figure and noticed that the child was reaching for some weaponry. With her increased perception, she could also the wire attached to the shuriken that had been discharged towards her. 

In a matter seconds her a blue emanation would've shrouded her hands and her hands would've been clad in chakra. Running towards Izanami the Hokuma would extend her hand forward swatting away the shuriken that had been flung in her direction being mindful of the wire of that was attached to each individual shuriken.* - Wed Oct 28 06:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) advanced towards Izanami hastefully an a attempt to close the distance between the two of them so she could fight on her terms and utilize her taijutsu style. Voyaging towards Izanami Mirai couldn't help but notice the girl clap her hands and with her perception significantly increased and her Dojutsu activated she was capable of seeing the wires being manipulated even if she wasn't staring directly at them. Amidst running towards Izanami Mirai would form a single seal before her body would've flickered as she traveled at a quick pace utilizing the shunshin technique to move at a quick enough pace to effectively avoid being coiled in the wires that had been set ablaze by Izanami.

Mirai would've utilized the shunshin technique to effectively avoid the attack and position herself behind Izanami so that she could attempt to strike her. Once she was behind the child Mirai would've crouched down entering her usual stance before she began her assualt. Her hands would've been completed coated in her chakra as she delivered two swift attacks towards the child an a attempt to disrupt the flow of her chakra and cause some internal injury. Her movements were fluid and graceful as she motioned her palm forwards displaying her prowess and ability to execute her clans fighting style.* - Wed Oct 28 06:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've been in the midst of assualting Izanami but unfortunately the child was extremely skilled with utilizing her chakra nature and seemed to manifest an abundant amount of flame around her figure acting as a shield to protect her from her assaults. In the process of attacking the child Mirai would suffered from minor burns causing her to cease her actions for the time being. She would've merely stopped realizing that there was no way she could win this spar if she couldn't attack the girl without inflicting harm on herself in the process.

"Neat technique. I can't beat ya kiddo." Mirai expressed accepting defeat from the child.* - Wed Oct 28 07:05:23 2015
