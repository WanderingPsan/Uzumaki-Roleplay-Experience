<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: Then come. - Sat Oct 17 20:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've grabbed onto Madelyn's hand establishing a firm grasp before she led her twin sister towards the training grounds where the vast majority of her training occurred. Once both of them touched base at the training grounds she would peer towards her sister before she separated her lips to talk in a delicate tone. 

"I'm glad you're mindful of what the Byakugan is because it's required to utilize our clan's fighting style. On the off chance that you weren't aware, our clan originated from Konohagakure and was viewed as the most powerful clan that occupied the village. Seeing as you're of age and because of the wars and sinister individuals that try to obtain our families secrets and claim our eyes I thought now was the ideal time to start your training so that you could appropriately defend yourself should you need too." Mirai murmured peering towards her twin sister pausing for a minute before she started to talk once more. 

"So would you say you are willing to dedicate your time to learn how to defend yourself? It will require a considerable measure of time and commitment yet I can guarantee you i'll be there to guide you through the process and teach you all that I know." Mirai said consoling her sister that she would guide her through the procedure if she needed too. * - Sat Oct 17 20:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) listened eagerly to her sister as she talked. She found Madelyn to be entirely hysterical particularly in the wake of watching her ruthlessly attack and rip the head of a bird off however she was focused on what was important at the moment and peered towards her twin sister as she enacted her Byakugan. Mirai was in awe for the simple fact that she had no clue that her sister was even equipped for initiating her Byakugan in spite of most Hyuuga being fit for doing as such after birth. 

"It isn't that simple Madelyn. The Gentle fist style is comprised of a series of assaults towards the foes chakra pathway system. It can only be used once your Byakugan is enacted which concedes you the ability to see the chakra pathway framework in this way permitting you to make precise strikes to your adversaries tenketsu. With this ability, you can cause internal damage on your adversaries and stop the stream of their chakra. When this is done and you have sufficiently struck enough of their Tenketsu's that individual won't have the capacity to make utilization of their chakra for a long while. " Mirai mumbled clarifying the concept and how to utlize their families battling style in full profundity to her twin sister. 

Her lavender shaded optics were focused upon her sister now as she talked. approaching her twin sister she would close the separation between the two them before she talked yet again. "Since your Byakugan is actuated you can see my chakra pathway framework. I need you to strike one of my tenketsu's. Push your palm forward and convey an assault and refrain from striking me close to my heart. " Mirai said instructing her sister selecting to permit her sister to practice on her.* - Sat Oct 17 21:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) insisted that her sister strike her for a various measure of reasons. Peering towards her twin sister she noticed that she closed her eyes before she struck her. Once she was struck she felt an immense amount of pain however she kept her composure in an attempt to not display the pain she felt. Parting her lips she would speak in a low tone. 

"You managed to strike one of my tenkentsu's however the next time you do this you want to keep your eyes open. Your eyes are what grants you your power keep them open our clans fighting style is about utilzing our eyes to strike the tenketsu precisely. Keep in mind that it's going to be a difficult fighting style to master. In time you will be able to perform this fighting style fluidly" Mirai muttered to her sister in a low tone before she turned to face Shin and noticed him observing. She would squint towards him but she didn't utter a word for the time being.* - Sat Oct 17 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: So what do you think? - Sat Oct 17 22:07:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: There are alot of evil people....The world is based around fighting and killing. I mean, as much as I want peace, I've killed and even vowed to kill certain men. Is it evil to kill?---In your opinion? - Sun Oct 18 07:33:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't believe in murder. All lives are valuable. I understand that people feel the need that they must kill, but my journey is to change the way people think. Too many people view themselves as tools, which is a reason why we fight for our lives. - Sun Oct 18 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Is murdering and killing the same thing? - Sun Oct 18 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So to answer your question, I don't believe it to be 'evil' as evil is a relative word. There's no good or evil, just those with an open mind and those who refuse to think in a new way. - Sun Oct 18 07:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Taking the life of an individual is all the same. I've yet to take a life, and I hope that I don't have to. I've been told that such a day will happen, but I really wish one won't arise. - Sun Oct 18 07:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I can't agree with you there. We both are looking for peace in the world though...I don't see it happening without certain people dying. - Sun Oct 18 07:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I am willing to die in order to achieve peace..But I'm not here to die  without a fight. You will find a man one day that cannot be changed, and is destined to be killed or continue killing. - Sun Oct 18 07:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You will realize at that point, this world can't be so innocent....It will never be so innocent. - Sun Oct 18 07:39:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, we take two paths towards the same goal. Maybe we will achieve it together, through different means. There are many ways to take down a beast. - Sun Oct 18 07:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Perhaps.. - Sun Oct 18 07:42:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I guess mine is from personal experiences. But my brother was murdered in cold blood and so was my closest friend. - Sun Oct 18 07:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And those men who killed him are the men I have vowed to kill. They are everyting that is wrong with the ninja world. We have a few like that in the village and I wish to change them for the better...From my experience, it's more probable that I'll have to kill them. - Sun Oct 18 07:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see. So your 'peace' is one where your loved ones don't die through the actions of other men? - Sun Oct 18 07:44:38 2015
