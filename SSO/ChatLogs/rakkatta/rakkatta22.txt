<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered towards Chikyu as she reached for the sword that was upon her shoulder. Her eyes widened the instant she saw the girl reach for the weapons. After witnessing what happened during the last spar with Mitsunara it made the Hokuma a bit uneasy however she was going to trust that the girl wouldn't get carried away. 

She had intended on holding back however seeing that the girl chose to utilize her blade Mirai would channel chakra to her eyes activating her Byakugan causing veins to protude her temples. As the veins formed upon her face the woman would've felt empowered the moment she activated her dojutsu. 

With her Byakugan active she was capable of seeing the woman's chakra passgeway system and her vision was exhanced signifcantly. Peering towards the woman as she charged for her Mirai would remain in position preparing herself to evade the woman's attack if need be.* - Sun Nov 15 00:06:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered towards Kasanari as she closed the distance between the two of them. Mirai was prepared for the blow and contemplated on how she was going to go about fighting her opponent. She didn't know if utilizing her clan's fighting style would be to much for just a simple spar. 

The moment Kasanari was in close enough proximity and swung her blade Mirai would've utilized her swift reflexes backflipping in order to gain some distance away from the girl and to effectively dodge her attack and avoid being struck by the woman's blade. Once she had avoided her attack Mirai would charge for the girl. 

Once Mirai was in close enough proximity she would've entered her usual stance before began to deliver a series of palm thrust towards the girl in an attempt to cause internal injury and disrupt the flow of her chakra. She would've moved gracefully as she demonstrated her prowess when it came to utilize her Byakugan and clan's fighting style. Each strike made to Chikyu's chakra points were swift and accurate. * - Sun Nov 15 00:21:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) had managed to successfully strike the girl. Despite Mirai being clearly faster she still was impressed by the girl and found her to be considerably strong for her age. She assumed that being struck would have singificantly injured the girl and she wouldn't be able to push through the injuries but Chikyu had proven her wrong. 

With her Byakugan active her vision was expanded considerably thus allowing her to see the movements of Chiyku which only aided her when it came to avoiding her strikes. Ducking to avoid being struck by the blade Mirai would extend her left leg out before she spun and entire 360 degrees in an attempt to knock her off of her feet. * - Sun Nov 15 00:37:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Now we can watch - Sun Nov 15 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've entered the hospital room and instinctively put on a pair of gloves. She was going to be dealing with a corpse and wanted to protect herself from the bacteria that shrouded the body and she didn't want to contaminate the body. Heeding Kiyoko's instructions she would lift his legs up a bit, allowing the woman to remove the bag that was underneath the corpse. 

Once this was done, she would begin to unbutton his shirt before she began to strip the corpse of every article of clothing. Due to the body lacking arms it wasn't quite difficult for her to remove the shirt and removing everything else wasn't much trouble for the aspiring medical Shinobi. Parting her lips, she would speak to Kiyoko in a delicate tone.

"The individual that found the body said that the arm were removed when he found it. We spoke to the guards about it and they said he was last seen harassing a woman with purple hair. Once Koji arrives, we will investigate further and try to figure out who murdered this individual and left his corpse to rot within the walls of Sunagakure." Mirai said delicately having now removed the clothing waiting to begin cleaning the corpse.* - Sun Nov 15 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've listened to Kiyoko as she stated that this individual was killed outside the village. She was a bit relieved that this didn't take place within the walls of Sunagakure but was also depressed that someone had lost their life. She would nod her head, glancing down towards his legs, scanning the area for any wounds that might have been inflicted upon him during a scuffle. Unfortunately, she didn't find anything which led her to believe that he died due to blood loss just like Kiyoko had stated. Peering towards the medical Shinobi she would speak. 

"I don't mind if you send everything to lab. I'm sure I and Koji can make use of the information it will probably help us figure out what exactly happened to this individual. I'm relieved that this didn't take place within the village though.I couldn't fathom living with a murderer or someone who would do this. For now the only information we have is that he was arguing with a woman with purple hair and he died due to losing too much blood. Hopefully some light will be shed on this incident soon. I'm curious to know why the body was left here. Maybe he was coming here to help but died at the gates." Mirai said, speaking to Kiyoko about the entire situation.* - Sun Nov 15 04:18:59 2015
