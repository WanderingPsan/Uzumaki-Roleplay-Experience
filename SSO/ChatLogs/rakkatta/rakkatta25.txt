<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) had just been briefed upon the mission her and a few of her comrades had to complete. After listening intently to the Kazekage explain the details of the mission she would nod her head realizing that her Byakugan would be a neccesity in order to complete the mission successfully. 

After moments of pondering the Hyuuga would form a single seal and muster up an abundant amount of chakra to her optics causing veins to sprout upon her temples as she activated her Byakugan. With her Byakugan activated her vision was expanded considerably allowing her to individuals that were 10 kilometeres away. 

After receiving information on their location she would peer towardsKirigakure atempting to spot the individuals that had kidnapped her friend Chikyu. In the midst of searching for the girl with her Dojutsu she would notice a large source of chakra just east of Konohagakure. After several seconds of scanning the area with her Byakugan she had spotted the bandits. Parting her lips Mirai would deliver the information to her squad of the location of the bandits.* - Tue Nov 17 07:30:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ... Ai, I don't think what's east of Konoha is them either... And besides, it's on the way. We have to go through the area to the east anyway... to get to the other. - Tue Nov 17 07:32:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: The mission is the save the genin before they murder her...After this mission and everyone is checked out then you can go east of Konoha and check out the chakra but beware, it might be death. - Tue Nov 17 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: -- I'm saying we need to go check out the individual bandit east of where we are right now, not the Konoha shit.. - Tue Nov 17 07:35:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Like.... If neither of those things are the bandit's we're looking for, this is worrying. One of the two has to be it. - Tue Nov 17 07:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Either that individual bandit is a survivor from their group, or they are camped east of Konoha... - Tue Nov 17 07:36:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: So maybe we should check out what's east of konoha. - Tue Nov 17 07:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Also I see a lot of corpses. - Tue Nov 17 07:36:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: We engage while the clone runs with her underground. - Tue Nov 17 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Because this guy isn't going to just let us go in, grab her, and get out. We are, in fact, goign to have to fight- even if you do send in a clone to get her while we do so. - Tue Nov 17 07:53:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Or... is the plan for me and Mirai to just sit back while your guys clones do it all? - Tue Nov 17 07:58:17 2015

With her Byakugan active she was capable of determining the real Lerixus from the clones. Once she had found the real Lerixus she would dart towards the individual a glare would've been cast upon the individual as she voyaged towards him at a quick pace. Once she was in close enough proximity she would crouch down entering her usual stance before she began to deliver a series of palm strikes towards the individual who deemed himself to be a god. 

Mirai's hands would've been imbued in a blue hue as she effectively displayed her prowess and ability to utilize her clan's fighting style known as the gentle fist.  She would've moved fluidly as she discharged each individual palm in an attempt to disrupt the flow of his chakra. She knew she would be required to land more hits if she wanted to prevent him from using his chakra temporarily. If her hits were to land he would sustain internal injury despite his durability.* - Tue Nov 17 22:14:11 2015

Her hair would smack the wrist of Mitsunara attempting to change the trajectory of her attack. If she were succeed Mirai would lash her hair out towards the individual binding him. With her hair coiled around the individual she would utilize her hair to send him hurtling through the air. Once she had sent him hurtling through the air she would manipulate her hair bundling up and changing the shape of it to that of a lion's mouth. Her hair woudl've been reinforced and was as tough as steel. If she were to succeed he would have been devoured by the lion's maw that was constructed out of her hair.
