<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mirai(Rakkatta) would touch base at the destination far from her confidants. Standing specifically opposite of Koji the kunoichi would've looked towards him as he charged for her. Naturally Mirai would've initiated her Byakugan causing bulges to show up around her eye attachments as she used her clans Dojutsu. Due to initiating her Dojutsu Mirai's vision would've extended fundamentally and she could now see Koji's chakra network and the chakra that moved through his body. Hunkering a bit and entering her fighting stance the kunoichi would've set herself up for his assault. 

The moment his clench hand would've been in close enough proximity to Mirai she would've motioned her hand forward aiming for his wrist in an attempt trying to divert the course of his assault. If she somehow happened to succeed her right hand would follow aiming directly towards his abdominal area. Being certain to use her Dojutsu the kunoichi would obviously be aiming for one of his chakra points. She would've done quickly and effortlessly having practiced her clan's fighting style known as the gentle fist.* - Fri Oct  2 04:58:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mirai(Rakkatta) would have succeeded in redirecting the course of Koji's attack and dispatched one of her own. Disastrously her attack would've been diverted as well and Koji was awfully too quick for her to keep up with his movements to satisfactorily impede his next strike. The minute Mirai was struck the Kunoichi's lips would've isolated and she shrieked in complete utter torment from her tenketsu being hit with such constrain. 

Groaning in devastation the kunoichi would've endeavored to launch an attack on Koji. Moving rapidly she would've augmented her palms forward using her clan's fighting style and viably dispatched her palm towards his lower arm. Being a practitioner of this style and sharpening her aptitude she would've done this easily and without much inconvenience showing her capacity to use her families fighting style adequately. If she somehow happened to succeed she would continue her assault and endeavor to overpower Koji with a series of strikes.* - Fri Oct  2 05:20:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mirai(Rakkatta) peered towards Koji as he countered her assault and began to spin a complete 360degrees releasing chakra from each of his chakra points. In a matter seconds, Chakra would manifest and envelop his figure forming a dome before she blown away and knocked off of her feet into the dirt and debri a few feet away from Koji. Laying on her back Mirai would gaze up towards the sky as she layed there motionless before Koji arrived. 

She would accept his hand before she stood up on her feet and parted her lips to speak to him. "I wasn't aware that our clan was sought out in the past. We can work on restoring our clan if that is what you wish. I've yet to run into anyone else like myself other than you of course." Mirai muttered before she would begin to wipe away the dirt that lingered on her clothing. Her eyes would dart towards Sanoke before she approached him and grabbed his hand intertwining his digits with hers. Being the territorial individual that she was she wanted to mark her property and claim her pet while the presence of others. A lewd grin would form upon her face before she managed to utter one word. "Mine" * - Fri Oct  2 05:36:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mirai(Rakkatta) would peer towards Sanoke now that both of them were in segregation and far from their comrades. Looking towards him she would place her hand upon the sash that was tied around her waist before she undid it and started to uproot the kimono that clung to her voluptuous figure before she stripped down completely before Sanoke until she was bare. She would've stood before the turtle sage now complete nude her voluptuous figure, plump ass, and gigantic bosom all presented to him. 

Her cheeks would've been a reddish hue now as she looked towards him before she separated her lips to talk in a low tone. "One of your obligations of being my pet is you are required to fulfill my needs. This will be my first time engaging in sexual intercourse so be delicate pet." Mirai mumbled giving him the honor of deflowering her. Looking between her thighs she would've seen her womanly discharges trailing down her thighs. Climbing on the bed Mirai would position herself on all fours curving her back pushing her sufficient ass into the air uncovering her wet snatch. Her vaginal lips would've been shimmering in her emissions. She would've remained in this position waiting for Sanoke to satisfy her.* - Fri Oct  2 08:43:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: (grab) - Fri Oct  2 21:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mirai(Rakkatta) would've been gathered up off of her feet and into the arms of Sanoke bridal style as the two of them left the fairly swarmed area. Looking off into the skyline as Sanoke sprinted away with her in tow the Kunoichi would look around the village with her lavender shaded optics before Sanoke came to a sudden halt. Her ears would perk up subsequent to listening to Sanoke propose showing her some Jutsu. Jumping down onto the ground and out of his arms she would look towards him her ivory-hued optics would've been set upon him and it would've appeared as she was gazing into his soul with her piercing gaze. 

Separating her lips, the kunoichi would talk in a genuine tone. "I want to learn the Jutsu that will permit me to break free from Genjutsu. With my eyes, I can see through the most powerful Genjutsu however with that technique it will just increase my possibilities of being liberated from any Genjutsu that is cast upon me. I'm keen on learning Kai as you call it." Mirai communicated peering towards the turtle sage. 

Pausing for a moment the girl would stare down towards the soil before her attention diverted back towards Sanoke. "I was serious when I said I'm going to kill them. All of them" Mirai muttered clearly seriously about the claims she made about murdering the shinobi of Kirigakure that slaughtered a numerous amount of her family to obtain their sacred Dojutsu.* - Fri Oct  2 22:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mirai(Rakkatta) would simply shake her head as Sanoke continued to talk requesting that she forgive the individuals who brought on her family lament and uprooted their eyes as though they were creatures with expectations of obtaining the secrets of her family's most prized possession the Byakugan. 

"I can't overlook the individuals who have caused harmed to my family. It is still all that much an issue and I'm not going to permit you or anybody else to sweep this underneath the rug as though it isn't imperative. My family and the other family that was hunted merits equity and sooner or later somebody needs to adhere to a meaningful boundary and that individual is going to be me. You asked me why I became a shinobi is my reason. To exact vengeance on the village that wiped out a majority of my family.Those individuals are only terrorist who crushed the family that my antecedents worked so hard to build and bring to its glory." 

Mirai expressed in a frosty tone before she took a seat on the ground and started to take after his guideline orderly like Sanoke asked. Setting her hands together, her fingers would interlock as her digits distorted and she framed the "Ram" hand-seal. Once she had successfully framed the hand seal she would start to focus her chakra. With her eyes shut the Kunoichi would be focusing her chakra assembling up the chakra that  coursed through her body.* - Fri Oct  2 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mirai(Rakkatta) would've remained seated on the ground listening to Sanokes words as he guided her through the process of performing the technique known as Kai. Heeding his word she would follow his instruction using his analogy as a means to cease the flow of her chakra. Once she ceased the flow her chakra she would reboot it causing it to flow through her body once more. Fortunately, this didn't take much effort from Mirai and learning the Jutsu didn't consume most of her time. 

Opening her eyes, she would peer through her lavender shaded optics gazing towards Sanoke a smile forming upon her face as she felt her chakra coursing through her curvaceous frame once more. Parting her lips, she would speak in a joyous tone. Her entire demeanor completely different from the cold side she displayed a few moments ago. "Is that all that's required to perform the technique. If so I'm certain I can do this at will now. " Mirai commented on the technique providing feedback to Sanoke. For a few moments, she would peer down towards her chest gazing directly at her exposed cleavage before a smug grin formed on her face before she looked at Sanoke. Mirai wouldn't utter a word she would simply gaze at for the time being.* - Sat Oct  3 00:03:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mirai(Rakkatta) peered towards her kin as he spoke to her. Parting her lips, she would respond answering his question. "I haven't learned any of our clan techniques. I was hoping you would be able to teach me some. I'm a fairly new shinobi and I'm not as experienced with utilizing my Dojutsu like you are. I've mostly been working on improving my reflexes at the moment. As of now I can only see chakra points and utilize the fighting style which I demonstrated yesterday. I'm sure with time and dedication I'll be able to learn moves or at least develop some on my own." Mirai answered peering towards Koji.* - Sat Oct  3 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Also, your apart of my clan now but you're free to have another teacher as well. Im still a novice. - Sat Oct  3 01:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mirai(Rakkatta) ||". . . Hagoromo help me. . " Mirai thought to herself with a frown. What she sought was power, but this. . . The whole training regime, it was a bit much. Despite the reluctance, she knew better than to refuse Kojiro's requests, not only because of his strength but due to his pseudo rank as clan head. ". . . Yes, senpai," she'd say, somewhat submissively.


After doing a few exercise stretches, Mirai turns about towards the east. As she's prepared, her legs kick off the ground. Each pace is with a long stride, and holds decent power, enough to kick up a brief sandstorm or dust.  Her rate of velocity leaves much to be desired. She was simply as fast as an average genin, which was still swift in it's own right. About as quick as a trained, olympian-classed athlete in the real world. Nevertheless, as far as shinobi went, Mirai was dirt slow.


". . .Hrn. . .I hate this," she muttered along the way. In a few minutes, an entire mile had been covered, and by then, she was closing on the eastern wall. Coming to a skidding stop, Mirai turns about face, resuming in the same, determined fashion. She ran like a pro, her legs always stretching to the max capacity, allowing each rep to garner the most gains. But even with the mad dash, the gal moved in a peculiar way, one that was provocative and all too reminiscent of those cheesy, old school beach shows, like Baywatch. 
Her features, while tightly held together, swayed to and fro. Considering the location, many random citizens are able to witness the training session. Most seemed surprised, as, despite the Hyuuga's feminine and fragile physique, she moved with a level of grace that denoted a shinobi. Others simply gave catcalls, whistling-- But Mirai was having none of that. A task had been given, and thus, it was going to be completed. 


"Keep at it. . .Even if my legs are burning. I must acquire enough strength to gain vengeance for those that persecute my kind. . . And if running this much will gain me the energy required to learn a new technique, then so be it!" From her lavender eyes, you could practically see a fire, fire contained within those beautiful optics. Clearly, this wasn't actual tangible inferno, but simply a metaphor, accurately describing her spirit, her soul. Her resolved was absolute, and it was this same drive that compelled Mirai to continue in her running antics, no matter how tedious or boring they may become.


For the next hour, she continued with the regal strides and is closing in completing her goal. Thirty miles had been ran more or less, and by now, she's a stinky, sweaty mess. Due to the consistent exertion of physical energy, the lass is clearly exhausted, and thus cannot run at full capacity. Her legs lazily or un-energetically moved, obviously no longer being at max efficiency. "Keep it going. . . Keep it going. . . " 


After a bit more time of urging herself, Mirai eventually reaches the viewing point of her destination. She had effectively completed forty-one miles after an hour and a half. With a smile, the last lap is completed, leaving the young Hyuuga girl at her starting position, right by the canyon. Instinctively, she hunches over and places both hands onto her knees. Heavy heaves are taken in and out, allowing oxygen to be inhaled at a rapid pace, each time granting needed nutrition to replenish the vitality lost due to muscle fatigue.


Considering the high amount of sweat, her robe clung to her body, leaving even less to the imagination, though still keeping her modest. Swaying back and forth, Mirai clearly fights back the urge to fall over in the sand. Was this the type of training shinobi did daily? "Damn . . I. . What was the second part again, senpai. . .?"* - Sat Oct  3 02:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Guess not.  . - Sat Oct  3 03:16:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would have effectively circled the village finishing Koji's thorough preparing administration. Stopping the Kunoichi would be breathing intensely as she looked towards Sanoke as she was totally encompassed in sweat. Having circled the whole village, she was sweating plentifully. Soaked in sweat she would wipe the beads of sweat that framed on her temple away before she identifies with Sanoke. 

"I've already communicated to you what I plan to do Sanoke. I'm not certain why you take me for some kind of joke." Mirai murmured before she entered her stance hunching down a bit until she was comfortable. In a matter of seconds, the Hyuuga would start her preparation motioning her hands forward with an open palm honing her families fighting style known as the gentle fist. Being a practitioner of this style, Mirai wanted to sharpen her aptitudes sparring successfully releasing a progression of assaults towards the air. 

She would continue with her training wanting to enhance her capacities and bring honor back to her clan. Parting her lips amidst her training she would speak to Sanoke using this time to speak with him. "So you once were a shinobi. Why did you become one and why did you resign from being one?" Mirai inquired as she motioned her hands forward swiftly discharging a series of strikes towards the air.* - Sat Oct  3 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would continue with shadow sparring continuing on and releasing a progression of assaults towards the air as Sanoke talked about his past. Her ears would perk up as she listened eagerly to his explanations behind becoming a shinobi and resigning. As he talked about the deeds that his village did she recoiled a bit in the midst of her training yet she didn't display any signs of digust like she normally did. 

Stopping she would glance down towards her cleavage where a various sum sweat accumlated causing her enormous bosom to shimmer in sweat. She would soon occupy her consideration back towards Sanoke before she took a seat by him on the ground. Shutting her eyes the Hyuuga would close her eyes contemplating as she spoke with him. 

"Sounds like a fascinating past you have. I think that it's odd that you yourself don't concur with the activities that they've done yet you don't wish for me to punish them for their wrong doings. I'm certain till this day they do evil degenerate things. I'm glad that you've chosen to not be biased due to affiliation with a village. " Mirai said before she paused for a minute before she continued to talk. "Sanoke the hardest thing in this world is to live in it. Be bold and never permit others to stray you from the way you have chosen." Mirai murmured as she hummed somewhat continuing to contemplate.* - Sat Oct  3 04:43:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) Everyone could benefit from daily training. . . Yet it was especially important for someone that worked as a trained, and paid shinobi or kunoichi. For the weeks that preceded today, the bulk of Mirai's training had seemingly been centered about spiritual training. Things involving the refinement of chakra control, or the improvement of her reflexes. But any good warrior would tell you. . . To truly grow into a fearsome combatant, one not only had to gain proficiency in the spirit, but also in the body.

Fast forward a few minutes after awakening for the day.

She's at a secluded region of Sunagakure, wearing a comfortable track-suit. Before beginning with the exercise, the young kunoichi proceeds with thorough stretching exercises. Each one limbers her muscles up accordingly, and limits the risk of any injuries being earned or aggravated. Of course, this also rid the body of any stiffness, and thus increased the range of motion for your limbs. That settled, Mirai wasted little time, speeding ahead, at a brisk pace. The goal of the exercise was simple, to improve muscle endurance, stamina, and overall leg power.

For the few half hour, she remained sprinting, although never once moving to go at top speed. Each step or pace around the goal is one that expends a steady or even amount of physical power. A miniscule amount of sweat builds up, providing a small amount of moisture to her flesh, although this is easily noticeable. Despite the beginnings of fatigues, Mirai's impressive work ethic forces her to continue with the task at hand. As the continued calisthenics ran it's course, additional evidence of fatigue began to creep out the woodworks. 

Minutes eventually develop into an hour, and before Mirai knew it, a good chunk of her morning had already been put towards training. Towards the end of the jogging exercise, she picks up the pace, speeding along the track in a circular fashion at the maximum speed her exhausted muscles could muster. The fully powered sprint is just short of three minutes, and at the end, the hardworking warrior hunches over. Both  are pressed against her knees, and she's heaving as if someone had just forced every ounce of oxygen in her body out. Vision is a bit hazy, and as  a form of precaution, Mirai takes a seat, and drinks a canteen of chilling water.

"Phew..."* - Sat Oct  3 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) ||
Cue resting ten to fifteen minutes after the exercise. Before the eventual rest, her heart was beating at an almost inhuman rate, it thumped harshly, and at times felt as if it had given up on life. The sensation gave the impression that perhaps her own heart would simply leap from her body, so that it would no longer be subjected to consistent overworking. 

Nevertheless, with enough time to recooperate, her heart would settle down, and her muscles too would have recovered. "Alright. .  Got my cardio in. Now, I gotta work on my close-quarter-combat." 

Looking around, and realizing she was all alone, Mirai began by using a common method of hand-to-hand combat -- shadow sparring.  Her knees buckled a tad, allowing for a crouch to be entered. Her hands come upward, and while they often served no offensive purpose, each mitt would be well-positioned as to aid in defensive measures.Indeed, after falling into her basic stance, the woman's mind entered a state that allowed her to imagine an actual opponent being before her presence. After taking a step forward, the training began!

The training sequence was simple. Mirai starts off, performing basic kicks. Simple shin-checks, 'Big Boots' -- which is basically a heavy, straight-forward kick with the intent of planting a boot into your foe's chest -- and of course, the patented roundhouse and axekicks. Initially, they were done with repetition and of course are performed by each legs. After doing about a hundred reps each, Mirai opts to shift the sequence up just a tad. After all, in combat, your opponent wouldn't just allow the same, repeated strikes to go on without reacting accordingly.

The second half of the hand-to-hand exercises were made up of working on combinations. Each string of attacks were timed, to better measure how quickly and efficiently Mirai could switch things up. Roundhouse kicks often were re-directed while in the air, and converted into shin checks and so forth. Admist the repeated strikes, the Hyuuga's body pivots. At times, this meant her shoulder slanting forward, other times this meant that her head would duck downward. Why? To practice the motions that would be needed to perform an evasion.

The shadow sparring was kept up for a good fourty-five minutes. Afterwards? Her early morning training was completed.* - Sat Oct  3 06:12:03 2015
