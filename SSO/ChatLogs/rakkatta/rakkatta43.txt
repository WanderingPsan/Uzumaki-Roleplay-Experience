<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) || After being briefed on the mission that was assigned to her squad Mirai would pivot on her heel turning towards the entrance of Sunagakure prepared to depart to Konoha. Traveling through the desert the Hokuma would begin to ponder on a few things as she traveled with her comrades. Several things came to mind as she proceeded to travel through the desert. Parting her lips the Hokuma would speak in a delicate tone.

 "You know I've never been to Konoha? I've heard an awful lot about the village but never was quite interesting in visiting. It's funny because that's where my origins are according to a few of my relatives. I suppose it would be nice to see where my people originated from and how the village looks." Mirai stated peering towards her comrades as the trio proceeded to travel through the sandstorm.

 Her lavender shaded optics shined as the sunlight beamed down upon the trio of kunoichi as they headed towards the village known as Konohagakure. The Hokuma would occasionally alert her comrades to halt their movements so that they could all take breaks whilst the travelled.* - Thu Dec 10 15:59:08 2015
