<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) shuffles on off.* - Thu Nov 19 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) pushes through the hospital's door. Admittedly, she isn't expecting to find anyone significant, as most of the hospital's staff didn't seem quite competent enough to teach any medical skills. But. . . ladyluck seemed to have a different idea. 

Her beautiful lavander eyes fall onto Erin's features.

"Hi! I just stopped by to see if there were any medics around that could help me learn some healing ninjutsu. . . -- My name is Mirai, by the way."* - Thu Nov 19 01:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) grows a bit chipper at the response. It was a simple fact of life, Mirai reacted positively when treated kindly.

Just as the Inoue had done, Mirai's eyes moved to scan the teen's own features. It was clear that despite Eri's high status, she was still a bit young. Perhaps even moreso than even the Hokuma.

A smile spawns, prompting the beauty to step forward, a hand extended. "Wow! Really? I've been looking all over to find someone to aid in learning medical ninjutsu! It's a pleasure to meet you, Miss. . ." She says with a lasting drawl to lead into Erin's own introduction.* - Thu Nov 19 01:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) felt her heart warming just do to how genuine and kind Erin came off. Still, the smiling begins to fade, replaced with a subtle smirk. After the brief period of hand shaking, Mirai's hand is pulled back and falls at her side. 

"That would be nice, yes. Medics have to stick together, no? So tell me, when would you like to begin?" The Hokuma spoke gently, her lavender eyes never once leaving Erin's own gaze. She seemed to be in no rush, after all, why be demanding when a person was taking time out of there own busy schedule to be a help? 

A hand rested onto the table, and she'd lean over, using that arm to support her weight. Despite the calmness, Mirai still held an aura of eagerness about her.* - Thu Nov 19 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) 's eyes dialated once it was clear that Erin finally was going to come aid in her ascent as a medical shinobi! In fact, the notoriously stoic Hokuma  still sported that same eager smile.

She kicks off the ground, showcasing a little speed, and ending right by Erin's side. 

"Where are we going to train?" Naturally, medics didn't practice their skills at the first desk. Hopeful eyes wait for Erin to lead the way, as Mirai wasn't quite familiar with the hospital, despite being an increasingly skilled medical shinobi. * - Thu Nov 19 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) ||Apparently, they were leaving the hospital. Following behind Erin, Mirai tranverses through the heated streets of Sunagakure. Doing so wasn't an issue, as she had grown accustomed to the climate of the area given that she's lived here practically her entire life. 

In a few short minutes, the duo would arrive to a familiar home. Her partially visible pupils scans the exterior, and immediately prompts her to grow cautious. Blood. . . and a lot of it, reading 'Zenaki's Home.' "Wow. . . That's quite.  --A unique way of referencing your home. Did she really need to use blood?"

Chakra pumps to Mirai's eyes, forcing veins to laterally become visible. For that brief moment, she looks beyond the walls, scanning the inside for anything of note. Once all checks out, she pushes through, a tamed smile still in place. "Okay! I'm all your's, how will you teach me?":* - Thu Nov 19 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) says: I'm really good at healing, so don't be surprised if the chakra isn't as effective for you. - Thu Nov 19 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) visibly flinched once Erin had cut herself with the Kunai. Blood was drawn, yes. Enough that she could feasibly heal herself, but Mirai couldn't help but to think 'There must be a better way to demonstrate.' 

She doesn't air her opposition to thecut, and instead just remains as vigilant as possible. With a single seal, chakra pumps from her stomach and rushes upward to her optics. The special chakra reacts to her cells, forcing veins to become apparently laterally. Her pupils also become much more defined, rather than being hardly visible as they usually were.

With the specialized doujutsu active, Mirai is more tha3n capable of viewing chakra and reading just how particularly they moved to heal the injury. Through this all, she murmured to herself, stripping apart the application step by step. "Yang Release. . ." the Hokuma hummed with energy. Clearly, she's pleased to see the technique in use firsthand. It was this that depicted the wonders of being a medical shinobi -- being capable of taking way pain and healing the injured.

"Sanoke has told me of this. . .Yang Release representsthe physical aspect of chakra. Meaning, it can best be used to manipulate physical attributes. . . As the body uses physcial energy for all functions, even healing, it's natural that applying Yang Release can give super healing. Of course, accurately pushing the particles of chakra to the cells is easier said than done. . " Mirai muses to herself as she mentally prepared and anaylzed the technique as it's being used. 

After some thought, it's her turn to actually give the jutsu a try. Without any time wasted, she too seeks to replicate the basic healing technique. A hand is held out, allowing for a medium to be available for the future application of spiritual energy. As a Hyuuga and practitioner of gentle fist, she's far from a stranger to releasing energy from the tenketsu in the area. 

With a brief inhale and exhale, chakra pumps out from her digits and wraps a thin layer around her flesh. It's like adding a secondary layer of energy, except the 'skin'glowed with a light blue illumination. Naturally, due to the inexperience, the aura pulsates irregularly, and occasionally flickers out, like a weak fire. Meanwhile, Mirai's thumb is bitten somewhat softy, enough to draw blow and form a cut, but not so strong that she'd actually be in pain. 

As the wound is in place, the would-be medic is moving to place her chakra cladded hand onto the sight of the wound. Gently, energy is flowed forward, with an emphasis being on Yang Release. In no time at all, the particleso f chakra floods onward, targeting the wound. Meanwhile, the layer of energy around the hand grows more unstable, before flickering off. 

"Gaah!" groaned Mirai in disappointment. She had failed miserably. 

Her optics fall back onto Erin's frame, wondering what to do next. "Is there a better way we can train? I don't want to keep cutting or biting myself."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) goes to make like an order. It'd take about fifteen minutes for her to return with some fresh fish! They were held in an aquarium-like building.

She has them carried within a bowl after purchase and sets it onto a table.

"Okay! Can you explain one more time?" Mirai asks with giant, hopeful eyes.* - Thu Nov 19 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) says: Uh.. you use your chakra to speed up cellular mitosis. - Thu Nov 19 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Mitosis? I know that word. . Go over the definition for me again? - Thu Nov 19 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) says: Division.. or something like that. - Thu Nov 19 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) murmurs the word to herself. Mitosis, cell division which was imperative for healing damage done to the body. That's what she had to effect in order to aid in the rapid replenishing of lost vitality.

Quickly, She'd take a single fish out and have it retrained along the table, with a platter underneath.

She takes a Kunai, her hands shaking due to partially nervous jitter. The pressure was on sure enough, as if she failed, the poor creature could suffer an unnecesary death. Mirai clearly was breathing a bit heavier than normal, but ignoring the butterflies in her tummy, the woman slashes, giving a superificial wound to the aquatic-based creature.

Blood was still apparent, and it flowed from the wound like molasses. Once the tool had been condition, both of the Hokuma's hands glow nicely with a layer of cyan energy. It's a dull illumination, but one nonetheless, and signifies that the woman is in prime condition to apply the healing. Unlike the last, her energy flow seems to be a lot more stable, and manage-able. In no time, the hand presses against the sight of the injury and releases it's Yang-based energy onto the fishes cells.

Pulsating sounds litter the room, and the chakra for a moment workssuccesfully, patching up the wounded cells and forcing accelerated growth or healing. But along the way, fifteen seconds in even, all goes awry. The chakra combusts, and without lagging, the fish grows limb, losing all of the life or activity it held before. Its body grows limp, signifying that the creature had died or fallen into a coma.

". .I. . " Mirai frowned greatly at the discovery, her Byakugan scanning the creature for any form of life. Clearly, it was still living, but the damage had been done. Disheartened, shed' take time to rest and recover both mentally and spiritually.

. . . Cue half an hour break.

Once revitalized, she tirelessly begins with her endeavor. For the next hour or so, the woman was a workhorse, tirelessly going from fish to fish and failing each time. Then came fish number ten. . . The chakra routinely fluxuates from the hand and guides itself to the wound. Mirai wore an expression or look that clearly detailed her devotion and motivation. Her features were scrunched together, brow fidgeting due to the aggitation.

Eureka! The healing was a success, much to her delight. Afterwards, she lays against the couch, breathing in and out! "Thank you for the help!"
