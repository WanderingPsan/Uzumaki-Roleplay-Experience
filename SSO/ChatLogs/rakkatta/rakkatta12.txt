<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: What are you aiming to do? - Fri Oct 23 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've arrived at the training grounds accompanied by Mizora and Koji. Once the two arrived at the location where they would be training she peered towards Koji assuming that he would he give them an exercise or some instruction since he was obviously the strongest member in the clan at the moment. Listening intently her ears would perk up as he spoke before she parted her lips to speak in a fragile tone responding to him comment. 

"I thought you might have had something in mind. Usually when I train I just shadow spar or work on mastering techniques that I've already mastered. If you have something else in mind I'll be willing to complete an exercise of some sort that you have." 

Mirai responded in a delicate tone gazing at Koji. Her gaze would occasionally shift between Koji and Mizora before she channeled chakra to her eyes acitvating her Byakugan causing viens to protrude her temples as she activated their clans Dojutsu. Once she activated her Dojutsu her gaze would shift to Mizora before she parted her lips to speak. "What do you suggest we do Mizora?" Mirai inquired wondering if the Hyuuga had any suggestions.* - Fri Oct 23 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: We should've did a mission. - Fri Oct 23 04:04:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Hmm, I'm not very good with time... Night time??? - Fri Oct 23 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sure. - Fri Oct 23 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Can you explain what it is? - Fri Oct 23 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've followed Koji outside of the gates of Sunagakure so the two of them could train together. Unfortunately, Mizora wasn't interested in training with them at the moment. Once the two arrived at their destination she would peer towards Koji as he explained what was required for her in order to learn the technique that he had recently learned. "It doesn't seem to be that difficult. I'm sure I could complete the exercise seeing as i'm quite skilled when it comes to our clans fighting style." Mirai muttered peering towards Koji ready to begin the training.* - Fri Oct 23 04:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Alright, well just follow me! It'll be fun. I fell from the top one time! - Fri Oct 23 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) looked towards Koji as he showed what was required of her. Subsequent to watching him for a few seconds Mirai accepted that it wouldn't be to difficult to perform seeing as she was an expert when it came to using her clan's fighting style and techniques. Sprinting off towards the Cactus Mirai would close the separation of herself and Koji. 

Gathering up chakra to her eyes she would actuate her Byakugan causing viens to protrude her temples and her vision to grow to enhance her reflexes and overall perception. With her Byakugan initiated the Hyuuga felt empowered and was prepared to exhibit her capacity and ability for Koji somebody who she admired. 

Directing chakra to her palms her hands would've been immersed in a blue emanation that was unmistakable to her and Koji and any individual who was in the area. When her palms were clad in chakra the Hyuuga would start to thrust her palms forward delivering a progression of palms in a steady progression. The force of which she conveyed the palms would increment rapidly so that she could coordinate the yield of Koji and issue out an even measure of exertion behind each of her attacks. 

Mirai's developments would've been fluid and elegant showing her ability and how knowledgeable she was when it came to performing her clan's fighting style. Luckily, She found herself able to contend with the strongest member of her clan which caused her to assume that she was quite strong.* - Fri Oct 23 05:08:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) fortunately was saved by Mizora otherwise things wouldn't have ended well for her seeing as she was seated upon the bench and wasn't quite prepared for Madelyn's assault. The already frustrated Hyuuga wasn't in the mood to have another pointless spat with her sister but seeing as Madelyn was charging towards her she had no choice but to entertain her younger sister. Rising up the Hyuuga would begin to spin an entire three hundread degree's creating a blue sphere condensed of entirely chakra. 

Mirai would repel Madelyn and more then likely Mizora if she didn't quickly evacuate the area. Once the girl was repeled Mirai would charge for Madelyn not even giving her a chance to react. With great haste the Hyuuga would've closed the distance between her and Madelyn. Reaching for her hair she would establish a firm grip on Madelyn's hair. With her free hand Mirai would repetedly slap Madelyn not even bothering to utilize their clans fighting style. With each slap the Hyuuga would utter a word clearly being taken out of character.

"Bitch. Didn't. I. Tell. You. To. Leave. Me. Alone." Mirai said repetedly slapping Madelyn with force but of course she was mindful that this was her twin sister.* - Fri Oct 23 23:16:54 2015

Her head would've controrted the instant Madelyn's face came in contact with her face. 

As blood spilled from her mouth the Hyuuga would've became infuriated with her sister and was no longer going to hold back.  Clenching her fist the Hyuuga would've now been punching Madelyn violently in her face with no remorse for the girl. Once she swung her right hand her left hand followed shortly behind. Mirai intended on beating on Madelyn into submission now and was going for blood. * - Fri Oct 23 23:33:58 2015
