<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would simply nod her head before she advanced forward before she stood directly next to Koji. Channeling chakra into her eyes, veins would protrude around her lavender shaded optics as she enacted her Byakugan. With her Byakugan active she would position herself into her usual stance, standing directly next to Koji. 

She listened intently as he began to explain the fundamentals and what would happen to an individual who was within the parameters of the Eight Trigram circle. Mirai was already familiar with it, however hearing it from Koji wouldn't hurt and would only expand her knowledge on it. After hearing Koji's words Mirai's hands would be imbued in chakra and a blue emanation would've appeared her hands.

 Once this was done the Hokuma would extend her hands forward delivering a series of strikes gracefully. Her movements were precise and fluid as she surged chakra through her palms as if she was actually in combat. Her  chakra could been seen radiating from her palms as she repeatedly struck the air shadow sparring. Parting her lips Mirai would speak in a fragile tone.

"About how many Tenketsu do I have to strike to kill someone?" Mirai inquired as she continued her training. * - Sat Nov 21 07:07:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've arrived at the training arena accompanied by the Taijutsu expert known as Paine. Mirai was always eager to sharpen her skills when it came to Taijutsu and she figured the best way of doing this was to constantly spar so that she could improve. 

She thought it was ideal to spar Paine because the woman was exceptionally skilled in Taijutsu and she wanted to fight the best to assess how skilled she was rather than fight someone significantly weaker than her. Channeling chakra to her optics Mirai would activate her Byakugan causing veins to sprout around her lavender shaded optics. 

With her Dojutsu activated her eyes lustered as the sunlight shined upon her optics. Following up with Paine's attack the Hokuma would duck dropping down only to extend her leg forward. Contorting her body swift the woman would perform the technique known as leaf whirlwind quickly contorting her body and performing a leg sweep to knock the woman off of her feet. Should she succeed Mirai would charge for taijutsu expert.* - Sun Nov 22 00:09:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) had anticipated Paine's landing and had assaulted to soon bringing about her endeavor to knock the woman off of her feet to be a failure. Mirai was disappointed in herself committing an error like that as though she was an amateur when she had been a practitioner of Taijustu for all intents and purposes her whole life. 

Regardless of her Byakugan being initiated she wasn't sufficiently spry enough to successfully dodge Paine and was struck by the woman. The blunt power of her strike caused the Hokuma to be knocked northwards far from Paine. She would lay in the dirt for a few seconds motionless before she would ascend to her feet once again.

Clearly frustrated Mirai would charge towards Paine heedlessly. Her hands would've been permeated in a blue hue as she manifested her chakra before she endeavored to surgically infuse it into Paine's body to assault her chakra pathway system directly. Once she was in close enough range Mirai would extend her hand forward endeavoring to land hits upon the Taijutsu expert. 

A blue light would enlighten the territory as she extends her palms planning to strike the woman in her abdominal area region. Paine's chakra system wasn't the only thing that Mirai wanted to strike. Using her broad knowledge on the human body Mirai aimed to strike the woman's pressure points to generally render certain body parts useless. In this case she aimed for her arms since they were essential when it came to utilizing Taijutsu.* - Sun Nov 22 00:51:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) grew quite bored of standing around within the village idly and thought that wandering off to the hot springs after a long spar would be an impeccable approach to unwind and would start up some fervor between her and Sanoke. Assuming that Sanoke swept her off of her feet and into his arms she would glance around the village as both of them ventured off to the local hot springs.

Due to not being very acquainted with it both of them invested an impressive measure of energy requesting directions. After a few minutes of searching and soliciting down directions the two of them at last came to their destination. As both of them entered the lobby, she would look around the building observing it a bit before Sanoke set her downward on the ground once they arrived at the clerk's desk. 

Mirai's breast would shake bobbing violently upon her midsection as if they wanted to be freed from the confinement of her clothing in an anime esque style the moment he set her upon the ground.  Peering towards the lady working behind the desk Mirai would contemplate for a bit before she separated her lips. 

"Hi me and my Fiance might want to utilize the Onsen. (Onsen was a Japanese term for hot springs in the japanese language that weren't segregated by sex.) Judging by the looks of this place of business it has a great deal to offer yet for the time being we want to enjoy each others company in the hot springs." Mirai said recommending that both of them simply get in the hot springs for the time being.* - Sun Nov 22 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered towards Sanoke as he forked over the money paying for the expense to use the hot spring. As the woman gave the directions to the unisex hot spring, she would venture down the hall alongside Sanoke. As they ventured towards the hot spring, she heard Sanoke mention something about their past wager. 

It appeared as though he couldn't recall that she was the victor of the bet. Despite her winning the bet she would permit him to assume that he had won. Separating her lips, she would talk in a delicate tone. "Sadly, you did win Sanoke." Mirai said, assuming this would just boost his already high ego. 

Before  the two of arrived at the hot springs they would've arrived at the fitting room. There was obviously a fitting room for men and women. Both fittings rooms would contain lockers so customers could put their garments and things inside of it and would be supplied with clean towels. 

Expecting that Sanoke would enter the mens fitting room and strip himself of all his attire and meet her at the hot springs she would enter the fitting room and strip herself of every piece of attire. It didn't take long for the Hokuma to uproot her clothing. Once she had done this she wrap a solitary towel around her voluptuous figure. The towel clung firmly around her figure extenuating her curves. Leaving the fitting room she would wait for Sanoke to arrive not having any desire to enter the hot springs without him.* - Sun Nov 22 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: (you owe me 51 dollars bye) - Sun Nov 22 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) didn't quite observe the scenery and take in everything that surrounding like Sanoke. She merely stepped into the fitting room, stripped and exited. She would stand there idly pondering on what was taking Sanoke so long to exit the fitting room. Unaware that he was creeping up behind her, she would've been startled by the turtle sage as he placed his hands upon her hips. Completely flustered and caught off guard her cheeks would be a tint of red before she turned around to face the turtle sage.

"That wasn't very nice." Mirai muttered peering towards Sanoke before she turned around to face the hot spring. She couldn't help but notice the steam that emitted from the water, meaning that it was hot which only made her want to enter it even more. Approaching the hot spring, she would place her feet inside a bit to check and see if the water was in fact warm. 

"It's warm Sanoke" Mirai stated before she allowed the towel to fall exposing her curvaceous frame. For a few seconds every inch of the Hokuma's body was displayed to the turtle sage from her ample breast, which squirmed around because of their buoyancy and her plump derriere. Without hesitation the Hokuma would extend a single foot into the hot spring before her entire body was soon submerged within the depths of the warm water. Submerging her lower body in the water, she released a groan as she soaked in the warm water.* - Sun Nov 22 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) didn't need to utilize her Byakugan to know that Sanoke was gazing at her voluptuous body as she entered the hot spring. With her lower body submerged within the water, she turned around to face the turtle peering towards him as he approached the pool of water and joined her. Once he was within the water the Hokuma would venture towards him. 

Her breast heaved up as she approached him. Her teats were erect as well and were exposed to the shinobi as the two of them were inside the hot springs. Despite being completely topless the Hokuma seemed comfortable and wasn't embarrassed that her breast were exposed. It appeared as though the Hokuma had become comfortable around her fiance and didn't mind being in nude. 

"Mhmm. Next time we need to have some sake, maybe." Mirai said, suggesting that the two of them purchase some sake the next time they decided to take a dip in the hot spring. Overall the woman seemed to be enjoying occasionally groaning in relieve as she soaked in the warm water.* - Sun Nov 22 06:01:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Why did you ask? - Sun Nov 22 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I dunno. I just rarely see you stop to have some 'me time.' - Sun Nov 22 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Should I have more me time? - Sun Nov 22 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeah. Well, by 'me time.' I meant, we should do things like this more often. - Sun Nov 22 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: We can spend more time together. - Sun Nov 22 06:35:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'm hardly busy. - Sun Nov 22 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered towards Sanoke gazing directly towards his hands as they arised and placed near her breast. She would simply nod her head.* - Sun Nov 22 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: S-Sanoke you don't have to ask m-me. - Sun Nov 22 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I actually like when you touch me and when you just take control.  - Sun Nov 22 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) quivers a bit at the thought of him taking control.* - Sun Nov 22 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered towards Sanoke as he cocked his head back in surprise.

 A single brow rose as she peered towards him as he chuckled a bit before he his hands found themselves upon her ample breasts. The Hokuma was flustered and by now her face was a bright red as the turtle sage held both of her breast within the palms of his hands.

 She glanced down towards him as he relentlessly contorted both of her breast in a various measure of different directions even pushing them together. Once he had released her breas she peered down towards her ample breast as his hands pressed against her nipples. As his fingers flicked across her nipples the Hokuma would release low groans clearly becoming quite aroused as her Fiance toyed with her breast. * - Sun Nov 22 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: San-Sanoke it feels good. - Sun Nov 22 07:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) cries of pleasure seemed to grow more intense and increase in volume as time passed by and as Sanoke grew more aggrsesive. The sexual tension was rising between the two and she could feel his member pressing against her pelvis stretching the fabric of his swimming trunks. The two of them were nearly only a few inches away from eachother which made him planting his lips upon her less inconvient. 

Noticing Sanoke motioning towards her she would close her eyes leaning in towards him as well as he planted his lips upon hers. Before she knew it the two of them were engaged in a deep passionate kiss. Her tongue would've slipped inside of his mouth as well. Coming in contact with his pink muscle she would swirl her tongue around inside of his mouth exchanging saliva with her fiance. Mirai's body would quiver as he toyed with her teats pinching them whilst the two of them made love with their mouths.* - Sun Nov 22 07:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) exchanged saliva with Sanoke as both of their tongues swirled violently against eachothers. She couldn't but notice that Sanoke was a bit more enthusiastic likely due to given into perverted nature. Mirai herself had given into her desires and had lost sense of all self control. Her hands would find themselves gliding down his musuclar frame as his hands found themselves upon her ass. After several seconds had passed Mirai would've been pinned against the outer layer of the hot springs. 

Once she had been pinned she would peer down towards Sanoke as his head dipped downward and he latched onto her teats with her lips. Feeling his lips wrapped around her sensitive teats nearly drove the Hokuma insane. Her lips parted as she released moans and her face contorted as she felt his member grinding against her snatch. The Hokuma was in complete utter bliss clearly enjoying this.* - Sun Nov 22 07:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) was moaning as Sanoke's tongue lashed out against her teats. Her breast would've jolted back and forth as his tongue lapped at her nipples. She moaned as Sanoke occasionally shifted between each breast providing attention to both of her breast. The sounds of her moans were extremely loud and echoed throughout the area. With Sanoke's hands around her hips the Hokuma was held into place and forced to remain where she was whilst he aligned his member up with her snatch. 

peering into his eyes as he lined his member up with her entrance Mirai would've merely rolled her eyes the minute he asked her to tell him if it hurted. He had made the whole the moment awkward with his words however the instant she felt his member thrusting inside of her she would've released a moan as he member slowly began to sink into the depths of her. Her hands would've found themselves around his neck as her vaginal walls gripped tightly around his member as he buried his member inside of her. Her nails would've been embedded in his back once the entirety of his member was buried inside of her.* - Sun Nov 22 08:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) moaned as his member had completely sank into her moist folds. Her walls would constrict tightly around his member once it was buried within her. Mirai's body would quiver. 

After several seconds had passed and she adjusted to his length being inside of her, she would feel his hips slowly rocket forward before he picked up his speed. Her body would shake violently and her breast would jolt back and forth with each thrust. She would've left multiple scratch marks along his back digging into flesh as his momentum picked up and caused ripples of water to form along the water.
