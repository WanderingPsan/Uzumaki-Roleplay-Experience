<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) yawns.

She forms a seal, activating her Byakugan. As her specialized doujutsu sprung to life, Mirai's gaze peered around the general vicinity. Naturally, she was completely and utterly aware of the entire surroundings. 

Each individual is taken note of. Her enhanced visage moves beyond the physical realm. It was so accurate that she could pin-point the very nature of any individual's metaphysical circuits. However, in addition to this, Mirai could also accurately view each of a person's appendages or internal organs.

She takes this time to test herself, looking around, examining and even naming much of the different body parts mentally. "Huh. . . I can see even further. . " the Hokuma muttered to herself. Naturally, she was looking towards the physical correspondent to tenketsu -- pressure points. Only a few could actually be called out accurately. Nevertheless, the woman continued this repeatily.

Her gaze shifted frm person to person, as the different body types provided variety for the budding medic. After all, it wasn't like everyone would be the same when performing surgeries. Why not get a feel for the difference now? After a few minutes, the Byakugan receded. She moves to plant her rear onto the sandy floors shortly after.* - Tue Nov 17 01:45:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) nods. She shuffles on off.* - Tue Nov 17 01:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) had again been studying once hassan had provided the mission. Prior to this, her eyes were glued onto a book about advanced anatomy. It gave the more obscure details, and more vivid explanations regarding the human body. Being a step above the previous basic medical book,  Mirai was obviously excited and eager to progress. Her lavender eyes soaked in the information, mostly in regards to the specialp ressure points that could lock physical movement. 

It dazzled her for some reason, as they remained all too similar to tenketsu or chakra points. In addition to this information, she uncovered knowledge in regards to the special bodily functions of certain organs, and thus was now more informed to aid in pathogens that perhaps assaulted these particular organs.

looked towards the scroll she had been given. It conveyed information in regards to a simple mission, to deliver wood. Perhaps this was a mis-use of the Hokuma's talents, yet nonetheless Mirai aimed to please. DIligently, she moved on off, scurrying to the designated area that the scroll had described.

Once there, it was clear what the mission entailed. And that was to simply transport some wood to a nearby, neighboring outpost. They were in desperate supply of wood for an assortment of tasks. Tasks such as burning wood for fuel, and of course building up trivial items needed for basic living. . . Tables and such. 

Despite the ease of the mission, Mirai still took the objective very seriously. By now, all of the vast wood had been piled up ontop of a cart. The cart was fitted with circular wheels to make transportation all the more easy. It was going to be a tiring task. For the next several dhours, she drags the cart along the desert before reaching the outpost. 

On view, the workers roar in triumphand move to collect all of the items. Each one rush ahead, and goes to place their wood on about for their own need. As they do this, the Hokuma takes a moment rest, her eyes again falling onto her medical booklet. After some moments, the curved woman shuffles off, reaching the village's gate again and prepares to earn her reward.* - Tue Nov 17 02:55:21 2015
