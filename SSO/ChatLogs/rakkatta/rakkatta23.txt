<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Which one? - Sun Nov 15 23:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: The Hair Binding. - Sun Nov 15 23:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) face would've been completely red as she blushed completely misunderstanding what Sanoke had requested of her.  Mirai would simply nod her head before she began to amass an abundant amount of chakra to her hair follicles, which allow her to manipulate her hair and utilize it to bind and even send her enemies hurtling through the air. 

Once she went through the process of kneading the chakra she mustered up to her hair. Her hair would lash out towards Sanoke constricting around his figure as if it were a living thing. Once Sanoke had been completely entangled within her gorgeous locks Mirai would approach the turtle sage. Leaning in towards the turtle sage Mirai would plant a kiss upon his lips before she sent him hurtling through the air with her hair. 

She would repeatedly toss him in the air clearly getting a rise out of this. It was evident that the Hokuma's ability to perform the technique had improved considerably since the last training session that the two of them had together. Eventually Mirai would stop her actions and Sanoke would be released from the confinement of her hair.* - Sun Nov 15 23:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered towards Sanoke as he spoke about how long it took him to master the technique he would be teaching her. Placing her hands before her she would form a single seal activating her Byakugan. * - Sun Nov 15 23:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) || With her Byakugan activated the Hyuuga was capable of seeing the way that Sanoke maneuvered chakra from his tummy and guided it along his chakra pathway. It was a simple process and the same as the previous technique that he had taught her a few weeks ago due to it being derived from this technique. 
Mirai definitely recognized the similarities between the sequence and had a better understanding on how to properly knead her chakra due to simply watching Sanoke's demonstration with her Byakugan active. Listening intently she would nod her head after he explained in depth what Yang Release was and how it not only allowed her to perform jutsu such as the one he was teaching but her allow her to complete necessary day to day tasks such as breathing. After Sanoke had explained the process in full detail she would respond to his comment. 

"I understand. Instead of kneading chakra into my hair follicles you want me to knead that chakra into my chakra pathway and then into my scalp to rapidly speed up the process of my hair growth." Mirai muttered explaining the process that she would have to follow in order to perform the technique. 

Despite knowing the process performing the technique was completely different and was more complex. Closing her eyes the Hokuma would heed Sanoke's instruction going through each individual step like he explained a few moments ago. 

The Hokuma would conjure up a bulk of chakra maneuvering said chakra from her tummy and guiding it along her chakra pathway allowing her chakra to stream through her entire body. Once she had done this she would begin to channel said chakra into her scalp effectively causing the growth of hair to increase significantly, thus speeding up her hair growth and forcing her hair to grow longer at that very instant.* - Mon Nov 16 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) seemed to be doing well in her endeavor to learn the new technique that Sanoke was showing her. Fortunately, she possessed a Dojutsu that allowed her to see the flow of chakra, which not only allowed her to see how Sanoke was kneading his chakra but it aided her an her attempt to learn and practice and the jutsu. With the help of her Dojutsu and being knowledgeable on Yang release it made the learning process convenient and less complex. Parting her lips, she responds to his comment about her being a fast learner.

"I'm not that great to be honest Sanoke. If it weren't for my Byakugan and your great teaching I'd be struggling to learn this technique. Also the fact that it seems to be similar to the technique you recently taught me helps as well." Mirai muttered complimenting Sanoke of his teaching which she assumed would boost his ego considerably. 

She watched him intently as he moved on to the next part of the jutsu. The jutsu was complex and had to broken down into individual steps so that Mirai wasn't overwhelmed with to much information. Watching Sanoke manipulate the speed of his hair growth and the density of his hair, her jaw dropped as she in complete awe. He had managed to make his hair more durable, making it ideal for combat. 

After his demonstration Mirai would back up a bit pressing her derriere against his pelvic area. Her cheeks would've become red in hue once more as her body was pressed firmly against his. After the demonstration she would follow suit shifting the chakra that she built up to her scalp into her hair cells. 

Causing each individual strand of her hair to press together, causing them to gain density, making them durable enough to cause an immense amount of hair to an enemy. Once she had effectively changed the density of and durability of hair, she would motion her hair forwards as if she was Medusa causing it to lash out against the nearby terrain. Her hair was durable enough to leave dents within the solid rocky terrain.* - Mon Nov 16 01:34:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) decided to take Paine up on her offer and have spar her student. Mirai had become quite bored standing around within the village doing absolutely nothing. She figured it would be ideal to hone her abilities through sparring Shinobi within the village and that having a spar couldn't hurt and would actually benefit her. Arriving at the arena within Sunagakure she would positioned herself away from Mana. 

Locking eyes with the Shinobi Mirai didn't hesitate to active her Byakugan as she prepared to engage in hand to hand combat with Mana. Veins would sprout upon the woman's temples the instant she activated her Dojutsu. With her Byakugan activated she was capable of seeing the women's chakra network, allowing her to freely make assaults on tenketsu. Mirai wasted no time sprinting off towards the Shinobi. 

Once she was in close enough proximity Mirai would enter her stance crouching a bit before she discharged a series of palm thrust. Her hands would've moved in a flurry as she attempted to strike the kunoichi.* - Mon Nov 16 04:20:16 2015

Despite being faster than the kunoichi she had managed to deflect the direction of her attack which saved her from being struck by the Kunoichi. This however didn't stop Mirai's pursuit and she still aimed to strike the girl. With her Byakugan active her vision was expanded considerably and catching her off guard wasn't likely. 

Seeing the woman's hand dart out towards her neck Mirai would extend her hand out towards Mana's wrist to change the trajectory of her strike to avoid being struck in the neck much like Mana had done a few moments prior. Seizing the opportunity to strike the girl Mirai would dashed towards her once more, this time releasing a series of palm of strikes aiming to cause internal injury to the girl. 

She moved fluidly and gracefully effortlessly displaying her ability to utilize her Dojutsu and accuracy when it came to striking the tenketsu. If her attempt to strike the girl would succeed, she would proceed to strike the girl in an attempt to overwhelm. As a student of Paine's it was something she adopted from the woman and she was vicious in combat, however, she did keep in mind that it was a spar so she held back a bit.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) had assumed that Mana was stronger than her or at least on the same level as her. Despite holding back, she seemed to dominate the fight so she assumed that this was just merely a form of training that Paine wanted her students to engage in. 

After striking several of her tenketsu and causing some internal injury to the redhead Mirai would utilize this time to strike the girl once more. Amassing a significant amount of chakra the Hokuma would knead that chakra into her hair follicles, which temporarily granted her the ability to manipulate her hair. With this new found ability Mirai would extend her hair considerably stretching its length. 

Her hair would lash out towards the Shinobi coiling around her figure. Should Mirai's attempt at binding the girl succeed, she would send the redhead hurtling through the air. Once she sent her opponent hurtling through the air the Hyuuga would leap in the air following up with her combo. Amidst being in the air Mirai would begin her assault once again effectively discharging a series of palm strikes towards Mana. Her hands would remain open with each individual palm thrust that she discharged towards the girl. Aiming towards her upper body, she aimed to cause damage to the girl once more whilst they were in the air.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) admist her striking the girl repetedly she would've noticed that she was coughing up blood. In an instant Mirai would've ceased her actions grabbing a hold of her girl before they landed on the surface once again. She was completely unaware of the girl's condition or that she had fought Paine prior to their spar. Once she landed on the surface again she would peer towards Paine before she parted her lips to speak to the woman. 

"I-I'm sorry I didn't know she was so fragile." Mirai muttered whilst Mana was still in her arms as she carried the girl bridal style.* - Mon Nov 16 05:37:04 2015
