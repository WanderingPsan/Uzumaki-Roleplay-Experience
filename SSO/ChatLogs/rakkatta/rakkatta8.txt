<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Where we had our spar? - Fri Oct 16 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Works. - Fri Oct 16 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've arrived at the area where she had defeated Sanoke in a spar. Unfortunately, he would never admit that she had defeated him despite him stating that they weren't allowed to utilize Ninjutsu but utilizing it after she overwhelmed in with her exceptional taijutsu. Peering towards Mizora she would part her lips talking in a delicate tone towards the only other female in her clan. 

"We don't talk much for some unknown reason. I don't see you often so lets make up for lost time. How have you been and how has your development with the technique been coming along I've managed to master the technique what about you?" Mirai asked speculating about how well the Kunoichi was advancing with the technique known as rotation. Being second in command she felt committed to know the prosperity of individuals from her clan and the individuals who lived in the village. Her lavender shaded optics were focused upon the Hyuuga as she talked it was obvious that she was interested about her inquiries.* - Fri Oct 16 03:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) luckily had mastered the technique that Mizora was novice in. Separating her lips, the Hyuuga would give some insight on the technique and guidance. "It's a really valuable technique that you ought to master quickly. Seeing as our clan specializes in Taijutsu, i'm assuming that you only know Taijutsu which can hinder us in combat against those who utilize Ninjutsu or long range attacks.This technique is intended to secure our clans blindspot." She said pausing for a bit before she looked towards Sanoke before she continued to clarify. 

"It's critical that you master it. It can likewise secure you against effective Ninjutsu that could end your life or cause severe damage. Like most techniques, you aren't going to master it in the event that you don't more than once practice it. I needed to rehearse the technique consistently until I could perform it at will without much inconvenience." Mirai clarified peering towards the kunoichi before she pointed towards her and started to twirl her finger around in a circular movement. 

"Spin and discharge chakra from each Tenkutsu in your body." Mirai muttered wanting Mizora to get some practice in. Seeing as Koji wasn't there to teach her and simply handed her a scroll she wanted to ensure that Mizora received some form of training from her. It would not only help her improve, but it provided an opportunity for them to bond.* - Fri Oct 16 04:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) (test)* - Fri Oct 16 04:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) initiated her Dojutsu causing veins to protrude her temples the moment she enacted her Byakugan. Mirai would've utilized her Dojutsu to check whether the kunoichi was, in fact, discharging chakra from each Tenketsu in her body something that she was capable of doing whilst her Byakugan was activated. Peering towards her she would watch Mizora take a stride a back before she pivoted on her heel and spun a whole 360 degrees.  

Abruptly Mizora's chakra would manifest and would become discernable as her body was completely enveloped and shielded by a sky-blue sphere made of chakra. Watching her spin quickly, Mirai would essentially observe until Mizora stopped leaving a crater in the earth. Observing Mizora as she came to a halt she noticed that the woman didn't seem exhausted and came to the conclusion that she wasn't depleted of her chakra implying that her chakra reserves were monstrous which permitted her to perform techniques that would deplete even the most capable shinobi. 

"That was a great exhibition of the technique. The main counsel I can give you is to continue performing the technique. The vast majority of our clans techniques oblige us to have great chakra control. Seeing as you haven't passed out at this point I'm assuming your chakra reserves are colossal which is an extraordinary thing and on the off chance that you enhance your chakra control you can make more utilization of your massive chakra reserves." Mirai murmured peering towards Mizora.* - Fri Oct 16 04:38:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) glanced towards Marrisa as the kunoichi waved towards her as she remained positioned on the ground. Mirai would wave in return as she approached the girl before she took on the ground next to her.

"I don't mind joining you however I have no interest in learning Genjutsu and, unfortunately, the only techniques I know are exclusive to my clan. " Mirai muttered peering towards the fan that Marrisa possessed. Her gaze was fixated upon on her Kyodai Sensu for a moment before she began to speak once again. "I see you have a Kyodai Sensu. I would've never guessed that you were skilled in Genjutsu. Are you capable of utilizing your weapon?"

Not to be ill-mannered or rude but my clan has practical experience in taijutsu and really need to use hand to hand combat to defeat our foes and we need to train diligently. I think she was simply vexed that she was just upset that she was defeated by a mere chant and not by something all the more intense.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) wastes no time. Once in the designated training area, she falls into a stance of her own -- one that was slowly becoming reknowned around the village considering how powerful the rest of the Hokuma were becoming. It was a basic stance, yet powerful in its own right. . .The Gentle Fist! "Are you ready? I'm going to hold back. But I douibt that you'll even deem my attacks 'slow'. . . I'm getting pretty good, after all," Mirai states with a sly grin. She was quite confident in her own ability, clearly enough.

One leg slides along the sand, leaving a trail or path within the grainy surface. Both hands are held with their palms facing the opponent, although the right palm was pulled back a tad, making the elbow arc. You might ask. . 'Why do this?' And it was simple. She had to keep an appendage close for defensive purposes, while the other was primarily going to be for offense. In addition to this, any trained taijutsu fighter would be capable of discerning why her legs were in the position they were now.

Meaning, arched, allowng a crouching-like state.

And that was to simply keep the muscles stricken or prepared to evacuate should the going get tough. "I'll let you make the first move. Unless you wish to remain on the offensive for the entire duration?"* - Fri Oct 16 17:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Anyone up for a spar? - Fri Oct 16 17:08:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Uhm you want to do it here or should we move? - Fri Oct 16 17:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) smirked. She takes a step forward, looking ahead as Bryson actually decided to take the initiative. "My. . . Is the Holy Ghost possessing you to do this?" Mirai asks with a stifled giggle. The second his hand is moving in, her bodyi s taking defensive action. She hardly even has to think, it was like her cells had a mind of their own. Just as the mit is coming in, the Hyuuga speeds around, and begins to move in a semi-circular fashion. 

Her eyes are more defined by now, and veins pop along her facial features -- as the byakugan commonly forced to happen. Now in the perfect state, chakra discharged about her form, mainly the hands. It possesses a beautiful, azure-colored tint or coloration. Yet despite the beauty and serene look, what Mirai sought to do was anything -but- peaceful. 

As her hands blur through the skies, they seek to make contact with Bryson's ribs. On impact, chakra flows from her dainty hands, and fly through the male's body, attacking the circulatory system, and thus his insides as a direct result. Of course, in most cases, she could strike with lethality. Yet this was a simple spar, a means to empower her own ability by building up the necessary muscle memory, and developing the fast twitch fibers in her arms. "Hyah!" roared the Hokuma -- playfully.

Would Bryson be able to take the attack?* - Fri Oct 16 17:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Your choice. - Fri Oct 16 17:23:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: In fact. . This place is crowded. Let's move to the outside. - Fri Oct 16 17:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Alrighty. - Fri Oct 16 17:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mirai. - Fri Oct 16 17:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You up to spar? - Fri Oct 16 17:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I believe you are far beyond my level. - Fri Oct 16 17:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Is Lord Kazekage awake? - Fri Oct 16 17:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yes. - Fri Oct 16 17:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) makes her approach, giving a bow.

"Evening."* - Fri Oct 16 17:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) ||Unfortunately, it seemed that Mirai couldn't quite find another suitable training partner. 

As boring as it may be, she relents, opting to training on her own. Independent training, while repetitive, could also do a shinobi good. It often was a great agent to see your own flaws, and to gain a form of style of taijutsu that you were comfortable with employing in actual, conventional battle. 

Once in a secluded area, she resumed the formation that she had entered while battling that simple priest. Chakra funnels along her body, moving along the stream or 'chakra highway' that wash er circulatory system. Upon working on the tenketsu near the eyes -- which was easy, given her clan's natural ability to use a multitude of chakra nodes -- her doujutsu at last is activated. It spawns the almighty, or 'All-Seeing' Byakugan. 

From here, the pupil, which was normally a faint lavander, grows more apparently, gaining a thicker and more saturated pigmentation. Each muscle in the eye was now super powered, and the strength is only further emphasized by the unsettling veins that spawned on the side of her face -- near the eyes. In this state, Mirai's vision was absolute.She could casaully see from every conceiveable angle. In addition, if focused, her vision could see into extremely far distances.

Lastly, she was enable to view chakra, accurately at that. 

Taking advantage of this, the young Hyuuga is finally in her battle stance, prepared to begin with the shadow sparring. A profound imagery of a false opponent is taken. One that seemed apt on taking Mirai's eyes for his own. Immediately, her body breaks off into fast-twitched evasions, each one taking minimal movement to conserve stamina. As the figure continued to strike,  Mirai kept her movements consistent, while sending out gentle-fist spawned jabs here and there.

Her frame continues with the sequence, building up the necessary muscle memory to be capable of doing this in actual battle. Seconds creep up, becoming minutes. And in the end, Mirai would have kept up the training exercise for up to an hour. Exhausted, she drags herself back on over to the square, hopefully with Koji in tow.* - Fri Oct 16 19:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Koji-san. You should help me with my training. - Fri Oct 16 19:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Lets go. - Fri Oct 16 19:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) smiles. Finally, there was someone at near her level of skill to battle against.

Wht made it more special was that this was in fact her esteemed clan leader -- For now. Mirai eventually sought to ascend to his level of skill, and perhaps be a candidate to be new clan head. Wasting no time, she descends into a crouch, allowing chakra to flow towards her eyes, and force the Byakugan to take flight.

Now in this state, the young Hokuma crouches, and enters the Gentle Fist stance. As usual, the palms are held upward, facing Koji. One is held to the forefront, while the other is being held back, to serve as a perfect balance of offense to defense. "I will allow you to make the first move."* - Fri Oct 16 19:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) kept her ground, even as Koji exercised impressive speeds to close the distance beween the two. 

Perhaps, just as Koji had anticipated, her chakra begins to pump from her body, the strength being enough to work in direct opposition of the Hokuma's. As the two chakra pulsates against one another, Mirai takes initiative, allowing her own form to begin with it's own revolution. Speedily, her body is rottating in direct opposition.

In conjunction with her flow of chakra, this gives life to an impenetrable sphere -- Eight Trigrams, Heavenly Rotation! Hastily, the girl's form is completing different revolutions, each one serving to repel and rid her world of any lethal; attacks. Sadly, Koji had also sought to use this defensive technique. Thus, they were both forced to clash, the momentum spawning sparks or residual chakra to flow from their forms.

In time, they're both pushed away, with Mirai being sent a good five meters towards the east. ". . .! Strong!" Just barely, she's capable of avoiding being tossed onto the ground, her body still a tad bit dizzy. As per usual, she waits for her opponetn to come to her. After all, the besto ffense was a perfect defensive.* - Fri Oct 16 20:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) nodded obediently.

Koji -- despite being several years her senior -- was exceptionally wise, and knew much more about these strange skills than she did. "So I can use it for offense too. .  Noted. Although, my chakra reserves aren't too strong. I understand, however- -" He wastes no time, and resumes with her changing endeavors.

The second she's able to close the distance, a swift hand slashes through the skies, coated in thick chakra. Her eyes are just as fierce as the one Koji wore -- perhaps even moreso.

The second Mirai is even within distance, a swift right hander is being dished through the skies, with enough strength and speed to be nothing short of a blur to the naked eye. It aims to press against against the clan leader's stomach, and discharge a mass of chakra shortly after to attack the circulatory system within, and to go further and attack the internal body. ". . .! Even with the Rotation being a plausible offensive option,. . . There's nothing better than being able to use the gentle fist!" the woman declares a snicker, hopefully it had worked.* - Fri Oct 16 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) ||Quickly, she's move ahead, watching closely as Koji's flow of chakra flared, striking her form just as quickly as her's had struck his.

They were attacking in unison, it seemed now more than concentrated, and fast pced fashion. In no time at all, the duo manage to shut off an assortment of tenketsu, making the flow of chakra a bit less potent, and  slowing the typical movement.

"--- Gah. So strong, even when you're just a kid," Mirai remarks, dishing out another strike to the male's shoulder. As the blow goes through, the Hokuma is backing up swiftly, as she didn 't want to feel the unpleasant sting of being gentle fist'd again. ASsuming success, the woman takes steps backwards, still hiding her pain with a smug grin.

"I'll just keep playing a game of cat and mouse. When he comes, I try to attack, then get the hell out of the way at the same time."* - Fri Oct 16 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) ||Some how, some way. . She had managed to make it throguh the Heavenly Rotation. That was a nice, considering the technique was often irritating to deal with, especially when used offensively.

She slides nevertheless, and takes just a moment to regain her composure. "Thanks. . .I've been working hard. After all, someday it may just be me leading the clan in your stead," Mirai remarks, feeling high and mighty. "--" She can't finish her next statement, as Koji is making his approach, and moving at a fast pace as that. QUickly, her body leaps up, performing a kick while in the middle of the air.

But. . Taking cues from her spinning technique -- Heavenly Revolving Rotation -- Her body casually does various revolutions. Two kicks seamlessly are produced, with the intent on striking the male on the torso, and hopefully discourage the level of aggressiveness he had shown prior. "Geez. . .Let me finish my chatting before you attack next time!" The tone lacks any seriousness, of course.* - Fri Oct 16 22:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Hmm, Mizora is in the distance... - Fri Oct 16 22:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) ||The attacks are easily repelled, prompting Mirai to move back in recoil. Immediately, she's regaining balance andentering the form required to properly execute the gentle fist, and remain true to the stance's principles. The right hand rises again, coating itself in chakra, and preparing to be launched forward. But just as it's about to, Koji speaks, referencing Mizora. Odd how the two had similar names. 

"--Huh? Yeah. I can feel her too."* - Fri Oct 16 22:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) was sent onto the floor. "Umph! Distracted me. . And eh. Your choice."* - Fri Oct 16 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Ramen . . .  - Fri Oct 16 22:52:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: More for me, then. My body requires a lot to keep its pace. - Fri Oct 16 22:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Sanoke, you made it that's good. - Fri Oct 16 22:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sure. - Fri Oct 16 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm? - Fri Oct 16 22:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) squandered no time and initiated her Dojutsu causing viens distend her temples the moment she enacted her Byakugan. With her Byakugan initiated her vision developed significantly expanding her vision enormously permitting her to see a various measure of things around her. With her Byakugan initiated she was prepared to spar Koji using their clans Taijutsu style. Prepared to fight her Lavender shaded optics would've been focused upon Koji now as he voyaged towards her as he sought to engage with her in hand to hand combat an area that she was skilled at. 

Luckily the Hyuuga was prepared for the assault and saw it coming since she conceded that she was ready to proceed with her training with him. Acting off impulse she would've hunched down entering the necessary position to perform her families fighting style. In an instant, her hands would've become claded with chakra. Her chakra would've become noticeable completely enveloped in a blue quality that appeared to manifest exhibiting her mastery over the fighting style known as Gentle fist. 

Aiming towards his wrist Mirai endeavored to divert the direction of his assault before she dispatched in a strike of her own. If she somehow happened to succeed she would move rapidly releasing a progression of palm thrust towards Koji in a brisk progression towards his Abdominal area. She moved quickly and her chakra covered palms were detectable as she moved gracefully and fluidly. Koji would unquestionably see that she had enhanced altogether in every aspect of combat from the first occasion when they fought together.* - Fri Oct 16 23:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) intended to propel forward and push Koji back and overpower with him a progression of palm thrusts. The chances of this happening were slim to none particularly since he was more experienced than her when it came to performing their families fighting style however this didn't dissuade the Hyuuga and her determination to win this spar did not waver. Venturing forward she would release a whirlwind of strikes and her chakra lit up the area the blue aura was visible as it immersed her hands. 

Tragically her endeavor to divert the course of his assault fizzled and she endured a huge measure of torment being struck in the arm which not just caused pain upon on her it brought on her arm to become numb which thwarted the advancement of her strikes. Regardless of being struck in the region that Koji had intended to strike her she was sufficiently lucky to land a hit upon him which would bring about internal damage upon him. With her Byakugan active her observation was enhanced extraordinarily and she was fit for staying aware of his developments however she wasn't fit for dodging all of his strikes. She would soon be struck by a capable high kick which pushed her back a bit and brought on a compelling measure of pain on her. 

Because of her not being as durable as most shinobi it dispensed a gigantic measure of agony on her, however, she didn't stop her progressions on Koji. It just prodded the Hyuuga on and, therefore, made her continue with her endeavor to overpower him. Continuing she would nimbly convey numerous palm strikes towards his arms endeavoring to disrupt his chakra flow and cause internal damage to him. The blue hue that encompassed her palms remained around her palms and her gaze was focused upon her kin as she tried to strike him.* - Sat Oct 17 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) kept on progressing towards Koji as she endeavored to convey an excruciating attack upon him. Sadly he would use a technique that was made to repulse and protect individuals from her clan from attacks. Peering towards Koji as he spun a whole 360 degrees she would grit her teeth as of now being mindful of the technique he was amidst performing. 

Her palm was still claded in chakra and the minute she meant to strike him she would've been repulsed a great distance as the Hyuuga's chakra manifested in the form of a sphere as he spun quickly. Ascending to her feet she would've been struck in both arms which basically implied the battle was over. 
Losing inspiration the Hyuuga would just surrender for the time being becoming drained and getting to be disappointed of being struck different times by Koji. In spite of being baffled she kept her self-control not permitting her dissatisfaction to appear in her body langauage or how she acted. 

Peering towards him she would wipe the dirt off of her garments before she walked around towards Sanoke side. "That was fun we must do it again at some point. I have to improve on a few things. I believe I'm improving, however, I don't see a signficant contrast in my capacities." Mirai said talking in regards to her battling aptitudes and general battle capacity. She would gaze towards Koji's feet taking a notice of the crater that had been created within the earth once he stopped spinning. The veins that protruded her temples would diminish once she deactivated her Byakugan.* - Sat Oct 17 00:44:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) remained beside Sanoke as she waited for him to show the technique he had obtained. She was mindful that he liked to brag and as his woman she would permit him to gloat and exhibit his new technique. Peering towards him she would gaze at him as chakra channeled  to his eyes  provoking another one of the Rinnegan's abilities to be used. She observed eagerly as he motioned his right hand forward before a long, dark, durable item rose through the palm of his hand. 

She squinted at the article ignorant of what it was or what it was used for however with her Byakugan enacted she was mindful that the item was chakra conductive and worked in conjunction with Sanoke's chakra. Separating her lips, she would talk in a delicate tone. "Like what? It looks like some odd gadget I've never seen. " Mirai asked pondering what the item was used for and what Sanoke was equipped for doing with it. Seeing Mizora had arrived she would wave at the Hyuuga greeting her before she redirected her consideration back towards Sanoke. It was apparent that she fascinated by this item particularly since she was mindful that it was chakra conductive. Living in Sunagakure she had never seen a gadget like it hence making her more intersted and entranced. 

"It's amazing love" Mirai muttered feeding his already enormous ego.* - Sat Oct 17 01:33:00 2015
