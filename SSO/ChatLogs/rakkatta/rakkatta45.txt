<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Activate your Byakugan. - Sat Dec 12 14:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) || As the conversation ensued things would've shortly became more intense as the Hokuma requested for her son to activate his Byakugan something that he recently managed to activate. Peering towards him intently she watched him as he kneading my chakra towards his eyes activating his clan's dojutsu. 

She watched as veins sprouted around his temples. Being a wielder of the Byakugan the Hokuma would've assumed that his vision would've expanded significantly upon activating his Dojutsu. Placing her hands in front of her, she would contort her digits forming a single hand seal. The instant the hand seal was formed veins would begin to protrude around the woman's temples as well. 

Peering towards her child she would approach her before she began to speak to him. "As I informed you earlier our clan inherits the Byakugan. With your dojutsu active it grants you nearly  a  360º field. Not only does it expand your vision, but it allows you to see the chakra network as I stated yesterday. Members of our clan take advantage of this ability and utilize our fighting style known as the gentle fist. The fighting style is compromised of swift palm strikes towards the tenketsu in the body. Due to your Byakugan you will be able to see them and infuse chakra into their body to cause internal damage to them. No matter how durable, they may be they will not be able to withstand your strikes because our attacks affect the inside of our enemies. This fighting style alone has made our clan considered one of the most powerful. Our clan is said to be the strongest clan in Konoha. I assume it's because of this fighting style my child."

Mirai stated peering towards Taku hoping that he was taking in all of this information before the two began to actually practice. He needed to know the fundamentals behind the fighting style if he was going to be proficient with utilizing it.* - Sat Dec 12 15:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) || This moment was truly something that Mirai would never forget. It seemed as though her twins were just born yesterday and her she was teaching her son about their history and how to utilize his Byakugan. She was grateful that she got to share this moment him and looked forward to all the things that she was going to teach him and Manami in the near future. 

A single brow rose as her child spoke and began to speak about internal injury. He was intelligent and understood that internal injury wasn't a good thing. This reminded the woman of something and she parted her lips speaking to her child. 
"Internal injury isn't good. It can cause an enormous amount of harm  to someone that's why you must be mindful when you're using our clans fighting style. You have the ability to stop disrupt the flow of someone's chakra. If you close off a numerous amount of their tenketsu they can die. Our fighting style is quite lethal in nature. So be mindful if you learn this style and spar someone that you can potentially kill them if you strike them too many times. Personally, I'd say if you close of 64 of their tenketsu that should be enough to render them immobile without killing him. Anything over is extremely dangerous Taku. Only attempt to become lethal with those who intend to harm you and your sister." Mirai stated peering towards her son before she crouched down a bit placing a palm in front of her as she entered her usual stance.

This was the stance the woman positioned her in before she began to utilize her clans fighting style. She wanted her son to hone his ability and be just a proficient as her. Parting her lips, she would speak again proceeding to educate her son. "This is the stance that I usually take before I perform the fighting style. I want you to try to form a stance. Yours doesn't have to be like mine, but you should be comfortable while you're in your stance. " Mirai stated peering towards her son waiting for him to take his stance.* - Sat Dec 12 15:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) Peered towards taku as stood next to her. Watching him as he stood in close enough proximity to her the Hokuma would've watched her son attempt to mimic her stance. Unfortunately, her stance didn't seem as comfortable to him as it was to her.

 After several minutes of tweaking her stance he would've been positioned in a stance that he found comfortable. A smile would've been plastered upon the beautiful Hokuma's face. It was evident that the woman took an interest in her son's training and was quite intrigued. Parting her lips the woman would speak. 
"Once you enter your stance you'll strike your opponent. You must learn to utilize your Byakugan to strike the tenketsu with PINPOINT accuracy. Your movements must be swift and fluid as long as you can land a hit that's all that matters. " Mirai stated before she extend her right arm forward performing a simple palm thrust. 

The woman would shortly follow up with her left arm performing a palm thrust as well, hoping that her son would mimic her actions just to get an idea of the fighting style before she tested how accurate he was with striking the tenketsu.* - Sat Dec 12 16:31:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) || Listening to her daughter, request training the Hokuma felt obligated to teach her daughter Manami the fighting style known as gentle fist. The woman had spent most of her day teaching her son Taku how to utilize her Byakugan and taught him a bit of history about their clan. 

Arriving at their home the woman would've closed the door behind her locking it before she set her sights upon both of her children. Her gaze occasionally shifted from Miaka and Manami gazing towards both of them with her lavender shaded optics. She had originally intended on training Manami but she assumed it would be best to teach Maika as well since she was present and was the only one of her children who hadn't activated her Byakugan. 

Parting her lips the woman would speak in a fragile tone. "Manami, I'm going to teach you, gentle fist, however, let's get your sister caught up so I can teach both of you at the same time. It would be convenient if I taught the both of you girls while you're both present. She hasn't activated her Byakugan however, once she activates it, I'll teach you both gentlefist like I did with your brother earlier." Mirai stated peering towards her children before she proceeded with instructing her baby girl on how to activate her Dojutsu. 

"Miaka, I want you to muster up chakra within your body and channel it to your eyes. If you solely knead chakra towards your eyes you should activate your Byakugan. I'm going to warn you though once you make your vision will expand considerably so things might be weird for a moment until you grow accustomed to seeing with your Byakugan." Mirai stated peering towards Miaka. The woman would've kneaded chakra to her eyes, causing veins to sprout near temple demonstrating for the child.* - Sat Dec 12 23:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: If you can help your sister Manami. - Sat Dec 12 23:07:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Manami(JustTheTip) says: Thop baby Aki. You have to learn what chakra is first..Momma teach her chakra! - Sat Dec 12 23:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered towards her Maika watching her attempt to perform the technique. She had assumed that the Hokuma knew what chakra was, however, she soon realized that her daughter might have needed to know the fundamentals before she attempted to activate her Dojutsu. 

After watching her daughter endeavor to activate her Byakugan and fail Miria would've spoken afterwards. "I'm sorry dear, I forgot to inform you what chakra. I'm sorry for assuming you knew what it was. Chakra is the energy that is utilized by Shinobi to perform techniques that would be otherwise impossible. I'm quite sure you've seen Shinobi around the village shooting massive fireballs from their lips or you've seen me or your dad do something you would consider to be cool. We are able to perform these amazing techniques through chakra. Chakra is the source of our power. Genetically I'd say you  naturally have a great chakra reservoir." 

Mirai stated peering towards Maika as she explained to her depth what chakra was. The woman felt obligated to educate her child on whatever was required for her to activate her Dojutsu. After pausing for a moment she would've began to speak to Maika once again. 

"Now that you know what chakra is I want you to attempt to amass your chakra before you try to channel that chakra solely to your eyes. Close your eyes and attempt to muster up every ounce of chakra in your body. Remain focused." Mirai stated  taking on the role as her children's Sensei.* - Sat Dec 12 23:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) was peering towards Maika after she had explained what chakra was. A few seconds after her explanation was given to Maika she watched the child intently as she began to pour her chakra into a certain a area that area happened to be her eyes. 

The Hokuma's jaw dropped as veins began to protrude her daughters temples as she activated her Byakugan for the first time. Mirai was extremely proud of her youngest daughter Miaka as she was with all of her children due to all of them effectively activating their Dojutsu. Clapping her hands together the woman would applaud the child on her success to activate her Byakugan. 
Parting her lips the woman would speak. "Wow! I'm extremely happy that all of you managed to activate your Byakugan without any inconvenience. Activating your Dojutsu is special in our clan because without it you can't perform the other techniques. Maika since you just activated your Byakugan I'm sure things will be a bit strange for you. The Byakugan is an inherited Dojutsu that members of our clan possess. It grants the user nearly a 360 degree vision except for the blind spot located at the back of the neck. Also, if you're wondering what the pool thing is circulating throughout my body it's my chakra network. " 

Mirai stated to her daughter, hoping that she and Manami retained this important information. She would gesture her hands beckoning for Manami to come closer.* - Sat Dec 12 23:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: At five. - Sun Dec 13 00:04:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Not really. - Sun Dec 13 00:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) || The sounds of the Hokuma speaking resonated throughout the home as the woman was in the process of teaching her daughters a few things. Seeing her daughter activate her Byakugan the woman could now proceed to the next lesson the one which Manami seemed to be really interested in. Once the girl was in close enough proximity the woman would begin to speak. 

"Now that you've activated your Byakugan and both of you are capable of seeing the chakra network I can teach you both the fighting style that made our clan renown as the most powerful clan in Konohagakure. The fighting style is called gentle fist, however, it is anything but gentle. The fighting style is comprised of quick palm strikes towards the enemies tenketsu. Once you strike, then you'll surge chakra into their chakra network to attack them from the inside causing internal damage. Since we attack from the inside it doesn't matter how durable your opponent may be as long as you land a blow you are bound to cause damage girls. Our fighting style can be quite lethal so I want you girls to be mindful of what you are doing during spars however, if someone attacks you and intends to harm you feel free to show no mercy. Once you strike a chakra point you can close it temporarily and disrupt the flow of their chakra. Should you strike more than I'd say 128 it is likely that the individual you are fighting will die. Striking 68 chakra points is enough to immobilize your opponent. Do you understand?" 

Mirai inquired peering towards them as she informed them on the fighting style that she was going to be teaching them. She recalled the time where she brutally hurt someone during a spar when she was a child due to not being informed about her abilities. She didn't want this to happen with her daughters so she assumed that it would be best to inform them to be mindful when using this fighting style.* - Sun Dec 13 00:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) gaze occasionally shifted between Manami and Maika who continuously screamed the word chakra. The Hokuma would've snickered as the child repeatedly screamed the word chakra before she focused upon teaching Manami. 

"Now that you understand the dangers of performing this fighting style on an individual we can actually begin learning." The Hokuma said, pausing for a moment before she crouched a bit contorting her body to a comfortable position entering her stance. "This is the stance that I usually enter before I begin my assault. You should try to find a stance that is suitable to you. You can try to mimic mine and adjust your body a bit if you're not as comfortable in my stance as I am. " 

Mirai stated before she began to jut her palms forwards repeatedly hoping that her daughter would mimic her movements. The woman was enjoying the time that they were spending together not only was she teaching her daughter, but the two of them were bonding. 

"Once you strike the area infuse your chakra into them. It's an ability that members of our clan possess. You must be fluid and swift and strike the chakra point with precise accuracy." Mirai stated. 

Her hands would've even engulfed in chakra a blue emanation would've shrouded her palms. Assuming that Manami was mimicking her movements Sanoke would likely see the two of them shadow sparring jutting their palms forwards simultaneously. The two of them would've looked like twins since Manami was a spitting image of her.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Right. - Sun Dec 13 11:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Hi, Nubi. - Sun Dec 13 11:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've gazed around the home of Claudette noticing how odd it was. She found it creepy, however, she wasn't one to judge and assumed that Claudette had decorated her home herself. The woman would've waited patiently waiting for the woman to return back upstairs. 

The woman could hear the medical Shinobi rummaging through something downstairs as she stood there idly. Her gaze would've soon diverted back towards Claudette as she had returned with a bag that seemed to be covered in crimson red blood. Mirai squinted a bit as the woman set up the table unfolding it and placing the body upon the table. 

"Well, she is a medic, maybe she uses it to train." Mirai pondered to herself, wondering if it was weird for the woman to have corpses lingering around her home. After several moments of pondering on it the woman would've assumed that it was fine and she was using them for her studies. Parting her lips, she would speak. 

" That would be correct. I know the technique that is considered c rank. Took quite a while to master. That's all I know at the moment regarding medical ninjutsu. My profession is Taijutsu  I'm trying to expand my knowledge in this field." Mirai stated in a delicate tone her lavender optics were fixated upon Zenaki. Should Nubi proceed to smell her the bat would find that woman smelled like vanilla it was the scent of the fragrance she was wearing.* - Sun Dec 13 12:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered over towards Zenaki as the woman begin to speak once more. Listening intently to the woman, the woman would've spoke once she finished her statement. 

"Sounds like a rather useful Jutsu. I'm already capable of chakra transfer so there is no need for me to learn that. However, I'm more interested in learning chakra scalpel since it is a more advanced Jutsu. I'd rather knock that out and work on the d-rank Jutsu afterwards since it will be more tedious and complex to learn then Gantai no Jutsu. The sound of nubi's wings fluttering would've filled the ears of the Hokuma as she watched the bat fly over toward Zanaki only to land on her head.* - Sun Dec 13 12:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Well, it's a pretty easy technique. - Sun Dec 13 12:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Can't she just get both? - Sun Dec 13 12:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: She can. - Sun Dec 13 12:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Why the hell do you think why I asked her here? She can do and learn both. - Sun Dec 13 12:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh. - Sun Dec 13 12:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) glanced towards Zenaki as the woman bursted out in laughter. The woman found Gantai no Jutsu useful, however, she was eager to learn chakra scalpel because she was trying to experiment and create a technique of her own that could've possibly been utilized with the technique. 

Peering towards the woman as she spoke, she would've listened intently retaining the information the experienced medic has given her. Parting her lips the woman would speak. " I suppose you're right, it is pretty useful. It's best that I learn both whilst I'm here. Besides, it's best that I learn, especially now that I have children." Mirai thought to herself pondering how useful this could be in most situations. 

After listening to Zenaki's full in depth explanation of the technique the Hokuma would've attempted to perform the technique. She was a bit apprehensive though due to not being as experienced in medical Ninjutsu as she was in Taijutsu. Removing a single kunai from her back pouch she would've decided that this would be her object. 

Recalling the hand seals that Claudette had just executed the woman would place her hands together and begin to contort her digits swiftly weaving the obliged hand seals. Amassing her chakra the woman would soon begin to transfer her chakra into the object. Having mastered the technique this was an easy feat for the Hokuma. 

After she transferred her chakra into the object she would've peered at it waiting for it to take on the form of a bandage. After several seconds of waiting for it take on the form a bandage the woman would've remembered the she forgot the following step. "Sorry I forgot the following step." Mirai muttered before she swiftly performed the hand seals and transferred her chakra into the kunai once again. 

This time, however the woman would've poured her chakra into the object molding her chakra together with the kunai bending it in place. This resulted in the kunai taking on the form a bandage.* - Sun Dec 13 12:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: See. Wasn't that difficult.  - Sun Dec 13 12:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I suppose you're right. - Sun Dec 13 12:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Now come here. - Sun Dec 13 12:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) would've approached the red haired woman.* - Sun Dec 13 12:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) || Before Zenaki would've even began to explain the technique to her, the woman would've activated her Byakugan causing veins to protrude her temples. With her Byakugan active the woman would've been capable of seeing incisions being made inside of the body. 

Mirai would've listened carefully as the woman explained what the technique was used for and how it required her to have exceptional chakra control. Fortunately the woman was quite skilled with manipulating her chakra and had great control of her chakra. 

Peering towards the body as Zenaki would've severed a muscle on the inside of the body Mirai would've been in awe. The woman was fascinated and eager to learn this technique because, like her clans fighting style the technique could cause internal damage to someone should they use it for that purpose. 

Parting her lips the woman would speak. "No need for me to open it up I can see that you severed the muscle with my eyes. It's quite interesting and a useful technique." Mirai stated peering towards the severed muscle that Zenaki had cut with great precision.* - Sun Dec 13 13:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) || After listening to the experienced medical Shinobi's explanation on chakra scalpel the woman was sure that she was capable of performing the technique. This was a Jutsu the woman had been eager to learn due to the simple fact of how it operated on making internal incisions to individuals. 

It reminded of her of the gentle fist style and the woman wanted to make a few tweaks to her fighting style whilst incorporating the technique. The woman usually doubted her abilities, however, she was a bit confident and was certain that she could learn this technique. Amassing chakra the woman would allow her chakra to course through her chakra system.

As her chakra was evenly distributed throughout her body. As her chakra coursed through her voluptuous the body the woman would've clasped her hands together, weaving through a progression of hand seals. Her digits contorted rapidly as she formed each individual seal. Once she formed the final hand seal she would mold her chakra kneading her chakra to the desired location which happened to be her right hand. 

As woman solely channeled chakra to her right hand, she would shape the form of her chakra manipulating the shape of her chakra so that it was reminiscent of a scalpel. Abruptly her entirely palm would've been engulfed in chakra a blue aura would've coated her hand as her chakra was redefined and shaped into a form of a blue. A blue hue would've radiated from her right hand as she performed the technique. 

Peering down towards the body with her Byakugan the woman was capable of seeing muscles, organs, and tendons within the corpse. Extending her right hand forwards the woman would've swiftly made an incision on the corpse of the young boy known as Suitengu a child who possessed the same eyes as her husband. 

Severing a tendon the woman would've peered towards Zenaki waiting for further instruction or feedback from the more experienced medic.* - Sun Dec 13 13:29:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) || Right on cue Chikyu had arrived at her home. Seeing as Miaka was awake and active she didn't want to leave the house and requested that Chikyu come over to teach her the rather simple technique. At her behest the swords woman had arrived at the domain of the turtle sage and the Hokuma. 

Peering towards Miaka for a moment the woman would've uttered something from her lips. "No date Miaka. You can go on a date with me daddy and your brother and siblings. " Mirai stated before she diverted her attention back towards Chikyu. Glancing down towards her legs, she would've watched the woman position her legs taking a note of where each leg was positioned. 

After the explanation and demonstration Mirai would've realized that she had been doing this practically all her life. The Hokuma's arms would've rotated her arms as if she was attempting to change the trajectory of someone's attack.* - Sun Dec 13 14:49:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) peered towards Chikyu as the woman prepared herself to strike the Hokuma. The woman assumed it would be in her best interest to practice the technique she and practiced a few moments ago. As the woman jutted her arms forward aiming to punch her the woman would've utilized her swift reflexes extending her arm forward aiming to strike the woman's wrist to change the trajectory of her attack. Naturally the Hokuma would've done this with ease due to Chikyu holding back a bit. It was just practice after all.* - Sun Dec 13 14:59:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) Naturally the Hokuma would've changed the trajectory of the attack of the swords woman. This was an easy feat for the Hokuma due to the woman holding back. The technique seemed simple enough for Mirai to grasp and she seemed to have grasped it quickly. The Taijutsu practitioner would've peered towards Chikyu as she distanced herself a bit before the two were going to have another go at practicing the technique. Nodding her head the Hokuma would give Chikyu the okay and the instant she extended her leg into the air the would've quickly extended her arm forward redirecting the attack of the swords woman once again.* - Sun Dec 13 15:13:52 2015
