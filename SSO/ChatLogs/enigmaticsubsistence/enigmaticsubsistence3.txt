That being said, any stories he had heard about Kenshin were simply inadequate in describing the man. When the curled fist connected with Yan, it was as though he was hit by a freight train. The last thing he knew, he was just diverting his gaze from Kenshin in order to return to what he was doing before-hand--instead his head was smashed into the ground by a fist moving at speeds far beyond Yan's comprehension.

Underneath Yan's head, which was now connecting with the ground with indomitable momentum, the ground shook and and evidence of blood collecting on the ground beneath appeared as it leaked into a pool. Yan was out cold, and wasn't waking up for some time in all probability..Nevertheless, his breathing as strained yet steady.||* - Sun Sep 13 03:27:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) had for the most part been fairly quiet and distant from the conversation before him, however as the Mizukage stood to speak, Tethys, Yan removed himself from his thoughts in order to pay attention to the man. Yan was pleased with the man's words, his desire for everyone to work under a common good. Yan would grin as he listened.* - Sun Sep 13 20:17:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) Yan was invigorated by opportunity, with illuminated eyes that were indomitable and unforgiving to the bastard Edge. If Kenshin would train Yan, then surely he would become such a formidable ninja that even Edge would fall under his hand. It was his dream; the very thing he awoke into thought of. In many ways, it had changed him yet the lingering boy that was Yan shined through the expanding darkness that tainted his heart. With that being said, Yan would begin to move and increase his speed until his pace was a steady job that would start him in his fity-mile run.

Such training proved boring and so he would begin to contemplate as he ran. First he would begin thinking about the day that everything in his life had changed. The day had just begun, and once the sun rose enough to penetrate the darkness within the sky, Tatsumi had already shaken his brother awake and ensured that they would eat and commit to the general preparations they would endure before training in the morning. Yan was dressed before his brother would be finished eating, as Yan always enjoyed such training as he idolized his brother in many ways.

His brother made sure that all of Yan's training was adequate in terms of preparing him to take the genin examination or more simply become strong and able when it came time for him to serve as a genin. Tatsumi had always been the one praised, and Yan always fell behind. When Tatsumi created his affinity with the Toads and therefore became their exclusive summoner, the family was quite happy. They were a prestigous group of summons, the toads. That being said, Tatsumi wanted his brother to even excel him and so he would push and train Yan everyday to that end.

Yan shook from the memory as he looked around. The climate was nothing like it was in The Hidden Sands as well as the entirety of Wind Country. In fact, it was even more moist and cool than Fire Country and The Hidden Leaf was. He was sure there were so many powerful water release users here it was pitiful and he also had every intention of taking all the chances he could to soak up powerful ninjutsu even if they weren't water release. That being said, he trudged along and continued pondering on his brother. After all, what Yan endured was in order to avenge his life.

That very same time that he had been thinking on materialized once again, even as he trudged along amidst an endeavour to traverse an entire fifty miles in one go. He had done many more miles than that though such stretches were dotted with breaks and camps. This was the longest he'd ever run..ever..and it was fitting it was to impress such a man of speed that was Kenshin. Anyway, just as the sun cracked the horizon, Tatsumi beckoned his brother awake and they enjoyed breakfast with one another. Their mother, and father, were there as well and helped serve the food. After they were done, they left.

"Tatsumi, what are we training today?!" He remembered asking his brother, though it was the routine question kept between the two that Yan would ask every morning before training. As usual, Tatsumi would give Yan the very same smirk he always did. He always remembered his brother as a joyful person and as time passed, such benevolence was instilled in the young impressionable boy that wanted to be just like his older brother. Even today, despite certain circumstances, Yan was indomitable with a smile and only at the mention of Edge did such fade from his features.

Soon after leaving their home, which was within the thick of the residential district nearby the local academy, both Yan and Tatsumi's venture would bring them upon the training grounds which was located on the south-eastern corner of the village. It was far enough away from the village that any hardcore training wouldn't threaten anyone's life. Tatsumi and Yan weren't doing anything on that tier of damage, yet they would make a ruckus in their own right as they entered the training grounds. With the air still cool and a slight breeze upon them, Yan and Tatsumi would proceed to train.

"Yo, yo--you look like you are training hard!" Tatsumi would say...wait, no, Tatsumi hadn't said that. Yan shook from his thought and became more aware of the world around him. He was back in Kirigakure, truding along in the fity mile trek that he had to endure in order to be taken under the wing of the fastest man alive--Kenshin. Somewhat confused, he set those illuminated green optics upon the person who was speaking out toward him. He wasn't even sure that he was being spoken to, and after pointing towards himself, the other confirmed he was the one being talked to and so without slowing he would speak back.

"Wha?! Yeah, I'm going to be trained by the great Kenshin!" Yan would say, his voice full of pride although such an agreement had not yet been reached as he would have to first successfully finish the training that Kenshin had ordered him to. The man praised such and would throw him a bottle of water for him to consume on his run. That worked out, as if he hadn't recieved some soon, he might have used his water release in order to quench his thirst in one way or another. Even the D-rank technique Water Gun would leave moisture in his mouth from which he could be satisfied from.

He thanked the man though he continued running. The man didn't seem to be bothered by this and Yan assumed that most knew what it meant to be under the training regime of the fastest man alive. Once he made it far enough away from the man that Yan could no longer exchange words from him, Yan would unravel the top of the water bottle which he was given and began to drink it down. He didn't drink the entirety of it, in fact, he didn't even drink half of the water bottle before fastening the cap back upon it and placing it on a hook which would suspend it from the satchel which he wore around his belt.

As yan would continue running, it was notable that neither his legs began to ache or his reserves in energy began to falter. He felt as refreshed as a brand new car and it wasn't something that would be changing as the boy had the reserves of the most formidable ninja. It was the thing that kept him alive, after all--that and a chakra reserve that was even greater than that which he had for physical energy. Within Yan's studies, he knew himself to be abnormally strong in this and that is why he decided to become the strongest elementalist that The Hidden Sands had ever birthed.

Needless to say, as the tranquility of his isolation came to be again, Yan would descend into thought about his brother. Shuriken would combat against one another, as both Yan and Tatsumi cranked back their hands and shot them forward as they both released projectile weapons against one another. Each of their shuriken whizzed through the air until the stars came into contact with the others. Both of their shuriken would be deflected and stick into the ground however being that Tatsumi was more skilled, one of his always seemed to make it past and slice Yan on the shoulder. This time was no different.

Upon seeing Yan perform handseals, Tatsumi would utilize his trademark Fuuinjutsu which would always trumpt Yan in awesomeness factor. At the end of both their seals, each one would bring their techniques into fruition yet yield different results. Yan would be accompanied by three clones whereas Tatsumi would now have a frog which was perched upon the young man's shoulder. This of course was how all of their fights would occur as they trained into repition and were well versed in each other's techniques and abilities. Eventually, throughout all the fighting, Tatsumi would capture Yan with his syrup trap and the fight would be over--eventually.

"I am a ninja, and they are ninja...We've both been training our entire lives for this moment and now that we are here--we are legal."

When they did, they would begin screaming in panic calling for Zetsumo's group to assimilate to Kirigakure's endeavor of killing Zetsumo due to the money which Tethys had offered them.

Due to the weaker nature of his own technique, he would have to pour more chakra into it.. That being said, this technique was compatible to such extents.

At the end of the sequence of seals, his mouth opened and a formidable volume of water was ejected from it. He had placed five times as much chakra as the original technique called for, thus amplifying it in relation to that much chakra..
