<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, if we out number them, and they are spread across the boundary of Kirigakure, it's safe to say wherever we go, we are out numbering them. What if we send a third of our troops out to attack a certain point. That'll draw Zetsumo to that area, at which point they will retreat. Meanwhile, the other two-thirds attack the opposite side. We can inflict the most casualties doing this, and Zetsumo won't risk attacking the village itself and facing the kunai launchers. - Fri Sep 18 17:11:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: But if we send all our attacks in, Zetsumo will eventually show up. We aren't risking as much separating the attacks. - Fri Sep 18 17:12:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: I add to that by sending out a false attack on their troops through explosive tags and kunais. To make them think we'll go for there, and send the attack in the opposite way. - Fri Sep 18 17:14:27 2015
