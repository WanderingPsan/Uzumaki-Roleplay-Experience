"You will probably be one of the strongest people I've trained with so far," He noted, a wide grin placed upon his lips as vibrant green eyes scanned the shinobi. "Do you start or I? I'm fine with you going ahead," He said, dropping into his own stance. Within his interior, chakra was bubbling into life as he prepared to utilize it. On the exterior, his hands remained close and open-palmed with digits slightly curled inward. His feet were shoulder-length apart and his eyes trained upon Tetsumi. He had to push himself if he was going to increase his power.* - Fri Sep 18 23:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) narrowed his eyes. While he had heard of iron sand, and had even seen it in the distance on the battlefield--there was nothing like it actually being pulled out to combat you. That being said, Yan sought to counter immediately as the sand poured from the gourd. He formed a single handseal, and with his mastery of the technique, plumes of smoke ignited all around him. Even before the smoke settled, a clone darted in his way--instictively preparing to block anything that was thrown at him. That being said, the shuriken dug into the clone's chest which threatened to deform the cone into mud. As it began to, the other clones darted forward.
\
\There were a total of six clones, two lines of three which were layered with one behind the other. As the lines broke, the left and right row of clones (2 in each) broke off to the east and west where the middle row continued to mover forward. The front clone in the middle row unleashed his chakra in the form of a mud river which was generated fairly quickly--threatening to smash into the iron sand manipulator.. Meanwhile, the clone behind him prepared his chakra and the four others who had gone east and west were intending to flank him if they were able to arrive to that point.
\
\In the background, Yan was molding his chakra, with one clone which was already reverted into mud now dwindling in mass to the ground. Yan was perfecting his clone technique's strategy.* - Fri Sep 18 23:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: i didnt see that - Fri Sep 18 23:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) frowned. He hadn't thought of the man going aerial. No matter, he would have to accomodate such manuevers. With that being said, Yan would attempt to cast a genjutsu on the iron sand manipulator. Due to Yan's progressed abilities with genjutsu, he would be able to manipulate the genjutsu to a degree that it's elements were changed yet the basics of the technique remained the same. If he was able to capture his opponent through this, a bird would lunge from behind him as though to attack. It was slow, easily captured, although when hit it wouldn't die but instead split off into more. With that one bird's arrival, thousands of others would appear. Tetsumi would feel as though he was being surrounded and overwhelmed by the aerial beasts.* - Fri Sep 18 23:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched as the iron sand user covered himself up completely now. With that done, the Yan himself dipped within the earth. At this point, there were five clones still alive and well that were created by Yan. 
\
\
\As for the genjutsu, the iron dome didn't seem to help. The birds would glide through the dome as though nothing was impeding them. Upon entry, they would attempt to peck at the boy from within the dome. Within moments, a dozen birds were within the dome fluttering around the boy, or so it seemed.* - Fri Sep 18 23:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was gifted the ability to sense through magnetic energies through the ability Hidden Mole, thus allowing him to percieve the shifting iron sand upon the earth through his third eye. That being said, as it began to form, all of the clones jumped into the air quickly. One was caught by the spikes, but four remained. Their leaps brought them to safety, one even landing in a nearby tree for safety. Meanwhile, the birds continued fluttering as he had not deactivated the genjutsu at this point. Nevertheless, it seemed the effort proved fruitless. Meanwhile, Yan remained underneath the earth--chakra was not a concern.* - Sat Sep 19 00:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm,I'm out of here. - Sat Sep 19 00:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) sensed the drills, causing fear to envelop his senses as he sought to avoid what would be deadly consequences if he were hit by the drills. He wondered what made Tetsumi use such fatal techniques on him, after all--Yan had techniques that could kill a ninja as well though he'd never pull them out in a spar. Needless to say, he burrowed deeper and angled so that he could eventually go topside. Meanwhile, all four of the clones formed handsigns. Their speed was formidable, and almost blinding to those not trained in perception. With two lagging behind in seals, the first would complete their set at which poin the first technique would come into fruition.
\
Spears would protrude from the earth, jutting inward toward one another as they intersected. Of course, this wouldn't hurt anyone. Two sets would appear in different positions. Thereafter, the second set would finish, at which point both of them would slam their hands into the ground. With that done, a total of eight spears would animate from the ground and be sent hurdling towards Tetsumi and now Flexus who seemed to be in the way at this point. With both of them distracted by one another, perhaps they would be caught off guard.
\
\By this time, Yan had avoided the drills and was top side--thankfully. He looked into the sky--observing the fruits of his labor.* - Sat Sep 19 01:00:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) grimaced. It seemed Flexus was intent on placing himself in the match, and with Yan watching, he grew to gargantuan porportions as he sought to over-whelm Tetsu's sand by sheer size. Yan formed a handseal, his speed in forming seals allowing him to weave the singular formation in less than a half second. Meanwhile, five clones would appear and would run towards Flexus. Applying Suimen, they would all jump onto his ankles and run up his body from different points. He wasn't sure what he was going to do, given the size of Flexus and teh defensive power of Tetsumi, but he wasn't giving up either.* - Sat Sep 19 01:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) knew what was going to happen as soon as he jumped into the air. That being said, he dipped into the ground and kept moving down.  Hopefully he could avoid death.* - Sat Sep 19 02:04:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) settled those green orbs upon Erebus. He recollected memory of the man, which was quite brief, as he had been the one to challenge Flexus to battle  upon their return from one of their own. It seemed the man was wise, much more than Himura, as he was instilling some of the wisdom into the young man. Nevertheless, even as it wasn't designed for Yan, the lively chunin was able to build upon Erebus' words as well with his own experiences in life. He had a man he placed vengence against, and that was Edge--someone that he seemed eons from reaching. It was indeed a necessity. If he killed Edge, if he brought the man to justice--he could take his people home. But first, there was a blood thirsty army to deal with. He sighed and brought both arms to his chest where he folded them into suspension there, his gaze lowering to the drifting waters below both Erebus and Himura.* - Sat Sep 19 13:19:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You can definitely resid here until you pass the test, or you can get a greencard and live  here like a citizen and be a shinobi, but never actually be a full citizen. - Mon Sep 21 00:33:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: Now that Zetsumo has been killed, I need to train even harder so I can take Sand back....I am glad Tethys let us stay here, but this is not our home. - Mon Sep 21 00:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Yo, so...What's this about Sunagakure merging with Kirigakure? - Mon Sep 21 00:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peered towards Ikarus, Koji and then to Izanami. He wasn't the strongest but he felt like they needed some direction yet he also knew he was far too weak to be that direction. Fujitora was a strong ninja but leadership wasn't in his heart, and Yan saw that day in The Hidden Leaf. He sighed and leaned against the post at the building, locked in that train of thought for the moment.* - Mon Sep 21 00:42:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) pushed off the post. He needed to speak to Fujitora. Yan wanted things to move over but he didn't know where they were moving to. The way the conversation before him just went, he wasn't sure where they stood at the moment. They weren't being kicked out, at the moment.* - Mon Sep 21 00:45:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Sanoke, if you want to spar, I am game. - Mon Sep 21 02:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: *sigh* Sanoke, you're so gullable.  - Mon Sep 21 02:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: But thank you...I suppose. - Mon Sep 21 02:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If you think about surrendering again, Mizukage, look at what happened when our Kazekage Tategama gave Suna to Kumo. - Mon Sep 21 02:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Nothing good came of that. - Mon Sep 21 02:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded, as the words he spoke were true. Yan's desire to spar wasn't to test his might but simply gather information about him. Nevertheless, Yan's smile was benevolent and his spirit was true to the same purpose. He was a curious young ninja. He wondered if he over-step with Koeki, but he didn't mean anything from what he said--simply to reference to history. Everyone knew Suna's time had been marked by turmoil since Kastya took leadership and then Tategama--ninja that weren't ready for such a post. As he turned, his eyes met Erebus...The man was interesting to say the least.* - Mon Sep 21 03:03:15 2015
