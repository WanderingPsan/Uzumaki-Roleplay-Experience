<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) placed an elbow against the hard, wood table meanwhile his fingers would spread and cradle his chin as he leaned into the base of his palm. He would observe Paine and then glance towards the paperwork.

"Hm, I should leave her be." He noted in his htoughts as he removed himself from the table, thereafter venturing into the kitchen area as he rummaged through the cabinets lining the wall. 

"I can't teach you while you are doing that, but I'd be happy to cook for you tonight." He'd offer up the idea as he pulled out different edible raw material that would be used to concoct something for them to eat.* - Wed Nov 18 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) hahadn't really anticipated her finishing the paperwork so quickly, yet he was pleased to hear she did. "Just leave it there and I'll put it up in a moment," he noted as he turned around. "Did you want to stay for dinner? You don't have to, I noticed Rias is probably waiting up for you." He noted, a pleasant smile upon his features.* - Wed Nov 18 06:49:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) had just wiped his hands off via a cloth towel which he had retrieved fresh from the  proper drawer when he was turning around to see Paine fall over initially. She wouldn't need to really fall again, as his concern was stretched upon the first time. He would hurry over to her side and bend down, grabbing onto her shoulder to let her know that he was there as he wasn't sure if she was fully concious or not. "Are you okay?" He'd say, his hands moving in an attempt to keep her body up in case she lost her legs again.* - Wed Nov 18 07:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) shook his head with a smirk, albeit concerned look, as he then would reply to her once she was finished. "Don't be sorry, I will teach you to cook next time. You should sit down," he said as he would gingerly help her up, augmenting her own ability as he simply provided her the safety net of being by her side if she fell. With that, he'd aim her back towards the seat where she had filled out the paperwork. "Sit..Do you like tea?" He'd ask her once she sat down.* - Wed Nov 18 07:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) looked down and smiled, once she was seated and as she nodded her head in confirmation of her desire for some tea. Yan would venture from here thereby heading towards the cabinets where he'd retrieve the supplies. Once he boiled the water, and placed the convient preforated pouches of dried tea leaves in the cups--he'd pour them and present the cups alongside a bowl of sugar cubes to Paine on a tray. He'd set it down in front of her. "Are you good to handle that?" He'd ask as he briskly returned to the kitchen where he'd be chopping up vegetables and the sort. "Do you eat meat or no?" He'd ask, planning the meal.* - Wed Nov 18 07:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded. He would some time preparing and cooking. "There's more tea in the pitcher on the table," he noted. After a while, he would have finished cooking and plated the food on two separate plates. "Here we are," he said as the aroma would encumber the air around them. By this point Yan would be back at the table she sat at and he'd place a dish with chicken and sauteed vegetables with a chili sauce on the side. He'd pour his chili sauce over his food and begin eating. Before long he'd look up to ensure she was enjoying her food.* - Wed Nov 18 07:30:33 2015
