<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You stole my shit. - Thu Nov  5 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) inspected the entirety of the army as it stood before him. He adorned different garbs than his normal jounin vest, as he intended to set his position apart from the rest for commanding reasonons. As he turned, he gestured toward the other commanding officers to send their own signals to the troops they had dominion over. With that, they moved.

The army of two-thousand Sand Ninja trudged through the desert before them. Their very presence could be heard for some distance, as they clanked with their weapons and armors, and periodic voices which resonated as multitudes of them sounded. Yan would be at the front, positioned in the middle, where his lead would be followed.

Furthermore, scouts were sent out ahead in order to ensure that nothing was awaiting them in the distance. They would send constant reports and lines of communication reporting that everything was either clear or there was an obstruction and/or something that Yan needed to tend to. That being said, the would march on unless reports dictated they should do otherwise.* - Thu Nov  5 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) yawned slightly to himself, breathe captured by an intercepting hand which cupped over his thin lips which parted slightly. A scout came from the one of the section of men, reporting that they had encountered some man-sized scorpians and that they had been put down with no casualties. It was to be expected. Most of the desert was desolate, devoid of human life and it wasn't often that a group of this magnitude would be traveling through this area. It was natural that the beasts of the desert would become territorial. The ninja were trained for such.

With that being said, Yan dismissed the scout and it returned to its post and the march continued on. In the distance, he could see the reserve of water which would ultimately lead into the boundary that separated The Land of Wind and The Land of Fire. They would replenish their reserves of water and rest before continuing on at that point.* - Thu Nov  5 06:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) finally arrived to the source of water which was known to be the very beginning of The Land of Fire, or rather, the very end of The Land of Wind. Either way, it was a resting point for all shinobi passing from to and fro as the journey from The Village Hidden in the Sands or toward it required a certain level of stamina that would only be required from resting up. Of course, people were known to make the stretch without stop though it wasn't really recommended. Yan would sit nearby the water source as commanders came to him.* - Thu Nov  5 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would listen as the commanders gave their reports, both oral and written ones. While he listened to one commander speak, he would be reading another report. Some were ailments, some were regarding rogue ninja. There were many reports that related to the creatures of the land creating issues. Yan would please them all by giving them what they wanted, sending medical ninja to help those who were hurt or suffering from exhaustion or dehydration. He would send hunter nin for the rogue ninja who broke away from their formation and attempted to flee from duty.* - Thu Nov  5 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was handed a form. The form indicated food distribution throughout the entirety of the army. Yan read over it briefly before he signed off on it, handing it back to the man whereupon he spun around and headed off. Within the next hour or so, the food would be dstributed and consumed at which point the final appropriations would be made so that they could prepare to set off again towards Kumogakure no Sato. Yan found himself at the head of the army again, in the middle, signaling that they were to move. As he took a few steps forward, he could hear the sea of shuffling feet as they moved upon his whim behind him. It was pretty crazy, or at least, in his mind.* - Thu Nov  5 17:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noticed wildlife flee from the approaching army. Any wolves or anything that might try to fight back would be ended quickly, the mass of ninja easily dispatching anything that was in their way as they moved through the thick woods that were indigenous to The Land of Fire. Yan wasn't too fond of this method, forcing wildlife to flee in fright as they moved through, yet it was necessary to ensure the fluidity of the mission as he couldn't allow the creatures to deter the movement of his army. His Kazekage expected perfection, and Yan would serve him a report of that very quality.* - Thu Nov  5 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) signaled stopping. They have moved into the country in which they were eventually employed to annex into the sovereign body of Sunagakure and The Land of Wind. Hence forth, the country would be a mere region as it had proved in recenty times to no be able to stand up on its own. There was a time that Yan remembered Sand being in a similar position, after the reign of Tategama, that it could no longer stand on its own and all trade agreements had been disbanded. Kumo had taken over Sand at that point, and so, Sand would do this now. Not in the same manner though--Yan hoped they would breathe benevolent life into a dead hidden village.* - Thu Nov  5 18:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) entered the territory of The Village Hidden in The Clouds. The jounin of The Hidden Sands was accompanied by an ominously large army of ninja in a uniform formation that stretched as far as the eye could see every way. The sheer amount of chakra one would sense if they were in the village would be alarming to say the least.

With a single hand gesture, a loosely-raveled fist that was extended upward, the commanding officer's would mimic the gesture which would bring the forward march of the two-thousand-man army. Even as the sound of the marching died down, he could hear the murmering of the army.

Yan would look upon the village, now falling into ruin due to negligence and lack of organized presence, shaking his head slightly. He remembered when Ushinawa was running the village, how there were shinobi thriving here. That was no more, not at the moment anyway. Yan would give the signal to march forward, and at that point, they would enter the village and begin operations.

Each commander had a task, most of which were set upon organizing and taking regions of the village. What few bandits were there would be ran out in due time. Yan would be moving with the main army, expecting reports on how the contingent squadrons were performing and  updates on progress made.* - Thu Nov  5 19:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) approached the area. At this point, two thousand sand ninja were taking over the village and all operations would be run by them. Yan would notice a native Kumo-nin, and with skepticism, he approached.

"Greetings." He'd say, his chakra ready to strike the ninja down if he provided any sort of descent from the will of Sand.* - Thu Nov  5 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ordered troops to grab the man and place him within the room which Yan would work from. He would tend to him when he was able to speak with him.* - Thu Nov  5 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) began recieving reports. No one was here, not even bandits. Everything had gone through smooth and operation "Annex Kumo" had gone succcessfully as Hassan mentioned it probably would. Yan sought to create a foundation for the future within the village, immediately creating plans for guardsmen throughout the village similiar to the fashion in which he had done so in Sand Village.

Merchants and civilians of necessary occupations were brought as well, and would occupy stores with their goods so that the village's commerce and economic stability would return in due time. For now, he would be running the village though he expected a replacement sooner than later as he had no intention of remaining here for anymore time that was required to stabilize the village and get it into running shape. At the desk of the Raikage, Yan would pull out a scroll and write up a report to send to Hassan. Once attached to a bird, the message would be sent away to travel the land at a fastened pace towards Sand Village where Hassan awaited word.* - Thu Nov  5 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) looked up from his paperwork, noticing the rather hostile demeanor of the ninja who had awoken from his meditation. "I am Yan, and I am here to bring this village back into operation." He'd say, bringing his fingers between two pages as he pushed one to a stack of finished paperwork. * - Thu Nov  5 20:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ....The Cloud village is an extension of Sand now. There's no need for hostility. This is for the best. - Thu Nov  5 20:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: What is your name, ninja? - Thu Nov  5 20:07:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'd much prefer to return to my home village, but for now, I will be able to help you in any way you need it. - Thu Nov  5 20:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Regado(RiseofthePhoenix) says: Hmmm.....I see. - Thu Nov  5 20:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Regado(RiseofthePhoenix) says: We mostly need updated facialtyies and repaires. - Thu Nov  5 20:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) brings a hand up from the paperwork, beckoning his assistant as he requested a sum of food to be brought. Within moments that was done, and Regado would be presented with a large amount of dried foods and such that could be easily transported from a distance without spoiling.* - Thu Nov  5 20:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: My financial advisors have made the determinations of what kind of funds will be needed. I'm working to secure the funds needed but it's alot.... - Thu Nov  5 20:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) as he spoke to Regado, he would push his hand into the satchel stationed upon his hip. His hand would slip from it in moments with a bag of herbs. "Do you?" He'd say, motioning towards the marijuana with his eyes as he began rolling up a joint.* - Thu Nov  5 20:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded and licked the joint to completion. He would light the end with a zippo lighter before taking a long drag of smoke. "Fair enough," he'd reply as he began to work upon his paperwork again. "Once I get permission, I might throw you a few tasks to test your mettle. Are there any other ninja in the village? From what I had seen, and in my reports, the village is a ghost town." He'd speak in an odd voice, holding in the smoke before he released it. It's skunky aroma would instantly fill Regado's nostrils. Then again, without even burning, the scent of the herb would be emanating throughout the room.* - Thu Nov  5 20:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I see. I'm surprised the village wasn't home to bandits during its downtime. - Thu Nov  5 20:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It made my job easier. - Thu Nov  5 20:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Regado(RiseofthePhoenix) says: Hmmm..I see I would have extermantied them if they were here when i arrived anyway. - Thu Nov  5 20:25:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Regado(RiseofthePhoenix) says: Ah.. just wondering. Why we have not recived aid from Amekagure. - Thu Nov  5 21:17:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would approach the area. He seemed somewhat fatigued, though it was an expected symptom of traveling over the ninja world from the Land of Lightning to the Land of Wind. As he approached the centre of the village, he only noticed but one face in which he was familiar with whereas he expected many others. "Hello Iza..Where is everyone?" He'd ask, his eyes casted about in observation of his surroundings.* - Fri Nov  6 07:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...What do you mean "something serious"? - Fri Nov  6 07:22:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) looks towards the new kid. He'd be smiling, and over all, a friendly demeanor could be percieved as he peered toward Musashi. "Hello..A new graduate?" He'd ask, beckoning him closer to have conversation with Izanami and himself.* - Fri Nov  6 07:27:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) laughs uneasily, bringing a hand to the back of his rather bright blonde hair where he would rub the back of it. "Alright then." He'd reply simply, moving his eyes back onto Izanami. "I hope everyone is okay. I am going to go find out. You said the academy?" He'd ask, just to make sure.* - Fri Nov  6 07:33:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) didn't really remember Jirun but it was okay.

Sorry for the unorthodox arrival, I wasn't sure of the state of this place after hearing Ortho's attacks. I'll be taking my leave now."

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Koji, you ready for that spar? - Fri Nov  6 18:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: We're not allowed to spar within the barracks however law of Sunagakure. - Fri Nov  6 18:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah, we are going to the training grounds. - Fri Nov  6 18:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would head towards the training grounds, beckoning his comrade with the wave of a hand.* - Fri Nov  6 18:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) sighed. He was a little fustrated, and he hoped it wouldn't factor into the match on. "I don't know why Index is here, but Hassan is allowing it now.." He said..."But anyways, let's get on subject." He'd say after Koji replied with whatever he intended to. Yan would fall into stance, leaping back a few feet to create distance as his hands moved together to form a T. While he kneaded and prepared his chakra, he didn't create the clones yet. 

"On your go," he'd say, prepared to begin.* - Fri Nov  6 18:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would eexpelled his chakra simultaneous to the chunin's movement, thus igniting plumes of smoke which manifested and billowed around Yan. In front, on his sides and even at his rear--these plumes of smoke were created and thereafter expanding only to dissipate from visual perception. Within the wake of these chakra-formed nebulas departure, four clones were within view of the doujutsu-user.

While his knowledge wasn't all-encompassing in relevance to Koji's skillset as a fighter, it did extend far enough to where he knew that ninety-nine percent of his abilities were cemented in close-ranged combat and taijutsu. That being said, and truly in all situations, Yan's clones were created omnipresent to the shinobi and therefore the majority of pathways to the jounin were obstructed by the clones.

With the air palm driven forward, it would collide with one of the clones. Of course, this was desired by Yan.  The clone at the rear of Yan began forming seals with focused ferocity--digits stretching to and fro as they formed seals in rapid, yet precise, pace. Meanwhile, Yan himself would unleash a low-level earth release technique in order to set things off. 

That being said, with his chakra more or less instantly prepared to unleash the technique, the ground before him would erupt in a river of mud which would manifest and progress forward in an accelerated manner amounting to approximately fifteen feet per second. Meanwhile, the two clones at his sides would form seals themselves. One would unleash their technique, whereas the other would hold it.

The one that released it chose to do so in the nature of water release. Chakra would welll up into his gullet, and before being projected from his mouth, it would convert into a reserve of water as it poured from his mouth in excess. The water would conjoin with the mud river, effectively doubling or even tripling the potency of the river and even the speed in which it flowed. What Koji would have would be a fast, heavy current heading his way. * - Fri Nov  6 19:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trent(Fang7777) thinks: Man theres people here already. - Fri Nov  6 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) anticipated this first assault not connecting with the ninja, yet in the end, Yan worked in multitudes of attacks rather than one or two attacks. He was five steps ahead of anyone normally, and even though he had no great skills, he made the most of what he had. As the explosion occured, quickly engulfed by mud and water--the rotation occured which worked against the two ninjutsu. Of course, they would be batted away due to the enormous amount of chakra circulating around the chunin.

More or less, in Yan's mind, things were going smoothly for the young Jounin. With Yan's rear clone having already finished forming seals, as well as the one who hadn't utilized their own ninjutsu when the water release technique was released by the other--he would be ready for when the rotation ended. It seemed like a pretty sound defense, but even the strongest defenses had a weakness. When the rotation stopped, and the chakra dissipated, the clone to his side released another raging waters which would pour forward, swallowing the kunai which was thrown their way.

"Maybe I should ease up..." He thought to himself, a grin forming upon his lips. By then he was forming his own seals. Yan wasn't the easiest ninja to combat, and these attacks being thrown toward Koji were dulled down to be non-fatal. Nevertheless, he moved to push Koji to be faster and stronger. If Koji couldn't get past Yan's defenses, which were cream of the crop, then he wasn't ready to face the ninja that plagued this world.

That being said, one of his favorite combos were about to be performed.* - Fri Nov  6 19:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) smirked, releasing the seal as he no longer needed to hold it. Then again, he never really needed to. With that said, hands dangled to the sides. Nevertheless the clone behind him maintained their own. The clone to the side remained on guard, ready to attack or defend the real body of Yan.

"Come get me..." He'd taunt Koji, bringing a hand up as he beckoned him forward.* - Fri Nov  6 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: You called me here, and they're busy. - Fri Nov  6 20:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) pushed off the ground. He wasn't dodging the kunai, but the technique which had been prepared behind him. That being said, a literal lake of water gushed forward. It would threaten to take everyone around them. That being said, the other clone would rush towards the group stationed north, and seal them off with a mud wall which would block them from the water right before being washed away himself in the onslaught of water.
