<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would have seen him way in advance of his approach, and so such would not be allowed. He formed a single seal, and thus, ten clones were willed into existence. Three of the clones went towards the Kaguya, meanwhile three others dug into the ground beneath him. The remainding four would station in his four cardinal directions in order to protect the original Yan. * - Wed Oct  7 05:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You will die! - Wed Oct  7 05:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched the man who he swore to kill, an addition to a list which at this point only contained two people, was targeted by the three clones which approached him. The middle one unleashed a mud river, whereas the other two began forming seals. Even at the end of their seals, they would hold the techniques which they were forming until the right time. Meanwhile Yan began focusing his chakra into the area around him, in preparation for a technique that would require such.* - Wed Oct  7 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Alastor, stay back and out of the way! - Wed Oct  7 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) wouldn't hesitate at this point, as soon as the man dissappeared from view in front of him, all four of his clones would begin forming seals which were around him. Unfortunately, one of the clones which was guarding his western position would be killed by ten shuriken which hit his body, though by being reduced into mud, they would hault the trajectory of the shuriken.

The other three would perform Mud Walls. Meanwhile, Yan would dig into the ground through mole. With the pause that wold occur between the first and second shunshin, Yan would be underneath the ground and Baen'd likely be sent catapulting into one or more mud walls due to the shunshin and his powerful momentum.* - Wed Oct  7 06:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) thinks: What am I looking at? - Wed Oct  7 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) finally the two clones would have released their techniques, having transitioned to running towards the others, upon the man re-appearing from the second shunshin. That being said, both clones slammed their hands into the ground, which would animate the rocks which were remnants of a once solid mud wall. That being said, considering Baen was probably stunned after using two shunshins in succession, the rocks would be sent towards him to catch him off guard. Meanwhile, Yan realized another participant joined the battle and he could only conclude it was Alastor being that he was the only other present. Yan wold delve deeper into the ground, whereupon he would extinguish all his clones. He wasn't going to be jumped..Once deep, he would enter Sand village once again unless somehow hindered.* - Wed Oct  7 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Nah, he told me he called em off for the fight.  - Wed Oct  7 06:47:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: Hm. - Wed Oct  7 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) emerges from the ground. He was unscathed and not lacking in any areas of conditions, yet he was burdened in expression. "Baen and I fought at the gates, Allastor turned on me and tried to kill  me from behind." He'd say, motioning. "He is a traitor to Suna."* - Wed Oct  7 06:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Alastor? - Wed Oct  7 06:53:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would form several handseals, their accuracy and speed quite formidable. Upon the last formulation of his hand, spears would protrude from the ground in four different positions around Alastor. Each spear would be angled inward, as to skewer the ninja in place, though one might be hindered by the gourd, it would undoubtedly break through it and continue onward towards him.* - Wed Oct  7 06:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Psychic_Warrior) says: ------Woah, woah, woah! - Wed Oct  7 06:58:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) 
 formed another seal, kneading his chakra as he prepared another jutsu while jumping backwards gaining distance. "Give up now," he'd suggest, prepared to unleash his technique.* - Wed Oct  7 07:13:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Mhmm.. - Wed Oct  7 07:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would have caught Alastor in the genjutsu. As such, the technique would take effect upon the ninja. A growth of trees which erected from the ground would coil around his opponent, effectively trapping him unless the genjutsu was somehow disbanded before taking effect. Simultaneously, Yan would vanish from sight as he was reduced to petals floating elegantly within the air.* - Wed Oct  7 07:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: he* - Wed Oct  7 07:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would fail in initiating the genjutsu, yet it seemed Violet took it upon her self to end the man. Yan would simply focus his chakra and wait to see what happened. He evidently underestimated the genin who had just shown up in teh ranks.* - Wed Oct  7 07:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: Im not killing him... im just taking a body part... - Wed Oct  7 07:46:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I am a visitor. - Wed Oct  7 07:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) bandishes a scroll from within his possession, before tucked in the satchel at his side. He'd unravel it's length and begin reading from the very beginning. Meanwhile, his attention would spread also toward Hassan. "You got a mission?" He'd ask, if the man was too busy to answer, he'd simply continue reading.* - Wed Oct  7 17:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thought back to his brief battle with Baen as he read through the scroll. Since he evidently wasn't going to acquire a mission from the Kazekage, his attention would fall wholly upon his train of thought and the contents of the scroll. The man had ran from him twice, only to best him in both combat and intellect in the third confrontation.

 Was it Yan's shortcoming that he could not defeat the man the first time and thus end the threat? It was an idealology that he had adopted early into his shinobi life and one that was strengthened by this very moment. One that gave up mercy in exchange for efficiency. He would not let his enemies live, not anymore--he would kill them before they could hurt more people...before they became strong enough to stand on their own two feet. His expression hardened as he progressed through the scroll.* - Wed Oct  7 17:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) decided from now on, the joyful Yan that he had been since his childhood was no longer necessary. With Alastor attacking him from behind, which he was still sure of since he had fought both of htem simultaneously and Alastor even utilized his sand ninjutsu in order to strike Yan, he did not know who he could trust. He knew the majority of Sand was truly his comrade, however there were shinobi he'd have to watch out for. His teeth gritted as he looked around. "Has Alastor fled with Baen?" He'd ask the group around him, almost completely done with the scroll as he began fiddling with the handseal requirement.* - Wed Oct  7 18:02:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) walks up to Fujitora, placing his hand upon him as he surged chakra into him. "Do not be alarmed, I mean no harm." He said. He was checking to see if the man was in a genjutsu, something he had been wondering for a while.* - Wed Oct  7 20:50:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) motions the man northward, where a bench was stationed not far away.* - Wed Oct  7 23:56:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would do the same, burying his elbow into the thick wood of the bench as he positioned his arm at an angle which made the arm wrestling easier. With that said, fingers spread and extended, awaiting the other to do the same. "If you do anything unnecessary, this will get more serious." He warned, though he wasn't being particularly hostile, he simply knew that cheap shots were often made against him as seen with Alastor.* - Wed Oct  7 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ai(Sennalove) says: Eh...You have the scrolls or something? - Wed Oct  7 23:59:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ai(Sennalove) says: Confusing me now. - Thu Oct  8 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) did in fact relax. He was on edge as of late, due to the increased number of rogues and traveling ninja coming to and fro from the village. He intended to stop the flow by speaking with Hassan and instating a more strict policy on such. Nevertheless, such thoughts were relinquished as the other commensed the contest with "Go". 

Yan wasn't especially strong, but hardened from his time as a ninja, he had more power than the average shinobi straight out of the academy. That being said, he pushed against the other.

(6 strength.)* - Thu Oct  8 00:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) grins, pleased to see he wasn't destroyed in the contest. Yan wasn't one that lost in such things often, so when he did, he didn't like it. It made him feel like he wasn't progressing. Nevertheless, the grin was accompanied by lips which curled back revealing pearlescent teeth which grinded against the opposing set. It seemed Reguel was stronger, and unless his previous display of ninjutsu was unapparent to the visible eye, he recollected seeing raiton chakra encompassing his hand when Baen was within the village. He pondered if his skill translated to the battlefield. Last time this man spoke, he was a simple peddler.* - Thu Oct  8 00:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Heh...you're pretty strong too. - Thu Oct  8 00:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) remains with his hand down in defeat, the gritting teeth reforming to a lips pushed together and forming a grin. "Yeah...It's not my usual display," he noted, as he was known for much more than punching or muscles. He'd push off his knee and come into a full stand. "So, you aren't a normal peddler, are you?" He'd ask, his grin lessening though his inquiry came with no hostility.* - Thu Oct  8 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Psychic_Warrior) says: A peddler has to learn to defend himself. - Thu Oct  8 00:16:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Where did you recieve your shinobi training? - Thu Oct  8 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) glances towards the boy who approached, though his eyes quickly returned to the peddler before him...as his question stood unanswered.* - Thu Oct  8 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Psychic_Warrior) says: Konoha. - Thu Oct  8 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I see. Well, soon we will be adopting stricter traveler laws. - Thu Oct  8 00:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I suggest you speak to Hassan about joining Suna formally so that you have a strong village to stay in. - Thu Oct  8 00:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Psychic_Warrior) says: Sure. - Thu Oct  8 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ai(Sennalove) says: ... - Thu Oct  8 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Psychic_Warrior) says: Yan-san. - Thu Oct  8 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Psychic_Warrior) says: Are you going? - Thu Oct  8 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I have a duty to my village. - Thu Oct  8 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: .....I knew not to let that boy in. - Thu Oct  8 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And now I am suffering the consequences of a decision made from compassion. - Thu Oct  8 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I know where he may be...I suggest you all stay here where you are safe. - Thu Oct  8 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) cracks his neck as he runs forward, directing himself to the western portion of the village where Zenaki lived. If Suitengu was anywhere within the village, it'd probably be there. He wasn't sure how he was going to deal with it though.* - Thu Oct  8 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I've heard news of a murderer? - Thu Oct  8 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Suitengu, someone I allowed to enter the village... - Thu Oct  8 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Again... I like to point out I didn't know him! - Thu Oct  8 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Help me apprehend this motherfucker.. - Thu Oct  8 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It is my fault, sir. - Thu Oct  8 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I am on it. - Thu Oct  8 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) gritted his teeth. As of late, there was no time for leisure nor laying back and training with his fellow comrades. It seemed there was always death and destruction occuring within the village and it was these damn illegal aliens that were rapists, murderers and whatnot. He formed a singular handseal, exerting a fair amount of chakra as plumes of smoke appeared in multiples around him. A total of ten would appear; surrounding himself. Meanwhile, he would pull out a scroll and write some information down whereupon a bird would fly off and deliver the said message unless deterred.

With that done, all ten clones including Yan would run forward towareds Ossa, Baen. He couldn't fight anyone airbourne, but he could fight the man who he had sworn to kill. This would be the last time he entered Sand village.* - Thu Oct  8 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: .... - Thu Oct  8 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: I can't believe it... - Thu Oct  8 01:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noticed Baen run, which was typical when the kettle grew too hot. He wasn't one to fight when the odds were against him, Yan saw that now..Either way, there were more to kill and so Yan's attention alongside that of the rest of his clones drew to the flying duo. All of them began forming handseals in unison.

 Yan joined them in this, and once they had all finished forming seals that took a mere second, all but 2 allowed their technique to come into fruition. Yan and two others held their technique. As a result, spears protruded from the ground though the their apperance was not exactly relevant at first. A split second later, Yan and the two which did not peform their technique just yet would twist and slam into the ground.

Upon doing so, all thirty-two spikes which were created would then be animated into movement. They would become projectiles that would catapult towards the position of the orgami user as well as Suitengu in an attempt to plunge into the wings as well as the bodies of the two ninja rendering them lifeless in their descent toward the ground.* - Thu Oct  8 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: she does it all the time - Thu Oct  8 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: -Omit- - Thu Oct  8 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would continue approaching the downed boy and Hassan, alongside the ten clones he had conjured. The battle looked over, but he was unsure as he didn't know where the paper girl had gone.* - Thu Oct  8 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: That could've been me. - Thu Oct  8 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..Is he the one that killed Taiga? - Thu Oct  8 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: How did he get here....to this point? - Thu Oct  8 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) shakes his head and returns to the square, hopefully to find Hassan in order to speak with him.* - Thu Oct  8 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Is Hassan gone? - Thu Oct  8 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: i do not know what that is I'll just get graps to make you .... - Thu Oct  8 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: My father knows my strict rules.. - Thu Oct  8 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Its like we're all related somehow... - Thu Oct  8 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ignored. Oh well, he runs off to train alone.* - Thu Oct  8 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) sighed as he removed himself from the group, not that they had really wanted to speak to him. As of late, he felt distant from his comrades and his squadron which was assigned to him had been somewhat inactive--partially due to injuries. Nevertheless, Yan was instilled with purpose as he had not really performed on the same level as Hassan during the battle. Of course, they were on two different levels of expectations yet =Yan would see such distance be removed in the future.
\
With his approach done, his hands would move together and his fingers would extend and loose nas to work nimbly with one another. Each finger fell into formation, eventually forming the first seal before transitionining into the next with skill and fluidity. As each seal was formed, thus chakra within his interior was kneaded and accumulated into a form that ws likeness to teh technique which he was trying to manifest into reality. At the last seal, once all the others had been completed and his chakra was prepared alongside elemental alignment, he would release teh technique.
\
\By slamming his hand into the ground, the technique would come into fruition. As a result, the ground churned beneath him and gave way to animation. As though alive, rocks were grown from the ground and build up, extending far above the young ninja as it constructed and continued forward from his position. in completion, the structure would create what looked to be a small cave with an opening before Yan, It would be completely enl=closed apart from this hole. He s=aw so many opportunities with th=is techniue=and had fiended for it since he saw the young kunoichi h=who had battled Tetsumi a week or so earlier. Now he would master it, and make it much more formidable than she would ever.* - Thu Oct  8 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched as the structure would conviently disassemble, retracting back into the earth until it was no longer visible as it were. With that done, he would attempt the ninjutsu again. He focused his chakra, closing his eyes as he attempted to hone what was a ominous amount of both physical and spiritual energy. The combination made what Yan had strived with the entirety of his ninja life. He would have undoubtedly perished long ago if it wasn't for his genes which he had recieved upon birth. With his hand clasped together, his technique would form.
\\
Each digit had a job to perform, and yet it realied upon the next finger for it to be able to do that job. It was much like the village, or at least Yan thought so. nevertheless, each digit fell into formation with one another cooperatively. As before, he had little effort performing a multitude of seals within quick sucession. Additionally, his control and earth= style prowess was such that kneading chakra and acquiring the elemental affinity to imbue that chakra would be in sync with each handseal formed. He was definitely a skilled ninjutsu user, and yet every target he has put his sights on was either still alive or killed off by another. Why did he continue to fall short?
\
\At the end of the string of seals, the technique would come into fruition as he twisted his hips, lunched his hand forward and down whereupon the open-handed palm would slam into the ground with moderate force. As a result, the construct would erect again. Sand would give way to terra-form that jutted from the ground. Sand was sent in several directions as  =a result from the power of momentum inherent within the assimilating structure. As it ascended, it would come into an arc and form sort of a hallway. This hallway of course would be allowed one hole within its entirety which would be before Yan. He could picture a multitude of combinations that would be utilized with this technique. in it's completion, i=t was mighty.* - Thu Oct  8 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Psychic_Warrior) says: Yan! - Thu Oct  8 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Psychic_Warrior) says: Yan-san. - Thu Oct  8 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Hm? - Thu Oct  8 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Psychic_Warrior) says: Nice arm wrestle we had earlier. - Thu Oct  8 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Psychic_Warrior) says: Do you think we could train together? - Thu Oct  8 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'd be willing to train with you. - Thu Oct  8 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: First I would like to speak to Hassan. - Thu Oct  8 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...Is he asleep? - Thu Oct  8 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) narrows firey green eyes, diverting them to Reguel. "If he is not available, then we can train now." He'd say. He'd wait a few moments before giving up.* - Thu Oct  8 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I suppose that's that. - Thu Oct  8 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) lifts the hand nearest to Reguel, beckoning him toward the training ground with that very hand as he himself pivot in the direction before heading off.* - Thu Oct  8 03:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Psychic_Warrior) says: Alright. - Thu Oct  8 03:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Psychic_Warrior) says: Let's train then. - Thu Oct  8 03:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If Hassan awakens, let him know im in the training groud=. - Thu Oct  8 03:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Psychic_Warrior) says: I've never been here before. - Thu Oct  8 03:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Psychic_Warrior) says: It's spacious. - Thu Oct  8 03:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It's housed many spars of mine. - Thu Oct  8 04:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'll let you make the first move. - Thu Oct  8 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: Usually spars start with them further away..I suppose I should challenge myself. - Thu Oct  8 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) executed one seal whereas Reuel did three. Even with a head start, Yan's execution in handseal speed was unrivaled in most cases. That being said, water would well within his gullet as chakra was kneaded and his technique was brought into fruition...with his lips giving away, the water would gush out in the form of a low-level water technique. With the water jetting from his mouth, it's speed eight feet per second, it would threaten to smash into Reguel. This process would take at the most three seconds, short of it due to preparations as the basic manuever took one second and the time it would take to reach his opponent just over a second.* - Thu Oct  8 04:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched as the water release technique made connection with the man, but as far as he could see, no effect other than hitting his body was made. Was he really that weak? He ended hi technique too early to protect himself from the raiton chakra which surged into his feet, additionally the roundhouse kick that landed into his side. He wouldn't tell Reguel until later, but he was the first one to hit Yan in probably ten fights.

Yan stumbled backwards, falling onto his back as he rolled back and onto his feet. With that done, he quickly performed a singular seal. It was time to take this up a knotch. With that done, sand gave way to mud as constructs became apparent in likeness to the chuunin. With these created, a total of five, they would stand guard around Yan. Additionally, all five would began building chakra to use their own ninjutsu while Yan prepared himself by stringing through seals.* - Thu Oct  8 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) slammed his hand upon the ground. Meanwhile, his clones finish their own seals and slam the ground as well. With all of that done, the rocks which were around from where he had been training just an hour ago would animate and shoot upwards towards him.

 Additionally, Yan's ninjutsu that he did by himself would come into fruition. Earth would rise up around Reguel, and unless he jumped high enough, it would enclose him within the construct. The growth of terrain would form a corridor of sorts with only one opening, and that would be at the foot of Yan's position.

If this impeded the raiton jutsu at all, Yan would prepare for the next ninjutsu. Otherwise, he'd probably be bombarded by the senbon. (I'll leave it to you)* - Thu Oct  8 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) wasn't able to dodge anything at the moment, senbon were sticking in his arms. He was really confused, and since the man had reverted from the transformation technique, he wondered how serious of a confrontation this was becoming. Yan quickly resorted to a higher tier water technique, as his clones were now destroyed due to the onslaught hitting him. He formed a single seal, and instead of the littlte water gun he had shot before, a wealth of water would gush from his mouth.


Theoretically, with the water and lightning coming together, it would aim to hurt both of them more. (I'm not sure if it does since it's chakra based), but the water which coarsed through the corridor filling it's width would now be augmented by the raiton chakra which was passing in the opposite direction. That being said, if he got the jutsu off, the corridor would become a rank of sorts and the only opening had a great momentum of water pushing Shinjin away from it.* - Thu Oct  8 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) released the technique as the other seemed rather impervious to any attempt. That being said, if he wanted to kill him, Yan would be dead. Even still, he was now on guard. The other grabbed his shoulder and he instinctively pulled away. "Why are you taking on disguises?" He asked, brows furrowed and expression firm.* - Thu Oct  8 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: That's a good question. - Thu Oct  8 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: And I don't really think you're wrong for asking that. - Thu Oct  8 05:01:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Though I usually don't let someone start as close as you, I don't think it woudl have made much difference. - Thu Oct  8 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Eh.... - Thu Oct  8 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Fighting... - Thu Oct  8 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Often comes down to three things. - Thu Oct  8 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Character. Principle. And moral. - Thu Oct  8 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: You were just up against someone whose character predisposed them to have more experience.  - Thu Oct  8 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Nothing big.... - Thu Oct  8 05:08:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: How long have you been a ninja? - Thu Oct  8 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Six years. - Thu Oct  8 05:09:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I don't like the idea of showing myself off as this. - Thu Oct  8 05:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Think you could find a way to hide me? - Thu Oct  8 05:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ....Are you wanted? - Thu Oct  8 05:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: No. - Thu Oct  8 05:11:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: I'm only wanted by my past. - Thu Oct  8 05:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You will need to be cleared by our leader before remaining here. - Thu Oct  8 05:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'll have to report you...Obviously I cannot stop you from doing whatever you want to stop that. - Thu Oct  8 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: But I'm not a coward. - Thu Oct  8 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I suppose that's alright then. - Thu Oct  8 05:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I didn't intend to stay in Sunagakure too long. - Thu Oct  8 05:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I'll be taking a caravan to leave. - Thu Oct  8 05:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: It was nice meeting you --- Yan. - Thu Oct  8 05:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods. "...I still don't know your name, otherwise I'd return the gesture." He replied.* - Thu Oct  8 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) wouldn't stop him, yet he'd take measures to ensure he left the village without trouble. The guy was too strong to leave at his own devices within the village with everything that's been happening.* - Thu Oct  8 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: . . . . . . - Thu Oct  8 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) formed a singular seal, and with that, two clones were created in likeness of Yan. They would station at the gate.* - Thu Oct  8 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Bryson, could you heal me? I have a few burns from raiton chakra on my body. - Thu Oct  8 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: I will be with you Yan - Thu Oct  8 05:40:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Guess i'll do my own training. - Thu Oct  8 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Morning Yan. - Thu Oct  8 16:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Mornin'. - Thu Oct  8 16:03:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..We had to kill a kid. - Thu Oct  8 16:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I already know that. - Thu Oct  8 16:04:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Ah, you... yeah good morning too. Oh was it that Anguo kid? - Thu Oct  8 16:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Don't say that in front of Zenaki. It was her brother. - Thu Oct  8 16:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods though he already knew.* - Thu Oct  8 16:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Alastor was taken into custody for attacking me while I was fighting Baen. - Thu Oct  8 16:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Hmm... wonder if anyone can beat those other two.... - Thu Oct  8 16:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: WeThose wo? - Thu Oct  8 16:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Which two? - Thu Oct  8 16:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: The two... well I mean three the other guy died. That killed the Mizukage. - Thu Oct  8 16:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I haven't heard who it as so I wouldn't know. - Thu Oct  8 16:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Have you spoken to Hassan? - Thu Oct  8 16:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Well Tram..something was the guy who got killed. Si'nichi is this guy that summoned... puppets. Then there was a mask guy asking for something called the Kiba blades. He had a stupid fake name, God D. Leader... and no I haven't. Didn't see him. - Thu Oct  8 16:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: I had Taiga tail Jirun for observation, but since that stupid kid killed Taiga, I guess I'm going to have to put someone else on it. - Thu Oct  8 16:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I see. - Thu Oct  8 16:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Oh... those weird teleporting chains... *shivers* didn't want to remember that. - Thu Oct  8 16:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, make it your top priority to speak with Hassan and introduce yourself--state your intentions in being here. - Thu Oct  8 16:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Got it... I'll try and find him. - Thu Oct  8 16:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods, the usual friendly smile and over-all demeanor vacant upon his person.* - Thu Oct  8 16:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm . . . The kiba blades. - Thu Oct  8 16:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I remember Ushinawa being a user of them once . . . Long ago that is. - Thu Oct  8 16:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He used them against Tethys. - Thu Oct  8 16:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Only Ushinawa knew where they were. - Thu Oct  8 16:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: The only way for them to find it would be to ask Ushinawa though he's dead. - Thu Oct  8 16:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Tethys also took the Kiba Blades from Ushinawa. - Thu Oct  8 16:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I think they fought again. - Thu Oct  8 16:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Oh? - Thu Oct  8 16:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I mean . . . I was told Ushinawa was there to fight with Zetsumo against Kumogakure. - Thu Oct  8 16:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Tethys died in Kumogakure while Niza was spared. - Thu Oct  8 16:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I was there when Ushinawa and Niza fought. - Thu Oct  8 16:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Ah, Alright. - Thu Oct  8 16:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I was almost killed that day, but Niza saved me - Thu Oct  8 16:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Some giant snake was coming after me. - Thu Oct  8 16:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I see. - Thu Oct  8 16:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Do you have more B ranks? - Thu Oct  8 16:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Only genjutsu. - Thu Oct  8 16:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: What B rank genjutsu do you have? - Thu Oct  8 16:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Slyva--..Hm? - Thu Oct  8 16:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) whispers: So.... Don't you want to ask any questions... Take my jutsu... rat out the horrible scerects of Kirigakure? I mean... normally people don't just let other ninja's into their village. I assume with some cost or something... - Thu Oct  8 16:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: It makes me wonder why you'd say that. Hassan was a jounin and councilman of Kirigakure for many years. I'm sure he knows more about the village than a little kid. - Thu Oct  8 16:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: I'd keep your head down until you talk to our Kazekage. Saying things like that won't generate trust towards you. - Thu Oct  8 16:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) whispers: Was he? Never knew him... Just got academy when the village was destroyed. And, well I'm a foreign ninja. I didn't expect much trust in the first place. Hell, I'm afraid to even practice my jutsu here assuming yall think I'm trying to attack you. - Thu Oct  8 16:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Go practice your ninjutsu in the enclosed area to the south-east of here. You won't encounter any trouble there. - Thu Oct  8 16:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: The Kazekage is already aware of your presence, he's simply been busy. - Thu Oct  8 16:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Awww, well. Thanks for the info. Guess I'll go and do that. - Thu Oct  8 16:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: So you were saying? - Thu Oct  8 16:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Slyvan Feathers. It binds the target and allows one to approach the target without them being able to see you. It's a pretty powerful genjutsu that I have yet to use apart from spars. - Thu Oct  8 16:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: How many and what rank jutsu would you want for that B rank genjutsu? - Thu Oct  8 16:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: I assume 2 C? - Thu Oct  8 16:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: You have no B ranks to offer? - Thu Oct  8 16:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Hm . . . Let's see if I remember . . . I gave you Earthern Corridor correct? - Thu Oct  8 16:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Did I give you Exploding Water Shockwave? - Thu Oct  8 16:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: I'm listening.. - Thu Oct  8 16:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Do you have Exploding Water Shockwave or not? - Thu Oct  8 16:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: ...No. - Thu Oct  8 16:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: I'll give you that Water B rank for your Genjutsu B rank then. - Thu Oct  8 16:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: I feel like I should ask for more but I'm a fair man. - Thu Oct  8 16:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Alright, Let's do it quickly then. - Thu Oct  8 16:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Thanks. - Thu Oct  8 16:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) pulled out into an open area, ensuring that his distance was adequate that whatever he was doing would not alarm or put anyone in danger. Either way, the technique was more supplementary than offensive. He would form a few seals, as such was necessary before mastery, before the ground beneath him began to change its very composition.

The technique was much like the one which he was known to use regularly while in battle, however instead of loosened ground that enabled digging; the elemental state transitioned from solid earth to a liquid-type substance. That being said, Yan descended into the earth, and began swimming forward as he practiced utilizing the technique effectively.* - Thu Oct  8 23:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Hassan - Thu Oct  8 23:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm about to pikc this shit up - Thu Oct  8 23:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) continued swimming through the earth, diving into the interior until the remnants of his technique no longer remained apparent as the earth returned to solid form. Underneath the veil of thick earthern crust, a pocket of fluid streamed through the terrain; leaving a tail which slowly remolded into solid earth.* - Thu Oct  8 23:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yo'. How fairs your training? - Thu Oct  8 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Hmm... well... I need to still work on a few jutsus... but my earth nature has improved greatly. - Thu Oct  8 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) obviously had ascended from the earth, emerging from what was once solid earth though had been changed into liquid form due to a technique. Once he was fully surfaced, the ground beneath him reverted. He'd ascend rather quickly, as compared to the hidden mole. Only at this point would he have asked the question, as before he was not visible nor was Jirun to him.* - Thu Oct  8 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Earth release? I see. Perhaps we could do some training. - Thu Oct  8 23:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: I still haven't met that Hassan guy. - Thu Oct  8 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) smiled as the other appeared, emerging only his head as he peered up at Yan. Despite Yan's recent times of strife, he still felt the softness and good-will which he was born with and grew up nurturing. That being said, a moment passed that such had revealed itself. 

When the boy mentioned Hassan, Yan turned his head and glanced towards the man. It seemed he was speaking with some officials regarding things which wouldn't allow him to get away to talk with Jirun. Yan simply looked back and shrugged; "later then." He'd begin walking towards the training ground. "C'mon, we can train alongside one another. I enjoy the company of another earth user," he'd say as he ventured towards the training grounds.* - Thu Oct  8 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Of course, if you have something else planned, then do what you will. - Thu Oct  8 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I am training regardless. - Thu Oct  8 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: I don't have anything else to do. - Thu Oct  8 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Allrighty. - Thu Oct  8 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..Hm. - Thu Oct  8 23:54:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: HMmmmm? - Thu Oct  8 23:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I asked you a question. Who are you? - Thu Oct  8 23:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I'm Hanae. - Thu Oct  8 23:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I've never seen you around. What's your rank? - Thu Oct  8 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: ...hmmm..... - Thu Oct  8 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Eh, don't have one. - Thu Oct  8 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If you aren't part of this village, what business do you have being in it? - Thu Oct  8 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I came here after konoha was well destroyed. - Thu Oct  8 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Does Hassan know you are here? - Thu Oct  8 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I guess? - Thu Oct  8 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Seems like you have a bunch of refugees here... - Thu Oct  8 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...Too many. - Thu Oct  8 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I wish Hassan would keep better track of them. - Thu Oct  8 23:58:17 2015
