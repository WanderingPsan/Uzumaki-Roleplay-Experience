<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) followed the battle as it progressed, observing intently. He knew of Koji's skills and he hoped he'd push her to reveal more of her own. It was out of spite, mostly. He disliked that she did not want to spar him.* - Fri Oct  2 06:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: So. Mirai, want a shell? - Fri Oct  2 06:21:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's weight, so no matter what I do, my body is getting stronger. - Fri Oct  2 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I use it to develop my strength, stamina, and speed. - Fri Oct  2 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) smirked, the expression mischevious as his eyes lit with an idea. He'd project a technique, though likely with her sensory abilities the source would go unknown; after all, she wasn't even looking at him and the exertion of chakra was minimal in comparison to what was happening before her. She'd soon found herself surrounded by ninja that looked just like Koji. They would be coming from just beyond her periphial, purposefully distracting her before the actual Koji struck. He noticed her eyes upon Koji's feet and knew the reason, and so he'd provide what she feared would be induced upon her.* - Fri Oct  2 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) thinks: Oh. - Fri Oct  2 06:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: Will you take that off when we play? - Fri Oct  2 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Uh, sure? I'll leave you in the dust, though. - Fri Oct  2 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Guess I can't go too fast. - Fri Oct  2 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: Are you really that fast? - Fri Oct  2 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Eh, somewhat. I won't test my speed until like another week. By then, I'd have worn this shell successfully for a month straight. - Fri Oct  2 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) hadn't noticed the female behind him, but he was itching for a spar. To satisfy his desire to grow stronger, feet were planted into the ground as hands converged before him at chest-level. He'd shoot through a string of seals before  the technique came into fruition. As a result, a durable earthern slab stood erect within the blink of an eye. It's thickness and defense which it provided was strong, augmented by a layer of chakra to increase such attributes.* - Fri Oct  2 14:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) again hadn't noticed the girl. He was a ninja, such should imply an expanded field of awareness yet he was focused upon the task at hand. Somehow that slab or earth which was created through ninjutsu dissapeared, perhaps descending back into the earth as it seemed convient. With that being said, he would seek to perform the technique again--centering his chakra as he brought his hands together once again to weave seals.

The string of seals formulated through dancing fingers, cooperating with one another, was done in a rapid manner. For some, it wasn't even perceivable as he could easily weave five seals within the span of a single second. At the end of the string, with his chakra kneaded and properly attributed to the correct element, the technique would commense.

The ground before him would shift, an audible sound emanating from the point of creation, as the thick slab of earth which was created before once again manifesting. It would shoot up into the air, beyond Yan's height and well beyond his girth--easily protecting two or more individuals if they were adjacent to Yan's position. Once formed, Yan inspected it for faults.* - Fri Oct  2 14:35:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Since then, my nindo has been to kill that man and in doing so, become the strongest ninja in Sand. I am undoubtedly the strongest suna-bred shinobi within this village. There are those that come from Mist that are stronger than me, but I intend to change that time. I specialize as an elementalist with both the water and earth element..I also summon toads and I am a proficient practitioner of genjutsu. - Sun Oct  4 19:30:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) happens upon the square, yawning ever so slightly as he scans the area. He wasn't tired, as Yan had nearly unlimited amounts of energy, rather he was simply bored. "Anyone down to spar?" He'd ask. With the specific group of ninja, he knew one of them would take on his challenge.* - Mon Oct  5 19:08:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peers towards Hassan as he speaks.* - Mon Oct  5 19:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Hmm? - Mon Oct  5 19:13:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Right here, huh? - Mon Oct  5 19:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) settled into his common stance where feet drew apart to shoulder length and his hands hovered chest-level and close to one another. Digits half-curled, remaining loose and prepared to form seals. "On your go, sir." He'd speak, a firm expression upon his lips with an interior that accumulated and prepared churning chakra ready to be utilized.* - Mon Oct  5 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) reacted as soon as the other reached for their satchel. As shuriken were brandished, a set of seals were formed whereupon a wealth of water was projected. That being said, the shuriken would be engulfed and thereafter Hassan if he didn't evade the ninjutsu.  It'd be likely that he'd be unable to perform the seals in time, as Yan would have began forming seals before Hassan had begun. Meanwhile, once adequate water was produced, the technique would cease and Yan would again form a seal thereby kneading his chakra in preparation.* - Mon Oct  5 19:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded to the man, whereupon the technique which most would guess he'd utilize came into fruition. Within the veil of billowing smoke--soon to subside--five clones were manifested into existence. There were three in front of him, and two at either side of him. The outside two in the front two projected mud rivers, pivoting as they did so as the middle stepped backwards. That being said, the two rivers would converge to increase the width of the river as they moved towards the man.

Meanwhile, the two clones at his side began performing seals. The third one, which was in front of him and backed behind the line of the two projecting mud rivers would peform seals and lag behind to work in conjunction with their attacks.* - Mon Oct  5 19:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We should spar someday again . . . Hassan. - Mon Oct  5 19:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would be prepared to react to a direct attack since he himself was doing nothing after the clones except watching the match. That being said, he would string through seals with amazing speed, three times the speed of Hassan. At the end of his string of seals, he would slam his hand upon the ground thus an earthern wall would form where the bunshin stood. The bunshin would be lifted up or destroyed, those who were performing the deed of the rivers, which would hault them from continuing

. Meanwhile, accounting for a connecting in the mud river, the two clones would finish their string of seals. Once would hold the last seal, thus maintaining the technique which he performed, whereas the other one would allow the technique to commense.

Spears protruded from the earth, or more like pillars, as the ends were dulled for sparring purposes. Four would rise from the ground, all angling inward around Hassan. Yan hoped that the current distractions would provide an easy connection, and without strength, they would lock the older man in place. 

Additionally, the third clone would be finishing his seals.* - Mon Oct  5 19:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Useful clones. - Mon Oct  5 19:49:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would twitch a bit, his own form bending his knees before launching upwards to scale and land ontop of the earthern wall. Meanwhile, the other clone who was holding their technique would finish as well, and more pillars would rise from the earth in bi-cardinal directions to further lock Hassan in place in the same manner which the others did. "I anticipated you dodging that." He'd say, though he had no intention of letting his guard down. His hands were ready to form more seals.

Meanwhile, the last clone finished their last seal and held the other technique. Using it at this ponit might cause pretty bad injury to his leader and that wasn't his goal. * - Mon Oct  5 20:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) twitches again. He formed a seal, which lolsy caused the pillars to be reduced to granules of dirt as it was before prior to it's solidification within the earth thereby releasing Hassan from the trap. "....You went easy on me." He'd say with a frown upon his lips, hopping off the wall toward Hassan.* - Mon Oct  5 20:06:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah? - Mon Oct  5 21:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Can you run a mission for me? - Mon Oct  5 21:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yessir. - Mon Oct  5 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Track down Jiki. - Mon Oct  5 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: And bring him back. - Mon Oct  5 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Interesting, but no. Too lazy right now. - Mon Oct  5 21:54:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Mon Oct  5 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Consider it done. Any idea where I should start? - Mon Oct  5 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: I will bear the duty of tracking Jiki-san, Lord Hassan! - Mon Oct  5 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Why not go lay down then? Get some rest? - Mon Oct  5 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: The village he leveled. - Mon Oct  5 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Fair enough. - Mon Oct  5 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: That sound like fun. - Mon Oct  5 21:56:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Well damn, he actually went and said that. - Mon Oct  5 22:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) wouldn't waste any time. Yan was pretty much geared up to leave, and so all that was needed to be gathered was food and water. Even then, he enjoyed venison and would partake in it as he traveled into the Land of Fire. Once the necessities were acquired, his adventure would begin and he would depart from the village.* - Mon Oct  5 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I love it when she walks away. - Mon Oct  5 22:00:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Ass. - Mon Oct  5 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . .That's nice? I guess. - Mon Oct  5 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) maintained a steady pace. The desert heat bore down upon him, it's arid composition, albeit something he had grown accustom to once again, seemed to rid his mouth of moisture until he took a sip from his canister. Soon the village was but a speck within the visage at his rear and he was surrounded by a vast ocean of sand.* - Mon Oct  5 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) traveled through the Land of Wind, camping out during the night and feasting upon the edibles which he had brought with him. He wasn't worried about his reserves, as he was quite excited to hunt dear and other wildlife once he entered The Land of Fire--a place that was much more plentiful in its biosphere than The Land of Wind which had little to offer in terms of food. In the distance, he was beginning to see the line of trees as the desert sands concluded and fertile growth was seen within the expanse beyond it.* - Mon Oct  5 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) entered the forests that encompassed nearly the entirety of Fire's landscape. Upon sighting deer, he would utilize his bamboo and earth spear technique in order to kill them at which point he went through the process of skinning and eating the dear after cooking it. Once he got a good meal in him, he would proceed north as he headed towards the village of Konoha in order to look for clues as to where the missing ninja might have went off too.* - Mon Oct  5 22:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) approached the village which he had been in more than a few times, even staying there weeks at a time. Upon its visage materializing within the distance, he could tell it was but remnants of  what it once was. Devastation was evident and life seemed absent. Nevertheless, a clone appeared before him and it was rather obvious who it was--as the gourd was something he had recognized to be adorned by the iron sand manipulator.

\"Tetsu, we need you to come back to Sand," he'd state firmly, though his intentions were devoid of ill will.* - Mon Oct  5 22:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Because that is where you belong, and with everything happening, you need your village behind you as well. - Mon Oct  5 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Mhmm... - Mon Oct  5 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: I understand but its for sunagakure's own good. - Mon Oct  5 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: You wouldn't understand. - Mon Oct  5 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I was tasked with bringing you back. - Mon Oct  5 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You can explain it to Hassan. - Mon Oct  5 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I know I'm not strong enough to make you, but I'll do what I need to...so please don't make this more difficult than it needs to be. - Mon Oct  5 22:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I am unsure, but I don't think Hassan has any intentions of anything other than incorperating you back into our forces. - Mon Oct  5 22:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Whatever happened here... - Mon Oct  5 22:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: We can move past. - Mon Oct  5 22:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Mhmm.. I see. - Mon Oct  5 22:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Its ironic, so much evil. Destroyed so easily, I wish I arrived on time to witness it all. I would've enjoyed myself. - Mon Oct  5 22:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Come again? - Mon Oct  5 22:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Mhmm.. The village. - Mon Oct  5 22:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I have reports that say you did this. - Mon Oct  5 22:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Me? Ehehe.  - Mon Oct  5 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: At any rate, let's head back to Suna...I don't like being out here. - Mon Oct  5 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Mhmm.. All right. As a warnining.. If you try anythin'..And I mean.. - Mon Oct  5 22:51:18 2015
