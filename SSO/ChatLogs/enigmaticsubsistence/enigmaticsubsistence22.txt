<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would pivot and head back towards his house. Unless deterred, he would continue on. It seemed as of late, he was being made out to be a bad guy. Maybe he was becoming one. A hardened view of justice against evil was something that was frowned upon these days.* - Fri Nov  6 23:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: I-It's better from e-experience.. - Fri Nov  6 23:24:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) happens upon the training field, and since he noticed the two, he'd stop nearby and observe. * - Sat Nov  7 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: O-Oh..I shouldn't g-go all out.. - Sat Nov  7 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: Sanoke seems like a good guy.. - Sat Nov  7 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peers towards Ivel, nodding to him politely. "What's up?" He'd ask, returning his gaze to the sparring match ahead of him.* - Sat Nov  7 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Honestly, do you feel its intrusive to stand here while they are sparring? I mean, they are showing their ninja techniques..Everyone does it, so no one can call anyone out on it really..but anyone can just walk up and peep your fighting style. - Sat Nov  7 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) whispers: Meh, my dad already told me that's how everyone is. - Sat Nov  7 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) whispers: I mean, not like we're going to be fighting our friends to the death or anything. - Sat Nov  7 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: I trust my friends, but outside that circle, I've learned to be vigilant. I'm not saying anything really other than to be mindful. I wasn't really trying to say that but it's something to keep in mind. You never know with people. - Sat Nov  7 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: I trust my friends, but outside that circle, I've learned to be vigilant. I'm not saying anything really other than to be mindful.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) whispers:  Maybe I shouldn't of showed off my secret technique! - Sat Nov  7 02:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: I've done it in myself. Given future events, I am going to start being more secretive with my abilities. - Sat Nov  7 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: I'd recommend you do the same. I don't know you, but you are Iza's brother, so I'd like to see you do well. - Sat Nov  7 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) thinks: Thanks, they say i'm better at fire style than her! So..maybe I should keep it on the low low. - Sat Nov  7 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would turn and pivot with all that said. The conversation simply meant that he needn't be a hypocrite and instead he would depart from there. He would maneuver past those there and in all likliehood check on the status of the prisoner who had escaped and was then captured. A very tragic example of a new developing mentality with Yan.* - Sat Nov  7 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: I-I'm r-really weak in sandy areas..B-But I can keep going..! - Sat Nov  7 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods politely as he moves past Zephiral. * - Sat Nov  7 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Anyway, Koji, do you think you can teach me that technique from before? - Sat Nov  7 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Can I watch? - Sat Nov  7 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Huh? - Sat Nov  7 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) entered the scene. He would move around to the north side of the centre, thereafter progressing towards the mansion. He'd nod in greeting to those strewn about. Although unless stopped, he would proceed.* - Sat Nov  7 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm? - Sat Nov  7 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peered towards Koji, and as a result of the chunin beckoning him over, he'd divert to the trio. He wasn't fond of being around Fujitora that much, yet a few moments wouldn't kill him.* - Sat Nov  7 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yo'. - Sat Nov  7 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: How goes it? - Sat Nov  7 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) whispers: Homies, we may have a problem. Ai is looking for blood. - Sat Nov  7 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: How come? - Sat Nov  7 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: .....? Ketsuki? - Sat Nov  7 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: ......Shit.. - Sat Nov  7 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) whispers: She's angry with the death of Ketsuki... She's seeking Trilliams's head. - Sat Nov  7 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peered towards Koji, unable to avoid the statement which resonated within his mind.* - Sat Nov  7 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Are you friends with Koji? - Sat Nov  7 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Two things happen. We take Trilliam out of the village and we talk to Ai or we hold Trilliam accountable as a normal ninja... - Sat Nov  7 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: Let me speak to her.. - Sat Nov  7 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: It's not my choice to met but that's what you are faced with. - Sat Nov  7 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: But remember this...and i'm not saying what we should do. But Leo is behind bars and he didn't even kill someone. Trilliam killed someone. We have to be realistic about how things are perceived..Do you understand? - Sat Nov  7 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: Much like how Katsune was allowed freedom and openly telling the world who she killed and will... - Sat Nov  7 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: I am trying to find Katsune...I don't know why Index is allowed in the village and I don't support it....Ugh. - Sat Nov  7 02:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: If you know where Katsune is, let me know...I will handle it personally. - Sat Nov  7 02:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: Index was with her?... - Sat Nov  7 02:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Yes. - Sat Nov  7 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: So goes Tetsumi's recounting of what the summon told him..and that's our source of information. Now let me correct myself, they stated it was a male ninja...but I know it was Index. - Sat Nov  7 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: . . . - Sat Nov  7 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: I...I just met him. - Sat Nov  7 03:05:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Wha- who? - Sat Nov  7 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: I understand what you are saying.....I will talk to Hassan about this as well. As for Index, I asked him if he knew where Katsune is and he said none of my business and then tried to goad me into attacking him. - Sat Nov  7 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: I don't believe him to be a trustworthy ninja. - Sat Nov  7 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: Speaking of which...We'll need to take back the blade the monk took off the private...Too much we do not know of the geavity blade to let anyone hold it.. - Sat Nov  7 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Well, we can't arrest him without proper evidence, but he is the boyfriend of Katsune. I doubt a lover would give up their partner. - Sat Nov  7 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: Mhm.. - Sat Nov  7 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: I won't attack him so long as he is allowed to be here. I don't think it gives off a good image though.  - Sat Nov  7 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) whispers: Hmm, I thought he just took the sheathe. Well yes, we'll need to get those as evidence in the case. - Sat Nov  7 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: I'll respect Hassan's decision on it. As for Kuro, he has no ill-will in him. I don't think we should take the blade. - Sat Nov  7 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: It's not my decision though. I'll follow your lead, Koji. - Sat Nov  7 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: It's my decision to do such..He may be a monk, but research is research mate.. - Sat Nov  7 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: I am at the will of the heiarchy, no need to flex. Whoever's decision it is, I will follow the lead. I respect boundaries. - Sat Nov  7 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) whispers: I agree with that as well, I would like our forces to be prepared for such an event if it occurs again. - Sat Nov  7 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Can't you interrogate him some way? - Sat Nov  7 03:20:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) headed off.* - Sat Nov  7 03:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would arrive upon the scene, truding through the thick surface of sand as he stepped over hills and dips from where the sand trasnported piles from one place to the next. He would be having a smile upon his face, and friendly eyes, as he made his way toward Paine alongsdie a guard. He recollected the brief moment they had in which Yan had consoled Paine. He felt somewhat accountable for her in some odd way. He wasn't sure, though it was nice to see her. "Hey! Long time no see, Paine!" He'd exclaim.* - Sat Nov  7 03:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) chuckled lightly, amused by her hesitations in perception. "You are always welcome here Paine--come on." He'd say, his smile maintained, as he motioned her toward the interior. Upon doing this, the guard would move out of the way. "You only need to say hi to the guards before coming through from now on...but that trust means alot." He'd say this at the end because he had trusted before, yet he knew she wouldn't let him down. If she did, it'd be the last person he would ever trust.* - Sat Nov  7 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Good to hear. - Sat Nov  7 03:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) pats her shoulder and would attempt to lead her into the village to be greeted by whoever else she might know within the village. "Same here..My house is in the north-east of Suna. You can come over and Koji and you can have dinner with me tonight." He'd offer up, being that she was a visitor, to a nice hot cooked meal. Yan had been practicing his cooking.* - Sat Nov  7 03:58:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: Is she attempting to block my way? I guess I'll stand down. - Sat Nov  7 07:21:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: I've yet to hear anything about Sunagakure while here. I assure you that these rogues most likely have no intentions of spreading information you desire. - Sat Nov  7 07:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It doesn't matter. - Sat Nov  7 07:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Communication? I assume that's code for "kill", since the Kzaekage himself sent two high-ranking shinobi. - Sat Nov  7 07:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If they are here, they are coming back with us. - Sat Nov  7 07:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: That much is true. However, one is a mass murderer. The other showed disregard for our laws. - Sat Nov  7 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Then imprison the mass murderer and let the law disregarder do what they desire, as long as it isn't critically ill to the code of your village. - Sat Nov  7 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Shouldn't you be letting Konoha shinobi look for these rogues..? - Sat Nov  7 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: We're attempting to prevent more casualties, but we do have a system we don't kill anyone like they're savage dogs. - Sat Nov  7 07:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Rather than just barging into our village and searching our houses..? - Sat Nov  7 07:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: What you're saying isn't adding up with your actions. - Sat Nov  7 07:24:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Inform the kunoichi themselves that you aren't out for their heads, and perhaps they'll think twice about avoiding personnel. - Sat Nov  7 07:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: When we find them, we most certainly will. - Sat Nov  7 07:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: There're other ways of communication. I suspect you'll tie them up, torture them abit.. and say you won't kill them. - Sat Nov  7 07:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..... - Sat Nov  7 07:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Perhaps that's my mind at work making me assume such, or it's the guilty truth. - Sat Nov  7 07:27:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: You're honest on your statement of not killing them, correct? Pass that message onto the Hokage himself. Perhaps he knows whether or not they've sheltered themselves in the village. - Sat Nov  7 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Is he available? - Sat Nov  7 07:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: No. - Sat Nov  7 07:31:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: We have our own security for this kind of thing. - Sat Nov  7 07:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Why should they act like our police? - Sat Nov  7 07:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ignores the one in the back as he was irrelevant.* - Sat Nov  7 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) sighs at the results and simple shakes his head. "Good day. Hopefully our next meeting is better. The name is Yan." He said. Business was business and Sand wasn't really scared of Konoha to any degree. In fact, they would likely be sent a letter by the Kazekage himself noting that harboring rogue sand ninja would be grounds for retaliation. That being said, he made his way alongside Koji away from the  duo of ninja.* - Sat Nov  7 07:39:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Kuma has our soldiers occupying it, Ame is a hostile village and obviously they aren't in Suna. - Sat Nov  7 07:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If you want to make a quick round, you can go but otherwise I think we should head to Kiri. - Sat Nov  7 07:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) approaches the waggon. He pulled out the usual fare as he hopped onto the caravan. Within a few minutes they were off, their horses trodding along across the Land of fire.* - Sat Nov  7 07:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was asleep, yet when the wheels came to a steady stop, Yan awoke. "We're here already?" He'd ask Koji as he quickly gathered his things and hopped off. He'd yawn slightly as he cracked his knuckles.* - Sat Nov  7 07:54:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: She's a doll... - Sat Nov  7 08:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: We are also looking for another rogue. Her name is Katsune...She's worth 2 million alive and 500k dead. If you want to give me information on her, and I kill hermyself, I'd happily split my portion of the money. - Sat Nov  7 08:00:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded. As much of a bitch Kana appeared to be, her information was infinitely more useful than what he had recieved while actually in Konohagakure no Sato. That being said, he was happy to have encountered her and hoped he would again to discuss information regarding Katsune. Alongside Koji, Yan would venture back to the caravan, putting out yet another substaintial sum in order for them to travel quickly while also conserving their energy.

He would hop on, and once Koji was on, they would set off back towards the mainland of the ninja world.* - Sat Nov  7 08:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Konoha or home? I think we need some official paperwork, at the same time, they could alert the rogue and allow her toe escape. What do you think? - Sat Nov  7 08:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: And yes, I did see her in Konohagakure. - Sat Nov  7 08:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Best to report and come back. This does break our code of alliance. - Sat Nov  7 08:07:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) arrives via caravan. He would hop off calmly, and peer towards the gril before him. She was facing from him, so he didn't know who she was.* - Sat Nov  7 08:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) thinks: I miss Konoha already. - Sat Nov  7 08:12:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Seems Mizora has returned... - Sat Nov  7 08:16:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) thinks: This is the second time I attempted to get in. - Sat Nov  7 08:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) had his eyes on Mizora at this ponit, and in turn, awareness would expand beyond the girl and toward the shinobi in front of her. After all, since she was a known rogue standing before them, it was likely something was about to happen as going rogue meant death..There was no returning from such a situation.


That being said, as Marissa started performing seals, so did Yan. He had seen Marrisa enough times in battle to know that her techniques were more destructive than precise. He wasn't sure how fast her seal forming speed was, yet he moved through his as though they were nothing. At the end, less than a second involved, an earthern wall would eject from the ground beneath him and protect both him and Koji from any incoming wind bullets.* - Sat Nov  7 08:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) grunts as he formed a seal. Five clones would appear around him and Kana, who would all simultaneously push chakra into the ground. That being said, Kana would be coming into the ground alongside them as they would get out of range of being crashed by what was now a destroyed wall. With two fuuton attacks hitting it head-on, one after the other, it would have given away. If Kana didn't fight, the clones would manuever through the earth in a digging fashion, and kana and Yan simply had to follow them.* - Sat Nov  7 08:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would travel under the ground, forming a seal as he utilized his own chakra to enhance his own speed as the clones were now heading upwards towards the surface. * - Sat Nov  7 08:57:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would be underneath Mizora, of course, she could probably sense him. Nevertheless, she had Marrisa on her, and now Sanoke was rushing towards them as well. Once the rotation would stop, Yan's arms would explode from the ground and grab Mizora's ankles, instantly bringing her down into the earth neck deep. If this didn't work, and she reacted in any way indicative of it not working, she would be released and he would dip back into the ground.* - Sat Nov  7 09:19:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) re-surfaces behind Mizora. While he didn't like Sanoke intervening, Marrisa was a bit crazy in her methods. "Well, that's done," he'd say. With that said, he'd pull out a kunai. "She doesn't leave alive." He'd not to Sanoke.* - Sat Nov  7 09:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Hassan has ordered her dead. We could bring her to him first but there's no need to prolong her life. It's tortuous. Let's just kill her and be done with it. - Sat Nov  7 09:41:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) says: and two for lightning. - Sat Nov  7 20:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Hello. - Sat Nov  7 20:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I cannot teach you lightning release, but show me your water technique. I'd like to see your skill level. - Sat Nov  7 20:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) says: Okay. - Sat Nov  7 20:11:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Uh, well, those people left so let's go inside the arena. - Sat Nov  7 20:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) says: Okay. - Sat Nov  7 20:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) stood adjacent to the boy's form, vibrant green hues watching on as the boy would announce the source of his technique and thereafter perform it. His attention would be upon his hands, watching him form seals as he attempted to deduce which technique would be used before hand, however his skill was lacking to be able to do that. Nevertheless, once the technique came to fruition, he recognized it immediately as one he had learned from Kilm.

"Interesting, I have built upon that technique and made a more versatile form." He'd note, forming several seals in quick succession. Once the chakra was prepared, kneaded through the creation of each hand seal, Yan's mouth would be encumbered with with chakra-enhanced suiton. With that said, it would shoot from his mouth. It's form would be that of a rope, tan in coloration, and would wrap around a wooden pole upon contact with it as to bind it.

"I'm not finished training it yet, so I'll hold off on teaching you that one." He'd say, smiling lightly as he peered towareds Zole thereafter. "How about I teach you a water-based clone technique?" He suggested, awaiting a response.* - Sat Nov  7 20:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) says: .  . - Sat Nov  7 20:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) says: That would be amazing ! - Sat Nov  7 20:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods and reaches into his satchel. Somewhere within, there would be a scroll detailing the very technique in which he had intended to show the young ninja. As he searched, and unraveled a few scrolls to find the one, he would talk to the young ninja.

"What is your name, ninja?"* - Sat Nov  7 20:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) says: My name is . . SUPER ZOLE ! - Sat Nov  7 20:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) finally acquired the correct scroll, and once he checked it's details to ensure it was a proper scroll, he would toss it to Zole. "You know..my brother taught me my first water technique." He recalled the moment, and it was a bittersweet moment to hear about Zole's brother teaching him. He wished Tatsumi could be here. His expression would lessen in warmth, yet not entirely so. "Here ya go." He'd say finally.* - Sat Nov  7 20:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I see...My name is Yan - Sat Nov  7 20:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Sure thing. Train hard and make your brother proud. As for me, I have a mission to tend to. - Sat Nov  7 20:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would turn towards the wide entry way of the training grounds whereupon he'd progress toward it--trudging through the thick sand.* - Sat Nov  7 20:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) says: I will ! - Sat Nov  7 20:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peered towards Mizora. He didn't harbor any ill-will towards her, yet he would ensure that she was being watched for the most part.* - Sat Nov  7 20:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: After thism you're free to go. - Sat Nov  7 21:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would suit up. That being said, he was hunting a ninja who was dangerous enough that the ranking of the mission was B. Not quite as dangerous as Katsune, yet much moreso than that of Mizora. It was definitely augment his progression towards a tier in which he could perhaps take on more powerful opponents. People like Baen. His strategic ingenuity could only take him so far, he had to increase his power exponentially or else he would never avenge his brother.* - Sat Nov  7 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) Once his crimson armor was upon his form, the insignia of Suna embellished with pride upon the chest-plate of his protective attire, he departed from his home which was conviently one of the most closest homes to the gates. He trudged through the sand, though that was nothing different, and past the masses which littered the village as he finally happened upon the gates.

"Hey guys!" He'd exclaim, a smile upon his face as he greeted his guards.
* - Sat Nov  7 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would enjoy the company of the men as they would talk for a few moments, all the while paperwork was checked and Yan's permission to leave the village would be verified. Once it was all said and done, Yan would wish them a good day and head out from the village. It was always nice to leave, but what was better, was being able to return to his village and see it strong and well-protected. As he left, the sensation of pride encumbered his senses as he was partly the creator of such an enviroment for his fellow ninja.* - Sat Nov  7 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) trudged through the more notably thick dunes of sand which littered the desert plains. What was in the village was a very mild comparison. Nevertheless, the accelerations of wind were minimal and there were no signs of any sand storms in the percievable future. Utilizing his time of traveling, Yan went over the details of the man in the mission details. He was a Chunin-ninja, accused of killing his brother as well as his wife. They were found naked, and based on that, it was assumed that the killing was on account of infidelity. He grimaced and shook his head. With his thoughts turning towards, Tatsumi, he quickly moved onto his abilities.
* - Sat Nov  7 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) had been walking through the sand for a few hours. The village in which he was traveling too was near the edge, a normal stop for ninja who were heading outside the village. Since it was a stopping point, there was a degree of civility to the village yet it was known for prostitution and criminal activity. The man who he was searching for was a taijutsu-user, who also utilized lightning ninjutsu, and Yan had no doubt he'd fair well against the criminals within the depths of the ghetto. In the distance, he could see the village materialize before him, and under the casted moon which casted it's dimmed glare, he would approach and enter thereafter.* - Sat Nov  7 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) met with the guards that were there, and with credentials shown, he alerted the security of the village that he would be operating in a mission to capture this ninja. Also, that they were welcome to help, but that help would involve clearing the area of civilians once the location of the criminal was uncovered. With that done, he set into the village. He moved immediately to route towards the ghetto which would serve as a safe haven for the likes of a man wanted by all of Sunagakure. As he moved through it's downtrodden streets, he observed the degree to which the place had fallen. Prostitutes were walking the streets, in all likliehood disease-ridden...In Sunagakure, the whore houses were at the very least reputable for their sanitation and hygeine.

* - Sat Nov  7 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noticed a homeless person. It was sad that the situation what it was, yet all ninja knew that when searching for someone--you should ask someone who's on the street constantly. In this case, an old man who was hunched over with his back partly against a wall. It seemed he was in somewhat of a stasis, from hard drugs, but Yan figured he might be able to get information out of him. He would approach the man, announcing his presence well in advance of him coming into the man's space. "Hello!" He'd exlcaim, his friendly aura exhibited alongside a bright smile and bright green hues hidden by the shade of night.* - Sat Nov  7 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) 
spoke with the old man briefly. He knew of the guy, but as anticipated, everything cost money. And why not? The man was living on the streets. If Yan was too cheap to pay the man for the good information, then there was something wrong here. He handed him a handsome sum of ten thousand yen. 

"Get something going with your life," though that might not be the case. Yan simply made his way on. He had the general location of the criminal.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) shrugs and slips his hand into his satchel. Before long, he would remove his hand with a joint in hand. He lit it to an even line of cherry before hitting on it. At that ponit, someone had started talking and it happened to be Zenaki. He would move toward her with intentions of talking. Meanwhile, he took a long drag of his marijuana and blew it out after breathing in it's thick smoke.* - Sat Nov  7 23:15:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) sighed heavily as he approached the woman. To be honest, he was a little scared of her. Not in the sense he feared for his life, yet something about the woman was extremely unsettling.

"Yo', when you're done, can I talk to you?" He'd inquire, thereafter quieting down to not interrupt further.* - Sat Nov  7 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) thinks: Or well.. Whisper.. - Sat Nov  7 23:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) folds his arms to his chest, yawning casually as he had placed the joint back into his satchel. Before he did, he smushed the cherry between two fingers.* - Sat Nov  7 23:28:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) frowned slightly as he'd turn around, peering towards the two girls. He knew one, though not the other. He'd smile and offer a slight wave as he approached. "Yo'," He'd greet them, taking a few steps over.* - Sat Nov  7 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: Maybe I'm intruding. - Sat Nov  7 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded back and continued on, stationing himself nearby as he hoped that Zenaki would return.* - Sat Nov  7 23:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) grunts discontently, starting to trudge through the sand. He would attempt to find Zenaki to speak with her.* - Sat Nov  7 23:48:54 2015
