<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was waiting for her to spring from the earth. In fact, based on her aggression showed previously, he'd now anticipate her being on the offensive. However, he hadn't taken into account that she used the lack of magnetic senses to deduce that the illusions were simply that. Nevertheless, he anticipated an attempt at a quick attack. As she sprung from the earth, having not been able to rid herself of the genjutsu,  another illusionary clone of Yan would be right in Lera's face aiming to attack.

Because she decided to ascend to his side rather than behind him, he would see her quite quickly as his only task at this point was locating her. Her seals were quick, yet not quick enough as he had ample time to react. In fact, the illusion MAY have provided some extra time as it might cause her to flinch, though in truth it would be the fact that he'd throw his body into hers. He wasn't huge, but he was a fifteen year old man of average height and weight. As his body would come into contact with hers, his arms would shoot forward to cause her to stumble backwards and possibly fall. This, of course, would disrupt the weaving of seals had the push been successful.

With that done, he would generate a river of mud quickly. With her on the ground, or possibly still stujmbling backwards, dodging would be difficult. If it connected, the mud would completely over-take her body since she was already on the ground and submerge her within it's thickness as it possibly moved her back from the flow of the mud.* - Wed Sep 16 15:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) being that she would be performing seals as he pushed his body against her, and thereafter with his hands which would in all probability be into her breasts. In the midst of a fight though, her womanly shaped mattered little.  At any rate, it would be unlikely the other would be able to grab him. She was tired and her reflexes were as fresh as when the battle began and the long reach would be plausible yet difficult even in a more lively state. So regardless, she would fall backwards and the mud river would be generated--over-taking her. Once he saw that she was not fighting back to evade it, he ceased the technique and she laid in the muk--face up.  She was probably the most difficult opponent he had fought since he had reached The Hidden Mist.* - Wed Sep 16 15:40:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peered towards the girl, not really too concerned with what Yan percieved as an obvious lack of acceptance of Suna-nin being within the Kirigakure's walls. Needless to say though, they brought a formidable force and therefore contributed greatly to Mist's army. "What's your name, little girl?" He'd say as he turned towards her completely now. Bright green eyes and a benevolent smile would slip upon his features, had it not already before this as it was often so he adorned such features.* - Wed Sep 16 15:59:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) looks around, shrugging thereafter as he attempted to walk off. "I'm going to go train, then." He'd say, having not recieved any attention from Tethys over coming alongside someone in a mission. He needed to train, anyways.* - Wed Sep 16 21:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: So uh, Got any missions for me then Tethys? - Wed Sep 16 21:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Or am I free to train for a bit? - Wed Sep 16 21:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) stood there after having left the area encompassing The Hidden Mist's leader mansion. He made his  training area in the usual spot, nothing like he had grown up knowing, yet a place he had grown accustom to since he became a refugee of The Hidden Sands. Nevertheless, he took position east of the small lake that was channled into by the waterfall which had a steady flow.
\
\His training was one involved something even more complex than the ninjutsu he had specialized in. Instead of ninjutsu, he would be focusing on genjutsu. He noted a deer combing the area for by-standards before approaching for a drink of water. He was almost tempted to cast the genjutsu on it, but his benevolent nature would not allow him to do this. He shook his head at the thought.
\
\Nevertheless, Yan didn't find himself bothered as much for something a little less majestic--a fish. One lept over out of the water, arcing before it went back in. As it arced, Yan would attempt to cast the genjutsu on the little fish. Of course, seeing as how ninja wouldn't be as entertaining he would instead project the illusion that large carnivorous fish were after the fish. It would run and hide, but no matter where it went, it couldn't seem to escape the fish that were after it.* - Wed Sep 16 22:32:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I am whenever. - Wed Sep 16 23:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) grins and progresses into a stance where his feet were shoulder length apart and his hands were hovering chest-level inf=ront of him. "Come at me," he'd say, building chakra up as he prepared to commit to seals.* - Wed Sep 16 23:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) formed a single handseal. With his chakra built up, thereafter being molded into the proper composition through the seal. Finally he opened his mouth to release a basic water technique which streamed towards Koji's chest. Yan didn't know how fast, but he could form a single seal within two tenths of a second.* - Wed Sep 16 23:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) moved when Koji did. He knew he was a fast opponent, but with him dodging away from Yan--it gave him to make distance. The technique was released and he leaned south-bound as he lunged in the direction.. He caught a hand to the ground, stabilizing himself as he flipped back onto his feet with a few feet in distance between them. With that being done, he would perform another set of seals thereby producing plumes of smoke to manifest all around him. Immediately clones bursted forward in an attempt to attack Koji. With two created, one would throw his body into the air and attempt to kick the other in the face while the second clone would attempt to spear him in the stomach. Of course, they were nothing in comparison to a taijusu specialist. * - Wed Sep 16 23:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Oh greetings. - Wed Sep 16 23:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: We better say hello! Yan! Fuji chakra has risen! Hello senpai! - Wed Sep 16 23:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would unleash a rather epic looking river of mud that would generate in the space before him. This would occur during Koji's attempt to make quick work of the clones and would hopefully catch him off guard. As Fujitora appears in the north, Yan shoots him a grin in acknowledgement.* - Thu Sep 17 00:01:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) released the technique, the mud river subsiding as it over-took Koji. The end of the technique would be the beginning of the new one. He would form seals with  ease and speed, and at the end of the string of seals, his technique would come into fruition. Above Koji, and all around him, spears of earth extended from the ground all around his downed form. The spears come out angled, and intersect with one another in their paths before haulting. The spears would end up trapping Koji to the ground, unless he squirmed out. "Ha..." He'd laugh in victory, or what he thought to be victory, as he turned and noticed the army of Tethys standg off to the side..."Woah..."* - Thu Sep 17 00:14:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noted this and turned, his eyes more serious as he peered towards Tethys. It was unexpected. "Sure, I'll meet ya there," He'd say, though by then Tethys was gone.= He made his way off as well. "I had fun, Koji," he'd say =as he made his way.* - Thu Sep 17 00:21:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) had a ten round spar with one ninja and a three round spar with Koji earlier. His threshold was 22 rounds yet he did feel the fatigue.* - Thu Sep 17 01:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Yan. - Thu Sep 17 12:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yo'? - Thu Sep 17 12:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: You've shown great loyalty to my army, and for that.. I'm promoting you to Chuunin. - Thu Sep 17 12:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) didn't see it coming. Yan shot Tethys a glance, vibrant green optics widened with surprise as the news was handed to him that he would be a chuunin. Ideally, he would have wanted to be a chuunin under the banner of The Hidden Sands, yet he knew that such might transfer if he was ever able to make the trip back to his home lands. Needless to say, he was overcome with honor and sentiment. "Thank you, Mizukage-sama!" He exclaimed, straightening his form as to seem more professional. 

Then to his brother, who he had been unable to save, who he he also pledged to become the strongest shinobi within The Hidden Sands. He couldn't help but think back to that promise and see the progression towards that goal. "This is for you, Tatsumi.." He thought to himself, the same benevolent grin as always plastered upon his face. * - Thu Sep 17 12:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would take the chuunin vest within his possession, looking over it in reverence. Upon Tethys speaking again, those green optics would avert into attention as he spoke. "Huh? What mission?" He asked, his voice brimming with excitement at the thought of his first mission as a Chunin. Considering it'd be a war mission against the villainous Zetsumo, he only knew it would be very dangerous. He was ready for such a commitment though, as if he could do this--he would be closer to being able to slay Edge.* - Thu Sep 17 12:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) thinks: Hmmm.... I haven't even touched the field of battle yet, and I was chuunin before then. I did see his battle with Lera, so its no surprise that hes useful there. - Thu Sep 17 12:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) listened to the man intently. With Yan's skillset and affinity to strategy, it was indeed something that he would be able to do if anybody. Filled with pride that only fed his zealous nature, he would take the scroll within his grasp and give Tethys a firm nod. "Consider it done when the time comes," he would state, hoping to instill the leader with confidence that he would give his all in completing the mission given to him.* - Thu Sep 17 12:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Tethys, Got any missions needed doing? - Thu Sep 17 12:52:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: No second guessing. - Thu Sep 17 15:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) approached from the opening which lead into the exterior of the courtyard. As he noticed Flexus, he would shoot him a friendly smile though Yan would quickly avert his eyes to the Mizukage whereupon he ceased movement and awaited the reason they were called here to be revealed.* - Thu Sep 17 16:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: South, by the dock. - Thu Sep 17 16:19:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: We can handle it. - Thu Sep 17 16:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Besides, if we don't learn to protect our village and take on these difficult missions, then we will always rely on the last generation to save our hides. - Thu Sep 17 16:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) thinks: I don't know if Yan understands what the mission is....or is oblivious.. - Thu Sep 17 16:30:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) thinks: Soon my children.. soon I'll rejoin you.. - Thu Sep 17 16:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: You and I are going to have to pull double the work this time around. - Thu Sep 17 16:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Is that okay with you? - Thu Sep 17 16:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I figured as much. Fine by me. - Thu Sep 17 16:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: I'll be having a shadow clone follow you in this mission. He's going to use Great Breakthrough to spread the poison to a larger scale. - Thu Sep 17 16:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: I'll be applying the other three scrolls. - Thu Sep 17 16:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: When your part is done, my clone will disperse and the knowledge will be transfered back to me. - Thu Sep 17 16:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) sighed. There was alot riding on this mission, he supposed. The others did not accept the mission and so it was left to him and the Mizukage, which gave him the small degree of fear that he was not capable of performing the mission. It was a small feeling, overwhelmed by a sense of duty and his indomitable trait that he would be the one to kill Edge. However childish such thoughts were, it was what drove him to this point and what would drive him if he lived through the risks of this mission.


Yan would form a quick set of seals thereby creating one earth release mud clone. Both he and the clone would approach the bridge. "C'mon," He'd mutter to Tethys' clone, grabbing the edge of the bridge before he would drop down. With his clone following, he would hang and suspend at the bottom of the bridge, applying suimen to his feet before he pushed them up and against the bottom of the bridge. With his clone doing the same, they would quietly make their way across the bridge. Upon reaching the other side, both he and the clone would concentrate chakra into the earth which the bridge led into. Through this, they would be able to traverse through the land. He utilized a clone to help him with this, as he wouldn't be able to bring Tethys' clone otherwise. From there they entered the earth, and entered the territory of Zetsumo's army. He took solace in numbers above, as sensory shinobi would not be able to distinguish one chakra source from another at this point.* - Thu Sep 17 16:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) moved into the area, ascending as he prepared the clone within his grasp. As he came top-side, the army now within range. With that being said, the clone of Yan took the scroll and ran towards them. Once he was close enough, he threw the scroll but not before instilling their own signature within it. As it was close enough, a singular detonation seal was formed at which point the seal was activated. Meanwhile, Tethys would release the greatbreakthrough which would then allow the poisonous gas to be pushed throughout the entirety of the forces present. The gas would wash over the armies successfully.* - Thu Sep 17 16:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) saw that his mission was complete, therefore he sunk back into the earth and returned back to the safe side of The Hidden Mist just as he had come. His clone was deassembled and Yan was the only one to return from their part. He hoped Tethys' mission went just as smooth.* - Thu Sep 17 17:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) arrived at the randevous point set by Tethys. Upon his arrival, he would wait for some time though no one showed. Assuming the worst, he ventured back to the mansion in hopes that he would find the Mizukage there. Otherwise, it was likely that his portion of the mission didn't go as successful and measures would have to be taken.* - Thu Sep 17 17:06:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) approaches from the south. He seemed unharmed but wasn't with the Mizukage, Tethys, who he had left with to perform the mission. "I think something happened to the Mizukage! He didn't meet me where he said he would after our parts in the mission." He'd say, a look of worry upon his features.* - Thu Sep 17 17:25:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I along with Flex and Sei went out to capture sea beast to use as a defense against the enemy forces if they ever step foot into the water around our village. - Thu Sep 17 17:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: That way our forces would not have to risk going on foot in the ocean, but rather have some monsters do the fighting for us as well. - Thu Sep 17 17:39:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched as he ran off. He went to go fight Ushinawa, but why? Last time he checked, Ushinawa was a decent man. Not perfect, but decent. Yan was tempted to follow him and see this unravel for himself..and perhaps help if he could.* - Thu Sep 17 19:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Something that only the Nidaime and Sandaime Raikage have save alongside Tethys. - Thu Sep 17 19:24:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) thinks: I hope he kills Ushinawa... - Thu Sep 17 19:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) began moving towards the path that lead to the exterior of The Hidden Mist, casually. He didn't want to raise alarms that he was going to follow the Raikage.  And he couldn't afford to take others with him on the journey.* - Thu Sep 17 19:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) moved through the terrain. To some ninja, this feat would be impossible as the continual drain would prove to be too much for them but there weas something about Yan that gave him such reserves since he was a child. It wasn't anything anyone could explain, he was simply gifted in both physical and spiritual energy. As he moved beneath the army stationed outside of The Hidden Mist, he could sense the magnitude of bodies littered throughout the area. Soon, as he continued to traverse, he would hear explosions as the very ground itself would shake all around him. It must be the Raikage, but why---he was given a promise that he would be able to move through the armies unhindered.* - Thu Sep 17 19:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) had been traveling from top for a while. After all, once he escaped the area surrounding =Kirigakure, there were only small patrols that he could easily escape between him and Konohagakure. That being said, he would rest his chakra reserves for what awaited him.* - Thu Sep 17 19:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) afinally saw the ominous walls which enclosed the village of leaf. Yan was tired but he wasn't that tired. The boy had reserves of stamina that seemed to know no end and as he looked to enter the village--he sunk underneath the ground. It would be easier than scaling the walls and chancing being sighted and attacked. It wouldn't be good--he wasn't as strong as people thought he was.
\
\As he traveled underneath the earth, he dived into depths that enabled him to travel underneath the wall. He then ventured further, to ascend in the middle of the village rather than tthe edge..It lessened the likliehood that he would be seen as patrols would be on the exterior and at the wall more than anything.* - Thu Sep 17 19:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) sunk back into the earth as he felt he neared the destination.* - Thu Sep 17 19:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) began to ascend. He had spent some time in Konohagakure, and based on Yan could tell, he was below or nearby the mansion of the leader. In all Likliehood, this is where the two would meet . As his eyes emerged from the ground, their vibrant green optics shot from side to side in observation. Of course he saw Niza and Ushinawa. "Ushi..." He murmered, hearing his words as he gritted his teeth. He had no knowledge of the history between Ushinawa and The Hidden Cloud village, yet he saw Ushinawa for what he was at the moment. The thought that one could take a village's leadership through the means as this was barbaric and would never work. Once upon a time, Ushinawa believed the same.* - Thu Sep 17 20:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) formed a few seals as soon as Ushinawa made his way toward Niza. It was a long shot, but he had to try. He would be able to perform this set of seals within one second, kneading the chakra and preparing to perform the technique. At the end of the seal, he would hold it. Based on Ushinawa's speed versuses Yan's handseal weaving speed, he would be done before Ushinawa made it to Niza. That being said, upon releasing, earth pillars would stretch from the ground on four different sides surrounding Ushinawa once his movement ceased. Each pillar was angled inwards, and threatened to pierce Ushinawa from different directions. If Yan could, he intended to dull the tips of the spears as to simply lock Ushinawa in place due to the pressure of the earthern spears. "Stop it Ushinawa!" He'd yell out, hopefully not signing his own death contract as a result.* - Thu Sep 17 20:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: | - Thu Sep 17 20:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) winced as his technique was dodged with little to no effort. It was obvious that he wasn't on the same calibre as the shinobi which he had just placed himself in the situation with.. Nevertheless, he wasn't one to shy down. "Ushinawa, the man you are helping is a horrible man! You have to stop!" He's scream aloud as he began performing seals. If he was going to die, then he wouldn't die without a fight. It took less than a second to do the deed, at which point he slammed his hand onto the ground. With the opposite hand, he grabbed a kunai.
\
\As a result of the technique, the same pillars which extended from the earth were thereby manipulated, racing from their contingent state to the ground into animation as they projected towards Hirusho in his path away from them. He hoped to catch him off-guard, and if Hirusho backed down, he would divert them. Based on events though, he had doubts that Hirusho would.* - Thu Sep 17 20:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) grimaced as the other seemingly avoided the attack. "Ushinawa! Stop this now! You once said I was a good ninja, and now I am saying the same to you! If you don't stop this now, you are going to lead this world to destruction by aiding Zetsumo and Edge!" He urged,  though in reality, he simply stood there entranced by the genjutsu. * - Thu Sep 17 20:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: \ - Thu Sep 17 21:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) wasn't in the genjutsu anymore? Since an answer wasn't given, that much was assumed. The giant snake seemed to be attacking Niza and since he dodged the attack, it turned its sights upon Yan. Yan wasn't going to stand around and wait. He would jump back away as the snake made its way.. With its distance, it was still a period of around two seconds before the snake would be upon him thereby allowing him a time for a quick response. With that being said, as he lept back, he would be performing a short set of seals with blinding speed. As he landed, twelve plumes of smoke appeared in front of him. 
\
\As the smoke cleared, clones would be within the plumes of smoke and those clones would unleash their own surprise. From Twelve clones was generated the same number in mud rivers. These combined mud rivers would hit the at this point attacking Manda unless it could evade in time. Yan would be transmitting his chakra into the ground, preparing to make an escape if he wasn't killed in that instant.* - Thu Sep 17 21:37:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would eventually wake up sometime later, in a hospital. He jolted in fear, only to be suppressed by the doctors who surrounded him. Being that he was only mentally scathed, and not physically harmed, he was processed and released from the hopsital. Upon arriving to Niza's room, he had just recieved medical attention for the second or third time. "..." He walked into the room and simply looked at him. Much like before, his weakness stared him into the face. If he couldn't help at all in the fight before, how could he possibly defeat Edge? He had been slacking on his training.* - Thu Sep 17 22:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods as the Raikage ordered him to a purpose, "How will we get you past the Amegakure army without raising alarm?" He'd ask.* - Thu Sep 17 22:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: ...Tunnels...make tunnels... - Thu Sep 17 22:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded, though he wasn't sure that he was up to the task of transporting the Raikage in the condition he was in. This was precisely the reason he wanted to endure the training of medical basics but at this moment, he had none. He told the doctors that he was taking Niza and even though they did not agree, they released him.. Meanwhile, he acquired a transportation bed, soemthing simple that would be easy to carry. Additionally, he would summon five clones that would transport Niza from his stationary bed to the transportation bed. With everything the way it was, he could not get a caravan and therefore he would have to endure the trip back on his feet. With the clones underneath Niza, now carrying him, they would exit the hospital. To ensure they were not attacked, not by surprise anyway, he summoned five more clones. This would exhaust his chakra before too long but for now he had no choice. From there they would venture back to Kirigakure no Sato...and as for the tunneling;  he would deal with it then.* - Thu Sep 17 23:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was exhausted yet his task was still undone. Even a boy with inherently so much chakra and stamina had his points of exhaustion. Nevertheless, seals were formed to create renewed mud clones at which point they all gripped different portions of Niza and sunk into the earth. They would travel underneath Ame's army and ascend above ground in safe territory. With that, he would muster the power to bring Niza to the first person he saw whereupon he dropped stomach first onto the ground. His chakra was exhausted and he was unconcious.* - Thu Sep 17 23:09:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would pivot and face towards the girl. His eyes narrowed, the usual bright and joyful composition within his eyes contorting to something more serious and dark. They then diverted. He meant no harm for the girl, or feelings of ill-will, he was just over-come with emotions. He didn't know what to say so instead of speaking, his eyes remained earth-bound and he listened to a mixture of their words and his own thoughts.* - Fri Sep 18 13:02:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: He made me chuunin. He believed in me and so did Chiiyari...And now they are both gone. I'm not strong enough to do this alone yet... - Fri Sep 18 13:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: . . . Where was he? Who killed him? - Fri Sep 18 13:09:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Someone mentioned he went to fight Ushinawa? - Fri Sep 18 13:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) looked around him. There were many shinobi that were there to help him yet such did not give him any comfort from the facts at hand. His teeth gritted as he recalled the events which occured in Konohagakure no Sato--how he was unable to make an impact despite his best efforts. If Tethys could not slay the beast, Zetsumo, then who could? Niza was probably good by now, but for the brief moment that Yan was lucid, he remembered how quickly he was severely wounded by Ushinawa. They were out-gunned.* - Fri Sep 18 13:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I said I assumed that was his intentions...It was the only thing that made sense. - Fri Sep 18 13:11:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No. - Fri Sep 18 13:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peered towards Lera as she said no to Ikaro's comment that he was to depart. Yan felt similar feelings towards it, yet he was in no place to tell the other no. It seemed by Ikaro's appearance that he was a chuunin as well.* - Fri Sep 18 13:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You have a duty to your village! Tethys entrusted us with this village. If he is dead, he needs to you to be here to prepare for war. I may not be a  born Mist nin, but Tethys made me a chuunin under Mist's banner. I am going to fight in his memory on the battlefield. If you go now, you may not have the same honor. Are you willing to say you didn't put your all into preserving the very thing that Tethys fought to  preserve? - Fri Sep 18 13:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Tethys last words before he left was to ensure the safety of the village. There by protectin his brother Niza. We can't go against his words. If we send a scouting unit it will be more acceptable - Fri Sep 18 13:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Are you people seriously trying to keave? - Fri Sep 18 13:20:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: And if you die? - Fri Sep 18 13:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) had watched his brother die as well. Those thoughts had always haunted him, but instead of making him go fight Edge, it placed upon him the burden to become strong enough to kill Edge. He didn't want his death to be in vain. He didn't want his brother to die for nothing, nor himself, and so he dedicated himself to increasing his power until it was adequate. Yet it was not. Was he simply prolonging the inevitable? Ikaro's words caused self-reflection. At this point, based on what he had been through, he wasn't sure if he had closed the gap at all between Edge and his own power.* - Fri Sep 18 13:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: I'm not going to fight. I won't die. I'll be back, and that's a promise. - Fri Sep 18 13:26:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: So am I...but for the memory of Tethys, we have to keep going. - Fri Sep 18 13:30:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Now more than ever...we have to stick together; if we break apart now then its all over. - Fri Sep 18 13:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) landed cleanly upon the plataeu, noticing a figure which most were fairly worried about. Their last exchange of words were noted to be less than friendly. Instead of bringing the same energy to Himura, he seemed sympathetic. "Yo'..how are you doing?" He'd ask.* - Fri Sep 18 13:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Well my best and only friend just died. - Fri Sep 18 13:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: So not fucking great. - Fri Sep 18 13:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) looked down as Himura gave his reply. Such was to be expected. When Yan's brother was killed, the young boy was torn apart. Yan wanted to say something that would help, but such words did not exist. "We are going to kill Zetsumo...and Edge..and Ushinawa. These are the men that must die." He'd say. They were shinobi, and Yan realized this. Combat was the majority of what they knew and most problems seemed to be fixed by such.  While Yan knew this wouldn't mend any wounds, he thought it may set Himura to task.* - Fri Sep 18 13:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) couldn't help but find a glimmer of truth within Himura's words. After all, no one had seemed to be a match against any of them. In fact, the only made that stood next to Ushinawa was Tethys and now he was gone. With the future seeming very bleak, it was difficult to muster up the words of courage that Yan wanted to find. He wanted to find them not only for Himura, but himself. With Baen's arrival, Yan's eyes temporarily avert to the man. He didn't know whawt to say, truth be told. * - Fri Sep 18 14:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If Tethys heard you say that, what would his reply be? - Fri Sep 18 14:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Tethys is dead so it doesn't matter. - Fri Sep 18 14:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Nothing matters anymore. - Fri Sep 18 14:10:08 2015
