<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: But evil and good aren't opinions its just what you catagorize someone and their actions. We wouldn't have the words good and evil, other wise. The only thin were argueing is that evil and good has many viewpoints that are based on prejuidice. - Fri Sep 25 19:09:26 2015

That being said, his pace was hastened as his intention was to reach Konohagakure and be able to back track and join them before they even reached The Hidden Sand. After all, who knew what would happen as they carved a path with such a presence of ninja.* - Sun Sep 27 07:02:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded to the gate guards. By this point, he was known and his benevolent nature had been established, thereby allowing him a moderate amount of leniency when it came to arrivals and departures. In this instance, he simpy needed to pick up a hot meal for the gate guard. "Here it is," He said as he handed him the bag--the contents within being steaming ramen which penetrated with its heat through the container and bag. In the cool air, the heat projected to near skin.

With that being said, a friendly smile and pleasantries were exchanged before Yan once again set out and headed towards Konohagakure no sato.* - Sun Sep 27 07:05:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) sighs, eyes dark in nature albeit bright and green. With that he turned from them all, and headed outside the village once again. He had acquired information which he needed. "Take care of Suna, Koji. I hold it dear." He'd say, looking back towards him. Despite his current train of emotions, he provided the very same friendly smile which was known to everyone who knew Yan even casually. From there he would depart from the village, unsure if he would ever return to the village.* - Mon Sep 28 06:00:32 2015

enters the scene in the very same physical condition that he had departed with, albeit he was tired and hadn't had a bed in a number of days. He had been camping in the wild outside Konohagakure within Fire Country, scoping out things as of late. Having not yet found Baen, he returned to the village that he called his home in order to recooperate and re-supply with food and water.

Upon his arrival, he peered around with those bright green hues. * - Mon Sep 28 18:52:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) caught the mission scroll and made his way off. (typing in wordpad)* - Mon Sep 28 19:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) set off the perform the mission. It was a simple, menial mission which he questioned as to why he was placed on it. Nevertheless, with his inherent charm and friendly nature, it seemed like he would be a good choice with all things considered. The targets were investors, looking to check out the village and what it had to offer as far as real estate. The men wanted to come into the village and create business. The way Yan saw it, Sand needed this.

As he approached the designated meeting area, he made observations of the two men which he would be showing around the village. One was short, rotund and bald--his expression wasn't the friendliest and he brandished a nice suit. The other one was quite the opposite, one of diplomatic accent. He was tall with full-bodied gray hair, and a smile which rivaled that of Yan's. Once the men realized that the ninja approaching them was indeed walking toward them, they both stood to attention and readied themselves. "Greetings gentlemen," Yan would say, brandishing the friendly smile he was known for.

Both men greeted him back, the tall one more welcoming than the other yet business was the tempo and so he didn't worry himself over the pleasantries too much. As he walked, the men would ask him many questions from which he would consult his mission scroll to answer. Of course, he didn't do this at that moment as he had familiarized himself with the information of the scroll prior to arriving to meet the men. He told them of how Sand was planning to get back onto his feet, their forces and many other things relevant to bringing business to the village. As they neared the Market place,  the men showed smiles upon their faces.

Life was getting back to the way Yan had known it to be, though such memories brought the thought of Tatsumi alongside them. Yan didn't show it, but he did feel sadness encumber his senses for the briefest of moments. He still had scores to settle, but during his time in the wild outside Leaf, he had determined that he had a duty towards his village and that all would be balanced in terms of retribution within time. He would continue to show the men throughout the village and they would find spots and note them within the papers which they held. At the end of their tour, the men seemed quite interested in bringing business to Suna which would bolster the village's growth.

Yan accompanied the men back to their caravans that would take them to their respective village, sending them farewells as well as thanking them for visiting the village. "Anything you need, Sand is here to help provide," He'd note as their carvans pushed off, thus leaving the village for the period of time they needed to acquire the resources for the business ventures. From there Yan would return to Hassan to report the deed performed and the investors happy.* - Mon Sep 28 20:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: The deed is done and the investors I showed around the village seem interested in bringing business to our village. - Mon Sep 28 20:03:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) entered the training area, which was enclosed in a thick earthern barrier that was similar to the more gargantuan structure that served as a barrier around the entirety of the village. Smaller in scale, it still provided isolation and privacy 'less someone was within the area or perched upon the top of the plateus. Yan stood at the epicenter of the enclosed area as he began to concentrate and center his focus thereby building up chakra within himself in preparation to perform his new earth release technique--Mud Wall.

Once he ridded himself of thoughts irrelevant to the forementioned purpose, Yan brought his hands together whereupon each digit fell into a formation that, in collaboration with the other fingers, would formulate into a single seal. Once that one was performed, Yan would transition expertly into another seal and then another--performing the string of handseals in quick succession as he prepared to end it thereby bringing the technique he was practicing into fruition.

On the last seal, once nature alignment had occured and his chakra was molded into the  correct composition, mud welled within his mouth. He opened his mouth, propelling the reserve of mud within his mouth towards the ground. As the mud accumulated at the ground, which the process was rapid, it would stack upon the ground and immediately harden into form. Within the moment it had occured, the mud would provide structure that would form a wall before Yan. It had chakra throughout, so it's stability and durability were magnificent.

 It was a technique which he had yearned for and it seemed strong. To test it, Yan would string through a few other seals and upon completion, water would well within his lips. He would release the torrent of water, and by doing so, it would catapult into the wall and slam into it. Nothing would occur, as the water technique was outranked and outclassed by the powerful defensive ninjutsu which Yan had utilized. Pleased with it, he would attempt to do it again.* - Mon Sep 28 20:49:42 2015

Once he ridded himself of thoughts irrelevant to the forementioned purpose, Yan brought his hands together whereupon each digit fell into a formation that, in collaboration with the other fingers, would formulate into a single seal. Once that one was performed, Yan would transition expertly into another seal and then another--performing the string of handseals in quick succession as he prepared to end it thereby bringing the technique he was practicing into fruition.

On the last seal, once nature alignment had occured and his chakra was molded into the  correct composition, mud welled within his mouth. He opened his mouth, propelling the reserve of mud within his mouth towards the ground. As the mud accumulated at the ground, which the process was rapid, it would stack upon the ground and immediately harden into form. Within the moment it had occured, the mud would provide structure that would form a wall before Yan. It had chakra throughout, so it's stability and durability were magnificent.

 It was a technique which he had yearned for and it seemed strong. To test it, Yan would string through a few other seals and upon completion, water would well within his lips. He would release the torrent of water, and by doing so, it would catapult into the wall and slam into it. Nothing would occur, as the water technique was outranked and outclassed by the powerful defensive ninjutsu which Yan had utilized. Pleased with it, he would attempt to do it again* - Mon Sep 28 21:14:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) took a step forward from the group he lined himself up with. Upon standing to Trilliam's side, he observed the boy's technique and smiled. "That is a technique I've relied on in many fights," he noted. He wondered if the boy's reserves was great or if he was a normal ninja. "Pay attention." He said. When the boy looked over, he would perform the seals of the technique very slowly--pausing beetween each one so that he could see the formation before transitioning into the next. Forming a total of five seals, he would slam his hand onto the ground thereafter. With a few random rocks around, he would thereby be able to manipulate them. They would elevate into the air before catapuling forward soon to skid across the ground as their flight ended. "This technique allows you to control nearby rocks and eathern debris." He'd say. He would perform each seal again for the boy to see, naming each one as he performed them.* - Mon Sep 28 21:40:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) arrived upon the scene from the north, from which the manor he had come. It wasn't but the briefest moment until he noticed Ossa, Baen present. His eyes were enflamed, the brilliant green bursting with emotion upon the man's visage. He immediately called out to him; challenging him to a battle to the death. "Kill me just the way you killed Flexus. I want to see what kind of ninja is capable of besting my comrade. I'm here to serve and collect--in Flexus' name." His voice boomed with intent, a killer aura spreading from his very demeanor--its grasp upon him completely uncharacteristic.

As soon as the enemy would look he would perform a singular seal, thus triggering the genjutsu technique to which he desired. If effected, the affected ninja's vision would blur outside the immediate foot or so around him. Additionally, when captured within the genjutsu, Ossa would likely be immobilized with the sensation and hallucination that he was captured within quick sand. From there he would string more seals, regardless of if it effected him or not.* - Tue Sep 29 04:39:53 2015
