<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You were trained to become a shinobi by our facilities, absorbed funds that were set aside to train loyal ninja. You went rogue, hid for an extended period of time and now instead of repaying us for what should have been your execution....You are asking to resign as a shinobi which would effectively end your loyalty completely to our village? - Thu Nov 12 22:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Or well, obligation to our village. - Thu Nov 12 22:23:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Just as I thought, you are honor-less. - Thu Nov 12 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: If I wasn't loyal after attempting to resign I would've mentioned decisions on leaving.. - Thu Nov 12 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I will set up a meeting between Koji, you and me. - Thu Nov 12 22:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: I'm worth nothing to Sunagakure. I'm honorless to myself. I don't want to hinder anyone anymore with my instability and lack of responsibility.. that's why I want to resign. - Thu Nov 12 22:26:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) arrived upon the scene. 

"Hello gentlemen, how is our Mizukage doing?" He'd ask politely, a smile upon his face.* - Thu Nov 12 22:33:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) had seen Mitsunara, though as he was busy, he really couldn't interact with her. That being said, he kinda was sad he didn't so after he was done with everything--he headed to a place that he thought he might find her at.


That being said, he happened upon the scene. He chuckled and folded his arms. "This girl knows no chill," he smirked as he said this and observed the fight.* - Thu Nov 12 22:47:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Well, that went pretty well. - Thu Nov 12 23:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) pulls a blunt of out his satchel, licking the line of cigar that had deviated from proper placement during the ride within his satchel. He'd then light it up and pull on it slowly.* - Thu Nov 12 23:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: Hi Aza. - Thu Nov 12 23:50:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would enjoy the thick aroma of the skunky weed as the smoke billowed from his mouth upon release. * - Thu Nov 12 23:51:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Thu Nov 12 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) took another hit, inhaling deeply. "Not much," he'd say with blow spilling from his mouth as he exerted it. He then would look to Nari, coughing slightly, whereupon he'd extend the blunt in her direction. "Come get it, then." He'd say with a smile.* - Thu Nov 12 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: Respect. - Thu Nov 12 23:53:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm... - Thu Nov 12 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) laughed slightly as she took the humungous hit of weed which resulted in an impressively sized cloud of smoke to be projected from her parting lips. "The name is Yan." He'd say as he took the blunt between two fingers, taking in the weed smoke as the cherry inflamed. "Yours?" He returned with curiousity. He'd peer towards Mitsunara after asking her.* - Thu Nov 12 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? - Fri Nov 13 00:02:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) extends his hand. "Come hit this weed, yo'." He said with a grin.* - Fri Nov 13 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: So what? You are going to take a nap? - Fri Nov 13 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was cluelessly high.* - Fri Nov 13 00:07:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I bet. A little too up close and personal for me. - Fri Nov 13 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Maybe she was measuring you before hand? - Fri Nov 13 00:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And she figured out you weren't a chump a little too late. - Fri Nov 13 00:08:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) somehow gets the blunt from Mitsunara, hitting it a few times before he passed it to Nari. * - Fri Nov 13 00:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: Why is there smoke every where?  - Fri Nov 13 00:09:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) sat there upon the bench, his firey green eyes casted upon the sands before him. Soon he would get up and head towards the south, turning east on the road which led to both the academy and training grounds. As he trudged through the sand, Yan reminisced on times he had with his family and brother. And also with Flexus, Trilliam, Izanami....People he had grown fond of. As he arrived upon the training field, he'd walk into the area and slump against a rocky cliff. He would relax a moment as he retrieved a blunt from his satchel, lighting it up as he took a long drag.* - Fri Nov 13 02:57:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) begins to get more focused. After all, pondering wasn't going to increase his ability to win. He pulled out a scroll and read upon it. He would focus on each line of the scroll as it talked about chakra molding, kneading through seals and principals of the earth release technique that involved the creation of a mud-formed dragon.* - Fri Nov 13 03:14:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) arrived upon the scene although his appearance would be drastically different. Instead of his usual armor, he wore the traditional Hidden Sand robes, or rather--the armor was veiled by the cover. Additionally, his bright blonde hair was tucked underneath a complimenting head dress. He would take one final look at the people within the square, all the way to Hassan. 

"I wish I could tell you how thankful I am," he thought as he it was visibly apparent how successful the village had become during Muhammed's reign. It was a truly amazing thing, and now, with everything settled--Yan couldn't hide behind the obligation to ensure his village's safety. There was plenty of stability and he was no longer necessary. 

Yan would then make his way off. While he was a known individual, he would look much different as he hadn't dressed this way since his time with his brother. Additionally, he would move within the group of civilians that walked. * - Fri Nov 13 03:32:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would be walking towards the gates of Suna. He would have his head down, and try to keep his profile low as he moved down the path.* - Fri Nov 13 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would be trudging through the sand, traveling from the land of wind towards the land of fire. In the distance, he would notice the familiar figure before he looked down and attempted to hide his face. He had to stay focused or else he would die, and so he would try to avoid her. After all, what would he say anyways? He never got to know her and doubt she cared either way.* - Fri Nov 13 03:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) enjoyed his journey. He brought little to no food, rather he stocked up on water and would rely on nature itself to bring him his dinners at night. Although, to make it through the desert, he would bring some dried meats and other things to at least provide him some nutrients where little was to be scavenged.

Now he was in the Land of Fire, and deer as well as many other edible animals littered the area. As Yan moved through the forests, he would dispatch shadow clones to look around and hunt deer and rabbit. He'd spend his nights skinning and cooking the meat which he caught--eating in excess. He'd also enjoy a nice blunt each night after his meal before creating small fires within rock corridors to keep him warm in what was drastically cooler temperature than what he was accustomed to.* - Fri Nov 13 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) arrived completely alone. Had Ortho percieved his approach through the augmentation of his sharingan, he would notice that there were no other notable entities emanating sources of chakra in the distance. And if he did, it wouldn't be in the company of the lone Sand ninja.

Firey green hues locked onto his target, and as such--he haulted before him in front of the ominous walls which served as a barrier between The Hidden Leaf and all of the ninja world at its exterior. His expression was unusually dim, yet a smirk crept upon the features as he had contemplated his death since he had accepted the challenge.

'If I cannot kill this man, then I will never achieve the power to kill Edge. I can't just play village boy forever,' he'd think to himself as he awaited acknowledgement of what he assumed to be a rogue-status ninja.* - Fri Nov 13 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) couldn't possibly see from what specific seals were being formed, though he did indeed see they were being formed. That being said, Yan would form several seals with as much accelearation as he could muster. That being said, the creation would be a little of half a second in creation time and upon finishing the seals--he would use his formidable chakra control to dip into the ground and manuever. 

Since Yan began forming seals soon after Ortho's initial set of seals, he would be easily done and already traversing through the ground before the spears were formed and thereafter ejected from the terrain. Additionally, he would have broke into a run forward, so Ortho's aim would be based upon older information.

That being said, he traveled underneath the ground fluidly as he headed towards Ortho's position.* - Fri Nov 13 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was traveling underground Since before the spikes, and given that he was traveling  fifteen feet per second, he would arrive at Ortho's position at approximately two seconds of being underneath. That being said, he would get to Ortho in ample time, and even before the two seconds was up--as Yan would shoot from the ground using the momentum of his movement through the terrain to catapult him forward as though a fish leaping out of the water with complete forward momentum.

Once his hands emerged from the ground, they would fluidly form a seal, at which point, chakra would be kneaded and fill into his gullet as it would convert into water and thus be expelled. The quick torrent was a low level ninjutsu, yet it carried his full ninjutsu power as he aimed to hit the man square in the chest at a similar speed to which his own body was moving.

Afterwards, Yan would release the water technique as his momentum was giving way to gravity, and he would throw his arms down and cause a sudden burst of friction which would flip his body forward. The product was him flipping and landing on his knees as he drug himself to a stop. Needless to say, it was doubtful that in the time Yan was able to mount his offensive that the probably surprised Ortho would finish his summoning handseals.* - Fri Nov 13 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) flipped over, digging his knees into the ground as he haulted his form. In a fight of this calibre, or well-- a fight in which one's life was at stake--one couldn't simply rely on what he saw in order to react. He had to anticipate, he had to theorize--he had to be steps ahead of what was happening within the present so that he could then be ready for the future. That being said, his hand would be forming a seal

Suddenly the terrain all around Yan would animate and create numerous mud clones of Yan. That being said, clones would do their best to manuever in the way of the snakes to slow their momentum. A total of nine  mud clones appeared around Yan and would be working to protect their original body. Meanwhile, Yan would be forming handseals and so would the back three where as the other six took on the snakes.* - Fri Nov 13 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched on as the battle progressed, with him in the back lines even more with a leap backwards. All three ninja would finsih their last seal, with two slamming their hands upon the ground. Simultaneous to this, soil within the ground would be manipulated and form a total of eight spears of earth--four by each clone. To increase the effectiveness, the poistion in which they would sprout would be slightly deviated from one clone's technique to the next, which would allow all eight spears to encroach the same area and would threaten to stab Ortho eight times seperately.

By the time they were extended, the third clone who was forming seals would slam their hand upon the ground, which would then allow him to animate the spears. Regardless if they skewered the Uchiha or not, they would be animated into flying in eight sepearate directions to catch a evading form off-guard. If he hadn't dodged, then it would likely rip his body apart.

Nevertheless, if the lightning came into play, it would be hitting the two clones which were coming into range that were left over from the four snakes who had grabbed onto separate clones. Nevertheless, with the leap back, he hoped that the conglameration of his attacks, the weakening of the technique as it coarsed through mud clones and Yan's repositioning that he would no longer be threatened by the raiton technique.* - Fri Nov 13 06:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) while Ortho catapulted into the air with no end in sight, and utilized his reflexive abilities to evade what Yan thought to be rather unpredictable combination technique, Yan would be watching all the while. That being said, amidst all the commotion, Yan would form seals and so would the three clones which were left untouched and were the source of the original combination.

As Ortho would be shooting out his fireball, Yan would return the gesture with a volume of water which would project from his mouth as chakra would accumulate and convert into water upon nature transformation. While the fireball and the water technique met, the three clones would attempt the previous combination but with more intent on the latter portion of it as the initial technique would have no effect on anything.

That being said, they would have the spears come up behind where Ortho stood, facing toward Yan, meaning they would be behind him. As the eight spears were created, the third clone would slam his hand onto the ground. With that done, the spears would animate again. Instead of going every which way as originally designed, they would catapult from the ground and all shoot forth as they would direct their aim towards Ortho's back.* - Fri Nov 13 07:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) grimaced as he kept his field of vision. The two techniques clashed, at which point the katon technique would be defeated. Meanwhile, the spears would fly without any ninja captured within their spearing points. With no knowledge of where he was, Yan would begin forming seals and so would his fellow clones at which point they would dip into the ground. This would be just in time to avoid both the fire and wind release as he assumed the fire release's projection was accomodated in order for them to work in cooperation with one another. 

Once the clones were submerged, each went toward a cardinal direction as though on a map. Yan went south, away from konohagakure, and he left the other three to move in their respective directions. Within twenty feet, all of them would emerge in different positions with Yan being one of the two who were now furthest away from Ortho. One would be along the wall towards the west, one would be to the north inside the village whereas one would have came underneath Ortho. 

With the one that came underneath Ortho, he would attempt to use the speed and momentum of his movement within the ground to catapult him upwards in a climb. Once the heighth of what the momentum would allow, he would transition to running up along the wall. That being said, upon getting within range, he would leap from the wall and try to punch Ortho.* - Fri Nov 13 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) didn't have but one method to deal with air-bourne opponents. I mean, how often did you encounter one that could stay up there for such a length of time? He surely had a mastery over the technique, Yan thought to himself as he formed another seal. With that being said,  another nine mud clones would form from the ground around him.

With that being said, they would all begin forming seals. At the end of each of their string of seals, six of them would perform the bamboo technique which would cause spears to protrude in the fashion that they did in six separate, yet visibly apparent positions throughout the area.

The five would complete their string of seals, and upon finishing the seals, they would slam their hands into the ground though their coordination would differ in timing. That being said, each set of spikes would fly up at different times and from different directions at Ortho--attempting to force him into running into one of the sets from having to expand his vision to dodge.

Meanwhile, the original Yan would blast through a quick set of seals, as chakra would well into his mouth and convert into a tan liquid. He would hold the technique as he prepared to unleash it last after he had dodged all the spikes as based on the current standard he would. AT that point, he would unleash his bind that would zip across the air and attempt to wrap around the Uchiha. * - Fri Nov 13 08:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) entered through ground via submarine as he he sored into the sky to cleanly dodge all the projectiles and simply shook his head. With that being said, he departed from the scene. If Ortho was going to keep running in the sky, he saw no point in continueing the fight.* - Fri Nov 13 08:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) entered the ground as he was soaring up in the sky. THat being said, he was moving at high speeds in an eastern direction and simply would not be caught by the ninja.* - Fri Nov 13 08:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would tank the first shadow clones, but he would be hit by the second. As a result, he dies.* - Fri Nov 13 09:16:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome(Enigmatic_Subsistence) 's features were mostly hidden by the veil of dark brown, almost black, hair that descended upon her form. Pale blue hues would peer through them, viewing the gathering of ninja not too far away. Her expression would be frightened and the aura which seeped from her form would be best described as meek and non-threatening.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched intensely from afar. She was frightened to say the least. Her phobic nature wouldn't allow her to mingle with others as most would, and as such, she strayed from groups and resorted to observing rather than participating. She would station herself underneath a tree, bringing her then form into a seated position upon the ground. Her movement was indicative that the gourd was rather encumbersome for her small frame.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome(Enigmatic_Subsistence) heard the dialogue of the group for the most part, as those soft blue eyes moved from one person to the other. She didn't know any of them, though those who called The Hidden Rain were people she was at the very least familiar with. As one confused the guitar for a back-scratcher of sorts, she couldn't but let out a slight yet quite audible giggle that would end her in her covering her mouth with both hands as though she had caused a serious offense.

In reaction, she pushed her feet into the ground and scooted her rear-end backwards, moving away from the group one push at a time as she thought to distance herself physically from the group would lessen the chance that attention would be diverted. While doing this, she didn't move her hands, as though preventing more noise  from lips she was afraid would move on their own.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome(Enigmatic_Subsistence) realized she hadn't been noticed, and even though the anxiety was still gripping her heart in an uneasy sensation, she was at least not pushed off the edge so-to-speak. Her eyes lessened in their intensity, and her lips trembled slightly as her small hands over her mouth. 

"Why am I so weird?" She thought to herself upon the realization that she was completely different from everyone else. While it was something she thought of everyday, perhaps every moment, it was still something that deeply impacted her. That being said, tears welled up in her eyes and she simply turned from them, laying on the ground sideways with her gourd laying beside her--still strapped to her back. She would cry silently to herself as she was lost in her self-hate connsumed thoughts.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome(Enigmatic_Subsistence) shut her lids tight, as though a dam to a river, though such was in vain as tears pushed from within. She wiped off what she could, and curled her knees to her chest as she wrapped an arm around her knees as the one that was beneath her would fold underneath her head as to provide something soft to lay upon. As she continued to cry, and dwell within her thoughts, the mental strain would soon cause her to grow tired and she'd fall into a slumber on the ground. If anyone touched her or her gourd, she would in all likliehood instantly wake up.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome(Enigmatic_Subsistence) eventually churned into conciousness, pale lids lifting to capture the sunlight that hit her instantly. A soft sigh was produced as her form craned to and fro amidst stretching limbs that had been curled into inanimation.

"..wah.." She yawned meekly, struggling to get up as she heaved the gourd upon her little back to where she would be able to sit up straight. As she did, legs would stretch and she felt the pleasant sensation enrich her senses as she once again yawned softly.

By then she'd realize she had fallen asleep, and looking around, she became more aware of her surroundings and instantly reverted to her frightened nature. Quickly gathering to her feet, she pushed the gourd against the tree she slept underneath; backing into it for protection as soft blue eyes looked around.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Oh...Okay./ - Sat Nov 14 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noticed some left, and she found some sort of obscure comfort from it, and so she lightened up a little and removed her hands from the tree which she gripped upon. She reached into her satchel eagerly only to rummage quite gingerly through it. It be a brief moment before she returned her hand to the exterior, though within it were a small sandwich. 

She would unwrap it and begin eating quietly; still forcibly pushing her gourd into the tree.
* - Sat Nov 14 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched the two men from afar as she nibbled on her sandwich. Since they weren't doing anything specifically, she'd take the opportunity to pass by them. She took one more bite from the sadwhich, chewing for an abnormal amount of time before swallowing it down, she would wrap it back up and slip it into her satchel as she proceeded to move towards the two men to get into the gate. As she neared, she was seemingly more cautious, although with her gourd--her movement was slow.
* - Sat Nov 14 05:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome(Enigmatic_Subsistence) trudged with the gourd hanging from her form. From an outsider's perspective, it was rather obvious that the girl found it a task to lug around the huge bohemoth of an accessory. Her shoulders were straightened, and her arms gripped upon the gourd straps that bound the large object to her back. She was hunched over, and it seemed a forced effort to make forward with each step. Nevertheless, her eyes were moving around rapidly as her full focus was where she was going and what was around her.

As she happened upon the man, she was looking away behind her, and as a result--she tripped over a rock. Her small frame fell forward, and so did the gourd, but once the weight was loss she turned and therefore the gourd slammed with a thud beside her as she hit the ground herself. She meeped in a pained manner, rolling onto her stomach half way to get her hands underneath her as she attempted to pull the gourd from the ground to begin her ascent once again to her feet.

Having said this, she was looking down, and hadn't noticed the man quite yet.* - Sat Nov 14 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome(Enigmatic_Subsistence) grunted in effort to push herself to her feet.  As she looked up, the man frightened her and she screamed aloud, as though bloody murder had occured. She'd then wail in fright and begin to run away, though of course, she could barely get into jogging speeds so again--she trudged at a quickened pace away as she continued crying.
* - Sat Nov 14 06:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome(Enigmatic_Subsistence) walked into the scene, her form strained as she tugged upon her small frame a gourd that was nearly her size. Her elbows were sticking out backwards, arms inagled to an acute angle as her small hands were tightly wrapped around the straps which were tight around her shoulders. 

As for her expression, it looked as though she was frightened or lost, although she had lived in the village her entire life. Her pale blue eyes shifted with apparent paranoia as it analyzed the surroundings to sift out any danger.* - Sat Nov 14 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome(Enigmatic_Subsistence) had noticed the woman, and as she began to run towards the young child, Otome's eyes widened as her pale blue eyes ignited with fear. While she was a genin, she was but an emotionally troubled girl whose inherit ability allowed her to slide through the system without properly being trained with the mentality of a ninja.

That being said, she'd turn and run, though the pace in which she moved couldn't be considered anything in comparison to what one would ordinarly expect of a genin. As the lightning ball slammed into her gourd, the electrical shock projected throughout her body and caused her to fly forward and hit the ground. Luckily, her gourd fell to the side so it didn't crush her small frame.

"Wahhh~!" She screamed in pain as the sensation from the lightning ball ripped through her form. Her hand would come up, and the cap from the gourd would pop out. Unlike her form, the sand moved at a faster pace and would attempt to encroach the entirety of the kunoichi's form in order to create a blanketed sheet of iron sand as another protective layer of her epidermis. That being said, even if the lightning was strong against her technique, it was her only means of protection. She'd attempt to get up and run more, obviously ill-equipped to handle the rogue.* - Sat Nov 14 07:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome(Enigmatic_Subsistence) looked back just in time to perceive the creation of lightning-based shadow clones. Their materialization was the last thing the young ninja wanted to see. After all, merely one foe induced fear which encompassed every nerve within her form that would burst with signals of fright and anxiety. 

She quickly pushed her hands forward, and with the cork now off the gourd, the iron sand would spill forward to intercept the two Bunshin. Because of her inability to form any other solid form other than the armor which she adorned, it would be as though a stream of iron sand that would attempt to encroach their throat and force iron sand into the bunshin's body to cause internal damage.

"Help..." She attempted to scream, but sheer fright had grasped her tongue and she could but whisper as the emotionally-broken girl could not control her own self.* - Sat Nov 14 07:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome(Enigmatic_Subsistence) couldn't possibly do anything against the speed which allowed the bandit to easily out-manuever the pace of Otome's sand, so when the lightning bunshin evaded her efforts, anxiety and anticipation drew her senses away from her attempt at departure and as a result she woudl trip over her own feet. Just then, the clone bursted.

Streaks of lightning, chaining with one another as it progressed through the iron sand and corased through her small, frail form. As a result, she shook without control and screamed loudly as the agony of the ninjutsu simply bypassed the iron sand and she was at the whim of the lightning-specialist completely.

As the restraints uprooted from the ground, sliding around her small stunned body--she would be stuck completely. By this time she was crying uncontrollably; screaming for someone to help her as she at this point would do anything to escape the pain. That being said, she was a phobic girl with deep trust and paranoia issues and this would only magnify an already socially disabling disease.* - Sat Nov 14 07:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome(Enigmatic_Subsistence) struggled with every fiber in her body. She was on her side, with the gourd on the ground beside her, and so her face was sideways and partially on the dirty ground below.  Otome would cry continually, tears flowing with no end as she shut her lids tightly--a habbit when afraid. Even though she closed her lids shut tightly, tears welled up and accumulated on the ground as it would mix with the dirt and smudge upon her cheek. She'd push into it, turning her face as though afraid to look as she heard the woman's word.* - Sat Nov 14 07:35:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome(Enigmatic_Subsistence) couldn't do anything with the punch to her face, and as Leera blodied it from the punch, she was knocked out completely. A small stream of blood leaked from his nose, carressing her lips before falling down her cheek onto the ground below where it would collect.* - Sat Nov 14 07:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome(Enigmatic_Subsistence) is inanimate, and completely unconcious, as she seemed to be repeatedly kicked. Her body would jerk with each force of momentum, wiht her head which whipped against the hard surface beneath them.* - Sat Nov 14 07:54:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) moved slightly. The road was rough, and as the caravan pushed through the safest portions of the desert to travel upon, Yan could feel the steady bump as wooden wheels clashed with rocks strewn upon the road. His lids opened, the sunlight which beamed through the thin animal-skin cover were captured for him to wince in protection.

"We're close!" The old man who directed the caravan would call out to Yan, and would wave in greeting as the guards would begin to approach for approval into the village. It wasn't long before the guards peered inside, and realizing who it was---they backed away as though they had seen a ghost.

"...Sorry guys," the familiar face was accompanied by a smile which was formed from pure joy of seeing faces in which he had grown familiar with. They were faces he never thought he would be able to see and talk to. Of course, things were different now. He was the man that stood for absolution in law in order to protect Sand.

They allowed him to get himself out of the caravan, and out of respect, they would allow him to walk towards the village gates without any form of restraint or arrest. Of course, by the time he made it to the gate--high ranking officials were present.

"Sorry, sir." The commander would say, though Yan would simply peer towards the path ahead of him into sand--moving his hands behind his back in order to be cuffed. "I'm just Yan now.." He corrected the man, and with that--he would head into the village accompanied by elite ninja who would kill him upon a wrong move..or so they were trained to.

It wouldn't be long, not even past the valley, before a visage appeared towards Yan to which his eyes instantly took a gaze to the other man to study his intention. "Yessir," he said simply. * - Sun Nov 15 08:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would evidently be uncuffed, and as a result, those guard which were stationed around him were beckoned away. "Yessir." He spoke, and as Yan spoke again, his voice continued in compliance of all that Hassan said. "Yessir," he'd say again. 

He wanted to tell Hassan what he felt. He felt alive....* - Sun Nov 15 08:23:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: ...? - Sun Nov 15 08:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) arrived upon the scene. HIs eyes moved onto Hassan, unsure if it was okay for him to be here at the moment. He nevertheless proceeded through the opening which walls of earth lined, and as it broke outward and expanded to form the boundary of the training grounds, Yan's bright green eyes would move around in observation to those who were present. His eyes noticed Mitsunara and he simply smiled.

"She has a real opponent now," he thought to himself as he thought it was Tetsumi against her and Mana. He'd remain to the side, with arms folded to his chest, where he'd lean against the rock wall as he observed the match. He had left to confirm his existence as a warrior, yet it made him also truly find the value in which he held his village's well being to.* - Sun Nov 15 08:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmmm - Sun Nov 15 08:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yan. We haven't sparred in a long ass time. - Sun Nov 15 08:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) tilted his head towards Lera, shooting a light exchange of dialogue as he lingered upon the spar before them.* - Sun Nov 15 08:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: I'm going to relax for a few days.I had a rough few days. - Sun Nov 15 08:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *Sigh* Darn alright. - Sun Nov 15 08:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: What about you pops? Feel like a quick one? - Sun Nov 15 08:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) hadn't really noticed the man, though firey green optics diverted from their fixated target as the man stumbled. Paying him no mind, his gaze returned on the battle in front of him. He wondered if Mitsunara still held onto his summoning scroll.* - Sun Nov 15 08:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: A spar? - Sun Nov 15 08:51:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: ...I'm assuming Jiki is holding back..Badly.. - Sun Nov 15 08:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) flicks eyes with interest as he peered towards Lera, and while he wanted to see the fight which Mitsunara was in, he found curiousity about Lera's progression rather captivating.* - Sun Nov 15 09:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: If I can just get one hand on him... - Sun Nov 15 09:12:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) folds his arms, yawning slightly as he pondered going home to go to bed.* - Sun Nov 15 09:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: . . .Must be nice to have someone that happy to see you. - Sun Nov 15 09:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) thinks: Jeez isn't Yan popular? - Sun Nov 15 09:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: THAT SON OF A BITCH! - Sun Nov 15 09:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: HE LET ME THINK HE WAS DEAD! - Sun Nov 15 09:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: MOTTHERRR FUCKKERRR. - Sun Nov 15 09:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was straight chillin, although such was untampered by the aura which would envelope him upon partaking in the herb which he so loved. When Mitsunara finally noticed him, his grin would grow and rub the back of his head as he gave off an innocent look.

Nevertheless, he understood the gravity of his actions yet he found more good than bad in what he had done. Yan had grown comfortable within the walls of Sunagakure since they had returned. The fear in which Zetsumo had struck--which Edge had placed upon all of Sand..He had forgotten what that truly symbolized to him. It was grander than them--it was the very world in which they lived.

None of these thoughts would show on his face. Instead, he nodded to Mitsunara as she finished her dialogue with one of the most unsightly comments he had heard from her mouth...Truth be told, he was more happy to see her than she was to see him in all likliehood. He was happy to see everyone.

"I think you have some unfinished business over there," he'd say as he beckoned her to place her attention upon the developing or transitioning spar as details were being discussed on a round 2. His eyes, from Mitsunara, would divert to Kiyoko where he would shoot her a similiarly drawn smile upon his lips.

"Hey," he'd speak cheerfully, his expression light and seemingly carefree. * - Sun Nov 15 09:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Grrr... You! - Sun Nov 15 09:35:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) simply nods to Mitsunara, glancing over Akira before going onto Kiyoko again as he awaited a response.* - Sun Nov 15 09:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Hmm.. The sand shield thing.. That's off of the table. Its not in my control. - Sun Nov 15 09:36:25 2015
