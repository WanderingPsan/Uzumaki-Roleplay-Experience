<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would descend into the ground at his own accord. After all, the air was a little thick with powerful ninjutsu. Utilizing the mole technique, both he and the clone behind the wall would descend into the earth. Meanwhile, the last clone would be rising out of the ground with a kunai in hand. Concentrating his chakra flow into the kunai, he would thrust it outward simultaneously as the bird flew in the opposite direction. 

He hoped that since the bird nor Trilliam was looking in his direction, the kunai would pierce the giant bird. Meanwhile, Yan could feel the shake of the earth as bombs descended upon 

him and were detonated. Yan pushed further in, and then towards the south. Meanwhile, his clone would appear topside of the surface outside of the corridor which was created--not visible to the earth clone of Trilliam yet visible to the boy himself.* - Wed Oct 14 02:14:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was underneath the ground, biding his time. Honestly, the way Trilliam was fighting, he was unleashing his full potential and therefore Yan found himself a bit taken aback by the sheer level of technique which the young man displayed. But alas, Yan hadn't become a chuunin to not be tested constantly by those around him.

Both clones would flee as the explosion in the middle projected rocks every which way. At this point, the scroll hadn't been dropped. While running away, they both thought just like Yan and so his first thoughts would be to utilize the rocks. After all, Yan used earth release three times more than he used water release, though both facets of his abilities were getting stronger. Nevertheless, both clones would weave seals in quick succession, and as both rolled forward away from the falling debris, they would slam their hand upon the ground.

Suddenly all the rocks stopped, and this was round about the time the scroll was being thrown and the birds summoned. "Shit," each one of the Yan's would say, on opposite sides of the field by this point. Immediately, the entirety of what was the rock corridor roared forward towards Trilliam and the birds which surrounded them.

He banked on the fact that from an aerial view, he couldn't dee descending or ascending motions as well as if he was eye-level view with the events unfolding, and so he wanted to catch Trilliam by surprise if he could. Either way, with the rocks slamming into the clay, he wanted to destroy them...and thought maybe their physical destruction would detonate the explosive. If it didn't, he would have more information on the nature of Trilliam's techniques.* - Wed Oct 14 03:10:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You begin. - Wed Oct 14 04:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was more defensive than otherwise, yet he would oblige in the Kazekage's demand. "Sir, wouldn't you like to get a bit further away from town?" He'd ask, after all, Yan's ninjutsu could get pretty spacious.* - Wed Oct 14 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Would you need the space? - Wed Oct 14 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'd prefer to fight in the training grounds. - Wed Oct 14 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: There are alot of civilians here. - Wed Oct 14 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: This is the baracks. - Wed Oct 14 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: There are hardly civilians here. - Wed Oct 14 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: But if you insist. - Wed Oct 14 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods as he would pivot and head towards the training grounds.* - Wed Oct 14 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) awaited positoning before he began. His usual stance was formed and his signal to commense battle would follow. Hands drawn together already, formed with curled fingers that inched towards the opposing set, converged to form a single T, thereby kneading the chakra within his form as he would thereafter project it from his core. 

From either side of Yan came plumes of smoke, their billowing structures dissipating revealing shadow clones from the veil. Yan would leap back and begin forming seals, while one clone formed a single seal and the other simply prepared their chakra. Both were ready to perform a technique, and Yan was soon behind. 

As all this occured, his vibrant green optics settled upon the visage that was his Kazekage. As chakra, white in hue, fumed from the senior ninja's form; Yan grinned slightly. There were not many ninja of Hassan's calbire, and Yan could only hope to stand against such a visage.* - Wed Oct 14 04:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence)  was prepared for the attack. That being said, each clone had their own trick. The one prepping their chakra formed three seals, and slam the ground. The other clone stomped the ground. Yan himself did neither, and instead, water shot from his gullet. THe water would follow the execution of the first two techniques. Yan waited for Hassan to perform his technique, and with the palm to the ground, pillars that were dulled from their normal spears would shoot up from the ground. Additionally, with the stomp, the earth around Hassan would rise up and encircle his top, creating a corridor whose only exit was in front of him. 

Thirdly, Yan would unleash a torrent of water that had a concentrated channel that lead straight to Hassan and the bullets he would be spewing. That being said, the condensed B-rank ninjutsu of the water release element would strike the B-ranked wind release element. Since Hassan was forming seals and preparing his own technique, he sought to trap Hassan where he stood so that he would be unable to do anything other than block with his hands. If this didn't work, it'd be onto the next. That being said, once it was all set and done, Yan would be preparing more seals again, and those shadow clones that were alongside him would have perished due to Yan's water technique.* - Wed Oct 14 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) formed a handseal, and as a result, a genjutsu had been cast. However, this wasn't one that needed eye triggering as it didn't bind nor change anything but visual perception. Simultaneously, his two clones on either side of him would begin performing seals with one lagging the other.


Suddenly Hassan would be, unless he was proficient enough to break the genjutsu before it began, surrounded by black crows. The first crow he would notice would fly at the hind of his periphial, and then suddenly, he would be surrounded about them.


In conjunction with this, Yan's clones would begin their combination. More pillars would rise as a result of one's technique, and at that point--the second clone would slam their hand.

Now those pillars, alongside the pillars he had created before and in addition to the rocks that were left over from Hassan breaking free would rise up from the ground and be sent hurdling towards Hassan in the air. He hoped the crows, or the process of breaking the genjutsu, would prove difficult enough that he would be unable to dodge the rocks.* - Wed Oct 14 05:22:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Look. You said Katsune and then said you're getting old. - Sat Oct 17 20:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Na. Not apologizing. - Sat Oct 17 20:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm not asking for an apology, just a reason. - Sat Oct 17 20:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Well, I told you the reason. - Sat Oct 17 20:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: That's the second time you made assumptions that I was talking to you and it ended up making you look foolish. - Sat Oct 17 20:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It's okay though. - Sat Oct 17 20:30:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Anyways...I'm off to train. - Sat Oct 17 20:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Later. - Sat Oct 17 20:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yo'. - Sun Oct 18 06:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Katsune, are you sleeping over there? - Sun Oct 18 06:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods and approaches her then. "Well, I'd like to know about the problem you have with me. I see there is an issue and I want to find it and eliminate it if I can." He'd say, stationing himself more adjacent to her location.* - Sun Oct 18 07:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Oh. - Sun Oct 18 07:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: ....Yeah, I wouldn't worry about it. Me and you are from completely different worlds. - Sun Oct 18 07:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Where I come from. . . - Sun Oct 18 07:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What I said to you would've been laughed off really fast. - Sun Oct 18 07:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Or I would've been stabbed. - Sun Oct 18 07:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And what would you prefer? - Sun Oct 18 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Honestly? I got used to that lifestyle. Adapted to it. - Sun Oct 18 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd love for you to try and stab me, just so I could spill your insides all over the place. - Sun Oct 18 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And the funny part about that? - Sun Oct 18 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't even dislike you. - Sun Oct 18 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ......I see. - Sun Oct 18 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: She's no Sand Shinobi. - Sun Oct 18 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) begins walking away. "Very well," Yan would continue to trudge through the thick-bodied hills of sand as he made his way towards the training ground.* - Sun Oct 18 07:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was approached by a guard whereupon the NPC would detail a ninja who stood at the entrance to the village. Yan would give him a nod and would follow him thereafter. * - Sun Oct 18 07:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would be seen approaching Kuro alongside one other guard. The very same guard he had approached, who left and instead allowed one guard to station the entrance while he alerted a higher-ranking ninja. That ninja was Yan.

Yan had bright yellow hair, ruffled yet controlled which swayed alongside the faint breeze. His eyes were bright green, accompanied by a benevolent smile. As he approached the gate, the guard who was with him would assume the original positoin he was in.

With that, he would speak to Kuro. "Hello! The name's Yan," he'd introduce himself as he gave the other a nod. "What's your business?" He'd inquire, further adding this to the dialogue after Kuro's own introduction. * - Sun Oct 18 07:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) replied with squinty eyes. He tired to remember the monk, yet his memory fell short of grasp and he simply shook his head. "I don't remember ya but I'm sure we've seen each other before. Kuro, huh? Here to see Reguel...."  Yan thought for a brief moment. "Alright, come on in." He pivoted to face the south, taking a step back as he created a pathway into the village. "If you cause problems, you are out..and that'd be best case sceanrio." He'd note as Kuro walked past him. If it wasn't Yan, he would have to answer to someone. The village was getting strong now; strong than he had imagined it ever being. They had to protect that, by all means necessary.* - Sun Oct 18 07:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: *cough* - Sun Oct 18 07:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah, sure. - Sun Oct 18 07:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: So, what is your goal? - Sun Oct 18 07:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) walks alongside him as he has a conversation with the monk.* - Sun Oct 18 07:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I wish to find a means to obtain peace. - Sun Oct 18 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: . . .I miss Zetsumo Konoha. - Sun Oct 18 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Doesn't everybody.~ - Sun Oct 18 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Well no..I shouldn't say that. - Sun Oct 18 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I am looking for the same thing. What have you learned from traveling? - Sun Oct 18 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I've learned that not everyone has the same mindset.  - Sun Oct 18 07:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's going to be a difficult thing to achieve, but I believe it's possible. - Sun Oct 18 07:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: ...Should I stop letting people know I'm a murderer who enjoys spilling guts? - Sun Oct 18 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: There are alot of evil people....The world is based around fighting and killing. I mean, as much as I want peace, I've killed and even vowed to kill certain men. Is it evil to kill?---In your opinion? - Sun Oct 18 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: omit - Sun Oct 18 07:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't believe in murder. All lives are valuable. I understand that people feel the need that they must kill, but my journey is to change the way people think. Too many people view themselves as tools, which is a reason why we fight for our lives. - Sun Oct 18 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Is murdering and killing the same thing? - Sun Oct 18 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So to answer your question, I don't believe it to be 'evil' as evil is a relative word. There's no good or evil, just those with an open mind and those who refuse to think in a new way. - Sun Oct 18 07:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Taking the life of an individual is all the same. I've yet to take a life, and I hope that I don't have to. I've been told that such a day will happen, but I really wish one won't arise. - Sun Oct 18 07:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I can't agree with you there. We both are looking for peace in the world though...I don't see it happening without certain people dying. - Sun Oct 18 07:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I am willing to die in order to achieve peace..But I'm not here to die  without a fight. You will find a man one day that cannot be changed, and is destined to be killed or continue killing. - Sun Oct 18 07:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You will realize at that point, this world can't be so innocent....It will never be so innocent. - Sun Oct 18 07:39:31 2015
