<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) reaches into his satchel, taking sight upon Trilliam as he licked the edge of the blunt to fix the wrap before he lit it to a firey cherry. From there he would pull on it and speak towards Trilliam. "Staying out of trouble in there?" He'd say. He felt bad that he hadn't really gotten to visit one of his students.* - Mon Nov  9 20:59:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) exhales the smoke, cracking his neck as he would pull on his blunt again. "Are you now? You better steer clear of trouble, then." He'd state, eyeing Leo.* - Mon Nov  9 21:01:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) pivots upon the swivel, casting bright green hues towards the kunoichi who had spoken to him. He hadn't noticed her, perhaps because of his smoking. "Not much, just taking a break from paper work. You wanna hit this?" He'd ask right before pulling on it again, afterwhich he held it out for her.* - Mon Nov  9 21:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Wow a party. - Mon Nov  9 21:05:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) returned the smile with a smirk, taking the blunt back. "Right..." He said in response to her first bit of dialouge, and as she spoke he took another drag and swallowed the smoke. "I got a little more paperwork (irl going back to work), and then we can..." He said, his voice distorted by the fact he was retaining the mass of smoke within his gullet, breathing outward heavily as the smoke came out in a large, steady stream that billowed into the sky. He'd offer another hit, as he intended to smoke the blunt down.

"I fought a kenjutsu the other day that I couldn't even see moving. It was crazy.." He said as he recollected the events which unfolded.* - Mon Nov  9 21:09:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If you have an issue, take it up with the Hokuma clan's Koji. - Mon Nov  9 21:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) frowns and laughs as she blows out the ring. "I could never figure out how to do that.." He said in a jokingly solemn way.

"Yeah....Hassan seems to think I should be his assistant and do alot of his paperwork. I guess we all serve in our own way," he noted. Ontop of that, it had a substantial salary increase which he enjoyed quite alot.

"Yeah...it was a task." Yan spoke in reference to the speedster, thereafter commenting on her. "Oh...? I'm sure you can beat me though." He followed this statement with a slight chuckle and a pull against his weed, though the nature of the statement seemed genuine.* - Mon Nov  9 21:13:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods to the first, and then the second. "No problem...I'll be sure to stop and get some supplies to good a good dinner then," he'd say in response to her last statement. By then the blunt which he was puffing on neared roach-status, though he would continue smoking it until it was a stinger.* - Mon Nov  9 21:18:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) settles into position beside Marco. He'd retrieve a blunt of weed and begin puffing on it as he awaited Marco's answer in regards to the Yan's interest in purchasing protective gear.* - Tue Nov 10 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: Don't get all beat up..you are suppose to spar me. - Tue Nov 10 05:53:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) simply nods and continues chiefings. As the man takes on the ominous transformation, the blunt was quickly put out and up within his satchel. He'd respect the boundaries of contest, yet his chakra was in a constant state of being prepared as he intended to be able to move at any given moment.* - Tue Nov 10 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) wanted to speak to Kiyoki, yet his attention was entirely on the fight ahead of him.* - Tue Nov 10 06:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) hears her, unless he wouldn't be able to, and looks back. "We might need you  in a moment," he spoke in a half-dazed manner, noticably high. If he had to, would he be able to stop the two before they really hurt themselves? 

It definitely seemed to be getting out of hand.* - Tue Nov 10 06:06:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Hmm.. Yan's going to do something? He has no idea... - Tue Nov 10 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) whispers: )He isn't that strong.) - Tue Nov 10 06:10:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: (Wanted to see his reaction) - Tue Nov 10 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) awaited those words for a second time, and figured it was about time to finish the bout.

Yan would begin forming seals quickly, each one kneading and molding the chakra of his technique into proper form. Once he was started, and the time it took to finish, it took less than a second to perform the seals that were needed.

At the end of the seals, chakra manifested within his gullet, converting chakra into water which therafter thickened and was projected from his mouth.

As the beast would turn towards her, and attempt to throw a punch, Yan would send the rope towards him which was created from both chakra and water release. The projectile moved approximately fifteen feet per second, and upon contact, would wrap around the beserking monster and bind him in place.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) narrows his eyes as Tetsumi and Yan both were bad motherfuckers and stopped the fight. "......" He was speechless, as he had never seen anything like that before. He simply looked towards Tetsumi, as though the more experienced shinobi may have a better grasp of what just occurred.* - Tue Nov 10 06:49:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) settles his eyes upon Mitsunara, mixed with a slight degree of concern but vigilance as well. She was seemingly clueless, and as far as Yan could see, it was a life or death situation. He couldn't fault her from his current perspective.

"No.....I haven't." He said as green hues diverted from her and back onto the ominous visage which was Aza.* - Tue Nov 10 06:54:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) stood up as Kiyoko lowered her form beside him; projecting the signature green aura that was created when utilizing the healing technique. It was a technique that was reinforced in his mind in this event. He'd turn to Mitsunara and head in her direction. 

As he approached her from behind, he put a hand on her shoulder. "How serious is the pain?" Yan would ask her, knealing down beside her depending on how lowered she was..* - Tue Nov 10 07:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Everyone else that was able to hurt me.. did it with some kinda trick, or technique... that was the first guy to just brute force it. - Tue Nov 10 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I gotta respect that, even if he did.. try to kill me. - Tue Nov 10 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) smiles, a cross between finding himself slightly humored that she was such a kunoichi and a means to comfort. In truth, had he been punched, he would have undoubtedly been put out of commission. It really put things into perspective and he was glad he was going under training to learn a new powerful technique. 

He simply shook his head. "Well, looks like we aren't sparring.." He chuckled afterwards, spinning and sitting beside her. At this rate, the situation was out of his hand and the right people were on it. "After everything is set and done, and you are checked out, you can come back to my house. I'm sure you'd like to sit on something softer than that ground." He'd note. Not to mention, they could smoke out. He enjoyed a good session.* - Tue Nov 10 07:10:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) reached into his satchel, rummaging briefly before his hand surfaced with a blunt in hand to smoke. He lit the blunt to a firey cherry, tugging on it as he did, before he attempted to hand her this. "Here you go," he'd announce his action.* - Tue Nov 10 07:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods in acknowledgement of her gratitude, turning his eyes upon Aza as she hit it, briefly diverting his eye to take sight upon the blunt as he mannd it between two fingers. He'd hit it slowly, and they would probably exchange it between the two of them from then until it was but a roach. "You ain't kiddin'," he'd reply. 

"You're pretty impressive," he noted, referencing towards her ability to stay alive in such an intense situation.* - Tue Nov 10 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: But the real question is- do I care? - Tue Nov 10 07:33:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) replies with widened eyes. "Oh, right---sorry." He said as he would help her out via a ginger grip and lift. As she came upon his feet, they would begin trudging through the sands carefully in route towards the hospital.* - Tue Nov 10 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: Oh, shit... - Tue Nov 10 08:05:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded and turned to go. Just then, a chuunin guard approached from the corner...Of course, Yan knew it was for and simple groaned as he was informed that a ninja was at the gate and was requesting entrance. "I'll be there in a minute," he'd state, telling the guard to hold him in place until Yan was able to make it over. "Let's go, MItsunara." He'd say, at which point they would head in the direction of the large medical building.* - Tue Nov 10 08:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Run me over, n' get to it soon as possible, yeah? - Tue Nov 10 08:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Work don't give a shit about personal matters. - Tue Nov 10 08:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) entered the hospital, pushing through the doors with the free arm. The other arm would be curled aorund her upper-body, resting on the upper-arm or shoulder of Mitsunara. The doctors would ask what was wrong, whereupon he'd brief them and they would soon put her into a room.

Once all settled in, he'd shake his head. "Well, at least you are good. Sorry about getting you high when I wasn't suppose ta'." He said with a laugh. "Do you need any company? I can come back after the gate situation, if you want. It's nothing either way." He'd continue on, pausing for her response.* - Tue Nov 10 08:19:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: For now, you don't need to be doing anything that would be considered hostile. - Tue Nov 10 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: She is smarter than Susumu so she will not do anything in public. I have allowed her to proceed to stay here under my eye... As long as she acts like a responsible member of the village I wont act.  - Tue Nov 10 16:52:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Just treat her normally... I just inform you to make you aware what she is capable of, you can nevertrust a necromancer. However if you choose to get close to this individual than thats at your own risk - Tue Nov 10 16:54:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) grinned as he watched the holy man toke on the bong. "Uh, at the local growth shops. They usually have a few glass bongs there for sale." He noted, grabbing it himself as he sucked on the tube with the fire light upon the marijuana.* - Tue Nov 10 16:59:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Uh, haven't we talked before? - Tue Nov 10 20:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) raises a brow at her.* - Tue Nov 10 20:59:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, I'm just as  guilty so we will call it even. - Tue Nov 10 21:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Nice to meet yah. - Tue Nov 10 21:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Are you a genin? - Tue Nov 10 21:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Yes. - Tue Nov 10 21:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) reaches into his satchel, brandishing a fresh blunt which he popped between his mouth. He wouldn't light it yet, though the intention was there as he fumbled for his zippo lighter.* - Tue Nov 10 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Cool, cool. - Tue Nov 10 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm planning on having some of the genin get together and spar me as a team. - Tue Nov 10 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You should come. - Tue Nov 10 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: When? - Tue Nov 10 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm nothing special, but I'd like to see you guys work on team work. - Tue Nov 10 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Sounds like fun. - Tue Nov 10 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I dunno'. When people are around. - Tue Nov 10 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: C'mon, Mana and I got it! - Tue Nov 10 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods, tilting his head as he cupped it with one hand to block the wind. He'd pivot slightly as well, blocking the wind as he flicked the lighter aflame. He would work it into a balanced cherry and tugged on it with an inhale.* - Tue Nov 10 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Hm, you two, huh? - Tue Nov 10 21:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) spoke as he removed the blunt, breathing inwardly as deep as possible before the air was spewed from parting lips. An expanded cloud would shoot until momentum was loss where it'd slowly dissipate only to leave the skunky aroma of the burning weed infiltrating the air ambient to him. "Sure, why not.." He'd say , coughing slightly as he put the cherry out between two fingers and placed it back into his satchel.* - Tue Nov 10 21:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: You down, Mana? - Tue Nov 10 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Otherwise I don't mind Solo'ing it. - Tue Nov 10 21:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: I've saw him fight... - Tue Nov 10 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Go ahead and solo. I'll watch and jump in if it looks like you need back up. - Tue Nov 10 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Eh, we can wait until you find a partner. - Tue Nov 10 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Like I said, it's an excercise. - Tue Nov 10 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Hmm. - Tue Nov 10 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Maybe Aza is around. - Tue Nov 10 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Ha! - Tue Nov 10 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Perhaps I could use a workout. - Tue Nov 10 21:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I don't think he will be sparring anyone until he works out his own personal issues. - Tue Nov 10 21:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Kurt.... - Tue Nov 10 21:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm pretty sure you don't need help beating little 'ole me! - Tue Nov 10 21:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) sweatdrop.* - Tue Nov 10 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: I spared him earlier. - Tue Nov 10 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: No, But he might need some help. - Tue Nov 10 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Who is Kurt? - Tue Nov 10 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: I'm Kurt. - Tue Nov 10 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: NIce to meet you, What is your name? - Tue Nov 10 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Hey, you two should spar. - Tue Nov 10 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Ivel. - Tue Nov 10 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: I don't remember sparring you. - Tue Nov 10 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You sparred me, not him. - Tue Nov 10 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Oh, not Kurt. I sparred Aza. - Tue Nov 10 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Ah, Alright. - Tue Nov 10 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Haha, that was confusing. - Tue Nov 10 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: How about it? - Tue Nov 10 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: I don't mind. - Tue Nov 10 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was pretty glad, as he intended to smoke the blunt to be frank. He'd retrieve it again, light it and proceed to enjoy it quite alot as he readied to follow them. He knew what Kurt was about, but he didn't know anything about Ivel from what he could remember.* - Tue Nov 10 21:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: I don't have much time but I'll give it a try. - Tue Nov 10 21:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Shall we do it in the arena? - Tue Nov 10 21:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Sure. - Tue Nov 10 21:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would follow, puffing on his weed all the while.* - Tue Nov 10 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: What shall be the rules on this spar? - Tue Nov 10 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: What is allowed and disallowed? - Tue Nov 10 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Let Yan decree. - Tue Nov 10 21:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: As long as you aren't killing one another or breaking bones intentionally, go at it. - Tue Nov 10 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: What about burns? - Tue Nov 10 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: As long as Kurt is okay with it, then sure. - Tue Nov 10 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Eh, We'll see. - Tue Nov 10 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Nah, it's either okay or not okay. - Tue Nov 10 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: I'm okay with it. - Tue Nov 10 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: You can go first. - Tue Nov 10 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) figured he'd only see part of the fight, and as Kurt dissapeared seemingly, he knew that Ivel was in for a treat. Yan would enjoy his blunt and hit it slowly. He'd also notice from his periphial that Mizora was standing nearby. He disregarded her for the most part and continued smoking.* - Tue Nov 10 21:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) leapt back as the flames sprouted omni directional from the spar. Ivel was trapping him in a small space, much like Kurt was into by Yan. That was pretty impressive, from Yan's perspective...It was hard to find a strategic ninja these days.* - Tue Nov 10 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: Ninja know no chill... - Tue Nov 10 21:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) folds his arms, toking the weed long and hard.* - Tue Nov 10 21:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) heads off, smoking the blunt as he departed. * - Tue Nov 10 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Make sure he gets medical attention, Ivel. - Tue Nov 10 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) approached the area, and as he came upon it, it'd be obvious a situation was unfolding. He'd approach, once again having forced to put out his blunt for the sake of attention.* - Tue Nov 10 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) glances towards Mitsunara through the veil of ninja, studying her for a moment. He seemed quite serious, so it'd be unsure of his intention.* - Tue Nov 10 21:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) approached the scene with blunt-in-hand. As he grew closer, he began hearing the screams and pandemonium ensuing in the distance. He dropped the blunt, with a hint of regret, before knees were bent and his form lifted off in an accelerated chakra-augmented leap towards the weapon's shop. Ae he looked on, the scene involving Aza, he simply shook his head. This would be the last situation in which Aza caused anyone trouble, and that was just how it had to be.

He also noticed Kiyoko, a girl which Yan could not deny having quite alot of interest in. His eyes narrowed, flaming with their vibrant green coloration, as he again progressed forward until his form was beside Mizora and Kiyoko. "What's going on?!" He'd ask, knealing down beside Kiyoko was he intended to see if she was okay. As far as Aza was concerned, the gank squad was there. Regardless, there would be a reckoning for this event..Yan didn't tolerate this sort of chaos.* - Tue Nov 10 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ....... - Tue Nov 10 22:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) places his hand on shoulder, turning as he looked towards Aza. "Look, it's over. Calm down." He said. He knew Tetsumi was the most capable ninja in this village. He wasn't worried about a situation when the jounin was around.* - Tue Nov 10 22:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: That.. transformation.. - Tue Nov 10 22:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Ambrocio...? - Tue Nov 10 22:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: N-No.. it can't be.. - Tue Nov 10 22:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Is it..? - Tue Nov 10 22:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ach shit.. - Tue Nov 10 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) looked up towards Mitsunara, unsure of what to say. He was definitely studying her demeanor and expressions. Afterwhich, he returned to Kiyoko's face. "Don't worrry..he's going to be fine." He said. Honestly, at this point, the vision of it was lost--he had no idea what was going to happen.* - Tue Nov 10 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yan, lift her off the sand. We'll need to clean out her wounds after this. - Tue Nov 10 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: Huh? Interesting thing to walk in on... - Tue Nov 10 22:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) simply nodded as one arm went around and wrapped under neath one arm and then the other. The other would attempt to hold onto Kiyoko's hand, at which point he would rise and as a consequence, elevate Kiyoko's form. "Can you stand at all?" He'd ask, his form retracted lower than hers as to more easily support her weight.* - Tue Nov 10 22:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) froze as she screamed in pain. "Tell me what you want me to do, my house is right there. Let me get you on my bed..." He suggested, though she probably wouldn't want to leave. If he was able to, he would gingerly scoop underneath her knee caps as he attempted to maintain her posture so she wasn't caused as much pain. If she said no, he'd simply hold her up until other instruction was given. 

This wasn't his field of knoweldge though he wanted to know more about it. * - Tue Nov 10 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ... Right, let's just.. - Tue Nov 10 23:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Take her to a doctor, yeah Yan? - Tue Nov 10 23:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Yo, dude. You know anything about medical stuff? Cus I don't.. - Tue Nov 10 23:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yeah.. I do. - Tue Nov 10 23:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Cool.. - Tue Nov 10 23:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) conviently dissapears.* - Tue Nov 10 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) thinks: He must have lost it agian - Tue Nov 10 23:56:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peered towards Ortho and simply nods. He didn't truly trust the man, yet he'd prefer to be within supervision if anything happened. That being said, he beckoned them. "Everyone is welcome to come..." He'd say as he headed towards his home. Once they entered, all you would smell is dank.* - Wed Nov 11 00:05:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noticed the guards, beckoning them to bring Yuudai before him. By this point, he had rolled the joint and as a result he sparked it and took a long drag. "So...Yuudai is it?" He said as he looked at the bingo book before him, which he had on person at all time.* - Wed Nov 11 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) scans the boy, his firey green hues switching up and down. "What made you leave?" He'd ask, observing for an answer.* - Wed Nov 11 00:23:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods and shares the blunt for the duration of the conversation with her, glancing towards the rogue.* - Wed Nov 11 00:26:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You joined our academy, recieved our training free of charge, and then you up and leave as though you have no obligation to serve this village...The people who invested in you. - Wed Nov 11 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: How does that sound to you? - Wed Nov 11 00:28:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would pivot upon his pillow, nodding to the guards as they formed a more solid grasp upon the boy. Grabbing both his arms and shoulders, they would try to keep him completely unable to get away. Meanwhile, Yan would form a seal whereupon he expelled his chakra in order to cast the interrogation technique.

From there, since he was still learning the complexities of the techniques, he would question him and beckon honest answers. With mastery came the ability to delve into their very mind, a concept Yan had yet to acquire.* - Wed Nov 11 00:31:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: At first, I was in Kumogakure, the place was isolated, considering the village itself was pretty much destroyed. So I chilled by the ocean. But then, I made my way into the forest of Konohagakure. - Wed Nov 11 00:34:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Blue cloths, white hair, a rather large blade on her back, had bandages. - Wed Nov 11 00:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Where were her bandages? - Wed Nov 11 00:40:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Hidden Mist, and a Water Clone Jutsu. - Wed Nov 11 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: From Mist, obviously. Uses a bandaged sword.... - Wed Nov 11 00:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Tell me how thick the blade of the sword was. Was it thick, almost round in nature? - Wed Nov 11 00:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: My memory isn't the greatest. I can't remember, sir. - Wed Nov 11 00:42:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Lastly, do you have any intentions in coming into this village other than to serve it? - Wed Nov 11 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Just to see one of my friend. - Wed Nov 11 00:43:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: If he resists, Yan, I got it. Yeah? - Wed Nov 11 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Your ribs are broken...no such thing will happen. - Wed Nov 11 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Eh. It's minor as fuck. - Wed Nov 11 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) releases the genjutsu and stands.* - Wed Nov 11 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Take him in cell 3B. - Wed Nov 11 00:49:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) walked in just then. He looked towards the ninja, and then to Mitsunara. Up until now, he hadn't heard anything. "Do I know you?" He'd question, eyeing the mohawk-wielding ninja.* - Wed Nov 11 01:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jay(Serori2) says: Are you really still hung up on that? I didn't even remember that still.  - Wed Nov 11 01:09:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: If he drops bath salts and attacks me, I'm not even calling the cops, I'm just ending him man. - Wed Nov 11 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..... - Wed Nov 11 01:10:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jay(Serori2) says: Ehh? Please don't throw me out... - Wed Nov 11 01:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) pushes past him, gesturing him to hit the door via the bucking of his neck towards the door. "If you don't, it won't edn well for you." He'd note as he took a seat upon one of the pillows.* - Wed Nov 11 01:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jay(Serori2) says: I have no where else to go. - Wed Nov 11 01:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Go do missions, make money then get somewhere to stay. - Wed Nov 11 01:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Simple as that. - Wed Nov 11 01:12:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: WRRRRRRRRRRRRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!  - Wed Nov 11 01:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was about to give in and allow him to stay. You see, Yan had a heart. It didn't extend to criminals or enemies, yet he loved his village dearly and would help anyone he could. Nevertheless, this was opposite of what he wanted.

Just then, a knock was heard on the door, whereupon Yan would answer it.

"Lord Hassan requires you at the jail." The guard said, leading Yan to frown in the most discontent way he possibly could. He'd turn around and grab Jay by the shoulder. "If you resist, you are going down buddy." He'd say, pulling him out. "Mitsunara, you can come if you want.." He'd say. As they came outside, Yan would thrust his arm forward, which would send Jay towards the ground away from his home.

"Regardless of your situation, you broke into my house and tresspassed. If you do not leave, I will press charges." He noted before heading off with the guards. He'd form a seal and have a shadow clone remain at his house to protect his sacred weed.* - Wed Nov 11 01:15:31 2015
