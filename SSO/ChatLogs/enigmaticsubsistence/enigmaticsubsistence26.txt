<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) stood there watching the fight s it unfolded. He had little doubt Paine would win yet he was nevertheless interested in seeing her fight. By all accounts, she was much stronger than Yan. In fact, he was sure that she would defeat him in one punch if they were in a real fight...Though not many could say they were able to lay a hand upon Yan. In fact, no one in this village had in a actual sparring situation. He would practice the technique he was learning and as a result, he'd be focusing his chakra and forming a single seal. While it did not succeed, he would be ready to try again.(6)

would attempt to form the technique again. Meanwhile, he'd close his eyes and detach his focus away from the material world and everything occuring around him. He would attempt to quiet his mind and visualize both his chakra and the form in which was suggested to him. At first, within his mind, the chakra resembled a ball floating in the abyss of his mind. It would soon after begin molding into a different form, a rock...AT which point Yan formed the snake seal. Upon doing the seal, the form would take the form of his hand--at which point a brownish tinge surfaced upon his skin and chakra was spread over it. Nevertheless, it wasn't successful.(7)

felt he was making progress. After all, since there was hardening upon his finger, it meant that he had applied the right manipulation of chakra and that the very essence of the technique was acquired within the scope of its function. Nevertheless, it would be ineffective in battle and so he couldn't really say he knew it either way. That being said, he would do the very same deed and visualize the rock within his mind. Simultanously, he would manpulate his chakra as though it would form that rock. Finally, he formed the snake seal. (8)

was seemingly unphased by his inability to perform the technique. Based on her description of the technique, and what it would do--it seemed like an ability which required much work and time before one would be able to utilize it effectively in battle. That being said, he cleared his mind of thoughts which distracted him from the task and simply honed in on his chakra. Again, through visualization, he pictured a durable stone within his mind.  AS he did this, he would push his hands together and attempt to perform the technique again although nothing would occur.(9)* - Wed Nov 11 22:21:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded to the challenge, and the announcement that they were ready. Yan didn't have much time to ready him self beyond what he was by nature as they seemed to begin their approach. It was rather obvious as they manuevered what their game was, and in result a bright smile would be shone upon his face.

formed several handseals. Within less than a second he was finished, and when he was, they would be flanked. A seemingly identical figure to Yan would lunge toward them from behind--just at the corner of their periphial vision. It would attempt to attack Hiroshi via a kunai slash towards his right shoulder blade.
* - Thu Nov 12 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was surprised to say the least. Instead of instinctively protect something that she might have interest in, she went towards the source. Or rather, she just completely disregarded what would be many clones around them. As a result, her blade would indeed slam into his gut. However, during that time he had regained composure with the thought that his armor would protect him.

As it slammed into his gut, a loud thud was heard. Despite that, nothing else would occur other than something which was in preparation and would be launched a blink of an eye after it hit. Mud would generate with encumbering mass and at approximately fifteen feet per second. Just before it's creation, Yan's form would pivot as well in the direction which the boy moved, his last minute reflexs adequately trained to do so. That being said, both of them would probably be caught within it unless they were able to somehow evade it. 

* - Thu Nov 12 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) now really could justify in his mind dropping such a large amount of money for armor. He looked like a total badass, unfortunately it seemed to have upset them. "Well, sorry." He'd reply though it was more of a teasing, should-have-dodged sort of thing. 

In Yan's mind, it shouldn't have even happened. Then again, they were not Yan and Yan was simply a different ninja than most. Upon the creation of the wall of wind, which roared forwards for Yan's defeat, Yan would realize that the team had been broken and Hiroshi was acting soley upon his own skill. Within a moment, Yan was gone. Perhaps the field of vision that was made by the slightly visible winds would cause Hiroshi not to be aware at first.

Either way, underneath the ground, he moved very quickly, and much quicker than the boy was accustomed to moving.  Utilizing a ninjutsu, he would be able to traverse underneath the earth and position himself beneath the boy. Assuming he moved faster than the ninjutsu, his position would still be in front of the wall of wind. 

Suddenly arms would shoot from the ground, where Yan would lurch from beneath the sand, grabbing onto the ninja's ankles as he pulled him inward. He would do so until the head of the boy was all that was exposed, at which point Yan would surface on the other side of Hiroshi away from Mitsunara. However, if there was any sign other than the body's complete compliance--as in no intention of pulling Yan from the ground--he would release him and surface several feet away from Hiroshi and Mitsunara.* - Thu Nov 12 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) felt rather accomplished. He wasn't sure what sort of friendship him and Mitsunara had, yet he did know that he wanted to impress her. So far, so good--or at least Yan thought. Yan would sprout from the ground unhindered, whereupon he'd notice Mitsunara mount an offensive. The weapon in which she utilized was huge and long, something he couldn't fathom wielding himself.

The sword was extended, wherein the intention was to attack a weak-point in what was otherwise very useful armor. Nevertheless, due to Yan's ninjutsu specialist posture, his arms would be in such a position to bring his hands close to one another so that the efficienty of transitioning from stand by to forming seals would be seamless and fluid. That being said, instead of hitting his arm pit, she would instead jam the sword into his arm.

Nevertheless, it would break his stature seemingly and cause him to pedal backwards to regain posture. As he did, he would fumble to push his hands together, attempting to form a seal. "Ouch!" He would form the sound out of humor, and not so much damage induced. It was nice being able to take a hit and not be out of commission as a result.* - Thu Nov 12 07:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ..You utter troll. - Thu Nov 12 07:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: -- I SAID GET OUT, NOT GO DEEPR! - Thu Nov 12 07:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: GODAMN MOLE PEOPLE. - Thu Nov 12 07:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was in position to release his technique. Needless to say, the armor had served to protect him quite well and composing his chakra in the midst of this assault would take little effort as he had become quite attuned to his own energies. Nevertheless, he didn't activate the technique...Instead, he braced for the attack.

Yan's eyes would widen, the firey green hue captured by sheer surprise as Yuudai's form would appear before him and behind Mitsunara--as though standing above her. That being said, at this point, he would be at the whim of attack as he was truly startled. The blade would slam into his shoulder blade--grinding into the armor.

Underneath the momentum of the blade, and the protective armor which he brandished in this battle, an echo of pain could be felt within his shoulder (Light Damage). Nevertheless, it was minute in comparison to anything that would put him out of commission. After taking the brunt of the force upon his shoulder, his hands struggled to remain as they were though they did.

Yan then released his technique, which was a simple and insignificant D rank technique. The water would spew his mouth and shoot towards her at point-blank range. The speed of the attack was utilized to its fullest, yet the damage would simply force her back. If damage was induced as a result, it would only mean that he was taking her slightly more seriously. Nevertheless, with that being said, he didn't know how his attack would factor into the other ninja.

Just then,Yan noticed the boy dissapear. Of course, he had dug downward, and as a result he was freed from the containment. Yan would immediately recognize this as in all probability that it was as a result of earth release ninjutsu. After all, it was the only method he had seen thus far and had three separate techniques which involved allowing him to delve into the terrain around him. That being said, the realization would cause vigilance to impact his awareness even more now.

Just then he appeared slightly to the north, about four or so feet from Yan. Yan would attempt to react, though he couldn't dodge. As the attack hit home, landing into his side which he defined as the side of his adomen, Yan would be sent hurdling to the side due to the momentum and potency. Nevertheless, the armor took most of the force though Yan was simply not sturdy enough to take a momentum that wasn't pushing down.

Yan would roll to his feet, quickly forming seals to prepare his next attack. He wasn't use to being on the run, and so, he would soon put them on the run. Regardless of what happened here, there was a certain fire in Yan's eyes as he was being challenged on a higher level than he was accustomed to. Yet, he wasn't using his normal strategies either.* - Thu Nov 12 07:38:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) leapt into the air. With the visual information processed that the blade was indeed chasing him, he was quite surprised. He had thought that the ninjutsu which landed point-blank upon the kunoichi would at least allow him to regain posture partially before being attacked by her again. On top of that, it was probable without even percieving it that Hiroshi would be following up as well.

In addition to Yan leaping air-bourne, his handseal speed was perhaps one of the best in the village. That being said, he would be done with his seals in good timing for him to rise up into the air over the sword. Yan would expell his chakra,  and as a result, two clones would form adjacent to his form in the air. 

Yan would immediately reach out towards both clones, grabbing onto their parts of their body as the clones would form seals.  As a result of their techniques being executed, two jets of water would project from their mouths. Due to their elemental alignment, the water release techniques would carry the full weight of Yan's own water release ninjutsu. Additionally, because of the power, they would be propelled not so much upwards but definitely backwards as they descended--bringing Yan to ultimately land further away than he had originally been within the trajectory to land. 

Each clone aimed at a different ninja.* - Thu Nov 12 07:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) Additionally, because of the power, they would be propelled not so much upwards but definitely backwards as they descended--bringing Yan to ultimately land further away than he had originally been within the trajectory to land. Instead of hitting the sandy surface, he would intead transition his form using his clones to land against the wall feet-first to land cleanly alongside his bunshin.

"Up here!" He'd announce, sticking his tongue out at Mitsunara specifically.* - Thu Nov 12 08:01:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) smirked at Mitsunara as she displayed what was quite an attractive physique. Nevertheless, the man was about his business, and while he was amidst sparring--he wasn't going to pay that much attention to it. As she commanded the boy to move, and he did, Yan's clone would quickly know what to do though they hadn't ever done it before.

That being said, he would swiftly go through a set of handseals, and upon finishing them--the clone would spit out a thick tan substance from his gullet. Due to gravity, and the fact that they were standing on a vertical wall, the substance would fly straight downwards towards the ninja who was approaching them. Meanwhile, Yan was forming several seals as well in preparation. Lastly, the other clone who was on the opposite side simply remained ready.

If the attack hit his opponent, it wouldn't cause any damage. Instead, it would pour onto him like a bug caught in a thick substance. He would be forced to a stop, and even more, be completely taken by the substance as it would stick to him and weigh him down. It would eventually cause him to be captured in it on the ground--seemingly unable to get out. * - Thu Nov 12 08:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) begins laughing wildly as he ceased forming seals. "Aw..." He'd bend his knees, concentrating more chakra into his foot as he pushed off of it. He'd leap off, performing a twist as he landed on the other side of Mitsunara and Hiroshi. 

"I'm done, anyway..." 

He'd say. Conviently enough, Yan would perform a seal which would extinguish the starch and make it seep into the sand and otherwise dissipate.* - Thu Nov 12 08:26:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Impressive battle. - Thu Nov 12 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: I hadn't expected you to be able to win in a two versus one. - Thu Nov 12 08:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Heh... - Thu Nov 12 08:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: He knows I can't chase him up there. - Thu Nov 12 08:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yan, you gotta teach me Suimen sometime. - Thu Nov 12 08:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Uh, well, I definitely got lucky.. - Thu Nov 12 08:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Anyways, later guys. I'm about to smoke out til I pass out. - Thu Nov 12 08:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: By sir~ - Thu Nov 12 08:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) presents them with the peace sign before he trudged through the sand towards his home. (grab lag killin me)* - Thu Nov 12 08:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods and begins pulling off his armor. He'd leave his jounin out fit on, but everything else would be off of him. With that done, he put it at the corner of the room and he made his way to the kitchen. "Are you hungry?" He'd call out loud, enough to where the sound of him speaking would reach her within the bathroom.


At this point he was getting out some different supplies to cook something for them to eat.* - Thu Nov 12 08:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would begin chopping up meat and veggies, sauteeing them in a pan with numerous seasonings and other things. He would cook the meat first of course, and once it was more or less complete, he would add in the vegetables to finish it off.

As he did, he spoke: "It was busy. Some ninja attempted to attack the village and was killed. I had to schedule guardsman strategy classes that the guard will have to take at least once a week. That being said, I had to sign off on alot of money being spent to do that." He'd note, stirring the vegetables. "Other than that, the usual, paper work..meetings with the Kazekage and other officials." He noted, washing his hands in the sink as he returned the question.

"How about yours?"* - Thu Nov 12 08:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) sighs, looking towards her. He hadn't forgotten. "Don't use that sort of stuff on me again," he'd say firmly as he turns off the stove, the food now cooked. He'd get out some plates and serve the food onto the plates. Other than the statement, he would seem care-free and friendly and would sit her foot down, and his food right beside her.* - Thu Nov 12 08:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) had put her food beside his own, which would mean he'd had suggested she sit beside him. As she didn't, he simply pushed the food towards where she was sitting currently. He had more thoughts on the subject, yet he wouldn't breech them in the subject. "It's no problem..I've enjoyed your company." He commented, exacting a piece of meat and broccoli in between his sticks as he'd then eat them.* - Thu Nov 12 08:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded, finishing up his plate as he did. "I haven't had anyone around on a normal basis since my brother was killed..so...it's nice to have people around in my house." He spoke. Koji and him never saw each other, and Koji was never here--it was pretty much Yan's house completely. 

Yan could have ate another plate, yet he was trying to become more physically fit and more disciplined in how he took care of his body. He felt some slight pain in his shoulder, and as a result, he would place his hand there and rub it gently. "That was good," he noted, tilting to the side away from Mitsunara as he rubbed into it gently.

"So, I was thikning, maybe you could roll a few up while I take a shower. I assume you already did when you changed clothes," he said as he looked towards her.* - Thu Nov 12 09:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: I need to practice that sword expansion technique.. shit is draining, I need to get a hang of making that particular soul my bitch. - Thu Nov 12 09:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) smiled. "Thanks," he'd say as he headed into the bathroom. He'd take a quick shower, washing up his body before rinsing off. Within fifteen or so minutes, Yan re-emerged from his room with the normal shorts that he wore. Other than that, he was ungarbed. He'd take a seat at the nearest pillow...quite ready to smoke.* - Thu Nov 12 09:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Spark it up... - Thu Nov 12 09:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm glad I took the shower, I feel great now... - Thu Nov 12 09:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm.... Aight... - Thu Nov 12 09:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) sits on the bench.* - Thu Nov 12 16:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: What do you want? - Thu Nov 12 16:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm just sitting on this bench. - Thu Nov 12 16:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Sit somewhere else. - Thu Nov 12 16:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) rubs the back of his head, peering towards the woman.* - Thu Nov 12 16:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would stand up. Afterall, he had some things to take care of. "Tetsumi..do you know where Aza lives?" He'd as the jounin ninja as he casted green eyes in his direction.* - Thu Nov 12 16:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Tch . . . . - Thu Nov 12 16:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: Why is everyone being an ass today? - Thu Nov 12 16:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) shook his head disapprovingly and simpy headed into the direction which he had seen the ninja depart.* - Thu Nov 12 16:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded politely to Mirai on his way out.* - Thu Nov 12 16:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Uh, me? - Thu Nov 12 16:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) smiles brightly towards Mirai whereupon he'd give her a nod. "Sure, let me just talk to Aza here for a moment." He'd say whereupon he would continue on until he was by Aza--at which point he'd take a seat beside him. 

"Hello Aza," he greeted the unstable ninja.* - Thu Nov 12 16:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) leaned forward in reply, exchanging words of low decibel between he two.* - Thu Nov 12 16:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: I'm going to fucking kill you - Thu Nov 12 16:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: <omit> - Thu Nov 12 16:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Lord Hassan, our Kazekage, has tasked me with helping you. I want to help you, because I don't want anyone else to get hurt and I want you to be a successful ninja in our village. That being said, sometime today and everyday for the unforseeable future we will be training in private. - Thu Nov 12 16:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) whispers: . . .Is that a smart idea? - Thu Nov 12 16:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: What do you mean? - Thu Nov 12 16:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: Why the fuck does everyone keep trying to help me. . .just leave me completely alone and there wouldn't be an issue. . . - Thu Nov 12 16:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) whispers: I mean you banned me from sparring for a reason didn't you? - Thu Nov 12 16:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Because I can't control who you fight. If you are fighting me, I am sure we won't have many injuries as I am an experienced ninja. At any rate, when you are ready to spar, come find me. You are required to do it sometime today though. - Thu Nov 12 16:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Any questions? - Thu Nov 12 16:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) whispers: No. . . - Thu Nov 12 16:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) pats Aza on the back, standing thereafter. He would then look to Mirai and head over to her, folding his arms to his chest as he awaited conversation.* - Thu Nov 12 16:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: What's up? - Thu Nov 12 16:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: Oh. . I don't mean to be a bother. I've merely been seeking assistance in my medical advancements. - Thu Nov 12 16:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: I believe I've seen you perform the art? - Thu Nov 12 16:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: I'm not a medical ninja though.... - Thu Nov 12 16:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: I've asked. There has been no help. - Thu Nov 12 16:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Nope sorry, but I am interested in learning some baisc healing techniques to help when needed. - Thu Nov 12 16:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Try Kiyoko, she is a good woman who would be happy to help you. In fact, mention I sent you. - Thu Nov 12 16:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: Zenaki is impossible to find. Kiyoko seems to spend all of her time with the gentlemen you've spoken -- Do you have any tips? - Thu Nov 12 16:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: Not to mention. . .With her recent injury, that may be difficult. - Thu Nov 12 16:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: I don't know! Heh, sorry. I'm just a simple elementalist. - Thu Nov 12 16:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: Ah, no need to apologize then. Do you have any other suggestions? - Thu Nov 12 16:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Those are the only two I know of. Bryson's techniques aren't your average medical shinobi's techniues. - Thu Nov 12 16:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: Ahhh. . Unfortunate. At the current rate, looks like I'll be stuck to independent efforts. - Thu Nov 12 16:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: I'll talk to Kiyoko and let her know you are interested. We have to foster desires to grow stronger and learn new things in our village. Expect her to approach you soon on the subject. - Thu Nov 12 16:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: I don't want to be a bother! If she's injured and pre-occupied. - Thu Nov 12 16:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: We'll work it out. What's your name again? I don't remember if we've met or not. - Thu Nov 12 16:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: Mirai. - Thu Nov 12 16:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Nice to meet you, Mirai. I am Yan...not sure if you know my name but there it is. - Thu Nov 12 16:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: I did. - Thu Nov 12 16:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Now...I just remembered Mitsunara rolled me a bunch of joints. I think I'm going to go partake in one. - Thu Nov 12 16:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) whispers: Nice to meet you as well. - Thu Nov 12 16:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Mhm. - Thu Nov 12 16:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) heads off, but rather, just goes AFK.* - Thu Nov 12 16:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yo'! What's up, Chikyu? - Thu Nov 12 17:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Nothing much really. - Thu Nov 12 17:15:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Mirai, you should come too. - Thu Nov 12 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: A party. .? - Thu Nov 12 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Oh right, The party. - Thu Nov 12 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah, you're over 15 right? - Thu Nov 12 17:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Yes. Mmm, why does that matter, however? Drinks? - Thu Nov 12 17:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: Party? - Thu Nov 12 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And weed... - Thu Nov 12 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I don't smoke. What's the occasion? - Thu Nov 12 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It's just not the place for an underaged ninja. - Thu Nov 12 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Just getting everyone around each other on friendly terms and having a good time. IT'll be at my place. - Thu Nov 12 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Then, stop inviting me. I'm not fifteen. - Thu Nov 12 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: North-east residential district, bottom-right house. - Thu Nov 12 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: She does appear to be. . . A tad young. - Thu Nov 12 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I didn't know, sorry. - Thu Nov 12 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Its all good. Hahaha! - Thu Nov 12 17:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I suppose. I'll consider it. . .I should be able to make it, assuming things don't come up. - Thu Nov 12 17:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Good. - Thu Nov 12 17:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Thu Nov 12 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Aza, are you about ready to hit the gridiron? - Thu Nov 12 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: If we have to. - Thu Nov 12 17:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: We do. - Thu Nov 12 17:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Gridiron. . ? - Thu Nov 12 17:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Maybe we should wait for Kiyoko though. - Thu Nov 12 17:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Or Bryson... - Thu Nov 12 17:27:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Why do ya say that? - Thu Nov 12 17:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Ask Kiyoko when you see her. - Thu Nov 12 17:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm asking you, pal. - Thu Nov 12 17:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, I'd refrain from it. - Thu Nov 12 17:29:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...Hm, I'll talk to him. - Thu Nov 12 17:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peers towards the voluptuous woman.

"Yo'...I haven't met you yet. The Name's Yan." He'd say as he turned towards her and gave her a bright smile and a polite nod in greeting.* - Thu Nov 12 17:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) got hard watching her jiggle.

"Uh! Nice to meet you...Anyways, I gotta go train with this guy over here--so I gotta go. Just thought I'd...introduce myself." He let out a cheesey, almost uncomfortable grin as he turned and headed towards Aza. "Let's go," he stated, beckoning him with a hand.* - Thu Nov 12 17:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: - - Thu Nov 12 17:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: Does the girl have a death wish? - Thu Nov 12 17:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: So many cute guys here... im always so tempted - Thu Nov 12 17:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peers back towards Rias with a bright smile upon his face. "Uh, unfortunately not. Maybe another time." He'd say with his cheeky grin, turning back to Aza he simply gestured him to walk with him. "Let's make our way towards our own training grounds," he'd say.* - Thu Nov 12 17:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Let her watch Yan. . .she obviously doesn't know. - Thu Nov 12 17:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: The more people who learn, and stay away from me, the better. - Thu Nov 12 17:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: C'mon Aza. You can show off your muscles some other time. - Thu Nov 12 17:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Thu Nov 12 17:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I'm trying to keep people away. I could care less about my 'muscles'. - Thu Nov 12 17:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was making light of the comment. He understood what he meant. THat being said, he gave the man an impatient expression.* - Thu Nov 12 18:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Fine, whatever. - Thu Nov 12 18:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) hands the guards permission papers for exitting the village.* - Thu Nov 12 18:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) trudged through the sands of The Land of Wind's desert. Each step sunk into the thick blanket of granules, encroaching the area between his sandals as he could feel the grinding of sand against his foot and the shoe. While this was annoying, such a commonplace created callous upon the bottom of his feet which more or less numbed the feeling to something insignificant.

They would eventually arrive upon the area in which Yan designated as the safe zone, whereupon he'd spin around and face towards Aza.

"So, tell me about yourself." He'd say, bringing his hands together as he formed several seals. At the end of the last seal, Yan would spit out water to one place, and the next--both forming up into a humanoid structure that in completion would be identical to Yan.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Have you had any desires to kill someone within this village? I'm asking for the truth, because once I feel like I can't trust you, I have other ways of getting information out. - Thu Nov 12 18:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Hm. - Thu Nov 12 18:10:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: and I appreciate that. - Thu Nov 12 18:12:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) searched for ways to spike the man's anger. "Where is your family? You didn't kill them too, did you?" He asked.* - Thu Nov 12 18:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...You actually did.... - Thu Nov 12 18:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Your mother....your father.... - Thu Nov 12 18:19:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You monster.... - Thu Nov 12 18:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) 's normal smile had deformed into a frown of discontentment. His heart tightened, feeling convicted for the words which he spewed. Yet they were necessary, as the village was his main priority over his own innocence as well as Aza's life. 

That being said, as the man began taking on his ominous transformation, Yan would be forming seals in quick succession. Before the hand would arrive, Yan would have dissapeared beneath the sands of the desert. Meanwhile, both clones simply watched as their creation was simply a contingent plan if he was unable to tame the brute himself.

Within a split second, hands would extend from the ground beneath Aza. Yan would attempt to grab his legs, and with the monster's rampaging-esque behavior, he hoped to catch him off guard and effectively pull him into the ground so that his neck was the only thing allowed above the surface.  If there was any sort of struggle, he would quickly retract his arms.

Either way, after the attempt was made in failure or success, Yan would pop out of the ground not too far away.* - Thu Nov 12 18:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) looked upon the restrained monster with. "Calm yourself, you are stuck." Yan would say as he folded his arms to his chest.* - Thu Nov 12 18:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Is this the extent of your will to not turn into that monster? - Thu Nov 12 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: .... - Thu Nov 12 18:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) didn't show his emotion, as he simply continued. "You need to gain control of this, and so we will keep training everyday until you do...But I think you need to take a break. Yan would take a few steps forward, channeling his chakra into the ground. The ground around Aza would be soft and easily manuevered in. "Dig your way out," he'd say, as the pressure would be quite different now that the sand and terrain around him would morph.* - Thu Nov 12 19:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Because you need to remember everyday what caused you to kill your mother and father. - Thu Nov 12 19:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Thu Nov 12 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And you need to use every fiber in your being to make sure you never hurt anyone that you love ever again. - Thu Nov 12 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I-It's harder than you know. - Thu Nov 12 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You have the ability for a reason. I believe in your ability to tame that power. - Thu Nov 12 19:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Everytime you think you are about to transform unwillingly, think about your mother and your father. - Thu Nov 12 19:09:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah. Return to the village. Like I said, no sparring unless it's a jounin or higher. - Thu Nov 12 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) formed several seals before he submerged into the terrain. He would be back within Suna long before both Aza and his water clones---who would walk alongside him back to the village. When he made it within the gates, the water clones would revert to water.* - Thu Nov 12 19:12:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded to both of them. "If Izanami doesn't mind," Yan would note as he'd step forward and begin the route to the restaurant before heading towards the prison. They would purchase Trilliam's favorite meal, and having been Trilliam's sensei, he had taken him to eat and knew what sorts of food Trilliam truly enjoyed.

After going to the restaurant, which we will blackscreen, the trio or duo would head towards the prisons. (someone grab me ;) )* - Thu Nov 12 19:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Nice to meet you, I dont mind you coming. - Thu Nov 12 19:39:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) made his way through the checkpoints within the prison, though because of his status, the trio had little problems and encountered minimal red tape on their path to see a comrade ninja. Once they came to the cell door, it was opened and they would enter. It didn't seem horrible, Yan thought as he entered the room.

"Yo', Trill." He'd greet the ninja with a smile and steaming hot food. Since I oocly don't know what kind of food it is, just name it whatever Trill's favorite food is. Yan would present the boy with the food, and would be accompanied by two other ninja. He wasn't sure if Kurt knew him, and once he found out, he'd make an introduction if they didn't.* - Thu Nov 12 19:41:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would look as though he remembered something previously vacant from his memory. He'd pad his armor, gesturing for Trill to look at it. "Check out my new armor." He said. It'd be identical to the hashirama armor, yet there would be an engraved hidden sand symbol etched at his chest plate.* - Thu Nov 12 19:54:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Eh...If you say soooo want some toilet wine? - Thu Nov 12 20:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Its apple flavored. - Thu Nov 12 20:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: No, Thank you. - Thu Nov 12 20:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: I think I shall get going now. See you later. - Thu Nov 12 20:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Need to talk to you. - Thu Nov 12 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Mad cuz I fucked yo girl - Thu Nov 12 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: put big dick in her world - Thu Nov 12 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: bust nuts on her curls - Thu Nov 12 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: <omit> - Thu Nov 12 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) looked back towards Kiyoko, nodding. Before he could run off to speak with Kiyoko, a guard appeared at his side via shunshin.

"Sir, there's an approach at the gate." Yan would nod, turning to Kiyoko to address her. "Soon..where will you be?" He'd ask before heading off with the guard.* - Thu Nov 12 21:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: Fuck it; i'll just ask it outright. - Thu Nov 12 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I need to spar someone for a mission. Any takers? - Thu Nov 12 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Sure, Redhead. - Thu Nov 12 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Just a moment. - Thu Nov 12 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: YO! - Thu Nov 12 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: We need a Jounin at the front gate. - Thu Nov 12 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded and beckoned her along. "Let's go, then...So, what are you wanting to talk about?" He'd ask as he went towards the gates.* - Thu Nov 12 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: The Mizukage and two other dudes are there, on 'official business'. - Thu Nov 12 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: And need a Jounin to talk to. - Thu Nov 12 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Anyway... who needed a spar/ - Thu Nov 12 21:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Mhmm. - Thu Nov 12 21:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, Kiyoko..on that note - Thu Nov 12 21:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I. - Thu Nov 12 21:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Let's talk about it afterward. You are welcome to come. - Thu Nov 12 21:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) arrived upon the scene with what appeared to be a battered woman. He liked to keep his bitches in line. At any rate, what the men would see was a ninja with blonde hair, bright green eyes and a set of armor upon his body which brandished the symbol of suna etched upon its chest plate. As for physical expression, he would seem to be pleasant and welcoming with a smile and a formal bow.

"Welcome Mizukage." He would greet the prestigious ninja, thereafter forming more words of curiousity. "Would you like to follow me to the mansion to speak over something to drink?" He asked, green hues moving over the two ninja which the Mizukage were accompanied by. He would nod to them in acknowledgement.* - Thu Nov 12 21:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: I feel like me coming along was pointless, this important of visitors and he won't be able to speak with me for a while. - Thu Nov 12 21:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noticed a different face. Was there a new Mizukage now? It almost seemed reminiscent of years past when Suna's leadership was shakey and changed often. He would move to the side, aiming to accompany the kage to the mansion. "Certainly. How was your travels, Lord Mizukage?" He'd ask as they trudged through the sand.* - Thu Nov 12 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Would you like to see the Kazekage now or rest before? I'm sure it was a long trip. - Thu Nov 12 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Sure, Kiyoko--thanks. - Thu Nov 12 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mn-hm. - Thu Nov 12 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: I'd like to rest first.  - Thu Nov 12 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would lead them onward further into the interior of the village. As they moved past the gate completely, the way through would soon be encumbered by guards. In fact, nearly five thousand troops were visibly or hidden within the sands and cliffs surrounding the gate. As they moved further, they would notice it was even more heavily populated by more guard as well as plentiful amount of ninja and civilians.

"I welcome you three to The Hidden Sands," He stated, as the village would be revealed upon them passing through the narrow valley. Suddenly a ninja would approach, though he seemed weak and insignificant compared to anyone within the company of ninja.

"Ensure the Mizukage has everything he needs, please." Yan would say to the NPC ninja, whereupon the ninja would inquire with the Mizukage what sort of food he enjoyed. After recieving the information, he would scurry off. "I had no knowledge of your arrival, so if you had sent information a head of time, I apologize for the lack of readiness. I can put you in the Shadow Leader Suite in our local inn--a room saved for the highest of positions within the ninja world." He'd say. The room would be the top of the line luxury, with top of the line technology and accommodations.* - Thu Nov 12 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: It's fine. I didn't expect any sort of a welcome besides my meeting with the Kazekage...But I'm sorry for imposing.. - Thu Nov 12 21:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It's our pleasure to accommodate you. - Thu Nov 12 21:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Uh.. Sure... - Thu Nov 12 21:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) thinks: They call this a fucking suite? - Thu Nov 12 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: The accomodations are lovely. - Thu Nov 12 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) thinks: I don't like small spaces. - Thu Nov 12 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Thank you. - Thu Nov 12 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I'm pretty sure most of those looked like prisoners.. - Thu Nov 12 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Well...We'll rest up..Whem the Kazekage is ready...We'll meet with him. - Thu Nov 12 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Your food and drinks should arrive soon, but there is sake chilled in the refridgeration and room temperature sake in the liquor cabinets if you wish to indulge, Lord Mizukage. - Thu Nov 12 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Otherwise, I will leave you be and alert the Kazekage of your arrival. - Thu Nov 12 21:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Very we- What's your name? - Thu Nov 12 21:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yan. - Thu Nov 12 21:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Very well. - Thu Nov 12 21:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was hesitant to take it, weighing rejecting the tip and causing offense or simply accepting a tip from someone he was obligated to oblige. He took the tip, smiled and bows graciously. "Thank you, sir. I will do as I said," he noted. "Your men have a room just next to this one." He'd note as he headed out. "Feel free to enjoy yourself however you desire." He'd say lastly as he bowed at the door and dissapeared down the hallway.* - Thu Nov 12 21:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Thank you. - Thu Nov 12 21:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: My pleasure, sir. - Thu Nov 12 21:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) arrives upon the scene, peering towards Kiyoko. "Soo..." He said as he'd lean on the desk. He imagined this was about Aza.* - Thu Nov 12 21:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...that was quick. - Thu Nov 12 21:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: The Kazekage is resting.. - Thu Nov 12 21:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mn... - Thu Nov 12 21:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Thought you would have to entertain them. - Thu Nov 12 21:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: So for one you need to get your flu shot. - Thu Nov 12 21:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..Eh, no thanks! - Thu Nov 12 21:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'll give you a sucker - Thu Nov 12 21:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: <omit> - Thu Nov 12 21:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Uh....I don't know.... - Thu Nov 12 21:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) scoots backwards.* - Thu Nov 12 21:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yan. - Thu Nov 12 21:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You know me. - Thu Nov 12 21:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'm not going to hurt you. - Thu Nov 12 21:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Eh..it's just...I don't do needles. - Thu Nov 12 21:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Can I take a pill? - Thu Nov 12 21:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Lucky for you I'm even in my right mind again, most of the village had to get their shots while I was loopy on drugs because Hassan wanted me to do them. - Thu Nov 12 21:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No, but I can do a nose inhalation. - Thu Nov 12 21:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ....Sounds better. - Thu Nov 12 21:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) grunts and takes a seat beside her. "Yeah, yeah..." He replied dismisively.* - Thu Nov 12 21:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) winced slightly as she grabbed his chin. He would inhale the medicine just as she had instructed and would indeed feel the strange sensation as the drug went into his nostrils and as a result sent on course throughout his body to work against any minor ailments.

He would inhale with his nose a few times, almost uncomfortably so, before turning to her as he squeezed the bridge. "So.." he released and simply rested his arms on the table. "What did you want to talk about?" He'd inquire.* - Thu Nov 12 21:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm simply following orders. - Thu Nov 12 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I think we made progress, too. - Thu Nov 12 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: .... - Thu Nov 12 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What you did was make him nervous. - Thu Nov 12 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And him nervous means halted progression. - Thu Nov 12 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ....Such a weak-willed ninja. - Thu Nov 12 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Let me handle i-... - Thu Nov 12 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm sorry to be rude, Kiyoko. - Thu Nov 12 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: But what I told him should invigorate him to defeat this mental disease. - Thu Nov 12 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It shouldn't deter him. - Thu Nov 12 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: He did something horrible, and that horrible thing he did..should fuel his desire to never lose control again. - Thu Nov 12 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Allow me to do this, I went through quite a lot to help him already all things considered and I know it looks like he just beat a weak little girl up but I'm still wanting to help him not only because I have love for my position but because he's my friend. - Thu Nov 12 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Instead it's making him depressed, Yan. - Thu Nov 12 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I haven't seen him eat. - Thu Nov 12 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: He must be stronger then. - Thu Nov 12 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And every time someone mentions what happens he puts his hood up, or lowers his head, or get's quiet. - Thu Nov 12 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...Talk to Hassan, get an OK and let me know. - Thu Nov 12 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Worry about stronger after he is able to control it, okay? - Thu Nov 12 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...fine. - Thu Nov 12 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Do you and Hassan not get along? - Thu Nov 12 22:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...no that's not it...we get along very well...but I'm dating his daughter and I haven't figured out if he knows that yet. - Thu Nov 12 22:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..Dating..Oh. - Thu Nov 12 22:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods. "I'm sure you can work past it," he noted with a smile. He didn't know either of them were gay. "Anything else?" he'd ask as he leaned back in the chair, pivoting to face her more.* - Thu Nov 12 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You think it's something to work past? - Thu Nov 12 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: The awkwardness, yeah.... - Thu Nov 12 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh, yeah. I suppose. No that's all... - Thu Nov 12 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..Wait..what did you think I meant? - Thu Nov 12 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) looks at her skeptically.* - Thu Nov 12 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: That maybe he didn't like his daughter being with women... or maybe with people who are weird and wear face paint all the time, or someone who is weak...I don't know.. - Thu Nov 12 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You're a good woman. I think he'd be pleased. - Thu Nov 12 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) pats her shoulder and stands up. "I have to go handle some business, so I'll catch you later." He noted, heading outside thereafter.* - Thu Nov 12 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Sir. - Thu Nov 12 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Yeah? - Thu Nov 12 22:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: The Kazekage and his company have arrived to our village. I have them in the "Shadow Leader Suite" at the inn. Would you like me to let him know you are available for your meeting? - Thu Nov 12 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I have  a lot of work to tend to. - Thu Nov 12 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I can't entertain them at the moment. - Thu Nov 12 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Keep them well rested and fed. - Thu Nov 12 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yessir, I left them happy and well accomodated. - Thu Nov 12 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Tell them I will get to them when I can. - Thu Nov 12 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded and turned around, intent on ensuring that the Kazekage was taken care of. As he did he noticed Mizora and peered towards her. "Hm?" He'd be obvious he was addressing her.* - Thu Nov 12 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: Hello. - Thu Nov 12 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I believe that's Hassan's decision. - Thu Nov 12 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: He told me to come to you... - Thu Nov 12 22:17:10 2015
