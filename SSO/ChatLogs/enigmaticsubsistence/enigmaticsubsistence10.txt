<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Yes sir, Lord Hassan. - Wed Sep 30 02:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods after it was all said and done, providing audible reaction as well--"yessir." With Hassan and Yan's dialogue in completion, bright green eyes divert to view the group in which he was going to lead. He was a leader in the very manner he fought, yet the connection with his clones were differenet than that of his comrade ninja. The moment made him miss both Tatsumi and Flexus--both of which remained unavenged. He cleared the thought and spoke clearly. "You three suit up and meet me at the village gates," He'd say as projected chakra into the ground below his form--slipping within it as he would venture towards the gates. He wanted to look cool.* - Wed Sep 30 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) stood at the very edge of the valley leading into and out of The Hidden Sands. It felt nice to be home, and also it was nice to see his village build back up again. It would be his death before Sand descended back into volatility--moreso than it was at the moment. As everyone arrived, they would observe him in full suit as normal--arms folded to his chest as he awaited his squadron. He was in a relatively friendly mood despite current events, as that was the young man's nature. "Is everyone ready?"
\
Once reactions were made, he would continue on. "We will remain in this formation loosely in order to transition into fighting more efficiently. Koji will remain in the back. He is quick and can move faster than even me probably. That being said, his ability to transition from the front formation to the back will make him more adaptable from a rear position. Izanami and Trilliam, you remain in the middle whereas I will remain in the fore-front. Any questions?" He'd ask. Truthfully, he was just trying to play the part.* - Wed Sep 30 02:12:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded as he would pivot. He expected everyone to fall into formation and remain in such a formation until the end. Theoretically it would be composed as a diamond but as it was loose and they were more casual as to not alert anyone of combat readiness, such form wouldn't be defined.
\
\They would make their way to the village to the north-east--passing skittering lizards and aimless tumble weeds. Eventually, they would come upon the village, and Yan would provide verbal confirmation of what he said.. "Remain in a loose formation and keep to yourself. If you have a suggestion, don't be loud about it. Who knows if our enemy is anticipating us at all." He'd note, arriving to the gate of the civilian village from which they easily gained access through official papers.* - Wed Sep 30 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) t|The village in which they entered was in a state not dissimilar to the same level that all the other civilian villages were facing. With The Hidden Sand devoid of productivity and ridden with bandits, the usual wealth of yen that would be exchanged and circulated through that left the exteriors feeling the fall-out from such. As a result, it was poverty stricken...And this was good for the genin to see, as they needed to have duty instilled within them as Yan had been so long ago. They would remain in formation as they walked, moving through the crowds of people..As most people recognized the attire and headbands, they moved aside in reverence. Some cursed their very name, and Yan kept a watchful eye upon them. "Koji, keep your eye out," he mentioned quietly, as he assumed that whatever Hassan had mentioned in regard to sensory would be utilized at this point.|* - Wed Sep 30 02:28:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan was on guard, yet he wasn't receiving any intelligence from the very man he just put to task on information. Nevertheless, they proceeded. Out of nowhere a young girl approached, someone slightly younger than Izanami. Feeling most comfortable with Izanami due to gender and age, the girl approached her specifically. Dirt ridden and starving, the girl pleaded out to Izanami and the rest of the squad. 
\
\"Please help me..my parents are dead and I am so hungry.." The girl spoke meekly, tears welling within her eyes as emotions would succumb to her weakened state. 
\
\"Stay alert, " He'd say, which seemed harsh, but then---Shuriken flew from the east, whistling through the  air towards the group. It was aimed toward Izanami and Trillium as they were probably most distracted.
\
\"The kid.." Yan wasn't fast enough to react immediately, yet the periphial visual on the projecting steel stole his attention as he turned--forming a single seal as clones would erupt. By then the faster was shifting to the opposite side. "Koji," Yan named the chuunin specifically, calling for him "There are too many bystanders, I can't see where the opponent is," He'd note.* - Wed Sep 30 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) formed a singular seal. Chakra was aligned and kneaded through the creation of the seal, and upon exertion of ominous pools of chakra, Yan's technique came into fruition as four clones appeared around them effectively doubling their numbers. One would step of the clone, given they had proper warning through Koji's byakugan, intercepting the attack as it was penetrated by the weapon. Of course, the clone bursted into mud thus trapping the shinobi clone's  weapon. 
\
\Meanwhile, the other clones searched through the crowds. "Find the other," He'd state as a kunai was brandished, flicking it forward as the mud revealed flesh to puncture. * - Wed Sep 30 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: He's scoping us out, looking to how we react. Don't show too much of your technique yet. - Wed Sep 30 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) waited patiently. "Tell me the original's location," he stated as he withdrew the kunai from his possess, tucking it within his satchel as he prepared to move off. Yan was much more deadly free of a kunai's restrictions within his hands. 

Meanwhile, the remaining four clones would break into movement as each strung a quick succession of seals before bringing all of their techniques into fruition. Yan wasn't one to be conservative when it came to the utilization of chakra. Upon the techniques' ignition, each of the man's clones who had made themself known would be assaulted with spears that jutted from the ground.

Each instance of the technique, four spears would extend from four opposite directions in an angle toward one another. They would extend to imaple the clones thus diengaging them if they weren't agile enough to dodge. Based on Hassan's report, the older father wasn't as quick as the boy himself. Nevertheless, they were dealing with shinobi of a higher tier.* - Wed Sep 30 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: The original is the middle building blocked by the congestion of the townfolk. There he can command his clones and watch closely those who enter the village. He's using the townfolk as shields. - Wed Sep 30 04:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched as the clones were destroyed, thus evading the damage that would be incurred by the katon blasts which the clones threatened with. With the dissolution of the visual enemy, the seasoned chuunin relied on the information given to him by Koji. (you are going to icly lose them)* - Wed Sep 30 04:59:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peered towards Izanami, providing an uncharacteristically stern look. "Get it together shinobi," he'd say as a singular seal was formulated within cooperative digits. Twelve clones of Yan then appeared as he exerted monsterous amounts of chakra to do so. "Do what you can to help wounded civilians and calm the ones that aren't hurt." He'd say, as they had to return the village to a safe level before rioting occured.* - Wed Sep 30 05:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) worked in several points simultaneously, thanks to his technique and his reserve of chakra for being able to perform it to such magnitude. Each clone moved civilians, directed them and appropriated transport for those too hurt to move themselves to medical centers. Meanwhile, the original spoke to Izanami. "You heard me," he'd say firmly. He looked off into the distance, hoping to see a familiar face that was the terrorists. They were cowards and wouldn't return to the scene until they were at an advantage. He noticed Koji was doing his job, which was indicative of his mettle for the rank of chuunin--he hoped Izanami would adapt.* - Wed Sep 30 05:23:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched her as she performed her duty. All the while his clones and Koji were handling the bulk of the work.

As Izanami looked around for how to help, she would probably notice a young child no older than five. She was laying on the ground, leg torn off by the explosive power of a device which detonated right next to her. She was screaming in agony and pain, wanting the pain to stop. She would look to Izanami and reach out to her, screaming as she displayed her agony in full force to the young genin.* - Wed Sep 30 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||It was but a moment that life fled the young girl's body. Similiarly, blood did as well. There was a pool where her lower-leg was now missing and her melanin faded as skin lost it's coloration. The girl's hand dropped, still etched in a fashion as though to grab Izanami for help, yet now simply inanimate. The girl had died, and it wasn't her fault, it was just the way the world was.* - Wed Sep 30 06:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohen(Cloud93) says: Oh look, fellow shinobi! Hey Shinobi bros.! - Wed Sep 30 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||The girl was dead, yet there were more to help. Many were in similiar position though many were also not injured at all. A family huddled together in fright on the side-lines, having avoided the blast. The father kissing his child, thanking the gods that they were all alive. Regardless, the terrorists had to be stopped. Yan's eyes were glazed with intent, with duty--he would end this man himself. His will to destroy evil seemed indomitable, mounting at every moment.* - Wed Sep 30 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I need some more ninjas__ - Wed Sep 30 17:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was awake, sitting in a chair that faced towards a window. They were in a room which Yan had rented, though it was out of pocket costs as such was not covered on missions. Nevertheless, he kept a watchful eye on a city that was picking up from where it had left off before the confrontation before. He noticed Koji shifting, and wondered if he was awake. That being said, his bright green eyes shifted into his direction.* - Wed Sep 30 18:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) wasn't sure about the shit, but it wasn't much of his concern either. Once Koji began going about his business, optics shifted back to the exterior through the window. "There is too much evil in the world to stand around not doing anything about it." He stated, a soft sigh escaping his lips thereafter.

"We need to contain our next confrontation with them to avoid casualties."* - Wed Sep 30 18:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: They fight at a distance, and hide behind explosives. We should match them with Trilliam. - Wed Sep 30 18:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Trilliam is a rookie genin, from my reports. - Wed Sep 30 18:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Koji, when the time comes, we will separate into two squads. You will find and take care of the son alongside Trilliam and Izanami. I will deal with the father myself. - Wed Sep 30 18:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If we separate them and cut off teamwork between the two, I imagine we will be more successful. After all, they are a team and wanted together, therefore they probably are more capable when together. - Wed Sep 30 18:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: True, but I'm worried about the hesitation of lethal force by Izanami. If she fails to act in a serious situation it could end badly. - Wed Sep 30 18:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I think she's seen the resolve and lack of respect for life that are enemy has... - Wed Sep 30 18:24:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Hmm. Well I have no problem with the plan. From Hassan's report the child lacks wisdom in battle. And, the  too reckless watch for a kamikaze. - Wed Sep 30 18:27:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) observes the change in appearance of the man's eyes. He has, of course, seen this before and after hearing of his increased field of vision--he attributed it to an eye technique or doujutsu. "Wow...." He was truly amazed; it was something that he had never witnessed by knowledge before. Of course, he had faced off against a fully developed sharingan brandishing three tamoe though hadn't known of its significance.* - Wed Sep 30 19:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You've definitely come into your own, Koji. Hassan was right to promote you to chuunin. - Wed Sep 30 19:01:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) sighed, having recollected his brief confrontation with Baen that ended in the opponent escaping. Would Flexus really be proud of a ninja that couldn't avenge his friends? He hadn't killed Edge or Baen....He felt like a failure to be honest. He moved his eyes back to the refuge of the outside, where no one could peer into his eyes and thus his heart which was riddled with dissapointment. "So you can see things like explosive tags?" He noted, contemplating the extent of the byakugan's power--a name of which he did not yet recognize it to be.* - Wed Sep 30 19:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I see. - Wed Sep 30 19:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: So, when the time comes, how do you plan to utilize Trilliam and Izanami against the son? - Wed Sep 30 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: He is a bukijutsu user, quick and agile, yet weak in ninjutsu power. - Wed Sep 30 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: I want the two to get training, so Izanami will go in with Trilliam as back up. I've sparred with Trilliam so I know his degree of skill. - Wed Sep 30 19:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: There's no time for training. What do you mean? - Wed Sep 30 19:28:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods. "Do not underestimate Izanami though, when the time comes--I am confident she will act accordingly." He stated.* - Wed Sep 30 19:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: I won't she's splendid in my mind. - Wed Sep 30 19:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Hm, Koji. - Wed Sep 30 20:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: May I test something out on you? It may help you hone your visual prowess. - Wed Sep 30 20:18:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Go for it. - Wed Sep 30 20:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded and pivoted, facing towards him as he pushed his feet from the ground and his rear from the chair in which he perched upon. Now in a full stand, he centered his focus toward his chakra as he began to exert it with a massive presence. A singular handseal was formed, the trigger, at which point the technique would come into fruition. 

If connected, which it undoubtedly would, Yan's visage would dematerialize into fleeting feathers. With his form now invisible, to the naked eye at least, his form would traverse to the rear of his opponent. Meanwhile, roots without a source would project from the ground underneath Koji. As it would expand into a trunk, the roots would branch out and attempt to coil around Koji as to bind him.

* - Wed Sep 30 20:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) grimaced. His target was fast, yet illusions provided infinite attributes that wouldn't be matched by the limitations of a physical world bound by the perimeters of reality and gravity. That being said, the wood would continue in the endeavour to capture the nimble ninja. In fact, it would approach faster as it branched out attempting to grab Koji's leg.* - Wed Sep 30 20:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) caught him. Alas, the trees were not real, they were genjutsu. That being said, as he attempted to assault them, his legs were instantly encroached by the branches and his form would be encumbered by the thick, restricting appendages of the genjutsu illusion.* - Wed Sep 30 21:12:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was tracking the terrorists alongside Koji, Trilliam and Izanami. Unfortunately Izanami wasn't able to make it so it was just the trio that searched. As they made their way outside of the city, they saw a grouping of forests. "Koji, what do you see?" he'd ask, hoping to rely on Byakugan's field of vision to ascertain where the terrorists were.* - Thu Oct  1 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded as the information Koji acquired through his doujutsu was relayed to Yan by the rookie chuunin. As they approached, he thought for a moment. 'I will move ahead, be within the cave in fifteen seconds. I will facilitate the end. Also, the father is an experienced earth release user, so stay near the entrance. If they are backed into the corner; they may attempt suicide to kill us." He'd note, and with that, he was off. He wasn't too fast, but fast enough accelerate past them toward the cave. As he landed ontop of the cave, traveling through trees from branch-to-branch, he began channeling chakra into the rock which he was perched upon thus assimilating it for the purpose of traveling within. With that said, he dropped in, applying suimen thereafter as he hung from the ceiling within the darkness.* - Thu Oct  1 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) remained quiet and still as the others were below him, plotting to kill them all. He also over-heard talk of a last attempt to kill the shinobi after them, involving detonations throughout the cave. He knew he wouldn't be able to save the two he was working alongside if they entered, and so he would utilize a low-ranking genjutsu to make them feel as though they were surrounded and helpless amidst the darkness. That being said, he performed the deed. His high-level genjutsu was matched to take on any shinobi that wasn't a specialist within the category of techniques. That being said, the two would be surrounded by shinobi and would panic. 
\
\"Son! Run!" He'd say to his son, whereupon the boy would run towards the exit. Suddenly the man detonated the seals, and boom, the entirety of the cave was encroached in fire=y flames of destruction that caused the entirety of the cave to cave in. Yan, having mole prepared, simply moved from it through the ceiling and to the top. As the ground broke apart, he launched off it and into a safe area. Meanwhile, the boy would be thrown from the entrance and on fire. He rolled and relieved himself, but Koji and Trilliam had a chance to catch him off guard and finish this.* - Thu Oct  1 23:56:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noticed the earthern projectiles heading his way. He performed a blistering five seals in quick succession, the speed in which each seal ws converted to full formulation difficult to percieve by anyone with base-level visual abilities. At the end of the string, chakra was converted and an earthern wall erupted into existence before him. It easily withstood the projectiles and protected all that it posed a threat to.* - Fri Oct  2 00:25:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) bent knees, thereafter launching upwards up and over the wall to land upon it. He converted chakra to the base of his feet to maintain balance as looked down towards Trilliam. "Are you sure that's the mastered? Seemed a little sub-par." He'd say, folding each arm into one another at his chest.* - Fri Oct  2 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) disregarded Trilliam for the moment as words from a different direction were shot his way. Of course, the problem with showing your ninjutsu in public is that everyone wanted a piece of the pie. Yan was reasonable. He took a step forward, and hopped with the other foot. He'd land his rear on to the lip of the wall with hands that braced the impact. "Who're you again?" He'd ask, a smile breeching his expression as he peered with bright green eyes. One could say he was a very unthreatening person as far as the manner in which he spoke.* - Fri Oct  2 00:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence)  coughed slightly and leaned back, bracing himself with the hands that stabilized his posture upon the rock wall. "Well, what do ya know already?" He'd inquire, tilting his head from one way to the other as crackling noises sounded off.* - Fri Oct  2 00:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watches him chuckle over and over again, an eyebrow raising as he didn't know what the other found to be so comical. Nevertheless, Yan didn't hold it against him...Maybe he was a nervous guy. "What is your nindo? " He'd ask finally.* - Fri Oct  2 00:43:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I mean, I don't know exactly have one. . .I just want to get stronger, and stop being beaten to easily. - Fri Oct  2 00:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) shrugs, gripping the wall as he placed a base of one foot upon the face of the earth wall, at which point he thrusted his body forward. His hip would pivot, and his foot would be brought around in an aimed kick towards Kang's cheek. After which Yan would land, poising a single seal. "Let's get stronger together, then. Maybe I'll teach you something if you show me you have what it takes." He didn't say what it took though, that was for the boy to find out.* - Fri Oct  2 00:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) did what he did best. His superior control allowed him to delve within the earth with the quick ,distribution of chakra into the terra beneath him. That being said, as the fireball took shape and roared forward with its destructive mayhem, Yan would be beneath the earth as to escape the devastation manifesting before him.

He re-surfaced behind Kang, observing to see how long it took him to turn around. Meanwhile, he was building up chakra yet forming no visible signs.* - Fri Oct  2 00:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) upon the realization and thus the full pivot in order to see Yan, the chuunin would be unleashing a ninjutsu. Hopefully the genin saw the theme as a mud river which was moderated in power as to not hurt the other. That being said, the mud river would be heading at the other once he turned around completely; giving him enough time to dodge if he was agile enough.* - Fri Oct  2 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would cease the mud river thereafter rushing forward. While he wasn't known for his physical attributes, he did hold some speed to his form. That being said, as the other was speaking, he would throw a left punch, putting his shoulder forward as he placed his weight into it. That being said, his punching was adequate yet lacking and so the other had opportunity to dodge it. If anything, he held back the speed of his punch in order to accomodate the other's reflexes. * - Fri Oct  2 01:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Fight now talk later! - Fri Oct  2 01:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) squinted his eyes, pulling the previous shoulder back as the other hand came in with a downward arc, ultimately being aimed to slam into the other's chest and send him stumbling backwards. "You're not gonna fight back now?" He'd ask, stopping his assault =after the last attack.* - Fri Oct  2 01:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) formed a single seal, preparing to utilize his own jutsu as chakra accumulated and welled wiithin his form. Just before water filled his gullet, Yan spoke. "Show me what you got then," he'd issue the challenge.* - Fri Oct  2 01:28:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded, and thus once lips were pried open from pressure, a stream of water jetted from Yan's mouth and projected towards the boy. The speed was formidable, moving at ten feet per second, and would collide into the boy with considerable force. Nevertheless, the boy would be left with nothing more than bruises if it connected.* - Fri Oct  2 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) observed as the water collided with the force of wind chakra manifesting in rotation around the genin. The water was batted away, as it was portioned in power and out-ranked in jutsu rank. Once both techniques ceased, he simply shrugged. "About here I guess." He'd say, releasing the seal as he transitioned into another. "I will teach you one of my used techniques." He said as kneaded his chakra and exerted it to create a mud clone beside him. "You will need to learn from this though, he'd say as he rummaged through the satchel at his side. Upon revealing a small scroll, he tossed it to Kang. * - Fri Oct  2 01:41:07 2015
