<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods and moves out before the group to face Ossa. "I am Yan, by the way;" he'd note his name with a toothy grin and bright green eyes. From there he had a basic stance, feet shoulder-lengthed apart with hands that suspended before him chest-level and near one another. * - Mon Sep 14 13:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Sorry pal, this guy has already volunteered. - Mon Sep 14 14:00:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) utilized a stance which weaving seals were ideal and actual close combat wasn't a focus at all. That being said, Yan would be forming seals once the other began to move. Lifting up one's hand and pointing in their direction didn't seem that threatening though on the other hand as they had discussed---you lose not expecting the unexpected. With the seals formed within a second, the technique would commense.

Billowing clouds ignited on either side of him and before him, the clouds casted away due to expansion as clones were revealed. The Digital shrapnel would hit the bunshin and probably penetrate the earthern style clone. Regardless, once that was done, the clone would be reduced into thick mud which would hinder the movement completely until it came into a stop. Yan would remain afar with the two clones now at his disposal readying their chakra as was Yan.* - Mon Sep 14 14:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I don't see why... - Mon Sep 14 14:07:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Well you need stop having that mindset becasue we need you - Mon Sep 14 14:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: There are plenty of others...that could fulfill my role... - Mon Sep 14 14:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) smiled. The spar played out, as they all did, just how Yan wanted and as a result he would know just what to do to counter. The other was indeed fast, but at this distance it took him entirerly too long to cover the distance which was needed in order to come within melee range. With both clones already preparing their chakra, they would unleash rivers of mud that would not begin until he was within fifteen feet. These mud rivers moved from either side of Yan, pivoted to angle inward towards one another that after a few feet--they would conjoin into one mud river that would flow forward.

Additionally, with a few skillfully woven seals, Yan would knead his chakra thereby allowing him to perform at technique of his choice. Within the last seal's completion, his mouth opened and a volume of water would be projected. Unlike the mud rivers, his technique wasn't directed towards the ground immediately. Instead, he would look to catch an air-bourne Kaguya off guard in the midst of dodging the rivers and trying to propel himself over it in order to close distance. Nevertheless, with a hit or not mid-air, the water would fall and join with the mud rivers as it was magnified in power due to the water increasing its volume.* - Mon Sep 14 14:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) allowed both of the clones to cease their techniques and direct their stances towards the other who had strafed south-bound. Yan himself would do the same, though his intention was to create distance. He jumped back, trying to create distance. Upon landing, he would begin performing seals in preparation.* - Mon Sep 14 14:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: Bone manipulation? Thats different... - Mon Sep 14 14:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) scared as fuck now based on the bone manipulation.* - Mon Sep 14 14:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) thinks: It would be hard to palm with a bone manipulater.. is it the perfect counter against my technique? - Mon Sep 14 14:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noted the clones would indeed run defense. After all, that's what they were there for. Yan would be at a safe distance performing seals and upon the last one, he would hold the technique for a moment.


As for Baen, the first clone would head towards him, attempting to grab hold of him. When destroyed, the mud would ooze all over Baen unless he was quick enough to dodge and would impede his movement if only for a moment. Meanwhile, the other c lone would release another mud river aimed at both the bone-manipulator as well as the clone which would now be hindering the Kaguya's movement. * - Mon Sep 14 14:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) thinks: Yan has definitely faced a faster challenger, but it's clear this guy's speed is no joke either. how will yan overcome it? - Mon Sep 14 14:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: I wonder how durable he is with those bones... I can cut him up a bit without getting yelled at - Mon Sep 14 14:49:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Fine. - Mon Sep 14 15:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) motions towards the wall to the east of them. Such would be sufficient, theoretically.* - Mon Sep 14 15:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: ok - Mon Sep 14 15:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded and headed after Mitsuru, listening to the basics of the technique as he matched him step for step. It seemed to be fairly easy, and in all probability, a basic technique which was taught to Mist nin. Yan was from Sand, which afforded little training due to their financial circumstances. Nevertheless, he had abilities in chakra control more than anything else. He focused his chakra onto his feet, and would run forward. He had no intention of walking up as that would be more difficult in his oppinion. As he hit the wall, he made it up two steps before slipping and landing back-first onto the ground below. "Damn...should have been able to do that." He said, elevating his confidence before he would make another attempt.* - Mon Sep 14 15:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thought about what Himura had said. After all, he was the one teaching Yan. Yan had experienced in being taught, as he has had many temporal senseis over his time of training and therefore had grown accustomed to instruction by ninja. That being said, he caught onto the words carefully and would incorperate them into his thought process.

The technique involved chakra, and walking on surfaces which were normally impossible due to gravity. The chakra would be an adhesive between Yan and the wall, and that being said, adhesives were normally spread even to create a balance. Yan theorized that such worked the same when utilizing the chakra adhesive. That being said, Yan would concentrate a thin layer of chakra onto the base of his sole--his own chakra control coming into play as this was performed skillfully. 

All that was left was for him to do the deed, and he did. He walked onto the wall, cautious but successful. He lifted his head and peered towards Himura. "Huh?" He'd say, grinning widely.* - Mon Sep 14 15:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Pretty good, Yan. - Mon Sep 14 15:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Violet. - Mon Sep 14 15:40:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Yes sir - Mon Sep 14 15:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) bent his knees and catapulted off the wall, catching his descent with a palm to the ground as he flipped himself over forcibly to his feet whereupon he landed beside Himura. He'd watch Violet from here.* - Mon Sep 14 15:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Use just a little more. - Mon Sep 14 15:51:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: No no, take your time. I'm just here to watch. - Mon Sep 14 15:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Good, Nice work Violet. - Mon Sep 14 16:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: But that was only half the puzzle. - Mon Sep 14 16:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Walking on water is much harder. - Mon Sep 14 16:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: So, If you'd both like to follow me to the waterfall, we'll continue there. - Mon Sep 14 16:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I was able to walk on water just fine after.. - Mon Sep 14 16:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: You're a medic Setsuna, I'm not surprised. - Mon Sep 14 16:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Water's not as solid, I can see how it'd be more difficult. - Mon Sep 14 16:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Still, It's best to practise. - Mon Sep 14 16:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Anyway, Let's go. - Mon Sep 14 16:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Sigh... another trick? - Mon Sep 14 16:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) contemplated what was said, and how he had reasoned his way into figuring out how to perform suimen on land. That being said, the water was still yet moved with a gentle sway. It would be more difficult to balance the chakra with the water's movement changing the elevation of one's feet. He began to distribute chakra into the soles of his feet, like spreading butter on bread, he created a sheet of chakra underneath his feet which were balanced throughout. As he took a measured step upon the water, he felt his foot sink and withdrew it. On his second attempt to step out, he would successfully do so, whereupon he drew his other foot out and walked carefully over the source of water towards Himura.* - Mon Sep 14 16:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Himura, you said your friend was a medical ninja? - Mon Sep 14 16:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: What is his name? - Mon Sep 14 16:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: She. - Mon Sep 14 16:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) looks up the waterfall toward the man elevated from them.* - Mon Sep 14 16:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Her name is Setsuna. - Mon Sep 14 16:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Oh...I mean her. - Mon Sep 14 16:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: She's up there. - Mon Sep 14 16:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: ... - Mon Sep 14 16:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) coughs.* - Mon Sep 14 16:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Please dont insult my girlfriend - Mon Sep 14 16:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I didn't insult anyone! - Mon Sep 14 16:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Really, I'm sorry! - Mon Sep 14 16:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) provides an innocent, sincere smile.* - Mon Sep 14 16:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: No matter, It's a simple mistake. - Mon Sep 14 16:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Just focus on the task at hand Violet. - Mon Sep 14 16:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: It ok, just a pronoun mistake, i wont hold it against you - Mon Sep 14 16:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Yes sir - Mon Sep 14 16:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: Hopefully the drain'll be less terrible by the time I master it, though. - Mon Sep 14 16:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peered up from Setsuna, purposely positioning himself near the base of the water fall to fight to stay on the surface. It wasn't much effort involved, as his chakra control was formidable. "Yo', will you teach me basic medical techniques?" He said as he called out to Setsuna.* - Mon Sep 14 16:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: I only know the more advanced techniques, honestly... - Mon Sep 14 16:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) found it odd that the other hadn't began with basic medical practices before moving onto more complex techniques although it mattered not. He would volunteer at the hospital if it meants learning basic medical ninjutsu. He came from a village where there was hardly any medical ninja, and so he saw learning to heal in a very basic way a means to help his people in the future.* - Mon Sep 14 16:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: A what? No. I haven't even learned that technique. - Mon Sep 14 16:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Where did it pop out from then? - Mon Sep 14 16:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I've recently learned water clone but it requires too much chakra for me to use it. - Mon Sep 14 16:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: For a B-Rank this requires less chakra than most techniques.. - Mon Sep 14 16:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: A plume of smoke. - Mon Sep 14 16:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm, Interesting. - Mon Sep 14 16:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: It has no element. - Mon Sep 14 16:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Could ya teach it to me? I could trade it to you for earth or water techniques. - Mon Sep 14 16:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Or even a genjutsu defense technique. - Mon Sep 14 16:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I don't teach people what I know unless I've learned all I can from knowing it. - Mon Sep 14 16:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Fair enough, good thought process! I will wait then, I have many mastered techniques that I can show you. - Mon Sep 14 16:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Try again Violet. - Mon Sep 14 16:36:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Think about the connection between the water and your chakra. - Mon Sep 14 16:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: If the water flows... - Mon Sep 14 16:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Bad analogy... - Mon Sep 14 16:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Well, you'll get it. - Mon Sep 14 16:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: ... I will - Mon Sep 14 16:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Also. Try not to get too wet in this weather. I can regulate your body temperature but can't stop you from getting hypothermia. - Mon Sep 14 16:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: You'rekinda supposed to learn that stuff on your own but what Setsuna said is correct. - Mon Sep 14 16:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: It's not efficient, time-wise, to let her figure it out on her own, though... - Mon Sep 14 16:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I guess, I was just teaching the way I was taught. - Mon Sep 14 16:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) yawns slightly, rubbing the back of his head as he watched them. "I guess I'm going to go and head back to the mansion. There has to be some strong water release users  that I can train with around here." He'd note, and with a pivot--he'd head into the direction of the mansion.* - Mon Sep 14 16:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Namuko(Darkcore1245) says: Eh'. - Mon Sep 14 16:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Namuko(Darkcore1245) says: So what brings you here, Raikage? - Mon Sep 14 16:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) says: War. - Mon Sep 14 16:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nudges Namuko with his fist. "What up, pal?" He'd ask, with a friendly smile accompanied by bright green eyes.* - Mon Sep 14 16:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) says: I plan to destroy this village single-handedly. - Mon Sep 14 16:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) says: Prepare to die. - Mon Sep 14 16:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) dips into the earth, issuing chakra into the ground underneath him as it would loosen and allow him to venture within it's refuge. He was the Raikage, nothin this nigga could do about it.* - Mon Sep 14 16:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) says: I see. - Mon Sep 14 16:54:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) says: You shouldn't talk down to your fellow shinobi like that. - Mon Sep 14 18:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) waves a hand whereupon he began walking towards the waterfalls.* - Mon Sep 14 18:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) says: If he is lazy, give him ambition. - Mon Sep 14 18:27:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Exactly. - Mon Sep 14 18:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Namuko(Darkcore1245) says: Sparring you is a waste of time. - Mon Sep 14 18:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: But always wants to do the cool jobs. - Mon Sep 14 18:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) says: Possibly because his heart lies elsewhere. - Mon Sep 14 18:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Namuko(Darkcore1245) says: ..All i've asked to do is come here. - Mon Sep 14 18:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Namuko(Darkcore1245) says: And look where I am? - Mon Sep 14 18:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm... - Mon Sep 14 18:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Question.. - Mon Sep 14 18:29:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: *whistles* - Mon Sep 14 18:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm going to do more st=renuous training. - Mon Sep 14 18:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yo'... - Tue Sep 15 00:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..Uh-huh... - Tue Sep 15 00:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) poistoned himself nearby as he began to train on a technique.* - Tue Sep 15 00:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) stood there bored, though there was always something to train. At this very moment, he had more techniques to hone than he had already mastered or so it seemed like that. With alot of work to do, Yan would begin forming seals at an accelerated pace. With each one performed, chakra would be kneaded and thereafter molded into the composition which would bring the technique into fruition.  As he would finish performing it, he would prepare to try the technique a second time with the same energy as the first.* - Tue Sep 15 00:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) read the profiles of the bingo book. One of the enemies that they fought was a formidable dream weaver--a genjutsu specialist. If he was going to be able to fight in the war, he'd need to be able to cast and thrawt genjutsu. As he began to concentrate, the explosions sounded and beckoned his attention. He'd head in the direction to investigate.* - Tue Sep 15 00:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: I...don't know.... - Tue Sep 15 00:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) walked up to the group. He saw the fight occuring, and even though he wanted to watch, he would endure his training simultaneously. Before he did this, he would introduce himself to those ambient to him and make his presence known. "Yo'," he'd peer towards Kida with the bright smile he always garnished alongside two bright green eyes. "Name's Yan," he'd say lastly.* - Tue Sep 15 00:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Hassan.... You're Koeki's teacher right? Do you have any idea whats going on with her chakra right now? - Tue Sep 15 00:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded to the reply, diverting his attention from the other thereafter as another figure approached. It was the old man that he had seen around--someone that held prestige throughout The Hidden Mist. He'd approach. "Yo', so I was wondering if you could teach me some of your ninjutsu," he'd say, again, the same bright green eyes and illuminated smile.* - Tue Sep 15 00:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) folded his arms to his chest, watching the fray as it continued. It was amazing at what level the two were functioning and with the blast-back made by Tethys, Yan watched with widened eyes as her body was slammed into the wall. Of course, he was clear of any debris that may be thrown though he was sympathetic to the others. That being said, if they didn't dodge, he intended to help them out of the situation.* - Tue Sep 15 01:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) settled his eyes upon Jin. He didn't know the man, but he wasn't smart stopping a battle of this tier by trying to use a ninjutsu on them. He wasn't sure what was going to happen, but just in case, Yan began distributing chakra into the earth thereby changing the ground underneath him as he stood upon it. At any point, his form would descend into the earth.* - Tue Sep 15 01:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Why are they fighting like this? - Tue Sep 15 01:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) spoke toward Jin.* - Tue Sep 15 01:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: How are you speaking beneath the Earth? -omit- - Tue Sep 15 01:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: I don't know... - Tue Sep 15 01:25:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) scratches the back of his head. "Now, maybe I can spar someone..." He'd say as he stepped out into the water, applying suimen to stay on the surface.* - Tue Sep 15 01:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) thinks: Wonder if Koeki can heal me real quick... -omit-. - Tue Sep 15 01:30:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: I doubt she can hear you, Tethys. If she can, shes in worse shape then you. - Tue Sep 15 01:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Kida, you said? How's about we spar? - Tue Sep 15 01:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Um, alright.  - Tue Sep 15 01:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: My lord... - Tue Sep 15 01:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would move out onto the body of water, pivoting as he stood near the middle but slightly south so that the other could take position.* - Tue Sep 15 01:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Great... she has a concussion or shes so exhausted she can't stay awake. Either way... - Tue Sep 15 01:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Actually..let's spar on the earth. - Tue Sep 15 01:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: She'll.. be fine. - Tue Sep 15 01:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: So will I. - Tue Sep 15 01:36:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: When Hassan and I die, what then? - Tue Sep 15 01:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: How was I supposed to know I made the right decision of choosing Koeki as the next? - Tue Sep 15 01:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Don't even start where you're going with that! - Tue Sep 15 01:37:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Hmmmm. - Tue Sep 15 01:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: So she is the new kage? - Tue Sep 15 01:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: ... - Tue Sep 15 01:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Jin you need to respect his decisions. We dont know his intentions. The Kage clearly has an idea for Hassan, and himself. And, they cant do it apparently in their positions. - Tue Sep 15 01:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) assumed the same stance he did most times with shoulder-length parted feet as well as arms which were angled inward towards his chest to have hands positioned near one another in preparation to weave seals at any moment. That being said, he bent his knees and vaulted backwards to gain some distance. "Let's go then," he said as a few quick seals would be formed one after another. 

With the last seal, two three plumes of smoke billowed and expanded whereupon clones were revealed within their mass. All three clones would bolt forward, the two ahead ready to attack close range while the third prepared their chakra to be utilized.* - Tue Sep 15 01:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Who will be her assistant my lord? - Tue Sep 15 01:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noted the other sprung into action toward close combat, which meant that he was probably biased toward the range of combat and therefore would not be allowed to come into range of Yan to do that.

That being said, the third clone unleashed the mud river as he began throwing punches at the first two. Meanwhile, Yan would again move backwards and began weaving seals once again--in preparation of unleashing his own ninjutsu.* - Tue Sep 15 01:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would unleash the attack of his own as soon as the other jumped into the air. As he landed on the clone, or shortly thereafter, a stream of water would be in direct route toward him. It was a low-level technique but would be used to knock the other into the mud.* - Tue Sep 15 02:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) directed the remaining of the water gun's water into the river itself to enhance it ever-so-slightly, though he ceased his own technique and urged the clone to continue it as he ran forward. He wasn't especially fast, but he was above average within his skill ranking. As he ran, he made sure to form more seals thereby producing another troop of clones. As they appeared, they would be guarding their original body by creating a diamond around him, two in front.* - Tue Sep 15 02:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Join in the spar then. - Tue Sep 15 02:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Will it be a two on one spar my Lord? - Tue Sep 15 02:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched as the attack seemed to be working although the other managed to get to his feet. He had to be in pain by now due to being hit with two ninjutsu although the other may be more durable than anticipated. Nevertheless, the tiger seal was made which resulted in his opponent vanishing from sight.

"What the.." Yan immediately transferred chakra into the ground, thereby creating a tunnel from which he could manuever within. He would sink inside, having no chance to look around. If he was hit, it'd be the end of the spar. Meanwhile, his clones were looking around. Upon seeing him, the clones would lunge to attack once the other landed upon the ground with a flurry of kicks. One stayed back, readying the very same technique which had been used before. Meanwhile, Yan ascended from the earth not too far away but enough to where he wouldn't be a factor in the situation.

That being said, he'd begin stringing handseals again.* - Tue Sep 15 02:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) grinned as he watched the other battle the clones. He was going to utilize mud river, but that wasn't needed. In fact, Yan had a different idea in mind. Within the last seal, such came apparent. Since one was already in creation, and the others destroyed, Yan would create a total of eleven plumes of smoke. At this point twelve clones were created and they all rushed to fight Kida. He would be over-whelmed and his stamina would be killed. Needless to say, when he gave up, they would cease movement.* - Tue Sep 15 02:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) sat back and watched as the fight commensed against twelve Yan clone versuses one mist-nin. As the first elbow smashed into a clone, the explosive power reduced him to mud instantly though the mud served as a deterrent as another clone moved on the other side. The other clone would attempt to grab the other's arm, which was slowed in momentum due to the mud. Meanwhile, Yan would perform a few seals which would cause the clone who had been reduced to mud to re-form into a clone at which point an upper-cut would be aimed at the restrained Kida. Meanwhile, another clone would aim a kick which lunged forward and used its weight to hit the back of the other's knees in order to break his guard. All of the clones would close-in, preparing for the end. If this didn't work, then whatever combos Kida elaborated upon would be completed.* - Tue Sep 15 02:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: If my real enemies are anything like the mist-nin I've been sparring...I am getting stronger and stronger. This fight would have been over if I could use my deadly techniques. - Tue Sep 15 03:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...I had fun. - Tue Sep 15 03:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Same.. - Tue Sep 15 03:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ordered the remaining clones to pick him up and take him to wherever his home was. They would ensure he was tucked into bed and saw to anything he needed.* - Tue Sep 15 03:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: No, not at all. - Tue Sep 15 18:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Umm, mind giving me a few? - Tue Sep 15 18:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yo'... - Tue Sep 15 18:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukitani, Alice(Get Jazzy) says: A few? - Tue Sep 15 18:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Gross.. - Tue Sep 15 18:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Namuko(Darkcore1245) says: Eh'. - Tue Sep 15 18:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Namuko(Darkcore1245) says: So how is everyone? - Tue Sep 15 18:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: |wich - Tue Sep 15 18:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peered towards Alice in observation of her summoning technique. .He smiled brightly and casted those illuminated green eyes to her own. "Hiya..name's Yan." He'd say as he took measured steps toward her.* - Tue Sep 15 18:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukitani, Alice(Get Jazzy) says: These'll be good for scouting.. - Tue Sep 15 18:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: That's a summoning technique, huh? Pretty cool...I learned summoning after my brother passed and left me his summoning contract.. - Tue Sep 15 19:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm not great with it, though - Tue Sep 15 19:02:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peered towards Anguo as he approach, offering him a bright smile.* - Tue Sep 15 19:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If you learn to utilize water or earth style, I'll teach ya. - Tue Sep 15 19:03:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I dunno. - Tue Sep 15 19:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: I only know fire... - Tue Sep 15 19:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I don't know any fire, sorry! - Tue Sep 15 19:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: .... - Tue Sep 15 19:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Do you know any fire release techniques, Alice? - Tue Sep 15 19:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukitani, Alice(Get Jazzy) says: Nuhuh. - Tue Sep 15 19:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Sorry pal... - Tue Sep 15 19:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Fujitora knows fire release, I think! - Tue Sep 15 19:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: He does... - Tue Sep 15 19:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: And he won't teach me... - Tue Sep 15 19:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Why not? He taught me water release... - Tue Sep 15 19:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: I don't know... - Tue Sep 15 19:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Huh..odd. I'll talk to him and see if he can set aside some time to teach you. If anything, Izanami knows at least one fire release technique. - Tue Sep 15 19:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Welllll. - Tue Sep 15 19:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: Time to practice! - Tue Sep 15 19:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yo', what's going on peeps? - Tue Sep 15 23:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Hey Yan. - Tue Sep 15 23:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: What's going on? - Tue Sep 15 23:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Not much, I assume. - Tue Sep 15 23:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Boring.. - Tue Sep 15 23:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Is anyone down to do some training? - Tue Sep 15 23:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Nope. - Tue Sep 15 23:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I hurt my back yesterday. - Tue Sep 15 23:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) begins stretching idly,pulling one arm over his head as he pulled it toward stretching with his other hand. He would then begin reaching down to his toes, making sure his body was worked out as he waited for a response.* - Tue Sep 15 23:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I could barely take on those two kids. - Tue Sep 15 23:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Hmm? - Tue Sep 15 23:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: I want to see two people spar. - Tue Sep 15 23:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: How about Yan and Flexus go at it? - Tue Sep 15 23:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peered towards Flexus and then toward Tethys. He remembered the other's formidable taijutsu and grinned. It'd be the best fight he would have since he came to Mist. Unfortunately, those he fought so far in Mist there were genin were not a match to him.* - Tue Sep 15 23:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm down. - Tue Sep 15 23:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm going to go challenge him now. - Tue Sep 15 23:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ran off, not particuarly fast or flashy, yet he made his pace toward his endeavor to find Flexus.* - Tue Sep 15 23:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) walks up to the scene, applying chakra to his feet as he transitioned from solid land. He'd observe the situation before prying further.* - Tue Sep 15 23:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) grinned at Flexus mischeviously, as though a fire was lit from underneath him. "Lookin' to throw down. You game?" He'd ask.* - Tue Sep 15 23:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Hhmmmmmm I have been working on something new. - Tue Sep 15 23:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) pivoted and watched as he went on about showing Yan what he had developed. He expected extravagance based on his previous experiences with the teal-haired ninja.* - Tue Sep 15 23:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched with widened eyes as Flexus seemed to expand just as he had done before--but now with his entire body. The strength given alongside the physical growth was potent to uproot a tree. There was no fighting a giolath. But again, as Yan had s een before, the other lacked the chakra to maintain it for long periods. "You ready? Come at me." He'd say, readying his chakra as he began to perform seals. He had a remedy, he just hoped he was strong enough.* - Tue Sep 15 23:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) released the technique, though as he did, he'd jump into the air and narrowly avoid the tree trunk. With Flexus now in the midst of swinging and possibly not expecting a direct attack--Yan cleared his lips as water spewed from his mouth. It wasn't the normal amount of water, instead--Yan put a massive amount of chakra into this technique thereby increasing the volume of water. That being said, the water would emanate from his mouth and catapult as a roaring wave towards Flexus once it hit the ground. He put ten times the normal amount of chakra required to perform this technique. In additon, the pressure of the water would move his body backwards and out of immediate range of the Akimichi until he landed cleanly onto the water behind him.* - Tue Sep 15 23:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) had landed on the ground during his own attack, and therefore, was able to manuever again as the torrent of water was shot toward Yan. He'd lunge to the east as he kept weaving seals. Upon landing, a total of twelve of his clones were created and all of them ran towards the giant. A set of six jumped high--aiming for attacks that would be directed to his face while the other's remained ground-level and headed for the lower-portion of his body. Meanwhile, as soon as he hit a blind spot of flexus, he disengaged the suimen technique and he dropped into the water---swimming down.* - Wed Sep 16 00:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) could feel the pressure of water changing as the Akimichi hit it. Fortunately for him, he had reached the earth and began to fuse his chakra with it thereby gaining him access into its interior as it churned and changed in thickness and solidarity. Meanwhile, the clones were at the will of chance. As planned, the six bottom clones generated mud rivers which would occur as the other was landing, allowing them to replace the slick water with a gunk of mud which was slowly descending into the water though quickly replaced by the next torrent of mud. With traction possibly loss, they hoped to cause the Akimichi to spin in place as he'd be unable to get the traction needed to push his momentum forward.* - Wed Sep 16 00:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ascended above ground, just in time to hear Flexus give up. Yan was a tricky fighter. That being said, he worked to tire his opponents out instead of fight them directly. Once they were tired, they were easier marks. Yan wore a bright smile and bright green eyes as he looked over toward Flexus. "Yo', you are crazy strong," he'd say, extending an arm out to fist pump the taijutsu fighter.* - Wed Sep 16 00:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Nuh uh. - Wed Sep 16 00:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Not yet. - Wed Sep 16 00:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: What are you guys doing, daddy? - Wed Sep 16 00:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Oooh.. - Wed Sep 16 00:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Can I join? - Wed Sep 16 00:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Pleaaaaase? - Wed Sep 16 00:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: He's mean. - Wed Sep 16 00:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I don't want to show him anything. - Wed Sep 16 00:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: *<_<* - Wed Sep 16 00:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: He never says thank you or anything! - Wed Sep 16 00:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah, yeah. - Wed Sep 16 00:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I guess.. - Wed Sep 16 00:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: What should I show him? - Wed Sep 16 00:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Mmmkay. - Wed Sep 16 00:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) scratches his head as bright green eyes divert from Flexus and onto the new comer. Alongside moving eyes, a twitching nose became evident as he inhaled the rotten fish. "Sick man, go take a bath!" He'd say as beckoned him away with a wave of his hand.* - Wed Sep 16 00:37:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) folds his arms to his chest. One could say he had basic understanding of genjutsu and defensive tactics against it.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) took the scroll within his grasp, and as it had already been half-unraveled, he simply moved it some to take in the details of the scroll with intensity. The technique was of course a genjutsu, but one that involved trickery that was comparable to the very same techniques which Yan utilized in the field of ninjutsu. He was quite interested and read it over until he had an understanding.* - Wed Sep 16 01:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would continue reading the scroll until he finished the end of the scroll whereupon he raveled it back into the complete roll which it was presented to Yan. After doing this, he'd toss it towards Mizumi's location for him to do the very same thing that he had just done--learn the basics of the technique which was contained.* - Wed Sep 16 01:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) settled his eyes upon Mizumi. He was the target of his genjutsu, though he hoped the other wouldn't take it wrong. Yan felt that it wasn't as likely to be accurately casted if the opponent knew of the impending illusion. That being said, the other might find himself surrounded by ninja who lunged forward to attack him from multiple different angles.* - Wed Sep 16 01:39:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Give me a moment to try working these things out.. - Wed Sep 16 01:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) listened to Kirie speak out, as though the illusion hadn't effected her. With that in mind, he'd turn his attention towards her as he smiled. At this point, he would try and cast the genjutsu on her. "Yo', Kirie, right?" He'd ask, hoping to garner her attention as he winked at her. Of course, that would be the trigger to his genjutsu (20 Added up) would activate if he was adequately powerful enough to catch her. That being said, she would notice a wealth of ninja attacking and lunging at her as well.* - Wed Sep 16 01:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I think you both would want for me to master these first. - Wed Sep 16 01:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) grinned as he saw his technique seemingly startle her. As the illusions would come into contact with the flames, they would multiple and split off increasing the density of shinobi surrounding her at this point.* - Wed Sep 16 01:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would try and manipulate the technique, as he was the one casting the illusion, he would attempt to alter the hallucinations that were inflicted upon the woman. Instead of a ninja, he would attempt to put forth his mental powers to ensnare her mind--making her think that there were beasts within the lot of ninja. Feral dogs jumped at her from the crowd of shinobi, attempting to bite her. Although with it being an illusion, such would not occur.* - Wed Sep 16 01:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: So, how was your Genjutsu experience? - Wed Sep 16 02:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Of course. - Wed Sep 16 02:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: You know how to create chakra flow ? - Wed Sep 16 02:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: No. - Wed Sep 16 02:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I'm a master at it, I can teach you. - Wed Sep 16 02:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Chakra flow does sound interesting. - Wed Sep 16 02:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Indeed it does. - Wed Sep 16 02:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) feels his power over her dissipating as the illusions fade from visual perception. As it faded, he'd offer her a smile. "Did it work?!" He'd ask. Despite being a highly-intelligent ninja, he was a little bit of a dunce.* - Wed Sep 16 02:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Hmmm could I apply that to my bare hand? - Wed Sep 16 02:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Yes, a method of heating your inner chakra much like you would with the great fire ball, but trying to maintain this flame as well.. - Wed Sep 16 02:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: You can if you wear fire proof gloves. - Wed Sep 16 02:10:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Uh...I'm down! - Wed Sep 16 12:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm. Okay~ - Wed Sep 16 12:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And your name is...? - Wed Sep 16 12:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yan. You? - Wed Sep 16 12:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Lera, Nice to meet you. - Wed Sep 16 12:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Follow me. - Wed Sep 16 12:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You want first shot? - Wed Sep 16 12:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) grinned as she distanced herself from him. It made him wonder her intentions as far as how she was going to fight him..As far as he was concerned, the further distanced from one another the better. Yan's bright green eyes were casted toward her, a bright smile emanating the aura of benevolence evident, as he prepared to fight. He would remain in normal stature for the most part with the exception of hands which were suspended before his chest. Open palmed, with fingers partly curled in preparation to commense weaving seals. "Nah, come at me." He'd say while maintaining that grin.* - Wed Sep 16 12:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Okay~ - Wed Sep 16 12:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) allowed his grin to widen, taking on a more mischevious nature as he would join her in weaving seals as she had just finished and her technique coming into fruition. Within the blink of an eye, the string of seals were completed thereby molding his chakra into the composition necessary--thereafter infused with the earth release through nature transformation. 

Immediately plumes of smoke ignited all around Yan. He would play her game, though it was one he was quite accustomed to engaging in. That being said, a total of five clones would be revealed as the smoke expanded and eventually dissipated. "Two can play this game!" He'd say, his voice brimming with enthusiasm as all five clones ran forward towards her. That being said, their first goal would be to destroy the three clones separating them from the original female.

Yan would remain back stage, preparing his chakra as he would soon be transitioning into more techniques at any moment.* - Wed Sep 16 12:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ..... - Wed Sep 16 12:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched as his clones would spread apart. If she formed seals, that means she had something coming at them. That being said, as the clones distanced themselves from each other, the technique which was performed would ignite and probably kill multiple clones of both Yans and her own creation. Neverthless, there was a high chance that she would be unable to kill them all due to the distance needed to be covered.

Meanwhile, as the clones would get into position, the two that survived generated formidable rivers of mud that would project towards Lera. He hopefully could catch her off guard. One mud river would hit her position, while another hit the area just behind her. With the widening of the attack, the chance of hitting would increase. Since she used lightning release, Yan would probably stay away from water release.* - Wed Sep 16 13:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) sighed as he watched her sink into the ground. Based on his experiences with her so far, the two were identical in skill set though she used lightning release and he used water release. That being said, he wasn't use to being the aggressor and having someone on the run. He's form a few seals and allow the previous clone's existence to be extinguished as five new clones bursted into existence.

These clones would get on all fours, one after another--making a path for Yan to travel upon. Meanwhile, as he jumped onto the first and headed in the direction where the girl descended; the one he had just jumped off would scurry to the area in front of him so that he would have a new body to travel upon. He was mostly being silly, almost losing balance a few times as he made his way over at a slower pace. "Come out!" He'd yell aloud, and as he jumped from one to the other, he lunged forward and catch a clone's back with his hand where he flipped to the next one.* - Wed Sep 16 13:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was diddly-daddling at the moment, somewhat distracted from the fact that he was in a spar to the degree that he didn't notice her ascend from the earth at that very moment. Nevertheless, he did see her. He hadn't ever fought a wind release user, but he would try and utilize another source of chakra that he hadn't done yet in this match.


He strung together five seals in less than a second, whereupon he released his technique. This technique was on that wasn't absolute in its scale of power. Instead, it could be altered based upon the amount of chakra one put forth into it. He had downed the toughest opponents he had faced with this technique. As his mouth opened, a grand wealth of water would spill forth and rush towared the greatbreakthrough with formidable power. Yan had placed ten times the normal amount of chakra to increase the potency of this technique. At the very least, it would serve to stop the explosive tags from being a factor. (I"ll leave the outcome up to you.)* - Wed Sep 16 13:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Yo. - Wed Sep 16 13:49:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: So~ - Wed Sep 16 13:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: What brings you here, Jin. - Wed Sep 16 13:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: I'm tired from my training, and watching my ally spar was just a good option for me. - Wed Sep 16 13:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: What ally is that? - Wed Sep 16 14:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Which one was in Kirigakure in the beginning. - Wed Sep 16 14:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: No idea~ - Wed Sep 16 14:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: *sighs* - Wed Sep 16 14:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Must be Lera. - Wed Sep 16 14:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Good guess. - Wed Sep 16 14:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) realeased his previous technique soon after beginning it, long enough to create the volume of water which was used to combat the wind release technique. Having said that, as both techniques ceased and the water rushed outwards to either side due to the conflicting momentums of both the water and wind--Yan would form a handseal.

 If this girl was using offensive techniques now, she would probably continue to do so. He would use a means of defense that he had done so m

any times before. At the end of the seal he would perform the technique. Plumes of smoke ignited as clones appeared before him. Based on her movement and him weaving the seals, he might have time to get the clone technique off before he was struck. If so, one clone would appear in front of him whereas two other appeared at his side.

 From there Yan would attempt to form an X in front of his body to take any blow that his clones were not able to withstand. That being said, only one clone separated them. Upon the technique hitting the clone, if it didn't clear the area before the clone was created, the clone would be reduced to mud. Due to that, the velocity of the air bullet may be affected but to what degree was unknown if any at all.* - Wed Sep 16 14:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) wouldn't see the attack coming, but it didn't matter anyway. As soon as he had performed the mud clone technique, he thereafter began to transmit chakra into the ground before him. He would descend, both arms still angled to cross one another in front of him, and he would descend into the earth. As the fire release technique came into fruition, a blazing ball of fire projecting toward them, Yan would be dissapearing into the ground underneath both of them. 

Meanwhile, the clone in the middle would have been obliterated, and both of the other clones would leap out of the way. One would get caught, being completely destroyed in the wake of the fireball that etched its path along the land. As for the wind bullets, with their velocity dampened by the mud clone, they would slid over his shoulders. One would hit his hand, though since the original power would only leave stinging bruises, the result was a quick whip that would cause insignicant pain within the said hand.

With that, Yan would move underneath her while the clone which was spared the destruction of the fireball would chase towards her. Yan was brimming with both energy and chakra still, and he knew, the average ninja wasn't.* - Wed Sep 16 14:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) while he was able to sense her location via the magnetic sensory abilities granted to him through the technique itself, he had moved to her original location from which she lept from before performing the lightning release technique. That being said, he would not be hit by the lightning technique but soon would feel the clone degenerate into mud and theorized the worst..That she had defeated it. That wasn't a big deal, as his clones were created with the assumption that they would soon die.

Yan would now resort to a new technique he had just learned. After all, it seemed she knew every element and that was outstanding. He was bested as far as versatility in ninjutsu was concerned. "Yo', over here!" He'd call out loud, now to her right as she had strafed in her leap and hadn't moved south or north but rather east or west based upon their original positioning. When she turned to look towards him, most likely expecting seals to be formed on Yan's part, he would perform a single seal. This of course, was a facade.

If she looked towards him and took note that he was forming seals, which was likely based upon the tempo of this fight so far, she would be entranced by a genjutsu unless she was proficient against it. Immediately a wealth of ninja would appear around her, looking as though mud clones. Yan would leap back from her as the illusionary clones would be running around and past her, periodically attempting to strike though slow enough for her to easily dodge.* - Wed Sep 16 14:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched her descend into the earth. He used this opportunity to play with the technique. After all, she was at his mercy. He attemtped to manipulate the technique to a degree, and instead of her seeing ninja, she would see ominous-looking rodents burrowing through the earth.

 Since she wasn't able to see much beyond the line of sight granted by the magnetic senses and what was immediately within the space she inhabited, he thought it may scare her that something appears before her. 

That being said, an ugly, jagged-toothed mole would traverse into her immediate space--baring fangs though it had no ability to cause damage--it would definitely scare her. If she attacked it, two would split from it and it would burrow away soon to return from a different angle.* - Wed Sep 16 15:09:00 2015
