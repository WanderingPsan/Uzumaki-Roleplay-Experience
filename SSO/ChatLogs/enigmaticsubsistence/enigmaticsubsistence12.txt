<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thought for a moment he was going to be attacked, his green hues widening with surprise. As Tetsumi revealed himself, Yan's eyes settled once more though more serious than normal. "Are you okay?" He'd ask, examining the ninja's battered condition.* - Mon Oct  5 22:55:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was quiet for the most part. As they walked, he formed seals and created clones who went off in the endeavor to hunt. Soon they returned with rabbit. "You wanna take a break from our travel and eat something?" He'd say, taking the rabbit into his possession before extinguishing the clone who at that point was reduced to mud.* - Mon Oct  5 22:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods and smiles. He had no clue what the ninja had gone through over the extensive time he was off the radar of Suna. He proceeded with the process of skinning the rabbit and preparing it to be cookied. Meanwhile, he utilized clones to simultaneously gather materials for fire. It wasn't long before this was done, and the clones had created the fire, thereby allowing him to cook the rabbit. He sat by  the fire and watched the meat cook. "So, wanna talk about where you've been?" He said, his voice both sympathetic and curious.* - Mon Oct  5 23:07:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noticed the meat reach edible temperatures, the meat brown and the insides no longer retaining a fleshy consistency rather that of fully cooked meat.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) smiled and enjoyed his own portion. "Eat up, there's more..This is all I will need." He noted. He could definitely eat more, but it seemed Like Tetsumi hadn't ate in a while. He motioned towards the rabbit still roasting over the fire.* - Mon Oct  5 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) finished his meal, and assumed Tetsumi did the same, whereupon the y put out the fire and continued on. Yan cooked another rabbit and cut up the meat, placing it within a satchel which he gave to Tetsumi. "For the travel home."* - Mon Oct  5 23:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) as they approached the entrance to the village, both of them were immediately recognized. Yan waved as he assumed the normal bright smile which he wore often. The gate guards would let them in, yet their eyes would be somewhat cautious. They heard of the destruction of Konoha.* - Mon Oct  5 23:28:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: That's an epic earth technique...Maybe she'll teach me. - Tue Oct  6 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched on with widened eyes as the explosion occured and the pure chakra projected from the fist which slammed into the earth. It was an impressive technique and left Yan wondering if Tetsumi would get out of it unscathed. Hopefully Tetsumi's movements were deliberate and calculating, and not mindless.* - Tue Oct  6 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: I hope Kilm is just as strong...I have an appointment with him. - Tue Oct  6 04:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peers towards Trilliam, a bright smile placed upon his lips as they parted. "Done already?" He'd ask. Of course, he realized the magnitude of the spar was too much for Trilliam.* - Tue Oct  6 04:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Just keep training, is all I can say. - Tue Oct  6 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I remember back when my brother was alive..No matter what I did, he always seemed to be able to beat me. - Tue Oct  6 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Now..I'd like to think he'd be proud of me. - Tue Oct  6 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well...for the most part. - Tue Oct  6 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I know you will be a strong shinobi, Trilliam. I can see the fire in you. - Tue Oct  6 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: If you say soo... - Tue Oct  6 04:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Now I want to spar... - Tue Oct  6 04:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) retracts his form to the ground, as knees were bent, before he pushed off and catapulted backwards toward the building. He would apply chakra to his hands and feet, creating adhesive to allow him to manuever upon the wall of the shop as he ascended to it's top. From there he would hop from building to building, his aim to return to the square. He had seen enough. If she couldn't take down the beast of a ninja with that explosion technique, then she wasn't going to at all.* - Tue Oct  6 04:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm looking for a spar. - Tue Oct  6 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Who's down? - Tue Oct  6 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Huh? - Tue Oct  6 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Uh..guess I am! - Tue Oct  6 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Let's go. - Tue Oct  6 05:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) beckons her with a single hand, pivoting simultaneously as he carved a path to the training field.* - Tue Oct  6 05:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Alright. - Tue Oct  6 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Let's do this! - Tue Oct  6 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) pushes his feet apart, implanted into the sand, as well as his hands an inch in distance from one another at chest level. "Show me how much stronger you've gotten," he said, his hands moving together to form seals.* - Tue Oct  6 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) wouldn't hesitate to release his technique. Of course, it was nonlethal and of water release. That being said, at the end of the string of seals that would more than likely be done in conjunction with the manifesting of the billowing smoke that encroached his vision of the girl, the wealth of water would spill from a gaping mouth thereafter rushing towards the girl with formidable momentum and expanse.* - Tue Oct  6 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) released his own technique in view of her evasion, catapulting upwards into the air once knees were bent and momentum was built up as a result. Now ascending aerial, he would perform another seal which would activate a technique that most were familiar with. That being said, five clones would appear in the air beside him. 

"Can't stay up here for long--" 

One clone would grab his arm, spinning in the air as they gathered momentum. In addition, two of the other clones would perform the same manuever on the other two which would cause Yan and two of the clones to be sent catapulting west-bound away from both the clone of Izanami and the original Izanami. Honestly, he was unsure which was which as they both emerged simultaneously from the smoke.

As he landed on the ground, he would fall into a roll and pivot. Similiarly, the clones would as well and would position themselves in front of Yan for protection. Meanwhile, the two clones that were still airbourne began forming seals amidst their descent. Once they landed upon the ground, they would be prepared to utilize their own ninjutsu.* - Tue Oct  6 05:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) formed a singular seal thereby kneading his chakra in preparation to release a technique though such would be post-poned to the proper time. Simultaneously, the two who landed upon the ground would have finished their technique. One held their technique whereas the other released his. While normally spikes, pillars protruded from the ground. These pillars were simliar in width and functioned the same apart from piercing potential. That being said, they would come from different angles in an attempt to lock the girl in position. Meanwhile, the other clone held their technique but did not release it as it might not be necessary.

In order to prevent damage occuring to Yan, the clones which protected Yan would purposely place themselves in the way of the shuriken. That being said, with the added protection, he might remain unscathed. Any shuriken that passed through the clone defense would be met with the water gun technique, which was prepared to be unleashed upon any shuriken that would bypass the clones.* - Tue Oct  6 05:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would release the water gun technique, surprised or not by the henge, he was prepared to do such and would dispatch the clone with the potency of the technique without issue.

Meanwhile, since she dodged the technique, it would go into it's next phase, wherein the clone which held the technique would slam his hand upon the ground thereby acquiring the ability to manipulate the pillars that rose from the earth. 

With that said, the pillars would shoot up toward her from the ground, aiming to catch her off guard being that she was mid-air.* - Tue Oct  6 05:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: Gotcha'. - Tue Oct  6 05:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) grinned, having relinquished the water technique upon destruction of the immediate opposition against him. He was pleased to see her fare so well against him, rising above expectations as he anticipated the spears catching her. Nevertheless, she was now distanced away and regardless of her abilities--that was not in her favor.

His hands would come together, though he wouldn't form seals yet. Once her technique was revealed, the fireball projecting from her mouth, he would begin performing seals as well. It would be nothing to breeze through the required string of seals before his own technique would come into fruition.

Again, he would allow water to pour from his lips. At their distance, he would be able to get the technique off before the formidable fire ball would reach him. That being said, the water would would rush forward and connect with the fireball. 

Upon the two techniques meeting, steam would roll from the two of them as both would fight for domination. Unfortunately for Izanami, Yan had the elemental advantage as well as the skill in ninjutsu..That being said, the water technique would over-power the fireball and continue towards her.* - Tue Oct  6 06:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) performed another seal, holding it as he began building chakra. Unfortunately, there aren't many that had been able to strike Yan. Then again, he had many more ninja to fight in the world that were much stronger than he was. "Are you ready?" He'd ask, preparing to perform yet another technique.* - Tue Oct  6 06:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) released the water technique, dumbfounded how she continued to evade his attacks with such nimble manuevers. She must be super skilled and fast, her roll was somehow able to take her out of harm's way. She must have done like four rolls, who knows though.

At any rate, he formed a single seal as she rolled onto all fours thereby kneading  chakra and preparing it to be utilized. As he did this, he would taunt her. "Are you ready to continue?" He'd ask. He was still brimming with both chakra and energy. That being said, he was just getting started.* - Tue Oct  6 06:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: This guy always pops up out of no where! - Tue Oct  6 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) notes he has already been there and even spoke. Yan averted his gaze towards Sanoke, a man whom he knew very little about. In fact, he had challenged the man to a spar before and was turned down. Why the sudden change? Yan concluded that time simply changed people and their priorities. Maybe it was because some felt Yan needed to be defeated for once. Either way, he released the seal which would have ultimately led into a genjutsu and scratched the back of his head.

"Raincheck?" (I was just going to finish this spar and lay down. It's 1:30 am and I'm ready to lay down..been up since early this morn. I was gon do the gen and bury her neck-deep which would have been done in two or so rounds)* - Tue Oct  6 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: How good are you with Fuuinjutsu? - Tue Oct  6 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Eh. I've gotten as far as the Lotus Seal. - Tue Oct  6 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Dunno' what that is but it sounds cool. - Tue Oct  6 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: So I can set traps. But I can't take away chakra, or restrict movements. - Tue Oct  6 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'll teach you earth release if you teach me the basics of sealing techniques. - Tue Oct  6 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh, that's easy. Alright. - Tue Oct  6 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Later though. - Tue Oct  6 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: M'kay. - Tue Oct  6 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And Izanami, it was fun sparring you. - Tue Oct  6 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You're becoming an awesome ninja, even at such a young age. - Tue Oct  6 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You roll so quickly! - Tue Oct  6 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I honestly don't know how you do that. - Tue Oct  6 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeah, you're pretty good for a little girl. - Tue Oct  6 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: About half as good as me, when I was your age. - Tue Oct  6 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) runs off.* - Tue Oct  6 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: How'd the fight end? - Tue Oct  6 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) glances at Katsune.* - Tue Oct  6 06:46:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I met him there. I dunno much else about him. - Tue Oct  6 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: He's a purposeless ninja, but he means well. I am working on giving him a reason to get stronger. - Tue Oct  6 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The sand boy? Or Tetsu? - Tue Oct  6 06:49:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You and Yan versus me? - Tue Oct  6 16:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I don't do partners in spars - Tue Oct  6 16:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I have enough help as it stands. - Tue Oct  6 16:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Let's go ahead and do this. - Tue Oct  6 16:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Taiha - Tue Oct  6 16:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: You know you wann get in this - Tue Oct  6 16:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) tilted his neck thereby projecting crackling sounds as he broke into movement in a southeastern direction.* - Tue Oct  6 16:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Eh, I'm fine. - Tue Oct  6 16:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Who's going first? - Tue Oct  6 16:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: There's a place for spars, let's go there. - Tue Oct  6 16:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Tue Oct  6 16:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Is this area occupied? - Tue Oct  6 16:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Find yourself a comfortable starting position. - Tue Oct  6 16:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) settled into his own stance, whereupon his feet drew apart on the ground until shoulder-length and his hands came together yet noncontingent--remaining no more than an inch apart with curled digits prepared and loosened to formulate seals. Within the exterior, a wealth of chakra and physical energy churned, ready to explode though trained to accumulate and concentrate in preparation to be utilized. "On your go," he noted, a friendly smile forming upon his expression.* - Tue Oct  6 16:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: This is going to be fun. - Tue Oct  6 16:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) pushed his hands together, digits skillfully weaving seals within a fraction of a second. Unlike with the others, the level of skill within Kilm was unknown yet his  comrade's had been revealed. That being siad, with Katsune's destructive prowess and willingness to show it on the battlefield--ever precaution would be made to ensure that such destruction would be induced upon Yan. 

That being said, the area around Yan would be enveloped in a multitude of manifesting clouds of smoke which billowed until the young ninja was no longer visible to some angles. As the smoke settled, a total of ten clones would have been created. Three pushed chakra into the earth below them, whereupon they drew themselves into the ground via the hidden mole technique.

Three of the clones would burst into a run forwared and the remaining four would station themselves within the base cardinal directions around Yan's position. From there, they would see how Kilm reacted.* - Tue Oct  6 16:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Eh. Not like their stray fire could hit me anyway. - Tue Oct  6 16:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) grinned. Yan immediately recognized what Kilm was trying to accomplish, yet he over-estimated the clone's speed. Truth be told, the clones weren't even near enough to him that he would be able to strike them with the lightning technique--not the ones underground at least. 

With that said, the lightning would coarse through the opposing forces that were the clones, reducing them to a steaming pile of mud. Meanwhile, the clone  at the rear of Yan would begin forming seals. Within the span of a second he was finished, and the technique would activate thereby forcing pillars(not spikes since this is a spar) to protrude from the ground. Instead of forming upon him, they would form at his back--the idea wa to push him forward by startling him from the attack at the rear. Only one pillar, which surfaced from nearly underneath him, yet inches towards his front, would threaten to hit him due to the angle of the pillar's erection.

Meanwhile, Yan would form a single seal and hold onto it as chakra was kneaded and the technique prepared in anticipation of Kilm's evasive manuevers from the clone's earth release technique.* - Tue Oct  6 16:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) realized enough time had been bought. He released his technique once the other had been struck by the pillars, instead allowing his clones to do the remainder of the work. With Kilm being slightly stunned by the damage induced upon him through the pillars, the clones would strike. four hands would extend from the ground, two clones attempting to grab both ankles in order to pull Kilm downwared. Additionally, the other clone surfaced higher, grabbing at his legs to aid in pushing him down.  That being said, the handseals would probably be hindered by these actions.

If it worked, the clones would pull Kilm down until he was submerged neck deep, at which point Yan would extingiush the clones and the ground around Kilm would return to normal thus trapping him. * - Tue Oct  6 17:12:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched as the explosion erupted. Regardless if he was doing it or Kilm was self-inflicting, damage induced was toward his favor. Additionally, with the spears being destroyed and debris casted omni-directional from Kilm, one could not help but happen upon an idea of his own.

Seals were quickly formed, each one done in a fraction of a second which allowed five to be created in succession in the span of a second. At the last one, he would twist and slam his palm into the ground whereupon he acquired the ability to manipulate the earth. That debris which was all around Kilm would animate and shoot toward him in all directions--aiming to pelt him to cause even more damage.* - Tue Oct  6 17:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would be trapped within the genjutsu whereupon he heard the roaring fire above him. With that said, he quickly reacted. He pushed chakra into the ground thereby allowing him to dig into the ground and relieve himself of the damage that may occur had he not been able to dodge the descending fire. Additionally, all four of the remaining clones would rush forward. In timed strategy, each one would release a mud river. One would release, allowing Kilm to dodge, at which point the other would release, then the next--all based upon Kilm's next evasive manuever. With his slowed pace, Yan wanted to tire him out more and make it easier to land the move.

Meanwhile, even underground, Yan was getting extraordinarily hot, additionally, his clones were still alive and he had not sensed any terra being destroyed by the blast of fire which would have undoubtedly slammed into the ground by now. He had his own theories, but the heat was unimaginable. The only conclusion is that this was a genjutsu, as no ninjutsu would be able to reach him like this without causing destruction the ground around him. That being said, with the realization that it was a genjutsu through logical thinking, he stomached the heat and continued on. It wasn't something that would cause him physical pain, so in the end, he'd simply struggle to deal with the nature of the heat as long as he was exposed to the genjutsu.* - Tue Oct  6 17:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Should start wrapping this up so we can go to the square. - Tue Oct  6 17:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) sensed the destruction of his clones, though he hadn't moved towards Kilm as he knew the earth flash would be devastating and he wouldn't attempt to make himself vulnerable to such a technique. In fact, raiton was the one technique which he feared. Yan would surface from the ground, the heat immense upon his form. "Okay, okay. I give..." He said, sweat pouring down his face from the heat which was nothing but a illusion.* - Tue Oct  6 17:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) hopes he wasn't lolhit by the water tech, as he assumed he'd surface after such was concluded.* - Tue Oct  6 17:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods and heads off towards the square. "I am a practioner of genjutsu as well...Maybe we can trade techniques sometime." He'd say as he headed off. (I want that B rank water tech)* - Tue Oct  6 18:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yeah. - Tue Oct  6 18:02:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He has to take noticeable damage for me to win. - Tue Oct  6 19:45:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: <*Fidgets glasses*> I wonder when they're going to come attack. I'unno. . . Some weird group I've heard rumors about. - Tue Oct  6 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) listens to Sanoke as his hand ventures into the satchel located upon his hip. As his hands slides into it, it grasps upon one of three scrolls and brandishes it into open view whereupon he unraveled it. Upon doing so, he would begin reading the contents. "Is Ichiro, the man that hurt Tetsu, part of this group?" He'd ask, half-listening as he read teh scroll.* - Tue Oct  6 19:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would continue reading the technique, paying special attention to the seals which were required for the kneading of the chakra. "Do you know anything about the man? I intend on putting him down for hurting one of my ninja." He said, as Tetsu was placed under him, he felt a degree of duty to prevent him from being attacked by the man further. Additionally, he didn't invest much faith in the boy being able to do it himself.* - Tue Oct  6 19:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Eh, nothing really. He's just strong physically. - Tue Oct  6 19:57:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thought about Baen at that moment--someone who had evaded Yan before based on metagame. His lips cringed and his eyes narrowed, though his focus remained on reading the scroll. After all, he wasn't going to learn it otherwise. He'd sit on the ground, placing the scroll before him, as he would slowly practice the seals required.* - Tue Oct  6 19:59:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) begins walking towards the exterior of the village. "Where does Baen call home? I am going to pay him a visit." He'd say as he progressed.* - Wed Oct  7 04:39:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) with lack of an answer, Yan would continue heading out towards the gate of the village.
