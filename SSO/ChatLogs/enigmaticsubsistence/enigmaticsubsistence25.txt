<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) replies with widened eyes, as he couldn't react in time to stop the Jinchuuriki. Luckily, it didn't attack him. Nevertheless, he didn't know it was a jinchuuriki per say. Yan pushed chakra into the ground, dropping down immediately as he utilized his quickest means of traveling. He moved fifteen feet per second, and would dive until he was in the ground.* - Wed Nov 11 01:59:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: But out of uniform, they are common village folk, only one is even a registered shinobi. - Wed Nov 11 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Next time, I'd appreciate the heads up on things like that. I understand the need for it though. - Wed Nov 11 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: So they take complete orders from you out of uniform. - Wed Nov 11 02:35:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) formed several seals. With that said, he walkeventured towards the sight which they were to bury him. With one seal formed, several mud clones would be created as a result. One clone would perform the hidden mole technique, whereupon the ground would be softened, at which point the other five would perform several seals before slamming their hands into the ground. The loosened particles of earth would be manipulated, therefore each granule would rise from the earth as the clone would lower until it was six feet deep and the length of a human. The clone would help loosen the dirt to help lift it. 

As a result, there would be plenty of time for Marrisa to put the body into the hole.d over to the burial sight* - Wed Nov 11 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...So, about Tetsumi. - Wed Nov 11 02:43:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You're telling that to the person who defined the word "Loss" - Wed Nov 11 02:45:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Don't worry about it. - Wed Nov 11 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: How about I show you guys something I have been working on? - Wed Nov 11 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I am sure Yan and I would love to see it sir. - Wed Nov 11 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..Certainly, sir.. - Wed Nov 11 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: Mitsunara is waiting on me.. - Wed Nov 11 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) is impressed by the vast wind release technique, and as more people came and hassan announced his departure. Yan simply dipped into the ground. * - Wed Nov 11 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) finally returned. As he came in, he removed his armor and jounin suit, setting them down in his room before he came out. As he did, he'd simply be wearing some blue house pants and he would sit down. "I hope you have one rolled.." He said in a seemingly tired manner. The man had litereally an unlimited amount of energy, and so, he wasn't truly tired rather simple done.* - Wed Nov 11 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Alright. I'll check on them. - Wed Nov 11 02:58:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: They better not be doing anything in my brathroom... - Wed Nov 11 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods and turns around. He'd notice Mitsunara. "Let's go smoke one.." He suggested.* - Wed Nov 11 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, Sure. - Wed Nov 11 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) takes a seat, sighing heavily. "So..." He said, patting the table lightly. Supposedly she had rolled joints, yet he hadn't seen them.* - Wed Nov 11 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would be sitting down indian-style. He'd nod and grab one, popping it into his mouth. "That's what happens when you betray the village. I don't like killing, but it is the way it is." He said with an absolute feeling upon it. He'd light the joint and begin smoking it, whereupon he'd hand it to her.


'So...what'd you want to talk about?" He'd ask, the build-up having him rather interested in hearing it.* - Wed Nov 11 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I already know. - Wed Nov 11 03:17:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Well the- wait. - Wed Nov 11 03:17:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: No. I am just a jounin of this village. - Wed Nov 11 03:20:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: .... Fair enough, I guess. - Wed Nov 11 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Any other questions about... my proffession? - Wed Nov 11 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: We had a necromancer before that couldn't handle that. - Wed Nov 11 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I orderd him killed. - Wed Nov 11 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: So you can't control people at all, can you? - Wed Nov 11 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I see. Take it he... what? Put personal power first? Or ju- Hrm? Nah, not at all. - Wed Nov 11 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I didn't learn that shit - Wed Nov 11 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I learned what I used to execute that guy. - Wed Nov 11 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: He was assaulting women with his mind-control necromancy. - Wed Nov 11 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I kill people, and devour their souls to empower mine, which I then use as a weapon. - Wed Nov 11 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I don't do shit to you that anyone else can't, until you're already dead. - Wed Nov 11 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ....Well. - Wed Nov 11 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) hits the weed. One, twice..then the third long and hard. He'd hold the smoke in before blowing it out into a massive cloud. "That seems pretty crazy. I'm just normal ass guy." He'd say with a little laugh before handing over the joint. "I told Bryson to leave you alone, though." He'd note thereafter, his laugh simmering into a more dismissive tone of the subject..as though he was satisfied himself.* - Wed Nov 11 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods as he took the joint, leaning back as he yawned slightly. "Yeah..He's a good guy, but you two will never get along. It's best just to steer clear of him." Yan would say just before taking a hit.



"So...I don't know if I should ask you if you are okay after killing that guy or not.." Yan said honestly, ashing the blunt. They would undoubtedly be passing this thoughout the conversation, regardless of mention or not.* - Wed Nov 11 03:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) listened intently, taking a drag as she spoke. He thought about the first time he had killed someone--the emotions he had felt. It was in the middle of battle, and honestly, with adrenaline and all--he kept moving after the kill thoughtlessly. It was only after the battle that, once everything had settled, did he look back and realize what he had done. But in the end, he was but a ninja. No one should become a ninja unless death was something they were willing to grow accustomed to. Then again, many had no choice.

Then he thought of Mitsunara, and something she had said earlier. It had caught him off-guard, and with the situation, he simply ignored it and continued on. He was unsure if he would or should breech the subject. "Are you hungry? What's your favorite?" He'd ask instead, figuring that it was about time to eat anyway.* - Wed Nov 11 03:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Oh.. - Wed Nov 11 03:40:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) forms a seal, producing a shadow clone. "Uh...go get us some chicken curry and.." He looked to Mitsunara. "Want some sushi? I can have him drop by Fuji's place and get some.." He'd say, and upon her answer yes or no, the clone would leave. Of course, he woudl bring rice as a side dish to go with everything.* - Wed Nov 11 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: That'd be nice, sure. - Wed Nov 11 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: *The clone left.* So..... - Wed Nov 11 03:42:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) 's clone would return with the food. He's sit the food down whereupon Yan would dispell the conjuration of ninjutsu. With everything set out, and plates and forks placed in front of them; all there was left to do is eat.  Yan would invite her to the food with the gesture of his hand. While she got what she wanted, he'd pose a question. "So, how's your ribs feeling?" He asked in reference towards the injury. Other than the question, food was on his mind. He was quite hungry.* - Wed Nov 11 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods and make shis own plate. He had plenty of food, and so, he helped himself as he hadn't ate since early in the morning hours. "Good to hear. If you don't get better, then we can never spar," he'd note as he took in a piece of sushi, chewing it a few times before swalllowing it.

"A'hem..sorry. Clones? Uh, I've been doing them since I was a graduate from the academy. I have three different clone techniques, two elemental and the Shadow clone technique, the base and most versatile one." He'd state, continuing to eat thereafter.* - Wed Nov 11 03:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods and stands up, quickly hopping to his room where he grabbed his jounin suit. "I think I have a f--..yeah, got it." He'd say after rummaging through his stuff. He'd hop back onto his seat and place it on the corner of the table between them.* - Wed Nov 11 04:05:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I placed her on your bed, Yan. - Wed Nov 11 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hope you don't mind. - Wed Nov 11 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) notes ortho and nods. "I guess I can crash out here tonight.." He said. "You didn't have to help her, and for that, I'm grateful....There's some food here if you want..Chicken curry..rice...and some sushi." He'd say, the food was all over the table as he bought in excess.* - Wed Nov 11 04:09:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) didn't move quite yet, though the statement did put him on alert. Needless to say, all he had were simple soft-clothed pants on and wasn't prepared to fight. "You killed people in Mist, I've heard through my sources. If you want to react to what you heard, let's go outside first at least. This is my home," he'd note.* - Wed Nov 11 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ..Shitttt. - Wed Nov 11 04:16:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: How about instead of going straight to 'Meet me the fuck outside.' - Wed Nov 11 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: We all get dressed up fully, get shit in order- and talk this out, like cool little fonzies. - Wed Nov 11 04:17:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ehhh? - Wed Nov 11 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) studied the man as he spoke. He looked at the details, where his eyes were as he spoke and what he did with his body as he told the story. In the end, his eyes narrowed and he diverted towards the ground for a moment.

"Very well. I would have done the same thing." He stated, after all--he had vowed to kill the man who had taken the life of his own brother prematurely. At this point, it was all that he lived for beyond ensuring the longevity of his village. If it wasn't for his village, the score between Edge and himself would have been settled long before by either of their death.

Yan would gesture towards the food. "The invitation still stands," he spoke in reference towards the large amount of food in front of them. As for the fight, as he had told Mitsunara, Yan killed out of necessity--the quell evil before it became more than what it was just then. That's what happened with Baen, Erebus and even as Yan read in history--Zetsumo. Of course, they were all dead now too. * - Wed Nov 11 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) simply nods.* - Wed Nov 11 04:36:03 2015

"...Can anyone explain?" He'd ask.* - Wed Nov 11 17:34:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm almost finished training... - Wed Nov 11 17:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I feel like I'm about halfway there. - Wed Nov 11 17:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I have alot of other duties, anyway. - Wed Nov 11 17:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. - Wed Nov 11 17:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It's hard to just sit around and train. - Wed Nov 11 17:44:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Shinobi graveyard is to the north. I don't know if we bury just any shinobi there or our shinobi specifically.. - Wed Nov 11 17:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: But since you made the kill, go bury him north of that. - Wed Nov 11 17:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It's beyond the gates...so be careful. - Wed Nov 11 17:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: If i'm going to bury him, It'll be till that Zenaki person arrives. If she uses bodies then I wouldn't mind passing her one. - Wed Nov 11 17:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Then go put it into the morgue underneath the hospital. - Wed Nov 11 18:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Thanks, man. - Wed Nov 11 18:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: No problem. - Wed Nov 11 18:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: So....yep. - Wed Nov 11 18:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I guess I have to go handle the guard situation. - Wed Nov 11 18:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) sighs as he breaks his posture and goes into movement towards the narrow valley that was the gates of The Hidden Sand. He would have to make an account, send letters to the families and numerous other things...As he told Lera, Yan was often never free to train all day as he once was.* - Wed Nov 11 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Good luck. - Wed Nov 11 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noted no fire or crazy wreckage other than the destruction of wall, with debris of rock and stone smashed into the ground--indenting the sands which gave way to a certain degree to the falling momentum of the rocks from the cliff. As he arrived entirely, he was immediately met with commanders and other high-ranking officials of the guard. Also, medical ninja had already arrived upon the scene to handle the wounded and dead--both of which were apparent.

Yan sighed and began listening to the commanders. They had reports, statistics and other information relevant to the nature of the incident as well as how efficient the guard were at their job. Having said that, the commanders answered to him and he answered to Hassan. As they finished speaking, Yan would simply reply.

"We failed here today," and as he spoke this--the commanders were eerily silent.

"Based on reports, the mud dragon appeared with the individual. That means that they were far into the distance, as we would have sensed him. Additionally, this failure today is on a lack of no strategy by our guards. I want the commanders of this unit to constantly test the mettle of their units!" Yan yelled, the last sentence, as he felt passionate about the protection of his village and he wanted the commanders to have the same level of commitment.

"From now on, the guard will be having weekly strategy classes at the academy. That being said, each day a different unit will have a class so schedule all of it and have the report of it's creation on my desk BY TODAY!  Send letters of condolensces to their families and make sure they have some sort of way without this pension for a few months." He'd note as he turned away, heading off the scene. Things were going to change as far as these sorts of things went.* - Wed Nov 11 18:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would appear behind Aoi, having approached from the gates. He seemed rather bothered at the moment, his expression less friendly than what those ambient to him would be accustomed to seeing.

That being said, he glanced at Aoi's butt briefly to admire it before passing by her or continueing right along behind her depending if she kept walking. He'd then sit on the bench, and prepare to start training a new technique.* - Wed Nov 11 18:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would attempt to learn the technique in which Lera had utilized. That being said, he would close his eyes and simply focus upon the chakra which was coarsing throughout the chakra circulatory system within his body. As he did so, he would manipulate the mentioned chakra as he would attempt to visualize the very quintessence of hardness, or rock, as his extremities would lift and thereafter two hands would converge upon one another. As they did, each digit would fall into place until the snake seal was completed. With the chakra kneaded, he would spread it upon his epidermis however there was no physical change to his skin.(1)

was seemingly unphased by his inability to perform the technique. Based on her description of the technique, and what it would do--it seemed like an ability which required much work and time before one would be able to utilize it effectively in battle. That being said, he cleared his mind of thoughts which distracted him from the task and simply honed in on his chakra. Again, through visualization, he pictured a durable stone within his mind.  AS he did this, he would push his hands together and attempt to perform the technique again although nothing would occur.(2)

grunted for just a moment. If he was going to master this technique, then he would need to put his all into it. He contemplated what he was doing wrong, and of course, he thought it might be a visualization problem. Yeah, picture a rock, but could one be more definitive in that creation within ones mind? He honed in his chakra, and formed the rock which was in his mind. Though it began as a simple rock, it would expand and form, growing extremities and general human characteristics. As he formed the snake seal and kneaded his chakra, he concentrated a layer of chakra on his finger specifically. It could feel it hardening slightly, but nothing significant.(3)

felt he was making progress. After all, since there was hardening upon his finger, it meant that he had applied the right manipulation of chakra and that the very essence of the technique was acquired within the scope of its function. Nevertheless, it would be ineffective in battle and so he couldn't really say he knew it either way. That being said, he would do the very same deed and visualize the rock within his mind. Simultanously, he would manpulate his chakra as though it would form that rock. Finally, he formed the snake seal. (4)

activated the technique upon forming the snake seal. Though when he formed the seal, he then visualized the rock to take on a different form. Much like he did when it became the form of his own body, he instead concentrated it to a very smaller, specific area which would be his hand. He would exert the chakra and spread it upon the entirety of his right hand. And with his eyes opening, they would direct downwards and narrow upon the hand in which the armor would effect him. Unfortunately, it was again rather insignificant. Nevertheless, progress was being made.(5)

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was prepared to move, though he would try to make it easier on her. As she approached he formed a seal, kneading chakra in preparation. However, as she came closer, and brandished a open-hand to strike--he was bewildered.

Her hand would slap the shit out of Yan, his face moving to the side slightly. "..." He'd just stare at her, unsure if he should take her seriously at this point or not.* - Wed Nov 11 20:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) raised a brow, inspecting her as she seemingly seemed distraught over his reaction. "Uh...yeah, I'm okay." He said, releasing his seal.

"That's not usually how a ninja attacks, is all." He stated skeptically.* - Wed Nov 11 20:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: Oh there's somebody in my spot. - Wed Nov 11 20:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods and pushes his hand forward. "That's not necessary." If she went through the attack, his hand would be already extended and therefore it would instinctively dart down to intercept the knee which was only a small movement of his hands.

The force of the knee hurt his hand though, however it wasn't anything that would prevent him further. Having said that, the force also pushed it back and he leapt back to accomodate that momentum.

"Wow, sneaky." He spoke. She was clever, but how clever was she beyond that one ploy? Yan would find out.

"I hope that's not your best though," He'd state plainly, forming a single seal as a jet of water pushed out of his gullet once chakra was convered into the liquid. It woul shoot from his mouth, approximately fifteen feet per second, yet he was dumbing down the power to accomodate her own level.* - Wed Nov 11 20:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: Wonder if I can join in. - Wed Nov 11 20:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...Are you done already? - Wed Nov 11 20:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: . . . - Wed Nov 11 20:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: You're too strong... - Wed Nov 11 20:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I'll take you on. - Wed Nov 11 20:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: I thought this was a physical spar... - Wed Nov 11 20:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I'll take you on in a physical spar. - Wed Nov 11 20:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) sighs, scratching the back of his head. "Both of you can try taking me on if you want..." He said, and as Aoi spoke, he replied. "Uh, nah, spar is testing all jutsu styles. I'm an elementalist, I told you that..." He stated.* - Wed Nov 11 20:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Lies! - Wed Nov 11 20:24:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Smoking? - Wed Nov 11 20:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah, a little chief chief. - Wed Nov 11 20:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I'll spar you. I need to spar someone around my level for this mission anywho. - Wed Nov 11 20:25:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: People keep telling me this. - Wed Nov 11 20:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) plops on the ground beside her. "I didn't hurt you that bad.." He'd say as he folded his arms so that his hands would rest underneath his head. "You could die tomorrow from doing what you do everyday. What's the big deal about smoking?" He'd reason with her about the subject. "It makes you feel good, relieves stress in a world that you see dead bodies everyday..."* - Wed Nov 11 20:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I just use my toy when I feel stressed... - Wed Nov 11 20:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: Did I say that aloud? - Wed Nov 11 20:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: But.... - Wed Nov 11 20:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: I don't know... - Wed Nov 11 20:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I feel like if I could die tomorrow, I'll make sure I enjoy today. - Wed Nov 11 20:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Of course, you should make your own decision. - Wed Nov 11 20:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: But it makes you smelly. - Wed Nov 11 20:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) lifts up and stands, holding his hand out to help her up.* - Wed Nov 11 20:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Do you want to die smelly? - Wed Nov 11 20:32:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I love the smell of marijuana. - Wed Nov 11 20:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And I wear calogne. - Wed Nov 11 20:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peers uneasily towards her back, and then her butt. Such impure thoughts. He'd pat the sand off her back as best as he could. "Uh, yeah..that's good." He'd say, leaving her butt alone specifically.* - Wed Nov 11 20:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Thanks, now you can ugh...go smoke...I'll just watch. - Wed Nov 11 20:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods, wincing slightly slightly averting his gaze towards Mana. "You want to come?" He'd ask the girl as other arrived.* - Wed Nov 11 20:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: I think she's spacing out. - Wed Nov 11 20:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Fair enough...let's go. - Wed Nov 11 20:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would depart from the training field, unless hindered, and head straight to his home.* - Wed Nov 11 20:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: You have a nice home. - Wed Nov 11 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah..I get paid a nice salary. - Wed Nov 11 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Doing what? - Wed Nov 11 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would remove his armor from his body, revealing only a jounin suit underneath without the vest. He'd then take a seat and reach underneath the table to retrieve the tray of weed he kept there.

"So tell me about yourself," he'd suggest as he began breaking down premium nuggets of marijuana. By then, the skunky aroma would be emanating from it.* - Wed Nov 11 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm a jounin, commander of the guard...Paper pusher for the Kage... - Wed Nov 11 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ....What are you doing here? - Wed Nov 11 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Midora(Tsundere-san) says: Why not be here? - Wed Nov 11 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: This is my home...It's not open to the public. - Wed Nov 11 20:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) is currently breaking down bud.* - Wed Nov 11 20:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) broke down the bud completely. He would then begin rolling it into joint paper. The process would be about thirty seconds in all, as he was a seasoned roller.

"Anyway, about yourself.." He'd look at Midora..She was getting on his last nerve. She ate his food, smoked his weed..couldn't even suck a nigga's dick.* - Wed Nov 11 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) is noticably talking aoi tho.* - Wed Nov 11 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Well, you know my name...Ugh... - Wed Nov 11 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: I've lived in Sunagakure all my life. - Wed Nov 11 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: I don't really know how to talk about myself...Sorry. - Wed Nov 11 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) had rolled the joint, sticking it between his lips as he cupped over it with one hand and lit the joint to a cherry with the opposite. As she said the last of her dialogue, he would have pulled on it, held it in and would have been blowing it out. 

"What are your interests, your aspirations as a shinobi..." He spoke, giving her ideas as he would take another hit. The smoke was filling the air, rising until expansion caused it to be almost invisible at this point.* - Wed Nov 11 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noticed the discomfort but she put herself in this positon, and not the other way around. Despite this, he'd do his best to blow the smoke in the opposite direction for the duration of the conversation.

"Well, like I said, I'm a jounin. I've lived in three different hidden villages but I've always remained loyal to The Hidden Sands." He noted, taking another hit inbetween his dialogue. "I've fought in one war, multiple battles...But I was mostly a support ninja back then..." He said. He had served in the battles as someone who often times prevented damage to others and hadn't really done much killing himself during the war. "My parents were ninja here, and I have a brother as well." He noted.* - Wed Nov 11 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Oh, you're very decorated I see... - Wed Nov 11 21:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I've been around the block. - Wed Nov 11 21:19:34 2015
