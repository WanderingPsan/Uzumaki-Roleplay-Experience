<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Alright.  .That seems like a plan - Wed Nov  4 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Katsune, at one point, was the Hokage. I don't know the current state of Konoha, but perhaps we should start there. - Wed Nov  4 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would walk alongside her, entering the caravan as they would take off thereafter.* - Wed Nov  4 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded and would do so as well. After all, he was the type that would do this anyway.* - Wed Nov  4 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Where your best.  . - Wed Nov  4 01:26:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) looks towards the girl who just arrived, beckoning Marrisa's attention upon her with the gesture of his hand.* - Wed Nov  4 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: What about her? - Wed Nov  4 01:33:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ishizu 'Ai' Maxwell(Zela12) says: I went looking for a friend, however she's not here. I was going to determine the best route back to the village while coming here, and now I saw you guys. - Wed Nov  4 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Form up with us, That's an order Kunoichi - Wed Nov  4 01:38:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If you'd like, while you stay here, I can go check the mansion for anyone that may be able to help us. - Wed Nov  4 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ishizu 'Ai' Maxwell(Zela12) whispers: Oh, sadly I have not. - Wed Nov  4 01:46:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods and heads forward. He wondered if Ishizu had permission to be wandering around, though it wouldn't do any good to investigate that now. He'd wait to get back to Sand to do so.* - Wed Nov  4 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) shakes his head, emerging from the interior of the mansion a few minutes after entering. It seemed that he wasn't able to acquire a meeting with anyone of note. "Nothing," he'd reply, looking around in hopes to see a moving figure to question. Either way, they would want to make their rounds in the village before leaving. His next guess was Cloud village, or perhaps Rain.* - Wed Nov  4 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Alright. .  - Wed Nov  4 01:50:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I already have permission for the Hokage to question anyone I want within this village, from a previous encounter. Attempting to contact him was a formality - Wed Nov  4 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: From** - Wed Nov  4 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Who is the Hokage these days? - Wed Nov  4 01:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It changes so much.. - Wed Nov  4 01:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Zeus - Wed Nov  4 01:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I don't recognize the name. - Wed Nov  4 01:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: At any rate, I'll be waiting her unless you object. - Wed Nov  4 01:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I will form a shadow clone and have him wait at the entrance as well. If she tries to escape and kills the clone, we will know. - Wed Nov  4 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) formed a single handseal, the chakra kneaded and thereafter molded, whreupon a plume of smoke would appear beside him. The other Yan would smile and nod, already knowing his duty as he ran off towards the entrance.* - Wed Nov  4 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Ishizu, Stay with Yan - Wed Nov  4 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: So, did you find your friend? - Wed Nov  4 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ishizu 'Ai' Maxwell(Zela12) says: If who tries to escape? - Wed Nov  4 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ishizu 'Ai' Maxwell(Zela12) says: And no I did not. - Wed Nov  4 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Our target. - Wed Nov  4 02:02:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Nada - Wed Nov  4 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods and would do the same. "Let's go then. Where to next?" He'd ask, his eyes falling toward Ishizu to ensure she left alongside them.* - Wed Nov  4 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Mist has been under attack as of late. . So let's go to Kumo's remains? - Wed Nov  4 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Sounds good. - Wed Nov  4 02:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'll cop the caravan this time. - Wed Nov  4 02:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ishizu 'Ai' Maxwell(Zela12) says: Hmm? - Wed Nov  4 02:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ishizu 'Ai' Maxwell(Zela12) says: Is anyone even within Kumogakure? - Wed Nov  4 02:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: The less populated the more likely we will find her. She's definitely going to be trying to lay low with all of Suna looking for her. - Wed Nov  4 02:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: mhmm - Wed Nov  4 02:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ishizu 'Ai' Maxwell(Zela12) says: True - Wed Nov  4 02:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would make the necessary arrangements for them to acquire another caravan which was headed towards Kumo. He would make sure both kunoichi were on the caravan at which point it would set off through the landscape of The Land of Fire, ultimately heading north towards more barren landscape.* - Wed Nov  4 02:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ishizu 'Ai' Maxwell(Zela12) says: How much does it cost for such a trip? - Wed Nov  4 02:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: About fifty grand. - Wed Nov  4 02:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ishizu 'Ai' Maxwell(Zela12) says: Whoa. . . - Wed Nov  4 02:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would continue to practice the ninjutsu. With that said, he would form the shadow clone-oriented seal which would produce yet another likeness of Yan. Yan would then form several other seals as his form would then dip into the ground once both chakra and focus were trained to perform the technique. As he dove into the ground, he would quickly emerge as his form manuevered underenath the clone through the earth. As a result of grabbing and pulling the clone down, Yan would capture the clone with only his head exposed and quickly resurface.* - Wed Nov  4 02:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Empty - Wed Nov  4 02:25:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'd send a messenger bird back to Hassan to update him, maybe she's hiding in the village. - Wed Nov  4 02:25:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Maybe - Wed Nov  4 02:28:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would proceed to head towards the village in question through the caravan that they hopped onto after paying.* - Wed Nov  4 02:33:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would form three clones, all of which would sink into the ground. Meanwhile, Yan himself would move forward into the arena. If he could help end this, he would.* - Wed Nov  4 03:06:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) stepped forward. "I can be your opponent now. One on one...It's about time I end this little game you've been planning." He stated, his expression firm. There was too much volatility in the village as of late and Yan would see one facet of the problem ended now.* - Wed Nov  4 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Labyrinth, Aklys(Sephiroth3000) says: You may as well tremble now and beg. - Wed Nov  4 03:33:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Labyrinth, Aklys(Sephiroth3000) says: So far, only one has pushed me to a limit...And one foolishly placed me past that limit with new energy.. - Wed Nov  4 03:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) thinks: Confirmed... he has kidney stones from my strike. - Wed Nov  4 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) thinks: Hmmmm so i could overload him I wonder how much he could take before boom. - Wed Nov  4 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) quickly forms a handseal, one finger intersecting another to form the seal that was familiarized as the shadow clone forming seal. "Let's skip the pleasantries,"  he'd say as one clone moved forward and three remained around the newly-promoted Jounin. With that being said, the clone which ran forward would engage in close range and the other two would begin forming seals behind him.

Yan would so as well, each seal formed so that a string would be accomplisehd within a fraction of a second.* - Wed Nov  4 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) thinks: Ipushed his limits, but Yan will have to do better than I. Because now he's at a whole new level. - Wed Nov  4 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would slam his hand on the ground. Simultaneously, the other two would as well. With that said, three large mud walls would be created in front of the group. He would attempt to space them out, enough to over lap only slightly as to cover a wide range. Meanwhile, two clones he had created before entering the field of battle would be positioned in different locations. both would surface afterward at the man's flank.

With handseals formed, the two would then project a thick, unusual material from their mouth that would shoot towards an air-bourne Aklys.* - Wed Nov  4 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Koji, go get Hassan! - Wed Nov  4 03:58:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Hassan is sick and left him for us to deal with.  - Wed Nov  4 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Tch, this guy again? - Wed Nov  4 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: And I missed my chance to fight him aggain too - Wed Nov  4 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) is out this round. oocly washes dishes.* - Wed Nov  4 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Labyrinth, Aklys(Sephiroth3000) thinks: Fighting Kiters become dull and boring... - Wed Nov  4 04:21:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Huh? - Wed Nov  4 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Labyrinth, Aklys(Sephiroth3000) says: Heh...Those who have nothing to do.. - Wed Nov  4 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Labyrinth, Aklys(Sephiroth3000) says: You shinobi.. - Wed Nov  4 04:31:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'm no shinobi, but a monk of the Lightning Temple. I don't linger in the shadows, rather I bathe myself in the light. - Wed Nov  4 04:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) thinks: Nope. - Wed Nov  4 04:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: You again. - Wed Nov  4 04:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I rather end this with words rather than violence.  What can I do for you to stop your nonsense? - Wed Nov  4 04:33:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: ... - Wed Nov  4 04:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would have recovered by now, taking position beside Shin. Likewise, he would form a singular seal which wasn't the normal seal for shadow clone. Instead, he was going for quanitty instead of quality. That being said, he would convert his chakra and and expell it, thus creating ten clones which formed from the earth below them. 

Seven of them would run forward, and three would sink into the ground below.* - Wed Nov  4 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: One hundred and Sixty percent chakra left... - Wed Nov  4 04:49:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Yeah, but all of his 'honor bashing' - Wed Nov  4 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: And he's the one who ends up running away everytime - Wed Nov  4 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm not concerned with his games, nor should any of you. - Wed Nov  4 04:53:32 2015
