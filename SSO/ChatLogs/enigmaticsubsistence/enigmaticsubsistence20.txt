<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Does that change his status with us? - Wed Nov  4 17:10:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) centers both his focus and chakra. As he brought his hands together, each digit would move into its own positionining as began to form a few other seals. With each seal, his chakra was thereafter molded and at the end of the handseal formation, the chakra had been completely formed into it's proper consistancy and structure. With that being said, Yan shot out a thick liquid that would project across the area.* - Wed Nov  4 17:15:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I'll never get better if I don't - Wed Nov  4 18:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: What was that!? - Wed Nov  4 18:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Did ANYONE else hear that? - Wed Nov  4 18:19:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) heard the explosion from afar, the fire which erupting casted over the horizon of buildings that would otherwise block the sight of where the hospital was. Additionally, rolling black smoke projected upwards from the sight. "I don't know, but I'm going to find out. Prepare everyone here and notify Hassan if he's around," He'd say to Shin before running off towards the hospital.* - Wed Nov  4 18:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) forms a single handseal, kneading and forming his chakra whereupon he would expel it.

On cue, two shadow clones would enter the building quickly, looking for survivors, whereas the other three alongside Yan would begin performing water release techniques to kill the fire projecting from the exterior.* - Wed Nov  4 18:22:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) forms a number of seals, the rate in which they were created rapid, at which ponit a jet of water would rush from his mouth and combat the flames. With the amount of water he spewed, the flames would be killed within a matter of moments.* - Wed Nov  4 18:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) forms a number of seordered the clones he had created before nearby the hospital to head towards the gate, at which point they would inform the guard to be on lock down and not let anyone leave or enter the village. This would span across the wall, and everyone would be watching for unknown ninja.* - Wed Nov  4 18:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: The village is on lockdown. Get everyone to the center of the village. If anyone is seen roaming, they will be detained and questioned. - Wed Nov  4 18:31:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: This is the reason for the second explosion at least. A very flamable material that can only be found here - Wed Nov  4 18:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) approaches the scene, the second explosion evident within the distance as he ventured from the north quadrant of the village. "What?" He looked towards Shin, and the substanec which he had, whereupon he'd take it and look at it. "....There's only two people that could do this....Katsune and Trilliam. Unless someone else has learned this unique ability." He'd reply. "Kuro said he saw someone, yet he lost them I'm guessing. I haven't found anyone." He'd shake his head as he said. He needed to find this person and put them to justice as this wasn't to be tolerated. Either way, the enemy was trapped within these walls.* - Wed Nov  4 18:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I can probably find out who it's from. If it's from either of the two. I remember what their chakra looks like. - Wed Nov  4 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Then let's see. - Wed Nov  4 18:50:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: It seems we are being attacked from within - Wed Nov  4 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Two explosions, one triggered from a ninjutsu and the other, a secondary explosion likely created to kill anyone who investiagted, triggered by the Sunagakure's on 'Pop Sand' an older type of explosive material - Wed Nov  4 18:52:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Hmmm . . . - Wed Nov  4 18:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I've probably seen them, but it has to be someone from this village. - Wed Nov  4 18:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Or, someone working with someone in the village. Do you know who used to live in this house? - Wed Nov  4 18:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Don't know. - Wed Nov  4 18:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) looks towards Tetsumi. "Maybe you can find them from an aerial view Tetsumi." He'd suggest, a heavy sigh drawing with Kuro's words. "Why would someone in our village want to attack? What do we know about Leo? He said something odd before about causing chaos."* - Wed Nov  4 18:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: He did say that . . .  - Wed Nov  4 19:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Come to think of it, I haven't seen him before today - Wed Nov  4 19:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Shin and Kuro, can you see if you can match Leo's chakra to this incident? - Wed Nov  4 19:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: He hasn't left the village yet. - Wed Nov  4 19:01:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Sounds simple enough - Wed Nov  4 19:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Whose house is this, we should give them our sincerest condolences - Wed Nov  4 19:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: We will find that out. - Wed Nov  4 19:02:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yeah? - Wed Nov  4 19:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Can you check on Leo with Shin? - Wed Nov  4 19:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Sure. - Wed Nov  4 19:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I am going to make a round around the village. - Wed Nov  4 19:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: On the way - Wed Nov  4 19:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would run off east, then south. He would scan the village from the perspective of ground-level, as he wasn't as talented as Tetsumi or some others.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: He'd be able to determine if the material was infused with Ortho's. - Wed Nov  4 19:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Katsune? Why would Katsune do it? As a matter of fact, why would Trilliam do it. - Wed Nov  4 19:18:49 2015

"Leo, you are under arrest for planting and igniting bombs on civilian homes." He'd state, each clone positioning himself around Leo in case of noncompliance. Yan himself would be ready as well, hands hovering inches from one another.* - Wed Nov  4 19:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) shot through a string of seals before a thick, tan liquid would project from his mouth.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) rubs his head. He wasn't really digging a philosophical conversation at the moment.

Then again, he didn't even have any interests as far as women were concerned. "I'm about to go to my house to take a load off and smoke. Would you like to come?" He'd ask her, cracking his bones in his neck as he tilted his head to the side from one way to the other.* - Wed Nov  4 20:26:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peers towards Ketsuki, his eyes somewhat red as he provided a rather goofy smile. "Hello, I haven't met you before...Name's Yan." He'd introduce himself, nodding in reply to Marrisa's words. * - Wed Nov  4 20:46:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: But if you are telling the truth, then maybe I misunderstood Lera or she mispoke herself. - Wed Nov  4 21:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) says: It does if the man you described showed up not ten minutes after the fire was put out, not smelling of smoke at all, and inquiring on what had happened. - Wed Nov  4 21:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Either way, she did say that Ortho attacked the village. So one way or another, he's a suspect in the Mizukage's death. - Wed Nov  4 21:45:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) says: Ask anyone in Kirigakure this, he shouted it atop a giant snake. - Wed Nov  4 21:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) shakes his head, thinking for a moment. Maybe he had been too brash to ask Marrisa to question her through genjutsu, yet it was either she was dumb and ignorant or lying. He figured it was the first of the two.* - Wed Nov  4 21:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So.... - Wed Nov  4 21:49:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) thinks: What is she doing here? - Wed Nov  4 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) arrives at the gates alongside one guard who had notified me of a ninja's presence. Upon his arrival, the guard would take position again and Yan would inspect the approaching shinobi. "Hello..." He'd say, looking for any headband or indication of origin.* - Wed Nov  4 21:56:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, harsh. - Wed Nov  4 23:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Marrisa and I already set out and checked the major villages other than The Hidden Mist. - Wed Nov  4 23:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: We can go at it for another round though. - Wed Nov  4 23:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm eager to bring her to justice. - Wed Nov  4 23:33:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: What are you guys exploring for? - Wed Nov  4 23:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Katsune's whereabouts. - Wed Nov  4 23:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: All of em'.. And she still hasn't emerged?.. - Wed Nov  4 23:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: It'll be trouble if we enter Kirigakure. Mhmm.. I'm prepared for the worse. - Wed Nov  4 23:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: M'hm. Konoha is on the look out for her as well. - Wed Nov  4 23:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Ah. Yeah, those places would be obvious. - Wed Nov  4 23:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: If I was a person on the run. I'd just hide out in the forest. - Wed Nov  4 23:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Good. - Wed Nov  4 23:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: And from what i've heard. Kirigakure is no more. - Wed Nov  4 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah, people seem to think while Ortho was the one who attacked, he wasn't the one to kill the Mizukage. - Wed Nov  4 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I highly doubt that though. - Wed Nov  4 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: This Lera person seems to not exist..hmm.. - Wed Nov  4 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Ah. So it was him -- Funny. - Wed Nov  4 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Here's one of the old Kirigakure shinobi now. - Wed Nov  4 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: He isn't the one that killed her. But he just starts to attack the village? - Wed Nov  4 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: What's your name again, kunoichi? - Wed Nov  4 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Mana...still haven't found that perosn you said to report to. - Wed Nov  4 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Tell me what happened the day of the Mizukage's death...if you were around. - Wed Nov  4 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Ortho, a giant snake, and over two thousand bandits attacked. I didn't see the mizukage die, but I did see Elon and Violet pass.  - Wed Nov  4 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If you want, we can go in private. - Wed Nov  4 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: It doesn't really matter where it's discussed. It'll all be common information eventually anyways. - Wed Nov  4 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Uh-huh. - Wed Nov  4 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Thanks. - Wed Nov  4 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: A girl told me that he arrived around five minutes after the Mizukage died and asked what happened, which left her to believe that he wasn't the one that did it. I just have a hard time believing that he wasn't involved. - Wed Nov  4 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Kana didn't take the news of her brother's death too bad though. She kind of just walked off. - Wed Nov  4 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Especially since he was in Sand before that and went to the village right before the attack. Everything points to him being the one..but anyway. - Wed Nov  4 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I don't know if Ortho killed the Mizukage, but I do know he killed the other two. - Wed Nov  4 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: He had that... - Wed Nov  4 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Those eyes.. - Wed Nov  4 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: The red ones. - Wed Nov  4 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I've seen them but I know very little about them. - Wed Nov  4 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Anywho he said something about his actions leading to peace.  - Wed Nov  4 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I'm not quite sure how I feel about the situation overall. - Wed Nov  4 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Everyone claims to be working in the name of peace to justify whatever they want. - Wed Nov  4 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: What he did won't promote peace. - Wed Nov  4 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: His death will, though. - Wed Nov  4 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Same with Katsune. - Wed Nov  4 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And what about Baen? - Wed Nov  4 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: No idea who those people are. - Wed Nov  4 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I heard he was in Kirigakure.. - Wed Nov  4 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I'm pretty new to this whole shinobi gig. I graduated the academy only a few weeks ago. - Wed Nov  4 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I think I did see someone named Baen. He threatened to kill me. - Wed Nov  4 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: He's not a good guy. - Wed Nov  4 23:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: He came off as kind of an asshole. - Wed Nov  4 23:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Anyway..Tetsumi, if you want to head out let me know. - Wed Nov  4 23:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: I'm only coming out of retirement for this task. Its the least I could do for Kilm. - Wed Nov  4 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: So uh if we're staying here for a while... - Wed Nov  4 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I couldn't find anyone to help me better my proficiency in taijutsu in Kiri...any of you willing to do so? - Wed Nov  4 23:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Taijutsu isn't my forte, sorry. - Wed Nov  4 23:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Nor is it Tetsumi's, I imagine. - Wed Nov  4 23:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: -omit-  - Wed Nov  4 23:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) takes a seat on the bench beside Tetsumi, as it seemed they were to leave soon.* - Wed Nov  4 23:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Hassan. - Wed Nov  4 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Guess not... - Wed Nov  4 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: Wonder if I can still do missions. - Wed Nov  4 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: We had a recent bombing attack by a mentally ill genin. It was stopped and he was detained. - Wed Nov  4 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: His name is Leo and he's in jail. (maybe offline, dunno'.) - Wed Nov  4 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: So...what now? - Wed Nov  4 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Also, with Kirigakure in ruins, your daughter has asked if we give refuge to the genin of Kirigakure for the time being. I told her yes for a temporary span of time until we got official permission from you. - Wed Nov  4 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) whispers: What's his reason for bombing, does he have any important iformation. Also regarding Kirigakure, if you deem it should be so i'll sign off. - Wed Nov  4 23:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: He stated that "people said they were bored so he thought he'd give them something to do". He didn't seem very rational and of sound mind. - Wed Nov  4 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: Quiet bunch...guess i'll try and find some action somewhere. - Wed Nov  4 23:57:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Her name is Mana...apparently someone focused in taijutsu. - Wed Nov  4 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) whispers: Intresting. - Wed Nov  4 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Mana, this is our Kazekage. - Wed Nov  4 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) whispers: Either lock the boy in solitary confinement or kill him. - Wed Nov  4 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: The man that is allowing you to stay here safely. - Wed Nov  4 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Thanks. - Wed Nov  4 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) whispers: We don't need any of his types around these parts. - Wed Nov  4 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Nice to meet you. - Wed Nov  4 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Will do, I'll put out the order to put his life to an end. No point in keeping someone of that mentality alive with knowledge of ninjutsu. - Wed Nov  4 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) whispers: Exactly. - Wed Nov  4 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Mana, if you'd like, I can train with you. - Wed Nov  4 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) whispers: If he legit wants to keep his character, give hi the option to break out of prison and run away)) - Thu Nov  5 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm not a taijutsu specialist, or even taijutsu proficient, but I can push you to strengthen your own abilities in taijutsu. - Thu Nov  5 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: (k) - Thu Nov  5 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) whispers: But if its a 1 off just kill it) - Thu Nov  5 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: That'd be great! - Thu Nov  5 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Fair enough...Let's go to the training area. - Thu Nov  5 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: I think second chances are great, grandpa. - Thu Nov  5 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) beckoned her with a hand as he broke into movement towards the south-west. "Tetsumi, when you are ready, come get me from there." He'd say as he trudged off.* - Thu Nov  5 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) stood where he was, and watched her pace from him in preparation. For a taijutsu user, she sure gave herself a good distance to start form. Idealistically, she'd want to start from a closer position but Yan guessed that was her trying to be proper about it.

"Come at me, when you are ready," he said finally as he fell into a loose sparring stance. * - Thu Nov  5 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Hello... - Thu Nov  5 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) says: .... - Thu Nov  5 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noticed this was the second time today he had spoken to a female and been ignored. A brow raised as he thought to wondered to himself if there was something stuck in his teeth.

"What? Ya' don't wanna talk to me?" He said, clearly peering at Yoko with vibrant green eyes and a friendly smile that matched a benevolent aura.* - Thu Nov  5 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: Oh, he's distracted. Should I wait? - Thu Nov  5 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Ah, well, if you want to join our fight..just jump in. - Thu Nov  5 00:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: C'mon - Thu Nov  5 00:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noted she was fast. He wasn't exactly slow though, not by the standards of a genin anyway. This was one of the very few fights that he might be able to engage in close ranged combat. As she approached, launching into the air thereafter as her form positioned into a flying forward kick, Yan would react accordingly.

His right leg would move back and toward the left, coming behind his form as his left foot would pivot and in turn would bring his body around. Meanwhile, he would lean back slightly, thus avoiding the flying forward kick all together.

Simultaneous to this, he would bring his hands together to form one seal, whereupon both feet would have planted into the ground and he would pivot his body to face her now who was heading the opposite direction. 

He would hold the technique briefly, allowing her to regain stature and react, before unleashing a low-level stream of water which jetted from his mouth and projected towards her position.* - Thu Nov  5 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) released the jet of water spewing from his lips, water trickling from lips which formed into a satisfied grin. She had dodged his water gun, yet he had allowed her time to prepare for such an evasion. He wouldn't be as nice to her next time, as measuring her skill was necessary before applying pressure to her abilities.

As she moved forward towards him, he wouldn't hesitate to unleash another low-level technique. Kneading and expelling his chakra, the ground before him would erupt as a small river of mud would erupt from the sand to project forwards at a rapid speed. The mud moved at approximately fifteen feet per second, and would close in on her quickly. 

If she was able to get off the suiton jutsu in time, it would more than likely be over-taken by the mud river and even supplement Yan's own technique.* - Thu Nov  5 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: What you guys going to do? - Thu Nov  5 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Mhmm...  - Thu Nov  5 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Going to bring justice for the dead. - Thu Nov  5 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Soo.. He's supposed to be my little brother too huh. *sigh* Damn whore of a father. - Thu Nov  5 01:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Oh.. - Thu Nov  5 01:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: To this...Kilm, guy? - Thu Nov  5 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Yes. - Thu Nov  5 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Can I come? - Thu Nov  5 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) narrowed his eyes as the mud river was defeated by the raging water, a technique he was quite familiar with and had mastered quite a long time ago. Nevertheless, he pushed chakra into the ground below him, changing its very elemental state as it transitioned to a liquid and he delved within it. As the sphere of water entrapped where he once was it would seem as he was captured.

But then, hands would erupt from the ground underneath her, and he would attempt to grab her feet and pull her underneath. He used the wave of water and the developing sphere to conceal his descent so he hoped it would all come as a suprise and she would be left off-guard and at the whim of his technique. In the end, if all went according to plan, she would be neck-deep into the ground and Yan would be standing to the south peering down towards her.

If he was fine, and Tetsumi appeared to see him fine, Yan would simply smile. "All finished up here anyway. I guess I gave her a little too much room to move around and she almost captured me," He said with an uneasy chuckle as he would then transfer chakra into the ground, turning it into a consistency where he could easily pull her out and to her feet.

If he was caught, then he would wait to be freed simply.* - Thu Nov  5 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Err... I'm afraid not. The culprit is very dangerous. - Thu Nov  5 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Oh...next time right? - Thu Nov  5 01:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Sure. - Thu Nov  5 01:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Cool! - Thu Nov  5 01:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I hope she's easier to find this time around. - Thu Nov  5 01:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah, good job. Keep it up. - Thu Nov  5 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You are ready then, Tetsumi? - Thu Nov  5 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Yeah. - Thu Nov  5 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) reaches into his satchel and pulls out a blunt, lighting it up as he took a long drag. He'd hold the smoke in, reaching to hand it to Tetsumi. He wasn't sure, but Tetsumi looked like he could use some either way.* - Thu Nov  5 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) hit it a few more times, smothering the cherry between two fingers before he slipped it back into his satchel. "Cool...." He'd say as he began trudging through the sands. "Mana, maybe one of these can help you~." He spoke, his voice light as he made his way from the group.* - Thu Nov  5 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Do you have any idea where we should start? - Thu Nov  5 01:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: No... But.. I guess we'll start with Konoha. Then, we'll continue our searches to the other villages. Though I'll probably use my third eye technique to search the village first, just incase we stumble into a trap. - Thu Nov  5 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Right...Caravan or on foot...or your platform? - Thu Nov  5 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Mhmm...  - Thu Nov  5 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: If we go on a caravan, we'd probably be expecting company... - Thu Nov  5 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: On foot.. we'll be noticed coming. Especially with the jounin attire. - Thu Nov  5 01:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: By air, maybe we'll be able to go unnoticed.. - Thu Nov  5 01:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: And incase we stumble into trouble... - Thu Nov  5 01:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Let's go by air then, it'll allow a better view of our surroundings anwyay. - Thu Nov  5 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: I'll use the third eye technique from the safety of my platform.. - Thu Nov  5 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Like Sanoke said, she might be in the forests. - Thu Nov  5 01:24:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) braced himself as the platform formed underneath them, at which point they flew into the air. He applied suimen to his feet at first, not exactly comfortable in the air as he was. "So Tetsumi...what have you been up to?" He'd say as he peered over the edge and down onto the sands they traversed over high into the sky.* - Thu Nov  5 01:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) didn't really know who Madelyn was, and so it meant little to him but he realized that it did impact him some. "I see..." He replied plainly, slightly high and unsure what to say. While he respected Tetsumi, they had little in common. That being said, silence would take over as they both kept their eyes out for the kunoichi or her accomplice, Index.* - Thu Nov  5 01:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: We'll search the lesser villages as well. From up here, I'll use my technique. I'll be able to see everything. - Thu Nov  5 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) sat indian-style now, stationed at the front of the platform. He was close enough to the edge that if he leaned over, gripping the edge of the platform with his hand, he could peer down below as they zoomed across the landscape. His eyes were set on watching intently. "If you want, I can send some shadow clones down to scan the area as well. When I disengage them, any information they come across will be returned to me. I don't want to waste the chakra if you don't think it'll help, though," He'd speak towards Tetsumi as he peered over the edge, now peering at a tree line of forests which was difficult to see through.* - Thu Nov  5 02:06:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) shrugged and kept his eyes on the area before them, as they then zoomed closer to Konohagakure. It seemed like they would be there in no time with the pace they were moving at.* - Thu Nov  5 02:28:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded as Tetsumi spoke to him, bewildered at who it could be. "And who's that?" He'd question, and while they weren't on a general mission, bagging any rogues or criminals would be something he'd be interested in ultimately. * - Thu Nov  5 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would hop off the iron sand platform, thereafter heading towards the interior. "How many ninja are with her?" He'd ask before entering.* - Thu Nov  5 02:59:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) forms a seal, creating a shadow bunshin that would run off behind him to go fetch Tetsumi.* - Thu Nov  5 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) formed several handseals, kneading water based chakra as it spewed from his mouth in the form of a thick, tan object that would bind the girl in place upon contact.* - Thu Nov  5 03:05:36 2015

Once he did land he'd look up to Marrissa a confident smirk upon his face, but in his mind he was sweating. "Time to step it up!" rushing towards his cousin he'd proceed to weave a number of seals, they'd look familiar to anyone who had performed fireball jutsu for they were infact the same seals. 

In a swift burst of chakra he'd unleash the rather large ball of flame, intending to send it straight towards Marrissa, but of course he had a contingency, and a damn good one. *)* - Thu Nov  5 04:46:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) exitted the mansion, the sun gleaming against illuminated green hues as they peered over the cliff which the mansion was perched upon. He'd let out a deep exhale of breathe, as though tension and burden being released, whereupon he would begin walking. He had some of the higher ranking military ninja alongside him, those of no note although holding control of major portions of Sunagakure's army.

"I want you to prepare two-thousand men to march from this village as soon as humanly possible." He'd order, and alongside a few other specific details, the men would listen intently before breaking off in their own directions to complete tasks that were given. Yan would make his way down the declinning path that led to the square. He would peer towards those there, though he'd say nothing, instead continuing towards the gate as he awated the army granted to him.* - Thu Nov  5 05:54:33 2015
