<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) shakes his head. He hoped Susumu would stay out of trouble as he exitted the scene.* - Sun Oct 11 19:22:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) emerged from the terrain. Instead of within the perimeter of the training area, Yan's figure would burst from fleeting dirt as hand's full of loose soil made a pathway to the surface for the chuunin. His location would be at the heigth of the wall over-looking the training area. From this position, Yan would cast his vibrant green optics down upon the girl who was taken in her emotions and training.

With her fist delivered into the ground, and cracks being an apparent by-product to a strength unpredicted within the girl, Yan observed such with widened eyes. He hadn't seen anyone at her level of strength, apart from Baen, and was suprised that such physical strength came from such an unusual package. Upon his expression was brandished a friendly smile, and so if she looked up, his aura would be nothing other than benevolent and welcoming. 

After bending his knees, Yan would lean forward as his body would leap from the escalated position.  "Greetings," he'd say in coordination with him landing cleanly onto the sand's soft surface. He didn't mean to interrupt, but she seemed like she could use someone to talk to. After all, tears were apparent once he had closed enough distance between the two of them. That being said, he would add shortly thereafter; "are you okay?" The inquiry would be sincerely concerned.* - Mon Oct 12 08:46:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) saw the emotions within her eyes. From afar, such did not seem to penetrate him, and yet as he stood before her--he could not help but be encroached by the emotion within her aura. He could tell she had been through alot, and even though he had his doubts about Zenaki's lineage and true intentions, he didn't find such when in the company of this particular girl.

"...."

He thought of Tatsumi. Amdist the flush of emotion, thoughts were caught in the winds of nostaliga as memories of his brother manifested with an indomitable force within his mind. He still knew that he would have to avenge his death, as well as Flexus', a close comrade that he had lost as well. He held his arm out, to take her into his embrace to comfort her. He had no particular interest in the girl, it was the emotions fuming in addition to his benevolent nature which desired to console her. "Come here." He'd say, the warmest smile possible adorned upon his features.* - Mon Oct 12 09:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: This is cute. Yan finally got an interest? - Mon Oct 12 09:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was almost taken aback by her words. His eyes widened by her reply, though regained control. He hesitated to move when she fell to her knees, and watched as she pulled herself back up.  When she attempted to push him away, as it was assumed she wasn't using any supernatural strength at that moment, he would grab her arm and pull her towards him. His lengthened arms would wrap around her torso as his chin hooked upon her shoulder and a full hold her tightly.


"Whatever has happened...We will overcome it together," he said, and at that moment he would pull back so that he could provide the very same smile from before with eyes inspired by hope and love. He wanted peace more than anything, at the same time, he knew there were costs of peace and that was war. People had to die...People had died. He knew the pain of loss and whatever this girl had gone through seemed infinite in comparison to Yan. He wanted her to know that she was around people that would care about her so long as she cared for them.* - Mon Oct 12 09:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would maintain his smile, a standing reply to her own. Yan noticed Sanok within his periphial, though his focus was not on him at all. His eyes would fix upon her own, flicking towards the descending tear upon her cheek. He would sweep the tear from her cheek with the movement of his thumb whereupon he would speak words. "Cheer up..you're safe now." * - Mon Oct 12 10:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) pats her comfortingly on the shoulder as he then turned his gaze toward Sanoke entirely now. "Yo'," he'd greet the other, hopefully lightening the mood for all of them.* - Mon Oct 12 10:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Not much..just talking with... - Mon Oct 12 10:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I see you two having a little heart to heart. - Mon Oct 12 10:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peers back at Paine. "...Uh..Sorry but uh..I never got your name," He'd say.* - Mon Oct 12 10:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah...something like that. - Mon Oct 12 10:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: So yo, not to be a leech buuutt.. - Mon Oct 12 10:24:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Pain. - Mon Oct 12 10:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) looks back towards Paine, and while he hadn't gotten her name yet, he felt close to her in an emotional sense. "I will catch up with you soon," He said with a bright smile. He'd turn and walk towards the northern exit, stopping as he passed by Sanoke. "huh?"* - Mon Oct 12 10:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ....Pain? - Mon Oct 12 10:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I heard it when she was battling that Susumu character. - Mon Oct 12 10:25:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Anyways, what about you being a leech? - Mon Oct 12 10:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: She got good taijutsu from the looks of it. - Mon Oct 12 10:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hencet he nam-- Oh. I don't usually like to be a leech. 'Oh, teach me, please!' But i'm making good progress in Doton release. - Mon Oct 12 10:25:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) chuckles at his comment before reaching into his satchel. "Seems to me I should keep some of these techniques secret..I have a few up my sleeve still though." Upon the ending of his dialogue, his hand would emerge again, brandishing a ninjutsu scroll.

"This is more advanced...enjoy." He'd say with a toss of the scroll, it's trajectory towards Sanoke.* - Mon Oct 12 10:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You still owe me some fuuinjutsu training. - Mon Oct 12 10:29:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) falls into a loose stance with retracted knees, feet which were spread from one another approximately shoulder-length and hands that hovered at chest level and digits which curled inward towards one another.* - Wed Oct 14 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched carefully as he awaited the signal to commense battle. Since that signal was Trilliam's movements towards forming a technique or brandishing any sort of offensive, defensive of supplementary measures--Yan would move as Trilliam did. His hands were measured close to one another, as to break into forming seals at a rapid pace. The initial seal was in the form of a T, indicative of the Shadow Clone Technique. With the chakra kneaded and thereafter exhaled from his form--a bunshin appeared to either side of him.

If anyone was the clone master, it was Yan. Immediately five seals would be wove by one of the clones, and with the chakra kneaded and prepared, his hand would slam into the wall thus a giant earthern wall would eject from the ground to intercept the projectile ninjutsu formed by Trilliam's squadron of clones. Meanwhile, Yan and both clones would be behind the wall.

Additionally, the second clone would transfer chakra into the ground whereupon the very composition in which the terrain was transitioned to liquid. With that done, the clone would descend into the earth and move forward in the direction where Trilliam was. The clone moved at approximately five feet per second, and so, with all the action that occured before hand, he'd only move around ten feet for the first round.* - Wed Oct 14 01:41:58 2015
