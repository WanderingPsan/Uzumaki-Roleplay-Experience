<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) moved past them and to the south. He was extremely low on chakra, yet he still had more chakra than the average ninja. He formed a single handseal as he moved a little south and a cavern-esque structure would erupt from the ground. "You can take refuge as you wait for the Kazekage within this." He'd say.* - Fri Oct  9 23:45:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) shrugged alongside a pivot, thereafter breaking into a fast-paced walk towards the training ground. He hadn't trained since the mission, as his chakra reserves were lower than ever be fore after...he was eager to hone his techniques.* - Sat Oct 10 04:18:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would approach the group that was outside loitering at the gate. In truth, it was Yan's fault, he had a moment of weakness which allowed them to linger longer than welcome to. Yan couldn't have shinobi not sworn yet to Sunagakure to be at the gate possibly causing disruptions. That being said, he would hault at the edge walls which surrounded the entirety of Sand.

"I see you are still waiting," He'd state, firey green eyes moving in observation of the two ninja.* - Sat Oct 10 04:36:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I can probably get you in the village since you are a medical ninjutsu practitioner. - Sat Oct 10 04:42:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Take care, Yoshi. - Sat Oct 10 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) beckons Reguel, thoughh he was disgusted that Reguel would leave his comrade that he was traveling with. He looked back at Yoshi after Reguel addressed him. "You can still petition to my leader," He'd note.."I Just can't have you standing out in the open like this." He'd say. "There is a source of water to the west..Go there and wait, I will send word for you either way." * - Sat Oct 10 04:43:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was just about to begin forming seals, and performing techniques as a consequence, before the explosion of fire manifested behind him; within his periphial though. He turned quickly as he watched Izanami being launched across the area. He wasn't fast enough to react, so he just followed her. 

"You okay?!" He'd exclaim, though he was sure she was fine and so he brandished a smile. After all, Izanami should know what she's playing with.* - Sat Oct 10 04:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Good...looks like you had a awesome technique on your hands. - Sat Oct 10 04:59:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If they are looking for donations, I'd be happy to donate as long as I get a receipt for what my money will go towards. - Sat Oct 10 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: If your willing to donate I will accept it and put it all for the hospital - Sat Oct 10 05:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: I will get that to you... - Sat Oct 10 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would take measured steps from the group in which occupied the area. He was unsure exactly if his training would be destructive, but at the v ery least it seemed Izanami's was..For that, he felt everyone needed their own area. And so he respected her space and moved south-ward. Once he was adequately distanced from the girl, he would ponder his training routine.

Churning within Yan's interior was a vast source of chakra. He could feel it within every cell within his body, moving with ferocity as it yearned for the moment of blossoming. He brought his arms up and angled them inward with hands that neared each other. Upon meeting, each finger would slide into action. Loose yet meticulous...Accurate yet fast....Each formulation of his digits measured to a perfect handseal. With the last one performed, both physical and spiritual chakra propelled from his form.

The very ground in which they stood on rumbled with animation, and upon the sands which enveloped the area before Yan, terraform shook and broke through the sands which seemed infinite in depth. The construct would build as earth was manipulated by Yan's will. Once it transitioned into the entirety of fruit yielded, the ninjutsu would have created a cavernous extension from the earth. It started as a corridor, whose opening stood before Yan. It extended inward, a hallway which lead into a roughly-etched dome of jagged rock. 

He inspected the visage which he willed into existence with satisfaction upon his features. His firey green hues scoped the entirety of the structure. "Good," he stated, and with another handseal, the dome would descend back into the earth. (out of convience) Once it's existence was no longer, Yan would release a sigh before he initiated yet another attempt at honing the chakra output and durability of an impressive technique.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) removed a scroll from his satchel, releasing the bottom portion so that it woould roll out before Yan's firey green eyes for his viewing pleasure. He'd fix it between both hands, fingers with a snug grip upon the root of the scroll as he began reading intently. It was a technique that he had sought for a while now, and since he's obtained it, he would learn all that he could in regard to it.* - Sat Oct 10 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) completely immersed himself in his studies. The technique which he read was a high-level ninjutsu that was practiced among many shinobi as it was versatile. It fit the template of Yan's fighting style so well that he sought to acquire a mastery which no one had yet done. He would study the chakra manpulation and necessary method of kneading as he would soon attempt to perform the technique himself.* - Sat Oct 10 06:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) read the last bit of information entailed within the scroll before he placed it back within the interior of his satchel. Within it, numerous amounts of jutsu scrolls were within it. It seemed as though he had a vast collection..He'd need to find a safer home for the techniques. Nevertheless, he proceeded with the technique. Performing the handseals, and kneading his chakra--he would attempt to perfor the technique.* - Sat Oct 10 06:18:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) began forming the seals again, each one formulated between digits gingerly as to allow the other proper viewing of it. Additionally, as each seal was created, he would name the seal verbally. He'd also give some details about the ninjutsu, that the writer himself doesn't have the expertise to spit out. Afterwards, he would call upon Sanoke to attempt. (Do you want a scroll?)* - Sat Oct 10 18:09:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: So Yan. - Sat Oct 10 19:18:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Kilm, excuse us..we are having a private conversation. - Sat Oct 10 19:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Please.. - Sat Oct 10 19:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Oh . . . Thought you were sparring. - Sat Oct 10 19:23:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: See you later. - Sat Oct 10 19:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) raised a brow as the other began mumbling. Yan, of course, had no clue as to what he was up to yet due to the revelation of Susumu having hidden techniques, he figured the whispering were a portion of the technique's preparation. That being said, his hands would come together.


He formed a "T" with two fingers of either hand, thereafter kneading his chakra and molding it, thereby allowing him to perform a technique which he was just learning. Around him, two plumes of smoke would make the presence of shadow clones present. Upon their dissipation, they would both run forward. 

In the back Yan remained, preparing his own chakra. He had vast reserves, and so did the clones which burdened a third of his chakra each.* - Sat Oct 10 19:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: A clone, annoying. - Sat Oct 10 19:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) (*Susumu had finished his whispering as the male charged forward..Now in twos..It was a big annoyance..A single smile was given, he did like a challenge. After he'd crack his finger, his eyes focused on yan as suddenly yellow words bursted out of the male's body and immediatly went and wrapped around yan's body, they were..pretty much inescapable, he had the chance to stop susumu, but missed it.

The real yan found himself suddenly unable to function, his bodilymovements were stopped, all he could do was fall or stand, and move his eyes.

As for the clone of yan, susumu got into a quick stance, ready to fight the clone off.*)* - Sat Oct 10 19:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would be captured. Vibrant green optics widened with surprise as the manifested attack, appearing as words visualized, bound him and therefore immobilized himself. Nevertheless, he was still able to fight utilizing the two clones summoned as well as a few ninjutsu that didn't involve so much as a gesture from him in order to activate him.

Regardless, the ninja's technique was quite impressive.


As for the two clones, he couldn't afford them to be destroyed at this point. They were to do what he'd be unable to do. That being siad, one would begin forming handseals whereas the other would shoot forth a Mud river. This would occur as the other was getting into his stance, to maximize landing potential.

When the other clone finished his seals, he would hold them as to prepare for the other's dodge.* - Sat Oct 10 19:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: Yan. - Sat Oct 10 19:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: Give me your pussy. - Sat Oct 10 19:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: -----------omit- - Sat Oct 10 19:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched as pillars of earth rose around Susumu. The Mud river was simply something to occupy the boy's manuevering, whereas the real attack was being utilized by the other clone. Unlike the normal technique, the pillars would be dulled to null the killing potential of the technique.

Four pillars in all would surface, each one angling inward toward Susumu to slam into four different sides of his body. They would lock him in place, unless dodged. Meanwhile, with the mud river no longer being used, the other clone would begin forming handseals again.* - Sat Oct 10 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched from afar as the clone was capatured by projectiled words. Yan was truly dumbfounded at the nature of this man's techniques. Never before had he seen such, though he was interested in what it did. Upon connection, Yan's clone dropped his pants just as Susumu had anticipated whereupon he rushed towards the other clone.

 Yan sighed and realized immediately it was a mind control technique, and responded as such. Yan released a mud river, aiming to destroy the clone that was threatening to do whatever it was planning to the other clone. With that said, the mud river over took it and he would be destroyed thus ending the nature of the technique.

 Additionally, with the trajectory of the mud river, it would threaten to hit Susumu afterwards. Upon connection, it would break the pillars and free Susumu. Only problem is, he took the full force of Yan's relatively powerful ninjutsu and in turn would also be struck by the pillars as they were carried with the mud river as well.

Lastly, the other clone would move to avoid the mud river, while also performing a single seal. That being said, a vast amount of water would be expelled from his gullet. This water would expand and crash into Susumu afterward. Yan was no longer comfortable continuing this spar and would end it presently.* - Sat Oct 10 20:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Release me. - Sat Oct 10 20:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) notes the techniques would dissipate upon connection of all of them.* - Sat Oct 10 20:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) stretched his arms and legs, a sigh of relief released from parted lips. "Those are  some interesting hidden techniques you have," he commented, peering towards the man. "What was the second one in particular?" He'd ask thereafter.* - Sat Oct 10 20:06:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Unless you wanted me to let it happen. - Sat Oct 10 20:09:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Otherwise I am going to go train. - Sun Oct 11 16:59:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Yan. - Sun Oct 11 16:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Stay alert soldier. - Sun Oct 11 16:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I forgot to ask you soemthing. - Sun Oct 11 17:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods, peering towards Susumu for his question before he ran off towards the training grounds.* - Sun Oct 11 17:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm tryin' to like you, guy. - Sun Oct 11 17:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It's not working though. - Sun Oct 11 17:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm.. - Sun Oct 11 17:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Alright. - Sun Oct 11 17:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) heads off.* - Sun Oct 11 17:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) turns around, a malicious grin upon his lips. "I knew you'd come," he'd say as a bunshin emerged from behind him, slashing across the back of his knees. Yan would begin performing handseals, going in for the kill.* - Sun Oct 11 18:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Yo, Yan. - Sun Oct 11 18:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Hm? - Sun Oct 11 18:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I was wondering if you could teach me some stuff. - Sun Oct 11 18:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I only possess those two skills I showed you. - Sun Oct 11 18:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You've used your techniques on ninja around you and in very bad taste. - Sun Oct 11 18:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: What makes you think I'm going to teach you more techniques? - Sun Oct 11 18:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mm.. - Sun Oct 11 18:35:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Oh. - Sun Oct 11 18:35:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: There's someone with it on them. - Sun Oct 11 18:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I'll release it later I guess. - Sun Oct 11 18:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Who? - Sun Oct 11 18:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Bryson. - Sun Oct 11 18:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Do that. - Sun Oct 11 18:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Me and him, naturally don't get along. - Sun Oct 11 18:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Why? - Sun Oct 11 18:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Because of who we are. - Sun Oct 11 18:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: So, instead of us being enemies. - Sun Oct 11 18:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I let him love. - Sun Oct 11 18:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: And truthfully. - Sun Oct 11 18:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: The woman seemed very happy to be acknowledged. - Sun Oct 11 18:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: But if you want me to break that, I will. - Sun Oct 11 18:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You will break it. - Sun Oct 11 18:37:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Alright. - Sun Oct 11 18:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Do you know what elemental affinities you have? - Sun Oct 11 18:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Ah well uhm. - Sun Oct 11 18:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I forgot. - Sun Oct 11 18:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Go get some chakra paper from Hassan or Tetsumi. - Sun Oct 11 18:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Otherwise i have nothing to teach you. - Sun Oct 11 18:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Nothing? - Sun Oct 11 18:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: *Sigh* I'll be back. - Sun Oct 11 18:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: He's not available. - Sun Oct 11 18:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Do you have any non-elemental? - Sun Oct 11 18:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Like that clone thing? - Sun Oct 11 18:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Hm.I have genjutsu. - Sun Oct 11 18:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Or that. - Sun Oct 11 18:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Since I am a rather..Indirect fighter. - Sun Oct 11 18:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) expands his chakra, focusing it before projecting it from his form. With a single handseal, irrelevant to the other's sight, numerous amounts of clones replicating Yan's features appeared around Susumu. They didn't attack, but rather stood around him in a menacing manner.

"This is the Mist Servant Technique, it creates the illusion of hundreds of clones. When one is attacked, instead of dying, it splits up into two ninja. It can be used to drain a ninja's chakra and stamina as well as distract them for a killing blow." He'd say, thereafter tossing him a scroll.* - Sun Oct 11 18:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hm..Wow. - Sun Oct 11 18:43:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I won't be a leech off of you though. - Sun Oct 11 18:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm..That's a pleasent technique. - Sun Oct 11 18:49:48 2015
