<br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) |Yan didn't know the situation, in fact, all he knew was that Tethys was offering alot of aid to the hidden sands. In the end, the villages preservation was on the mind of the young ninja. That being said, as he saw the girl prepare a kunai, he reacted.
\
\A string of seals were performed, speed and fluidity amounting to a fraction of a second in preparation before his mouth parted--giving way to a stream of water that catapulted towards the kunai's projectory. He aimed infront of where it was, as to cause it to hit the water gun and therefore be diverted. He didn't know what else to do but keep this fight one-on-one.|* - Sun Sep 06 18:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan ceased his technique as it proved fruitless. It didn't seem Tethys needed his help though, and he supposed that was better than accessorizing himself despite his confidence that Chiyari would back his actions.||* - Sun Sep 06 19:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Chiyari-sama, we can't let Tethys die here.. - Sun Sep 06 19:02:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Say the word. - Sun Sep 06 19:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chiyari(Guujin) whispers: Assist Teyths. - Sun Sep 06 19:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Upon the order issued by his leader, Yan would break into a fit of seals as he would prepare his first ninjutsu utilized in this effort since the water gun technique. That being said, another fraction of a second would pass by before the chakra was kneaded, molded and nature transformation would occur. As for the nature transformation, he had sometime been preparing to utilize earth style ninjutsu as it was the center piece to his power. The water release was simply to restrain and not damage. 

That being said, upon the final seal clouds of smoke billowed into existence which prompted their expansion and eventual dissipation from perception. Within the wake of their departure, clones were materialized and created in likeness to who willed them into existence--Yan. Each of the clones would thereafter be performing a series of seals in quick succession akin to their original body. At the end of their strings, with chakra molded to porportion, all but the original Yan leapt into the air to avoid the bodies between him and Ushinawa as they unleashed their ninjutsu.

A total of ten clones were created, the maximum that he was able to, and with that 750 chakra was distributed to each one including the original Yan.  That being said, they all had adequate chakra to perform the technique which required very little. The original Yan remained grounded, and on guard, as the other clones performed the water ninjutsu. Each one opened their mouth as a wealth of water would emit from them. 

The mentioned water would stream in higher volume than the original which was classified as a D-rank ninjutsu and would be doubly more powerful with the incorperation of more chakra than was necessary at its base creation. All ten clones would aim the attack toward Ushinawa, hopefully avoiding those inbetween. It wasn't going to kill, or really hurt him, but simply divert his ability to further attack Tethys. He hoped Chiyari was running distraction to end the confrontation on Tethys end despite their efforts to aid him.||* - Sun Sep 06 19:17:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded and smirked, finding pride that the others thought his plan was good. With that said, he began performing a string of seals which would end in the final--activating his clone technique. Ten clones would appear within billowing clouds of smoke and each of them would be strapped with one explosive tag. With that said, they would travel with them until they reached the point where they would be seen at which point they would enter the earth and travel underneath the forces of Suna. Each tag was aligned with the very same detonation seal.* - Sun Sep 06 21:11:40 2015

Their presence was hidden by jamming bugs that were gifted by Dravae, and so as they emerged; Yan would perform a singular detonation seal that would cause all ten explosive tags strapped to all ten clones that emerged in the group of rain-nin that accompanied Zetsumo to explode in firey destruction within the ranks of their enemies.||* - Sun Sep 06 21:50:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) |The battle raged on. While morale was down, this was marked as to be the final battle as stated by Orakuru before the assault. That being said, many troops saw this as an all or nothing and fought harder as a result. For years Sunagakure had been the rear of many situations and if it didn't change today--it would never change. Their elemental brigade pushed forward--preparing an onslaught against the enemy.
\\
 Doton users slammed thier hands into the ground, causing the ground before them to turn inward and break apart in an attempt to destroy the ground underneath their opponent. From there, katon users stepped forward in between the doton user's lines--performing techniques that sent a =wealth of fire balls and streams of fire that emanated towards the Konoha nin to hold them at bay. Lastly, the more experienced doton users used earth-manipulating techniques which caused the earthern debris underneath the army to project upwards and every which way to cause mass casualties if they did not move in time. 
\
\As the Konoha-nin would retreat from this position, if they did; suiton users would be following up with streams of water which combined to cause a formidable flow of water that would pick up the rocks that were left over and carry them in a destructive flow that would threaten to take the army and damage them both through the water technique as well as the doton debris that was flowing within it. While the water would soon subside, the lightning users would mount a final effort and project their raiton abilit=ies into the flow of water further enhancing =its destructive capabilities.|* - Sun Sep 06 23:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) |The heads of the armies realized that at this rate, it was costing more chakra than deaths of their enemy. Throughout the expanse, each of the squadron leader and brigade leaders ordered expansion of their formations. The remaining two   thousand four hundred men that were part of the Suna army who were not immediately in the combo of attacks were ordered to move as well as they could to surround the enemy. With this intention, the roughly 3,700 man army would attempt to surround and bombard the enemy with bukijutsu and elemental ninjutsu aimed at the center of Konoha's army. With their numbers, it was only a matter of time before the tide of battle turned into their favor. If they were able to surround the army, it was inevitable that they would succeed. In the meantime, they would carve a path to do so on the outer-lines of Zetsumo's toops.|* - Mon Sep 07 00:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) |The encirclement would be accomplished at which point the entirety of the army began attacking Konoha who was in the middle. From every direction came fire, water and earth. Lightning-users were limited to bukijutsu and chakra flow if they had it, as well as all other ninja utilizing bukijutsu to cut down the enemy. As they attac ked, and killed, they would slowly begin to close in =on the army forcing them into a smaller and smaller grouping in order to cause more casualties with their bombardment that came from all directions.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noted the fray ahead of his path as fire scorched the air and combusted as it landed into a tree. He also observed the girl hide behind it and thereafter head in the opposite direction toward the fray. He knew there might be some trouble, but things looked a little heavy. He grimaced and proceeded towards the battle.

As he saw familiar faces, he took place beside one who was equivalent to his age yet revered as a much stronger shinobi thereby allowing him to gain information on the situation as he observed it from a safe distance. As for the participants, he assumed Tethys was underneath the robe and wasn't surprised to see Ushinawa a factor within the battle. He wonder why it raged on, as before they had made some sort of peace within Kirigakure. Or perhaps simply a rain check to continue at another date? The latter seemed more logical at this point.

"Yo, what's going on?" He'd ask, pausing before he spoke again as he would allow the other to reply. Depending on the relevance of the inquiry, he would then continue on: "What's our part in this?" He'd ask. Again, if the other provided such a question's answer, then he would not ask it.* - Tue Sep 08 00:41:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods and folds his arms. He wasn't a pacifist, not like Ikarus. His instinct was to fight, but the problem was he didn't know who the enemy was. It didn't seem like it was their fight either way. "Who attacked first?" He asked, now speaking to whichever one of them cared to reply.* - Tue Sep 08 00:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched the fight. His experience had taught him that solving the problem was ending the source of the problem. He could say it was Tethys, but he had only seen one dimension of many. Ushinawa caused anger in Tethys, and that left Yan wondering why.* - Tue Sep 08 01:31:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) heard Nigen yet his eyes did not divert.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched as the iron sand user moved to stop the attacks and so Yan would commit to the very same agenda as seals began to form, as well as chakra molded and kneaded. He personally wanted to end it for good, but Tetsumi was his superior and so he would help him in whatever capacity that Yan was able to. That being said, at the end of the handseals that he performed at lightning speeds--he'd slam his hand onto the ground as multiple rocks moved into the trajectory of the projectiles heading toward Ushinawa. Mostly Yan was just entertaining himself at this ponit. The rocks were provided by the destruction of the pathway by the girl who used chakra enhanced strength.* - Tue Sep 08 01:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) observes the body, his emotions enflamed as his illuminated green hues took on a slightly more serious composition which reflected lips that parted and teeth which gritted roughly together.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) stood before the mansion, as after a long session of honing his ability in ninjutsu, he sought to take a break. As the boy approached, illuminated green optics peered towards Anguo in observation.. Upon his mention of Zetsumo, Yan was beckoned into alertness and as a result  was =now on guard.. The boy was young, so he didn't anticipate anything from him. But there was a war just a few days ago, didn't the boy hear about it?"
\
\"Zetsumo was defeated and his army was destroyed....He fled and left his men to die on the battlefield..." He said, still on guard but not really sure as to what that threat was.* - Tue Sep 08 18:58:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) took a few steps forward, albeit cautiously, to comfort the boy. He placed his hand upon Anguo's shoulder and gripped it gently. "We have something in common then." If the boy looked up as he spoke, he'd percieve an expression of benevolence as well as a gentle smile. Yan wanted to kill Zetsumo, but moreso than him--he had his eyes on Edge. It was a twisted life they lived that Yan felt love and such hatred simultaneously that he wanted to end their lives. Truthfully, what Anguo felt towards Zetsumo was what Yan felt to Edge. He understood the hatred dwelling.* - Tue Sep 08 19:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) observed the boy as he looked up to him. As stoic the boy was, it was hard for Yan to deduce anything within the mind of the boy simply from his features and the aura he emanated. "Uh, * - Tue Sep 08 19:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) "once we talk to Chiyari, I'd be happy to help you train," he'd say, patting the boy's shoulder as he released the very subtle grip upon it whereupon he drew his hand from him. "He's busy I guess though, cuz I don't see him around." He said as his head would pivot from left to right and then toward the Kage mansion. * - Tue Sep 08 19:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) appears as though he is thinking hard. Yan was a very intelligent fighter, but =more often than not he was a dunce outside of battle.* - Tue Sep 08 19:36:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peered towards Aiyana, a comrade of Ushinawa. If she was here, he probably was too. He assumed Tethys was gone by this point, but nevertheless such peaked the teenager's curiousity.* - Tue Sep 08 23:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) approached the two, folding his arms as he looked onto them. "What's goin' on?" He'd ask, mostly without any bias toward either of them at the moment.* - Tue Sep 08 23:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) cocked an eyebrow at the male, though his smile was maintained as he noticed the pivot of Aiyana and so he chose to settle those bright green eyes upon her. "Where is your brother?" He'd ask, though there wasn't any hostility within his tone. After all, he had attempted to save Ushinawa's life though it was more for an attempt to end the fray than specifically help the man.* - Tue Sep 08 23:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) 's smile faded, though he didn't show any hostility. His thoughts were to ensure she left the village at this point. If she wasn't on their side, she could find no refuge here.* - Tue Sep 08 23:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would turn and walk away. He needed to do some training and at this point, he thought he may be talking to a wall.* - Tue Sep 08 23:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) |Yan was a little annoyed by the girl he had just spoke to. In fact, he was downright angry. He knew in the back of his mind that the young idealist in him wanted to agree with them.. At the same time, the actuality of things proved a separate truth that proved the worth of it.. Her bias was the very same that made Yan biased and so he chalked it up in his mind and casted it aside. He would concentrate on progressing as a ninja, where the world was imperfect and hard decisions were to be made..
\
\Yan clasped his hands together and upon becoming one form; the digits would begin weaving seals as they contorted to different formulas that completed the necessary form. With each seal he completed, his chakra was thereby molded and kneaded into the proper shaping for him to perform the technique. Lastly, as he fell onto the last seal, he would allow the chakra to project from himself and take visible form.
\
\The clouds around him came in plumes of smoke which billowed into expansion until their visiblity dwindled and the likenesses of Yan were left within the wake of its departure. Once the mud clone technique was created, he would begin forming another set of seals while the clone did the very same though his string followed behind Yan slightly in completion. The other clone would dart forward, as though attacking an opponent which Yan visualized was there. Once he completed his seals, the area right before the clone who was running forward would change as earth broke apart.
\
\Spears extended from the earth. The solidified soft soil came to a point, and a total of four penetrated from the earth four or so feet away from one another. Despite their base being separated, the spears came together at an angle toward one another until they all ran perpindicular. At that point, Yan's clone who was weaving the seals would be done and he would slam his hand into the ground. As for the clone which was running forward, he would lunge into the air over the spikes with the intention of intercepting an opponent who would have dodged and was now air-bourne.
\
The clone that was now mid-air would throw a kick, that would undoubtedly slam into the imaginary opponent. At that point, the other clone that had slammed his hand against the Earth would then activate his technique. The spears that extended from the Earth would now animate, and dart in their respective directions. Reality was different from theory, but with this combo--he maximized his chances of bagging an enemy that had to be killed immediately.* - Tue Sep 08 23:52:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) fell into a loose ninjutsu-focused stance. His feet were shoulder-length, and his knees slightly bent. He was ready to leap either way. As for his hands, they were suspended before him and open-palmed with a slight angling toward one another. He was ready to form seals as well. "I'm already loosened up so if you need to stretch before the spar, go ahead..Otherwise, come at me." He'd say as he awaited. * - Wed Sep 09 01:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) clasped his hands, as they pushed apart and digits skillfully moved into position to form the first handseal. With that handseal formed, and the chakra kneaded and molded, it would activate.

Three plumes of smoke appeared at his side, the first one jumping forward to intercept his opponent while the other two built up chakra and prepared for combat. Yan would be doing this as well, performing seals in succession at amazing speed.* - Wed Sep 09 01:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) , as Keyshawn attacked the first clone, went on the offensive. This technique served two purposes: to strike his opponent as well as make distance between them. That being said, his clones released their earth-style technique as did Yan release his own technique.

Both of the clones, positioned to either side of him, allowed rivers of mud to erupt before him and flow towards Keyshawn. At this point, Keyshawn would probably be air-bourne as he jumped over the clone that he had made short work of. 

As for the original Yan, he released his water style technique. His mouth gaped open as a wealth of water rushed forward to intercept the air-bourne ninja before him. In addition to this, the water element technique would supplement the two rivers and create a more powerful and now combined flow as the water allowed the two to grow and over-lap.

Lastly, as he performed the technique, he doubled the chakra output within the technique thereby increasing the potency and volume of the technique...which attributed further to the potency of the mud rivers.* - Wed Sep 09 02:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) grinned as his attack landed, the excitement welling within him as he ceased the ninjutsu and ran forward. As for the clones that were at his sides, they would cease the river as well in order to accompany him. 

He wasn't skilled in taijutsu, but according to what he saw from Keyshawn before, he could probably keep up with him. As he ran forward, chakra would welll up within him and he would slow--allowing both his clones to head forward ahead of him.* - Wed Sep 09 02:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) knew that he wasn't the greatest to spar. Or at least, he didn't hold back in the manner which he used his techniques and so it proved to be very difficult for his opponents to combat Yan's stategies. That being said, the first clone would welcome the close-ranged combat. As the fist slammed into the clone's chest, the momentum and sheer power of the attack penetrated the clone's form.

As the fist connected, the clone instantly erupted in a thick mud which was completely punched through by Keyshawn. It's thick and submersive form would work to deter Keyshawn's forward momentum toward Yan although with the opponent's power--it would simply slow him down. 

At this point, Yan performed a singular seal. His ability to weave seals were so great that the seal would be performed in a mere two-tenths of a second. Fingers would fall skillfully in place thereby molding the chakra into the proper form as suiton release chakra welled up within his gullet.

The second clone would attempt to intercept Keyshawn now as well, especially since he was directly engaging the clone anyway. Again, the clone's ability in taijutsu paled in comparison to the kumo-nin and therefore he was easily dispatched. That attack nevertheless was also to be caught up within the mud.

 Considering Keyshawn fought past the first one, alot of momentum would have been lost. As he hit the second, his attack would be considerably lessened in power there was no doubt that it was sufficient enough to continue through.

In the end though, the very function of the clone was not to singularly defeat his opponent but rather serve as a distraction as preparation was done to ensure Yan would land his own attack. That being said, as the clone bursted into mud, Yan's technique would be prepared and therefore activated.

A stream of water would jet from a mouth that moved open, it's form less in volume than the previous water release yet more condensed and projected longer without hitting the ground. This wasn't meant to create any flow but rather use condensed water to create momentum and power to hit the opponent.* - Wed Sep 09 02:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ceased the water as it hit and knocked him backwards and retracted his hands to his side once Keyshawn admitted defeat. "You don't use any ninjutsu?" He asked, cocking an eyebrow.* - Wed Sep 09 03:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) lifted a hand and provided a wave as he pivoted and headed towards the residential district. "See ya around." He'd state as he departed.* - Wed Sep 09 03:22:01 2015

The enviroment around Yan wasn't something he was use to yet he had been here long enough that it was growing on him. Still, he missed The Hidden Sands. It left him wondering why they hadn't departed yet as this wasn't their home. He shook the thoughts from his mind as he centered his attention on the moment and settled his vision upon the earthern wall before him that was quite a famous landmark within The Hidden Leaf.

	He would be continueing with his training in his new earth style techniques--both of which were reaching optimal levels of efficiency yet hadn't attained that level which satisfied the young genin quite yet. That being said, his hands came together and the usual actions would ensue as he performed a singular handseal. The handseal would mold the chakra as Yan would exert it from his form. With that done, two plumes of smoke billowed on either side of him until they dissipated from expansion and likenesses of Yan were revealed with in them.

	He'd nod to either of them, and all three would break into action to complete the combination technique which he was training in. Yan would break into forming seals, whereupon one clone would start performing seals right behind Yan in completion and the other clone would dart forward towards the wall. Both Yan and the clone who were performing seals would do so with extreme precision and formidable speed. Upon Yan completing his seal, thereby molding his chakra, he would release his own technique.

Earthern spears solidified from the soft soil, springing from the ground beneath them in animation as they jutted outward. Their projection came into an angle that would bring them toward one another. While never touching, each spear would extend past the other as they would theoretically intersect within an enemy. By then, Yan's clone had completed his set of seals and the one that was running forward would have elevated and scaled over the earth release spears.

Once the clone completed the seals, which was at the time the other clone jumped, he'd pivot and send an open-palmed strike into the ground before the clone. At the point of connection, the earthern spears that jutted out of the ground would come into animation as they shot outward in their respective directions. This would allow Yan to take out potentially multiple opponents, or at the very least, catch an opponent who's dodging proved to be their downfall as the clone would be running distraction. 

The clone which was air-bourne would have been caught by one of the spears. As it pierced his torso, and drove through until it had cleared through the clone's soid form--the clone itself would burst into mud which emanated in all directions. Of course, there was nothing to restrain and so the clone was completely reduced and therefore destroyed. The other spears landed in random areas, and Yan would prepare to perform the technique again.* - Wed Sep 09 13:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was sweating slightly, as he had just training. He peered towards Keyshawn, someone he had bonded with through sparring. He'd greet him with a smile and illuminated green optics. "Hey man."* - Wed Sep 09 13:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would stand idly before the mansion. It seemed Keyshawn was asleep and so Yan would work on a technique that he had been praciticing. Since he had his other down path, he'd soley focus on his earth manipulation technique. He peered towards some scattered debris from earlier fights and would begin performing seals thereby molding his chakra.

At the end of the seals, once his chakra was molded into the proper composition, he'd slam an open palm into the pavement below which would give him manipulative powers over the rocks nearby. The rocks lifted and shot forward--bashing into one of the trees. Since the rocks were small, insignificant damage was caused to the thick trunks and the rocks simply died in momentum and fell towards the ground.* - Wed Sep 09 13:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would bust into performing handseals again. He thought about how he was growing stronger yet he knew he had much distance to go before he was able to do what was needed. With the battle won, much of their forces were reinvigorated yet it was said that the malicious Zetsumo had somehow escaped certain death. It bothered him as he wanted to be strong enough to defeat Sand's enemies.

At the final seal, though each one he acquired this, he molded his chakra into the correct composition as he would thereafter exert it so that the technique would come into fruition. The rocks he had previously manipulated would animate once again. Their elevation would result in an immediate aversion as they were sent hurdling towards the next set of trees.

The rocks would slam into the trees, creating small indentions and marks within the tree as rocks tore through the bark. Due to their size though, the marks were insignificant and the interior bark was barely revealed. Once they landed and made contact, they would become inanimate again and drop to the ground as the technique would be released.* - Wed Sep 09 14:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) felt the power of his technique increase and the efficiency with its utilization of chakra as well. "Just a bit more," he'd think to himself as he prepared to perform the techniques again. He would begin performing seals once more, stringing through the entirety of them with speed and precision before he ended on the last one. With his chakra molded completely and the only thing left to do being to activate the technique--he slammed his hand onto the ground.

His hand slammed into the pavement, a light thud projecting from the point of impact. Just then the rocks that he had been manipulated would burst into animation again as they lifted and shot forward away from the trees they were once stationary by. As they were sent flying, they slammed into another tree. One after another, they pelted into it and fell to the ground below. Once it was done, Yan would prepare to use it again.* - Wed Sep 09 14:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) performed the technique again. After all, if one did not religiously practice their techniques then upon battle, they wouldn't be able to use them to their full potential. His hands would fall into position as digits would begin contorting and their over-all formation would create seals. As each seal was formed, the chakra within him would be progressively molded into the composition that was necessary to perform the technique.

The string of seals would be performed in a precise yet accelerated manner and would be finished with a strike into the ground which prompted the activation of the earth release technique. Rocks would animate and shoot forward, hurdling in the direction of the face of the cliff to the north. As they struck the wall, more rocks would break off and fall into the ground as it caused damage to the thick surface. Albeit, very little damage was sustained and the technique would end soon after.* - Wed Sep 09 14:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) had just got done practicing his ninjutsu. He wasn't tired but he was sweating slightly.* - Wed Sep 09 15:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) figured he'd so some more training since nothing was happening around him apart from the usual traffic of suna troops and guards tending to their tasks. That being said, he ventured to the field that was adjacent to the manor and prepared to train with his summoning technique. As he was instructed by Chiyari, the boy lifted his thumb to his mouth where teeth were bared. They closed, pinching the epidermis of Yan's thumb as to knick the skin and allow blood to leak from a insignificant wound.

As blood was exposed, he slapped it onto his hand whereupon he drew both of them together and broke into performing a string of seals that would end as quickly as they had begun due to his mastery with handseals. Once the chakra was molded, Yan would slam his hand into the ground thus activating the Summoning Technique. The ground below him would be etched upon, the summoning insignia manifesting upon the ground below. Even as that occured, nothing was summoned as he was simply training in proficiency and did not want to bother the toads for such a simple reason.* - Wed Sep 09 16:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noticed the Raikage approached and ceased his activities. He'd perform a respectful bow as he greeted the esteemed ninja with a bright and friendly smile. "Good morning Lord Raikage."* - Wed Sep 09 16:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would nod slightly in reply before making his acknowledgement audible. "Will do, sir."* - Wed Sep 09 16:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peers back to Keyshawn, who was somewhat idle and possibly snoozing near the doorway to the mansion.* - Wed Sep 09 16:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noted the one who stood beside him. He didn't know him but apparently the Raikage did.* - Wed Sep 09 16:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) summons Gambunta.* - Wed Sep 09 16:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peered towards the Raikage as he had leapt and soon after return to the ground. He eyed him for a moment, unsure of why. "What did you see?" He'd ask.* - Wed Sep 09 16:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) wasn't bothered by this although he did wonder the extent of Seisuke was of the calibre that such egotism was warranted. He had doubts.* - Wed Sep 09 17:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods in confirmation.* - Wed Sep 09 17:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) quickly became angered with narrowing green eyes that were lit like fire. "Are you serious?" He'd ask, his breathing accelerating with the accumulation of negative emotions.* - Wed Sep 09 17:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) listens intently, his anger fuming yet he reverted to a more collected appearance. He couldn't let his anger prevent him from being assigned to such an endeavor.* - Wed Sep 09 17:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded in reply, giving forth an audible reply as well, "Yes sir." Of course, it wasn't a promise he could keep but he'd try. As for Anguo, he noticed him within the corner of his sights and peered towards him. "Chiyari-sama, this is Anguo..He was a subordinate of Zetsumo but was left. He's just a kid and he hates Zetsumo. I told him you might let him join us but it would be your choice." He'd say as he introduced the kid. * - Wed Sep 09 17:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would turn, patting Anguo on the shoulder as he'd then head off. He was fully prepared to embark on such a mission so preparation was minimalized.* - Wed Sep 09 17:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was focusing on his objective and how he would accomplish it as he headed outside the village. He retrieved his papers from his satchel and presented them to the gate guards thus gaining access to the exterior of the heavily-guarded village. From there he would continue on through Fire Country as he would traverse all the way to Wind Country where The Hidden Sands was located.* - Wed Sep 09 17:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) || Yan welcomed the heat, the sun--it was home to him. He trudged through the sands within The Land of Wind, his path pre-destined to the village hidden within the sands. He yearned to be within his home, and despite this, he was unable to. His expression darkened as thoughts of the man he despised the most now occupying Yan's village. His friends, his family--he didn't know what happened to any of them yet barging in single-handed would only result in his death. He'd follow the plot.

Yan would keep a steady base as he moved from the western region of the desert all the way to the north-east portion, which positioned him north of the village. He had grown up in the area, so traversing through it was simple and he knew exactly where he was going where as others were at the mercy of a map. The sands moved such that maps were difficult to keep accurate. He'd approach from the north, and stop at the ominously tall walls which protected his village. In this case, it wouldn't help those who fought for it's will.

Yan had a plan for dealing with the situation at hand. He began to transfer chakra into the ground beneath him, manipulating the very consistancy of the earth until it was but loose soil beneath him. With that done, his form would descend within the depths of the earth as he intended to infiltrate the village in this fashion. Once within the earth, he descended into the seven feet into the earht as to allow him the magnetic sensory attributes to the technique though deep enough that he could descend if there was any wild commotion above.||* - Thu Sep 10 01:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) traversed through the soil, reaching out with the magnetic sensory abilities which allowed him to perceive the contingent ninjas within a fifteen foot diameter. As he did, he found himself slightly confused...Rumor had it Edge had occupied the village, yet as he moved through the village, such a population would be felt and it simply was not. As he only felt one or so bodies in the area, he ascended and slipped his head from the surface--looking around. In doing so, he'd see Izanami. "Psst," he'd beckon her attention.* - Thu Sep 10 01:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) shook his head as she seemed to be acting overly-dramatic. In a way, that gave him comfort. In a more serious situation, she might have reacted differently and so it left him to wonder if what information Chiyari had recieved was erroneous. That being said, he'd speak to her more. "Yo, be more serious. Is Edge around?" He'd ask, his bright green eyes moving about as he ensured no one was coming up on him. Since he still had the technique activated, he had three-hundred-and-sixty degree sensory of a fifteen foot radius around him so long as the body approaching him was physically touching the ground.* - Thu Sep 10 01:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) winced slightly as he felt silly at this ponit. He'd ascend more, until his feet were no longer within the earth and the technique all but deactivated. He needed a quick escape just in case. "Are you sure? Chiyari has sent me on a mission to confirm some information that the village had been attacked while we were gone." He'd state, and as he spoke, he was still quite alert.* - Thu Sep 10 01:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) yawns and places a head on the back of his head. "So the council is dead, huh? How many people left with Edge?" He asked, removing the hand as he rested both arms suspended and interlocked at his chest.* - Thu Sep 10 02:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) grins as he turns, performing a series of seals. Upon the last one, with his chakra kneaded and nature transformation accomplished, the area before him was manipulated. Soil would harden and compact, jutting from the ground at four different points. The extension of earch were formed as spikes, and angled in toward one another as to pierce an opponent from multiple directions.

"One more.." He'd say as he paused before breaking into another set of seals. Upon that last seal, he'd slam his hand upon the ground whereupon the spikes which extended from the ground were turned into projectiles that catapulted intheir respective directions. Where they went wasn't all that relevant, though no one was hurt.* - Thu Sep 10 02:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) yawned slightly as he approached the area. He found the new face to stand-out, with his unusual and brightly colored hair. "Yo.." He'd greet the other as he introduced himself. "I haven't seen you around...Name's Yan."* - Thu Sep 10 21:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noticed the other endulging in the sweet, frowning as he wouldn't mind one himself. "Yeah, I figured as much. The army of Suna is returning soon from war. We just had a victory against our enemy Zetsumo and forced him to dessert Konoha which he had taken." He said. He was ready for them to get here. With Edge on the loose, he could attack at any moment and they were sitting ducks.* - Thu Sep 10 21:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) wanted to show off but not so much that he looked arrogant. He performed a singular handseal at a moderate speed as he wanted the other to see it..With the chakra kneaded, his mouth slipped open and a stream of water ejected. It would extend for some ways before hitting a dune ahead of them. It sent sand omni-directional to project in volatility due to the pressure of the water. After a short time, the water ceased and he straightened his throat. "That's the simplest one I know...It's called Water Release: Water Gun.." He'd say, holding up the handseal that was necessary for it.* - Thu Sep 10 21:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) gestures towards the white-haired girl. "She has been training for a while, maybe she has something to teach you as well." He'd note.* - Thu Sep 10 22:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) bent his knees, lunging into the air as he directed the bottom of his sandal onto the other's shoulder. If it connected, he'd thrust into his shoulder which would perhaps knock Flexus  over and he would perform a backward flip that would end several feet away. "Then show me. If both of you want, you can both try your hand at the same time.." He said. This was probably an over-estimation of his own ability. He was testing himself just as much as he was testing them.* - Thu Sep 10 22:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) hadn't anticipated the ninja having such reflexes and abilities. The change in physicalities were obvious as the hand expanded to inhuman scale. Yan, being mid-air at the time, didn't have many options. Considering the other went from zero to one hundred, from passive to hostile, Yan assumed this would work due to lack of momentum.
\\
He shot both his hands forward, as well as his knees. The knees would connect to the hand first, stabilizing the momentum as his hands would land next. From there he would push off his knees and extend his legs, applying both chakra to his hands and knees to manage this without sustaining alot of damage. From there he would jump off. =
\
\As he landed far from the other, using both their momentum and his own upon pushing off, which would put him out of range of the ninja's s=econd attempt. "You're really trying to hurt me, huh?" He'd say, sustaining some damage within his limbs from the brief exchange. He concoted a plan as both the Akimichi and Iron sand user were now near one another in relation to where he stood in the north. 
\
\Yan would break into forming seals, rapid and accurate, and upon the last seal he would produce billowing smoke around him. As the smoke subsided due to expansion, clones were revealed. A total of five were, which three ran forward to combat the Akmichi where as the two that remained back simply built up chakra.* - Thu Sep 10 22:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched as his clones would commense battle against the less experienced ninja. They were anticipating the attack, and so with that said, the hand would come down upon them. Two of them would raise their hands up, which would slow the hand down slightly as it smashed into them. As they were hit, mud would burst from them--further slowing the descend but still fast enough to where it would hit the ground. The remaining clone had transferred chakra into the ground, descending into the soil in sync with the descent of the hand. It would look as though all three of them were killed which one survived.
\
 "I guess you are pretty good, but you haven't shown you are good enough yet!" He'd say, agging him on as he began to perform handseals in preparation.* - Thu Sep 10 23:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) frowned as the clone emerged from Flexus' flank. "It takes more than brawn to win a fight," he'd say with a tilt of his head--beckoning the ninja to look behind him as the other had a seal formed and ready to strike. "Of course, the same goes for me." He'd say and at that moment, the clone behind Flexus would dissolve into mud with ample time for him to look back and see the clone.* - Thu Sep 10 23:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would proceed towards the exit of the village. They had a three-day trek to The Hidden Leaf and getting started as soon as possible was crucial. "Get your supplies and meet me at the front desk," he'd suggest upon his departure.* - Thu Sep 10 23:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) recieves the honey bun into his person and replies with a brightened smile. "Thanks, now suit up." He'd say as he would continue on.* - Thu Sep 10 23:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noticed Flexus approach. He'd be leaning against the wall and contemplating on some things as the other arrived whereupon he pushed from it and looked out into the distance. "Ya' ready?" He'd ask, and upon reply; they would set out.* - Thu Sep 10 23:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) continued walking down the path that lead through the land of wind and toward the land of fire, where The hidden leaf was. As he did, he'd make conversation with his new comrade. "You have some interesting taijutsu. How versatile is it?" He'd ask as he walked. Needless to say, he had an eye out.* - Thu Sep 10 23:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) decided they had walked enough of a distance that they could rest. After all, the amount of sand dwindled and would soon be replaced by fertile grounds layered with grass and wildlife. They took a break near a source of water which would allow them to cool down and rejuvinate properly. Yan would rid himself of his clothing apart from his briefs as he would dive head-first into the water. As he emerged, he beckoned the other to join him. "Not like we get this often," he'd say.* - Thu Sep 10 23:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) swam for quite a while, though he would get out eventually and suited up as he prepared to move out. "Get ready to move out, we have quite a ways to go," he'd say as he slipped his sandals on.* - Thu Sep 10 23:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) enjoyed the tranquility of traveling, though it was also nice to have someone alongside him. He wondered why the army hadn't started marching, as he had sent word that it was safe to bring the army back despite rumors that Edge was currently occupying the village. With such rumors extinguished, what was the hinderance now? He hoped to find out as they neared the village's location. "We are almost there. Have you ever been outside The Land of Wind?" He said, referencing towards the country in which The Hidden Sands was located within.* - Fri Sep 11 00:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) soon arrived to the village of Leaf alongside his company, Flexus. As they entered, they were stopped by Suna-bourne guards who Yan told their business to. To back his claim, he showed paperwork for his mission that had taken him back to the Hidden Sands and now back here. With that said, the duo gained entrance into the village.* - Fri Sep 11 00:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) approached alongside another individual. It was the very person that was there when Yan had recieved his mission from Chiyari. He wondered how the young boy was doing. "Hello Anguo.." He'd greet the boy with the same gentle smile often seen upon the teenager's expression.* - Fri Sep 11 00:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) beckoned the other to attention with the gesturing of his head. "Yeah, this is a rookie genin of the Sand village. What happened with your talk with Chiyari?" He'd ask, folding his arms to his chest as he awaited a response.* - Fri Sep 11 00:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) shakes his head and transfers chakra into the ground. From there the ground beneath him would alter in its consistency until he dipped into it. His form would completely dissapear in this manor, having descended into the earth below. As he did so, he spoke. "I'll see you soon." He was speaking to both of them.* - Fri Sep 11 00:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) , upon sighting the Raikage, bowed toward him and began speaking. "Lord Raikage, have you seen Chiyari-sama? I have a mission report for him and I have not been able to get into touch with him," He'd state as he looked towards the prestigous ninja.* - Fri Sep 11 00:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods as he was gracious toward the Raikage for his aid. "Thank you, Lord Raikage. If you give me the written command, I can have it delivered to the commanders underneath Chiyari-sama." Yan would note this as he progressed toward him to recieve such an item.* - Fri Sep 11 00:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) received the item into his own inventory of items contained within his satchel and bowed once more. "Thanks, sir." Yan would say lastly, thereafter departing to the gate. On his way in, he had noticed one high-ranking commander there. He was eager to return to the village with the army, as such a presence loyal to Chiyari had not been seen in quite some time. It filled his senses with pride, to say the least.* - Fri Sep 11 00:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) approached the area, and continued on southward. As he did, he'd gesture them to follow. "It's time to go, we have our orders." He'd say as he proceeded to the gate. Upon arriving, one of the high-ranking commanders would be there who Yan would provide a written command to move three-thousand of Suna forces back to their village while leaving only five-hundred behind. From there, within the next few hours, such was prepared for and the three-thousand man army would set out from The HIdden Leaf. Anguo, Flexus and Yan would be accompanying them.* - Fri Sep 11 01:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) approached the grand village hidden within the sands. He was within a group of several thousand, and while normally this would send Sand into a frenzy, a messenger was sent ahead of the army to announce the arrival of Sand's quite new army. As they entered the village, civilians and shinobi alike lined up on either side to cheer on the army. For them, they had their first victory in a long line of defeats and the entire village was over-joyed. Anguo, Flexus and Yan had the honor of walking in beside the commander who was being praised by thousands as they passed through. Yan felt the moment to be quite sentimental and had such an expression upon his face that gave accent to a bright smile and illuminated green optics.* - Fri Sep 11 01:14:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would lead off toward Fujitora as the army continued on to greet him. After all, he was Yan's proclaimed sensei. "Hey, pulled some strings and got the job done. Now Suna's army can protect it's village." He'd say upon a pivot to stand beside the chuunin-ranked ninja.* - Fri Sep 11 01:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) yawned slightly, quite tired as he had traveled for six days straight with little rest while on his mission. "Well, I'm going to hit the sack and get some well-deserved rest. I'll catch you guys tomorrow...I'll be doing training if anyone wants to join." He'd say as he would turn and head towards the residential district of the village.* - Fri Sep 11 01:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) yawns as he swipes the gunk from his eyes that accumulated after a long night's sleep. It was early morning and the sun was just rising. That being said, the onset of heat had not begun and the stale air was somewhat cool. He ventured from the residential district and toward the area which was most densely populated by his bretheren. Once there, he would find his own area and prepare to start training his techniques.

"Time to train my Summoning Technique," he'd murmer to himself as he held the thumb up to his face. Pulling it in more, his teeth clamped down and grabbed a minute portion of the epidermis as to pinch it. Upon doing so, skin was torn and blood was released--slapping onto his hand as he transitioned from the preparation to performing a string of seals in quick succession. Each handseal allowed him to mold the chakra for the technique into the proper composition until the last seal was formed and preparation was complete.

"The Summoning Technique,"  he said aloud as the technique was prepared to come to full fruition. He pivoted, slamming an open-palmed strike into the ground as the form of the seal was relinquished for this to be accomplished. Upon connecting with the earth, the seal of the summoning technique would be etched upon the sands before him--indicative of success in the technique's performance. Although, as lastly the summoning would then occur, he did not do so as he was simply training.* - Fri Sep 11 12:37:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Not too much, just training and making sure civilians don't kill one another as all. - Fri Sep 11 14:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) moves on over to the bench, where he takes a seat. He had been training as well, but he was still lively. "So, how did you become a chuunin?" He'd ask, expecting a heroic story to be told.* - Fri Sep 11 14:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Oh, you are a jounin, mah bad. - Fri Sep 11 14:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I want to become a chuunin! - Fri Sep 11 14:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: We have chuunin exams, but there have always been other ways. - Fri Sep 11 14:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I heard traditionally villages would hold chuunin examinations but there haven't been in any in years.. - Fri Sep 11 14:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: What other ways can someone be promoted to chuunin? - Fri Sep 11 14:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) places both his hands onto the bench, at his rear with digits that wrapped around the back of the bench as he leaned into the foundation that was created from it. From there he'd simply listen to Fujitora and respond accordingly.* - Fri Sep 11 14:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Well, special missions given by the kage. - Fri Sep 11 14:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I was given a special recon mission by the Kazekage...I mean, there was no danger and it was all on wrong information but still! - Fri Sep 11 14:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Minato is my fav tho not cuz of his title, but because he the only normal non clan nig to have became a powerful kage - Fri Sep 11 14:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: It'll have to be requested or proven that you're worthy of chuunin duties. - Fri Sep 11 14:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Oh, I wa---. - Fri Sep 11 14:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I wasn't asking to be promoted to chuunin, I was just talking crap. I mean, the mission didn't result in anything. - Fri Sep 11 15:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Ah.. - Fri Sep 11 15:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: Tatsumi would probably be chuunin by now... - Fri Sep 11 15:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: How old were you when you became chuunin Fujitora? - Fri Sep 11 15:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I was 15.  - Fri Sep 11 15:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Just a year older than me. I'm on track then. - Fri Sep 11 15:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Just continue your training, master all skills necessary. - Fri Sep 11 15:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods in reply to the jounin. "Right." He'd make an audible reply, peering toward the heavenly body that was the sun as he thought about his career thus far as a ninja.* - Fri Sep 11 15:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yo'..iron sand guy, what's your name again? - Fri Sep 11 15:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would say, averting his eyes back to the ground. It was a little hard to see, since he had been looking at the sun directly, but he had already seen the other there from before.* - Fri Sep 11 15:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Namuko(Darkcore1245) says: Namuko. - Fri Sep 11 15:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Wish Chiyari was around to give me a mission. I'm bored! - Fri Sep 11 15:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: If only I had the power to. - Fri Sep 11 15:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Are you down to spar, Namuko? - Fri Sep 11 15:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Namuko(Darkcore1245) says: No - Fri Sep 11 15:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Namuko(Darkcore1245) says: .* - Fri Sep 11 15:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Whatcha' gonna do then? Just sit there all day? - Fri Sep 11 15:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Namuko(Darkcore1245) says: Yep. - Fri Sep 11 15:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Boring~. - Fri Sep 11 15:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I guess I will practice one of my techniques then. - Fri Sep 11 15:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) grimaced at how lazy the sand user seemed, although he did realize everyone was different and perhaps the other had been training earlier. Either way, energy was brimming within the young man and he sought to extinguish what had already been proven to be infinite--his stamina. He'd lift a single hand before his face, elognating his thumb as his teeth bared down upon it. The teeth clenched a minute portion of its epidermis which would cause a insignificant wound which blood would seep from.

As he removed his thumb and slapped the leaking blood onto his hand, he'd speak to Namuko as he began performing a string of seals. "This is my brother's summoning technique. When he was killed, it was passed down to me." He said, the thought invigorated his desire to perform the technique. If Namuko looked, he would see the string of seals performed at such a rate that his hands appeared to be a blur. At the end of the series, the last seal was relinquished from positioning and his hand shot down open-palmed.

Yan's hand would collide with the sandy surface, sending sand splattering in several directions as the seal of the summoning technique would manifest on the ground below him. Despite such coming into occurance, the technique would not come into full fruition as he did not want to bother the toads for mere training when the training had very little to do with them specifically rather simply the act of performing the technique.* - Fri Sep 11 15:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Namuko(Darkcore1245) says: Er.. - Fri Sep 11 15:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Namuko(Darkcore1245) says: Right. - Fri Sep 11 15:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: This guys seems like a drag. - Fri Sep 11 15:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noticed the other, eyeing him before reaching into his satchel. From within it he brandished a marker.* - Fri Sep 11 16:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) quietly walked over to Flexus as he'd begin drawing very lightly on his face. He'd draw a penis and balls, the penis directed into his mouth.* - Fri Sep 11 16:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) after doing this, he'd put the marker away and nudge him with a hand. "Hey, wake up!" He'd say aloud, surely awakening the other from his slumber.* - Fri Sep 11 16:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Uh, I Just got done training. What do you wanna do? - Fri Sep 11 16:33:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Have you been practicing that water jutsu I taught you? - Fri Sep 11 16:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Uhhhhhhhh... I have been working on drawwwing out my elemental properties so  that in a way would be a yes. - Fri Sep 11 16:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Oh yeah? That's cool. How far have you gotten? - Fri Sep 11 16:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Its gotten a little easier i can sorta switch betwwen the tow chakra natures but some times its hard to tell which is which. - Fri Sep 11 17:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Just keep practicing. As an elementalist, I can tell you doing things over and over are the only way to get use to them. - Fri Sep 11 17:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Will do. - Fri Sep 11 17:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm? - Fri Sep 11 17:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Flexus is trying to learn to control the elements. - Fri Sep 11 17:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Oh? Which? - Fri Sep 11 17:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I was just giving him some advice and I was teaching him the same technique that you had taught me. - Fri Sep 11 17:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) felt quite proud to be instructing genin who were in need of such. That being said, he seemed to have a wide, toothy grin extended upon his face.* - Fri Sep 11 17:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm..That is most good then, as long as it helps him progress faster. - Fri Sep 11 17:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: So where are all the other cool people? - Fri Sep 11 17:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yo'. - Fri Sep 11 20:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noticed the woman who had until now fairly unsociable. He turned from Flexus and looked towards the kunoichi. "Our army is bigger than its been in a long time..." He'd note further, shooting a friendly smile. "The name's Yan." He'd introduce himself after a short pause, as to eliminate any need for hostility.* - Fri Sep 11 21:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) wasn't sure how to respond to the woman so he just continued smiling, resting a hand atop his head as he rubbed through his blonde hair. "Uh, so, who are you?" He'd ask, as he had just introduced himself.* - Fri Sep 11 21:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mmm. - Fri Sep 11 21:27:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Besides whywould you want qoute unqoute barbains to protect you? - Fri Sep 11 22:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: A silly question. If one lacks the ability to fight for themselves. - Fri Sep 11 22:27:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) looked at him curiously. "And what's that?" He'd ask, sincerely at a loss as to what was going on.* - Fri Sep 11 23:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Its a game I call Sarcasam. - Fri Sep 11 23:14:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) fully complies with the quieting that fujitora attempted. Yan felt silly afterward but stood to attention. * - Fri Sep 11 23:40:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: ....Fuinjutsu...Edge? - Fri Sep 11 23:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) begins to seem more angrier at his mention. This would continue throughout the conversation.* - Fri Sep 11 23:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: This was done before he went rogue...An act of defense for us but can be used against us if he chose...I don't know how he assembled such but our army wont be safe...The civilians and children wil, but the army I believe is at risk.. - Fri Sep 11 23:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: More than 80% of our population..Are on the side of Edge. - Fri Sep 11 23:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...I can't stay here...not if Edge is allowed to be the leader. - Fri Sep 11 23:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: Though he does not stay here..They have all been moved by his word.. That 80% plus the number of men  he already holds...It is why I believe konoha or Kumo are better options.. - Fri Sep 11 23:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Kumo..? - Fri Sep 11 23:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) looked towards Flexus. He, of course, would be accompanying them alongside three thousand suna soldiers. Wherever they went, they'd be an asset and welcomed.* - Fri Sep 11 23:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: It'll depend on where we go..Whats the status on Konoha? - Fri Sep 11 23:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: .... - Fri Sep 11 23:48:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Namuko(Darkcore1245) says: I can hear you. - Fri Sep 11 23:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I know. - Fri Sep 11 23:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Konoha has five-hundred of us stationed there...It seems pretty safe...but I don't know if Kumo wil let us just take it - Fri Sep 11 23:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: The migration will have to be a wise one, if y' return to konoha, we'll be short of men...I suppose that you all can stay stationed here till we get better information on what will happen..But from the looks of things now,..I don't truly know. - Fri Sep 11 23:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: ... - Fri Sep 11 23:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Mister... - Fri Sep 11 23:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) thinks: ...What was his name...? - Fri Sep 11 23:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Stay stationed here? It's not safe for anyone to be safe. Why don't you start moving forces, and either I or you can go to the Raikage and talk business...I'm sure you'd want to do that.  - Fri Sep 11 23:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: If Edge decides to activate4 those tags, we won't be able to stop the casualties. - Fri Sep 11 23:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Namuko(Darkcore1245) says: Tch.. - Fri Sep 11 23:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Namuko(Darkcore1245) says: I'm just a genin. - Fri Sep 11 23:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: I am too, but when it comes down to it, we were trained to protect and serve these people. - Fri Sep 11 23:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: Because, one move can bring suspicion.. So if we do go to Kumo, who's to say Edge may not be waiting for us at the boarder with his men from the word of these civilians who look up to him as the ruler. - Fri Sep 11 23:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Namuko(Darkcore1245) says: #Hm. - Fri Sep 11 23:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: At least we could fight. The alternative is Edge attacking and activating the tags before attacking to leave us helpless... - Fri Sep 11 23:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Namuko(Darkcore1245) whispers: And who's to say we can't send messager birds? - Fri Sep 11 23:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: Then we should send our people back to Kono or Kumo till this can be fixed. - Fri Sep 11 23:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm? @Kush - Fri Sep 11 23:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) whispers: Who is edge? - Fri Sep 11 23:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Decide. We can send word to the Raikage asking for permission before hand... - Fri Sep 11 23:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: You said there were missions... - Sat Sep 12 00:00:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: In fact, Flexus, I want to finish what we started. - Sat Sep 12 00:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would move out to the open area, turning to face Flexus asw he beckoned him forward. "Let's get back to the test of mettle...for both of us." He'd say as he prepared for combat--hands neared in distance between the two.* - Sat Sep 12 00:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: WHOA?! - Sat Sep 12 00:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) half-expected this. As Flexus grew to unhuman size, Yan swallowed hard as he knew that if he was hit, it'd be major damage. Nevertheless, he was here to set an example. He finished the swallow and narrowed his eyes. "That's it; show me what a ninja can do for his village." He said, casting away doubts that he could go all out on Flexus.
\
\Yan began forming seals one after another, very quickly, as he kneaded and prepared chakra. At the end of the string of seals, five clones erupted from billowing clouds of smoke that would manifest around him. Upon settling, they lined up infront of him--all of them preparing to perform a technique.
\
\"Bring it, pal!"* - Sat Sep 12 00:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would trigger the clones to release the mud. As they did, mud would erupt before them. Because they were side-by-side, the rivers would over-lap and form a wider. Simultaneously, Yan would perceive a single handseal. His ability to form seals would allow him to perform this seal within three-tenths of a second. Upon the seals completion, a stream of water would jet from his mouth and combat the stream of fire. With his superior ninjutsu, it would probably trump the technique due to their rank being equal. Having said that, the mud would look to over-take the opponent. Additionally, once the flames were defeated, the water gun would divert to the mud strengthening the flow.* - Sat Sep 12 01:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) as poistioned behind them all, so as he hit them, they were insignificant clones. That being said, bursting into mud, each one would slow momentum and therefore prevent him from being as offensively aggressive as he wanted to be perhaps. Yan wasn't going to fight close-range with the gigantic ninja and so he leapt backwards more than once to distance himself. As he landed on the last step, he performed a set of seals that allowed him to activate the clone technique again. With that said, a total of ten clones rushed forward, jumping and attacking him. He wouldn't be able to fight them all. As he was fighting the ten clones, Yan would be building up chakra. He used some, but he had alot more.* - Sat Sep 12 01:16:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) found it odd he suddenly collapsed, but he cha=lked it up to not understanding his own limitations with his techniques. "You gotta be careful..that can get you killed.."H'ed say as he approached.* - Sat Sep 12 01:27:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) had the ten clones pick up his body and transport him to the hospital to be monitered until he regained conciousness.* - Sat Sep 12 01:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I'll spar in his place. - Sat Sep 12 01:29:48 2015

It reminded him f his older brother, Tatsumi, who was killed by Edge. "Nice." He transitioned eyes to the woman, as he did not trust to discuss anything with her regarding Edge or t heir knowledge of Edge's whereabouts. That being said, certain subjects were not to be breached at the moment.* - Sat Sep 12 13:20:38 2015
