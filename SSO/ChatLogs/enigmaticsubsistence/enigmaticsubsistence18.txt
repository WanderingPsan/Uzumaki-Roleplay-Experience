<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) received the mission from Hassan, replying with a firm nod as he placed the mission scroll into his satchel and did a one-eighty turn to face the office's door. From there he would take his leave, departing through the hallway that followed a set of stairs. As he entered the lobby, Yan would garnish his features with a bright smile as he'd wish a good day to the receptionist stationed near the entrance.

Yan received the sun and arid landscape upon what bare skin remained uncovered by his crimson armor, though he really enjoyed it...He had found him at some point in every renown hidden village of the world and he found the sand's climate home. Thoughts of such lingered within his mind as he set his focus to task.

 He swept by his home to stock up on supplies--dried foods, maps and a resource of information regarding the Land of Stone as well as the man he pursued. From what he read, the missing ninja was accused of killing a relative of his..his brother...who was also a fellow ninja. 

This struck Yan on a personal level as his own brother was taken from him when be was just a freshly graduated genin. He couldn't fathom killing his family, let alone an honored member of Sands forces though he revered all of suna as his family. After skimming the information Yan would leave his housing unit and make his way through alleyways and streets toward the earthen corridor that served as sands defensively minded gates.

"Yo," Yans voice would sound off in greeting to The guards at the gate. Hyashi and Nori were two ninja who frequented duty..Yan guessed they enjoyed it. Either way they did their job and for that they had Yans recognition. He would talk with them a bit more as he showed them his paperwork. It didn't say much other than his permission from Hassan to leave.  As he said his goodbyes to them...he noticed a familiar form approaching them from the interior.

---------

would smile brightly upon confirmation of the figures identity. Ther weren't many that Yan was certain would beat him, but on that small list was Jiki Tetsumi. That being said, he was happy to have such a powerful ninja to help him in the mission.

Yan parted lips as he mustered a reply with a excited grin etched upon his features. "Yep...and ready to get down to business. I'll follow your lead on this one," he would say with a pivot as bright green eyes cast their gaze to the expanse of sand they would travel  through. "Ya ready?" he'd ask without looking back.

----

nodded firmly as tetsumi responded. He shook his head just as his form shifted from the position and he started the journey. "Nor do I," Yan remarked. Yan believed in peace and love, but he also had a hidden nature that lurked beneath...he was merciless in the face of evil. Problem was he hadn't tasted unlawful justice. It was a naivety that might factor into the mission


As he pondered upon the man they faced, Yan would weigh tetsumi's understanding of the situation and how well he was prepared.  Really it was only small talk though.

"What do you know about the guy other than his crime?" the inquiry provided by Yan beckoned him into thought as to what sort of man he was. To kill your own brother? Yan could only assume he was nothing more than scrum.

 Yan would await Tetsumis answer as they trudged through the sand.

soon recognized the coined teal hair that had made trilliam perhaps too visible and distinctive. Yan had no doubt with such unique ninjutsu and different style of features, trillion would become known throughout the ninja world. Yan produced a lengthened grin as the boy pleaded to join with the chuunin on a mission.

"I have no doubt," Yan replied as He beckoned him along. "Nor I, tell Hassan I decided to take trillion along. He won't mind." Yan would say lastly as he began to trudge onward into the ocean of sand before them.

nodded towards the guard as they both forgot they saw anything. Yan was friends of the guards and headed immigration policies so the guard ultimately answered.to him

 
As for Trilliam, he laughed and motioned him to quiet with a Palm that urged down upon the ai "Woah, first off settle down..haha. This is a B-Ranked mission to capture or kill a rogue ninja that killed his brother before fleeing the village." Yan described the mission; pausing briefly before continuing.

"He is a experienced ration user who specializes in weapon techniques...so we are both at a disadvantage elementally...." Yan finished as he observed Trilliams reaction.

"Any questions?"

had forgotten that Trilliam used ration ninjutsu. "Maybe we can use your ration and my clones water techs for combos..I'd rather not be electrocuted myself." he chuckled and nodded at the suggestion.

He provided a very bright, friendly smile that matched vibrant green hues that peered forth toward the trio lined up behind the desk. "I have returned, sir."

The question would expand to all facets of village life that really impacted his own job. Immigration, criminal activity and general strength and status of the village's forces. Anything Hassan thought might make Yan's everyday activities that had become quite encompassing when on duty.* - Mon Nov  2 20:33:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Otherwise I'm going to get some training in myself. - Mon Nov  2 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) takes silence as do what you want, and so he bows and heads off.* - Mon Nov  2 21:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) departs from the office and heads toward the square. He wouldn't particularly take notice of those around other than brief glances of acknowledgement. He wasn't familiar with them save for one or two conversations at the most.* - Mon Nov  2 21:09:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peers towards the blue-haired ninja, and with a bright smile upon Yan's lips, his vibrant green hues would observe the boy briefly. "Hello. I haven't met you yet. I am Yan. I was on vacation but now I am back." He'd say, and looking towards Kasanari, he'd simply nod. He didn't know the state of affairs while he was gone, but he was a very active ninja in the village.* - Mon Nov  2 21:13:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) uses all of those elements.* - Mon Nov  2 21:17:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Really? - Mon Nov  2 21:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: What techniques do you know under those elements? - Mon Nov  2 21:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Well I don't know any water but I know a few earth techniques. - Mon Nov  2 21:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I see. Thanks...your name? @Kasanari - Mon Nov  2 21:18:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'll teach you your first water technique. - Mon Nov  2 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: That would be great!~ - Mon Nov  2 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) reaches into his satchel, rummaging through the quite spacious bag for inventory until he retrieved a small cyndrillical object that appeared to be a scroll. He would toss it towards Hiroshi. "This is a D rank water technique." He'd state. To help him learn, he would then perform it.

He'd form a single seal, at which point chakra would be kneaded and thereafter converted into a wealth of water that welled within his gullet. As his lips were forced open, the water would jet from his lips and extend south-ward until the loss of momentum caused it to divert downward.* - Mon Nov  2 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Haha.. Earth and water ..same as my natures. If I actually used jutsus, I guess you be pretty useful to teacher to me!  - Mon Nov  2 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Awww the only element I share with you all is Earth. - Mon Nov  2 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: I feel all left out. - Mon Nov  2 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Sorry pal. - Mon Nov  2 21:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And I see that sword on your back. I bet you are pretty handy with it, Chikyu. - Mon Nov  2 21:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Who's your pops? - Mon Nov  2 21:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: ...uhh... Well I just call him pops! - Mon Nov  2 21:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Oh...okay. - Mon Nov  2 21:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, alotta new faces. Trilliam, where is Koji and Katsune? - Mon Nov  2 21:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Ahh, who cares! Hes still my dad. - Mon Nov  2 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah, I understand that. - Mon Nov  2 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Training time is so close...meh... I really don't want to learn these last jutsus. They don't have much use while I have a sword. - Mon Nov  2 21:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah, I used a sword in my earlier days, but I realized that I didn't need one. - Mon Nov  2 21:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: My ninjutsu is what i need to focus on. - Mon Nov  2 21:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: My dad says that one just needs to focus on what their heart tells them too! If one wishes and trains properly, you can be strong in many ways! - Mon Nov  2 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Cool beans. - Mon Nov  2 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Your dad sounds like a man of passion for his ninja art. - Mon Nov  2 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I can respect that. - Mon Nov  2 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Well he said hes been trained since birth! He said his parents worked him to the point where he felt like dying would be better then living. But then, he had a realization. - Mon Nov  2 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) awaits her to continue, folding his arms to his chest against his armor.* - Mon Nov  2 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) honestly anticipated a very different version of this story, and so he busted out laughing at the plot twist from prinicple to lust. "Hahaha! Well, I guess that's true." He noted. "What is your own nindo?" He'd ask, his laughter fading as it reverted to his normal, pleasant smile.* - Mon Nov  2 21:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, your drive as a shinobi. Your ninja way, ya'know. - Mon Nov  2 21:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: ...... - Mon Nov  2 21:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Some people have various reasons for doing what they do. Some selfish and some selfless. Some don't even have enough purpose to have a ninja way....which I don't understand but it is what it is. - Mon Nov  2 21:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: What are you guys talking about? - Mon Nov  2 21:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Just reasons to becoming a ninja and what makes one drive to be stronger. - Mon Nov  2 21:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Who are you, young lady? - Mon Nov  2 21:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Ahh. I'm Nina!~ - Mon Nov  2 21:49:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Eh-heh. Yeah, I guess it is. - Mon Nov  2 21:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I like it, it looks cool. - Mon Nov  2 21:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Thanks! - Mon Nov  2 21:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Are you in the academy? - Mon Nov  2 21:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Nope, I'm a genin. - Mon Nov  2 21:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Oh man..well, my apologies.  - Mon Nov  2 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It's nice to meet you and I hope I'll be working with you soon, then! - Mon Nov  2 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: It's okay. Are you a genin too? - Mon Nov  2 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm usually the paper pusher of the village though so I don't get out on missions often. - Mon Nov  2 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..Uh, well, I am a chunin. - Mon Nov  2 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I never had the opportunity to take the chunin examinations though. I was promoted during wartime. - Mon Nov  2 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Ohh, does that mean you're strong?~ - Mon Nov  2 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Eh, it means I've been around. - Mon Nov  2 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: So you're weak? Haha. - Mon Nov  2 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: It's okay, I am too. But I don't care anymore. - Mon Nov  2 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, I guess I'd be bias in saying that I am strong. Few have beaten me. - Mon Nov  2 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I could count them on one hand. - Mon Nov  2 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You should care about your strength as a ninja, though. What sort of technique styles do you use? - Mon Nov  2 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Maybe I could help you a little. - Mon Nov  2 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I use everything. I'm a generalist. - Mon Nov  2 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: And I used to care, but I've come to realize that I can't save everybody. - Mon Nov  2 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: So.... - Mon Nov  2 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well... - Mon Nov  2 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: That just means you should try to get stronger. - Mon Nov  2 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I couldn't save my best friend or my brother. They are both dead because I wasn't there to protect them. Now I've devoted my life to becoming stronger so that no one else will be killed needlessly. - Mon Nov  2 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I suppose so, but even if you get stronger, you can't stop everyone. - Mon Nov  2 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And that's why you have an entire village to help you. Many of us who settled back into Sand have worked tirelessly to create a safe enviroment...We are the most stable village in the entire world at the moment. - Mon Nov  2 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: That way you can train to become strong...same for me and everyone else here. - Mon Nov  2 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I see. - Mon Nov  2 21:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) caught the chance in expression within his periphial. He didn't know either of them, though he was familiarized with Index to a very small degree. He wouldn't straight out watch them, but with his awareness now expanded, he would watch for any visual hints towards anything bad.* - Mon Nov  2 22:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Uh, well, I just got back from a long walk home..Uh, I mostly just train...*cough* I try to stay busy with my ninja duties.  - Mon Nov  2 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It doesn't leave much room for hanging out and leisure time. - Mon Nov  2 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I could train with you and maybe critique you, if you'd like. Otherwise Trilliam is someone you'd probably liket o go hang out with. He's a fun guy. - Mon Nov  2 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Well, you could train me if you'd like, but I'd rather have a friend to hang out with too. - Mon Nov  2 22:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) thinks: Such a gathering. They look strong.. I wonder how smart they are! - Mon Nov  2 22:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hey Nina, how are you doing today! - Mon Nov  2 22:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: There ya go. She seems pretty fun. - Mon Nov  2 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I'm doing good. - Mon Nov  2 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods and turns. "If you want to train, or anyone for that matter, I will be in the training grounds." He'd say as he began to trudge away in the sand.* - Mon Nov  2 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: And you're not getting out of this Yan, don't even try it. - Mon Nov  2 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..Eh, like I said, come on if you want. - Mon Nov  2 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: In fact, I wouldn't mind both of you sparring me. - Mon Nov  2 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Its quite rude to try and use training, as an excuse to break a conversation! - Mon Nov  2 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm not that strong but I can try to hold up against two ninja. - Mon Nov  2 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) says: How about three? - Mon Nov  2 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: You should've told them your training schedule was coming up soon! - Mon Nov  2 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Three? - Mon Nov  2 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ......Come on. - Mon Nov  2 22:07:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..Trilliam, you can watch. - Mon Nov  2 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I don't think I can even handle three. - Mon Nov  2 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Nina is who I invited. - Mon Nov  2 22:08:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Missions I guess. - Mon Nov  2 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Maybe Trilliam will spar you two. - Mon Nov  2 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: He's a strong genin. - Mon Nov  2 22:09:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded firmly as she stationed herself and completed preparation to commense the bout. "Go!" He'd say. By then Sanoke would have spoke, though it would have fell upon deaf ears as Yan had began movement. The chunin pushed extremties forward and hands together, forming a single hand with assimilated digits.


With that, four plumes of smoke manifested ambient to the position of Yan, wherein appeared four identical replicas of Yan. Each one would assume their job, though generally it was to protect Yan and prepare to counter or block. Yan would begin a second set of seals, the speed in which each seal created almost a blur.

Suddenly, two of the clones would form each their own seal. One held their hand close to their mouth, whereas the other one slammed his hand upon the ground. Simultaneously, their techniques would come into fruition. A growth of rock would become evident as terra formed upwards and around Marrissa. The second would open their mouths, jaws completely ajar, whereupon a wealth of water would spill from his mouth. The mentioned water would move forwards at approximately fifteen feet per second. The earth technique would ultimately form a cavern around the woman, with only one opening which was now victim to a surge of water rushing forward.

Yan would be behind the first two, and in line with the second two who were positioned behind the ones performing the techniques.* - Tue Nov  3 04:15:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I thank you for your kindness. - Tue Nov  3 04:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) wouldn't have noticed her. Unknowingly, since their wasn't a huge explosion or some other situation-altering attack that would allow her to escape; he continued his own intentions. Yan finished the seals being performed in a fraction of a second, thereafter simply start to look around for her. As the clone who spouted water from his mouth continued to do so, coming to an eventual stop, the other clone would venture forward to investigate. Meanwhile, one of the clones adjacent to Yan though a few feet away would begin forming seals. The other one would remain close and ready to defend Yan though his physical prowess was not great.* - Tue Nov  3 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Yeah. - Tue Nov  3 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: -omit- - Tue Nov  3 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) wouldn't have seen it coming. Yan would be kicked in the pelvic bone. At this point, it would seem as though Yan had unwittlingly fell into her attack, though just as the attack would continue into the taijutsu-specialized technique, things would take a turn.

The clone forming seals would release his chakra, having held the technique up until this point as his seals were formed in quick succession. Meanwhile, Yan's form would explode into billowing smoke. He would have replaced himself with the clone who was before hand simply guarding him. That being said, Marrissa would be hitting a shadow clone at this point.

Before the smoke would even clear, pillars from the earth would rise from the ground. Normally spikes, the ends were dulled to simply pin or ram cause concussive or blunt damage, rather than spears which wouldn't be appropriate in this scenario. Meanwhile, Yan would begin performing handseals himself now as would the other once he had recovered from using the first technique.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) simply nods. He wasn't one to be noncompliant with an order, even if he disliked it. Regardless, the village's operation was dependant upon every ninja doing their part. That being said, he would quickly make his way toward the gate. "Consider it done, then. And I've already started on the paperwork. I'll make sure it's caught up." He'd say, his voice less than enthusiastic about his job. * - Tue Nov  3 07:13:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) trudged through the sand for some time, eventually moving from the interior of the village towards the large walls which encompassed it's boundary. He would make his way between the two walls as it narrowed towards the exit of the village. Upon arriving, he would relieve those that were already stationed and would assume his position and begin watching out.* - Tue Nov  3 07:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) gazed over the horizon, his vision encroached by what seemed to be an endless ocean of sand marked by dunes that would be moved in a weeks time by the winds that were cast upon the sands. For someone who didn't know, it was hard to find specific smaller villages within the The Land of Wind. In fact, without a guide, some were impossible to find. Yan would contemplate the nature of the country he lived within as his focus remained on the distance ahead of him.* - Tue Nov  3 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would ponder upon many things, but there was a point that such gave way to his lack of attention and he'd soon find himself bored. It was a slow day, only passerbys were ninja leaving on the missions and merchants moving into the village to show their goods. He, of course, checked everyone extensively and made sure their visas and paperwork were all filled out properly and authentic.

When it got boring, he'd pull out a set of die and roll them. In his earlier youth, he would play die against his brother and his friend...And since he hadn't played in a while, he would roll them a few times to see if he still had a good rolling technique.* - Tue Nov  3 07:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Nice.. - Tue Nov  3 07:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would soon be approached by another set of ninja who would take his place. He'd give them a bright smile and look at their paperwork which confirmed such at which point he would take his leave. He supposed that the duty was a humbling experience. Nevertheless, he couldn't help but think that Hassan didn't really treasure him as a gifted shinobi any longer.* - Tue Nov  3 07:30:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) looked upon the sky, noticing the accumulation of clouds within the expanse. It was abnormal, and he recognized the sort of clouds from his times in other countries where such occurances were more common. As the rain pelted upon him, having no idea the reason behind it, he simply smiled and enjoyed the moisture as it pelted against his skin. Although it soon ended, he felt a calm aura around him. Soon though, that moisture would be uncmofortably humid when combined with the unrelenting heat.* - Tue Nov  3 17:22:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Oh, a medical shinobi. It's nice to meet someone going into a field that's geared towards helping people instead of killing. - Tue Nov  3 19:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: What's your name, buddy? I'm Yan. - Tue Nov  3 19:05:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Sure thing, boss. - Tue Nov  3 19:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) despite being a good shinobi, he was oftentimes quite oblivious to smaller, lesser details in his mind. That being said, he had made no real decision or thought about her arm and so it slipped his mind completely. He bore a smile to the woman, and greeted her with a friendly nod.

"Hello Marrisa." He'd say, interested in getting to know who the woman was that he had sparred before.* - Tue Nov  3 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) a brow raised, the smile twisting into one that exibited skepticism. He looked to his right, where Bryson was, and then back to Marrisa. When concerning tabacco, he had never been one that enjoyed the flavor or act. "Sorry, I don't smoke tabacco."  He replied, and as the smoke left the woman's lips, it's aroma drifted into nostrils which naturally breathed inward. It definitely smelt different than what he was used to smelling when someone smoked. A special tabacco maybe?* - Tue Nov  3 19:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I's not Tobacco. . It's Sweet Herb. . PErfectly healthy for you - Tue Nov  3 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And it's called blunt? - Tue Nov  3 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Mhmm - Tue Nov  3 19:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: It's what Ortho and I smoke - Tue Nov  3 19:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: What do you think Bryson? - Tue Nov  3 19:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You are a medical ninja, after all. - Tue Nov  3 19:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Well I smoke ciggerattes but herbs without chemicals as slightliy less worse than this - Tue Nov  3 19:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would shrug. It seemed things were pretty slow today and he could let loose and live a little. After all, all the work he put into ensuring the village was safe and everything operated nicely was for him to enjoy just as much as everyone else. The way Hassan had been regarding him lately, he felt a little underappreciated anyway. Maybe he should think about himself a little more. 

With that said, he'd nod with a smile. "I guess I can try it," he'd say in a mockingly defeated manner--reaching out with his right hand to take the stick of marijuana. He continued to take into the aroma, finding its skunky aroma abnormally savory. As he brought it towards his lips, a deep inhale and then exhale released to ready his lungs, he'd suck into his mouth the smoke of the blunt. 

The end burned a firey cherry, dimming as he finally released the suction and simply contained the encroaching smoke that billowed within the interior. He'd hold it for a second, as he had observed Marrisa do, before the smoke was forced out and his lungs gave into the eratic coffing that would be induced upon virgin lungs. He had taken a rather large hit, so the smoke would billow from his mouth and shoot across the air before him.

"What...tha.." He mumbled as he was hunched over coughing, eventually erecting his body as his face was flushed with the red pigment. His eyes, now discolored to a pink,almost red, hue. There was a sort of unexplainable tension in his eye, as though they were being squeezed gingerly. It was as though he could feel the stems in the back of his eyes, and the sensation reached from each eye and into his forehead as he felt slightly light headed.

"This is a drug.." He said uneasily, yet relaxed.* - Tue Nov  3 19:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) also tries to hand it back to Marissa, of course.* - Tue Nov  3 19:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Pass... - Tue Nov  3 19:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Who's that guy? - Tue Nov  3 20:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: That's my boyfirend Ortho. .  - Tue Nov  3 20:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: boyfriend* - Tue Nov  3 20:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods. "Yo', my name is Yan!" He'd say, a goofy expression lurking upon his face due to him being high.* - Tue Nov  3 20:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, he doesn't seem too friendly. - Tue Nov  3 20:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah, anytime. - Tue Nov  3 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would recieve a flier in his possession. Having been there the night before when he first arrived, he had knoweldge of the man. A brute, taijutsu fighter. Yan was interested in fighting him to say the least. With Tetsumi and the summon's exchange, his eyes darted over. "Katsune and who? Someone killed Kilm?" He'd ask Tetsumi, his expression quite serious.* - Tue Nov  3 20:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: ...... - Tue Nov  3 20:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Where is Katsune?! - Tue Nov  3 20:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Uh, I don't know. What is wrong? - Tue Nov  3 20:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would definitely follow, as he was concerned for what was going on and was obligated to find out.* - Tue Nov  3 20:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would arrive alongside him, and upon seeing the other, he'd inspect him with piercing green eyes.* - Tue Nov  3 20:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Yan, would you deal with this? You're capable... I have to find those two. - Tue Nov  3 20:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You should tell me what you are doing. - Tue Nov  3 20:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I know you out-rank me, but I'm just concerned. - Tue Nov  3 20:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: I'll tell you when you're finished. - Tue Nov  3 20:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Fair enough. - Tue Nov  3 20:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: I hear trouble? - Tue Nov  3 20:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) relunctantly nods and steps forward, taking his attention wholly upon the man before him. "What's your business bud?" He'd ask, his voice friendly and aura benevolent.* - Tue Nov  3 20:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: I'm just a travelling katana user, I aim to try and emigrate here. - Tue Nov  3 20:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Perhaps my skills could be of use to people here. - Tue Nov  3 20:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And what's your name? - Tue Nov  3 20:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: My name is Kurt, Pleasure to meet you. - Tue Nov  3 20:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yan. - Tue Nov  3 20:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: No provocation makes me a happy man. I'm not the type to be calm or diplomatic whenever provoked. - Tue Nov  3 20:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Hopefully I'll be on the same page as everyone else in the village. - Tue Nov  3 20:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: That doesn't sound like you intend to keep your cool. - Tue Nov  3 20:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: It just makes me want to kill them, though I'll try my best if they talk shit about me. - Tue Nov  3 20:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm denying you entrance into this village. I will let our leader know you have come and I will talk to him about you. You might be able to be gain entrance in the future. - Tue Nov  3 20:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: I see, Very well. I only keep my cool if no one starts anything with me. - Tue Nov  3 20:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: I'm the type to stay silent though, Not the type to start conversations. - Tue Nov  3 20:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: But since you're a high ranking official in the village seems like, I'll just wait to talk with the leader as you said. - Tue Nov  3 20:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah, but not right here at the entrance. - Tue Nov  3 20:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You should visit one of the outter-lying villages and take refuge there to return. - Tue Nov  3 20:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Hm, What are you suggesting? To come back once the leader is active? - Tue Nov  3 20:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm suggesting you do something other than stand at the enrance of a militaristic village. You can understand why one would not want a foreign ninja camping outside our village. - Tue Nov  3 20:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It's not good business. - Tue Nov  3 20:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I have no quarrel with you, I'm simply protecting my village. Our leader will be informed of your desire and I just might send a messenger for you to come back if Hassan is especially intereted. - Tue Nov  3 20:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Alright, Yan. - Tue Nov  3 20:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Good day and be safe. - Tue Nov  3 20:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: I shall camp out in one of the other villages. Inform me of the final result if you can using a messenger bird, I'll be interested still. - Tue Nov  3 20:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Farewell. - Tue Nov  3 20:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would turn and head off, the chuunin guards would cut off the entrance again and ensure his departure.* - Tue Nov  3 20:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yo'. - Tue Nov  3 20:42:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Something has happened and he's looking to find Katsune and a man she's familiar with. - Tue Nov  3 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Hmm? - Tue Nov  3 20:44:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) walks off quickly in search of Tetsumi.* - Tue Nov  3 20:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..I got your message. How do you know Kilm was killed and that Katsune did it? - Tue Nov  3 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: We share the same type of summoning contract. The raccoons informed me. - Tue Nov  3 21:01:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Do you want me to put the guard on high alert? - Tue Nov  3 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: I knew I should have done something about her. Now his death is on me..I won't let her kill anyone else. - Tue Nov  3 21:02:30 2015
