<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: What's your name again? - Tue Sep 22 00:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Violet - Tue Sep 22 00:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I see you are a kenjutsu-user....Are you good? I'd like an opponent to spar with. - Tue Sep 22 00:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: I would be willing to spar - Tue Sep 22 00:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Sweet. Whereabout? - Tue Sep 22 00:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: yeah - Tue Sep 22 00:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Any where is fine with me - Tue Sep 22 00:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, here is not the right place...So meet me at the waterfall, hm? - Tue Sep 22 00:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Ok... - Tue Sep 22 00:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) grins, and runs towards the mansion. With a slight retraction in his knees, he sprung from the ground and landed on the roof as he progressed towards the waterfall.* - Tue Sep 22 00:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...Good, you made it. - Tue Sep 22 00:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: My name is Yan by the way, I'm not sure if we have spoken much. - Tue Sep 22 00:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: I guess I will start? - Tue Sep 22 00:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: I will use my regular blades for this spar - Tue Sep 22 00:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) smiles at her to-the-point attitude. He has seen her alongside the girl, and they seemed to be rather intimate. It didn't make her distant to men, but he could definitely feel her lack of formalties. "Sure, come at me;" he'd state with that smile, accompanied by bright green eyes which peered towards her. He seemed to emanate a benevolent nature, though that much might not be taken in by everyone. Nevertheless, feet slid from one another at shoulder-length and hands ventured chest-level and half-curled in preparation to form seals. On the interior, chakra began to resonate and build.* - Tue Sep 22 00:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) formed a single seal. The time it took to form this seal was two-tenths of a second, at which point chakra accumulated and water welled within his gullet. His mouth was forced open and the water exploded from the fleshy walls of retainment in the form of a stream. Since his hands were already in position to weave seals, little effort was needed to complete the task and if she was using her full-speed, the distance in which the technique was from her form would be closed instantaneously.* - Tue Sep 22 01:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would have performed the technique, and the gap would have been closed between her and the technique, before she was able to get within range that a kick would be effective. Even if it was, she was being hit by a jet of water head-on and no real power would be able to be mustered to place into a forward momentum required for a kick. That being said, Yan assumed she remained stationary to tank Yan's formidable ninjutsu power.

As soon as he released the technique, he lept back. Knees bent, and his form retracted an inch toward the ground as he angled himself backwards. As he pushed off the ground, the distance would be lengthened momentarily between the two. Simultaneously to leaping back, more seals would be formed with fluidity and speed. Suddenly, with the requirements met, three plumes of smoke billowed in manifestation around him. Two to his sides and one to his front. From there he would wait for her next attack and counter accordingly.* - Tue Sep 22 01:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was impressed. It seemed his method of defeating taijutsu users was noticed by the young kunoichi. After all, no one but Kenshin had got the upper-hand on Yan in public and that wasn't something easily changed. Nevertheless, regardless if she remained still or rushed at him, Yan had the advantage. That being said, one of the clones ran forward--drawing the tanto on his back. With that done, it rushed forward. He was slow, but not much more slow than the girl herself. With a wide, untrained stroke with the tanto-he would swipe up high. The tanto wasn't specifically a sword used for slicing, and with her abilities, Yan was sure she could fare against his clone. Meanwhile, both clones would step forward towards her. Additionally, Yan was building up his own chakra in preparation.* - Tue Sep 22 01:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ceased the moment, his grin widening as his illuminated green eyes narrowed. As she side-stepped, the clone progressing forward from the respective side (who was originally at his side but moved forward) would unleash a mud river. Meanwhile, the other clone would cross past Yan and positioned before him for protection. The third clone would pivot toward her, taking a step forward thereafter as the base of his foot would be plunged forward to connect with her.  It's power was adequate enough to remove her from guard but lacking that it would knock her from the path of the mud river. * - Tue Sep 22 02:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would have the clone which guarded Yan to manuever in relation to Violet's positioning. With him being close to Yan, and Violet being far, his movement required very little distance in order to accomplish this and therefore the lack of speed within the clone mattered little. Simultaneously, Yan would be pivoting as well, as to keep his front toward her as she broadly manuevered around the battlefield. 

The clone which was utilized as a diversion would begin forming seals, its speed nearing prime speed however intentionally lagging. At the same time, Yan would be weaving seals as well though his speed was not deterred by purpose and was done with great speed.

 As he finished his set of seals, amounting to five and occuring within the span of time that was one second, dulled spears would jut from the ground. Four in total, distanced from one another however angled in projection. Their trajectory would intersect, and possibly bind the girl however the likliehood of that happening was small and was accounted for.

Once the spears pierced through the earth and the technique blossomed into fruition, the sring of seals being formed by the clone not too far off would be completed thereafter. Once done, the clone would slam his hand onto the ground and his technique would activate. Instantly, those spears that were at this point inanimate became the subject of a secondary technique...Shooting forth in their respective directions as to catch Violet off-guard as she was dodging. Since the spears were dulled, they would slam into her and cause formidable pain but would not pierce. 

Since Violet was directly north in cardinal direction, and these spears projected in a bi-cardinal direction, none of the four which were animated into a trajectory that would threaten him due to positioning. That being said, both he and the clone which guarded him awaited moment to captialize on a wounded kenjutsu specialist.* - Tue Sep 22 02:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) being that the clone still went toward animating the spears, regardless of their form at the moment, the slicing of the spears would still leave jutting portions of it from the ground, and since she did not move--the pieces would now project at her from four different directions and would threaten to smash into her. The combo was not haulted due to her attempts. Simultaneously, Yan began weaving handseals at a hastened pace. Upon finishing, he would hold the last seal in preparation to release.* - Tue Sep 22 02:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) released his technique. With her slicing multiple times, her form would be delayed from movement as even the fastest shinobi could not attack multiple targets multiple times and still be as nimble to dodge any attack thrown at them. That being said, an expanse of water ejected from his mouth. The technique at hand was ranked C, and could be altered in potency based on chakra placed into. That being said, Yan effectively doubled it's volume and momentum by placing ten times the amount of chakra necessary to perform the technique at its base power. This of course would hit his clone as well, obliterating it from existence.* - Tue Sep 22 03:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) notes that those spears she cut now lay in pieces, and as the water travels north, it would pick up these rocks which would be debris that threatened to smash into her as well.* - Tue Sep 22 03:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) wasn't impressed. "Later," he'd say.* - Tue Sep 22 03:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You should go get checked on. Taking those two attacks head-on can't feel that great. - Tue Sep 22 03:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Im fine... I have a medic at home if I need one... - Tue Sep 22 03:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm sure you are. - Tue Sep 22 03:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: That ain't smart. - Tue Sep 22 03:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) smiles benevolently, a singular optic providing a wink in response. As Sanoke spoke, Yan would turn and his eyes would settle upon him. "I don't think I've ever dulled the power of my ninjutsu unless it'd be fatal. We fight now so we survive later. My earth spears were dulled of piercing power..." He'd note, looking towards Violet as she remained still. He thought she was departing.* - Tue Sep 22 03:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It's effective, that's for sure. - Tue Sep 22 03:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) replied with widened eyes, taken by surprise as the ninja utilized his speed to beckon the attention of Yan. Obviously, as otherwise such a display would be pointless. As his eyes settled back to normacy, he studied the man as he posed his inquiry and thereafter spoke of his own perception of the village's current state. "Edge is an enemy of The Hidden Sands...unfortunately, he will need to be killed before we can return. I am training to do that." He said finally. He didn't see Fujitora have any true intent on this and with Edge and Yan's past, the young chunin was fully invested in the cause. Such determination would be reflected in his expression as he spoke.* - Tue Sep 22 03:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) comprehension of Sanoke's words fell short of its humor. "Edge killed my brother in cold blood....not to mention, he has killed many other innocent people. He is what is wrong with this world and I will see to it he pays for what he's done," Yan stated with immeasurable intent, his face hardening as the words escaped his lips who's corners straightened from the usual jovial composition. After he spoke, his eyes diverted to the ground as nostalgia flooded his thoughts. He missed his brother dearly, and the thoughts of him only reinforced an already adamantite will to kill Edge.* - Tue Sep 22 03:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: There are others...Flexus will be there the moment we take Sand back. He's my comrade. - Tue Sep 22 04:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And Tetsumi.... - Tue Sep 22 04:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh, good to hear. Figured you were alone, since I ain't ever hear of this Edge dude. - Tue Sep 22 04:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Even if I am alone...it won't change anything. - Tue Sep 22 04:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I have my brother's spirit and signature techniques to aid me. - Tue Sep 22 04:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Gues - Tue Sep 22 04:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods, extending his right arm as he stretched it. "I never get much of a work out sparring the shinobi around here. Maybe I should start traveling like you so that I can fight different shinobi. I am not obligated to stay here, though I would have had Tethys not died...He was a good man." He stated, thinking of the past and how perceptions changed. It was hard to know who was truly good natured or otherwise and it instilled the wisdom that one could not simply trust the picture without seeing it for what it was in its entirety...To know that despite the picture being one-dimensional, it's true nature was multi-faceted and that was simply one man's perception. Long story short, all the facts were necessary before making a decision about a ninja. "Do you know of a place with strong ninja?" He'd ask, folding his arms to his chest.* - Tue Sep 22 04:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded to his statement. "I am going to talk to Fujitora and Flexus. Flexus will probably accompany me to wherever I go. I'd still like to let Fujitora know regardless. At any rate, I am going to go rest up..." He'd say, even though the boy could go another round of fighting with relative ease--he thought it best he begin his trek with his energy at full capacity. After all, the wild was a much more harsh life than what was provided within a village...It would be the necessary change that Yan needed to rise to occasion against the villainous Edge and his loyalist army. "What's your name again? Mine is Yan." He'd say, his face sometime ago having adorned the same benevolent smile which he was presently brandishing.* - Tue Sep 22 04:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peered towards the hand, the young boy niave enough to not have come across such wisdom. Had he continued, Yan would have shook his hand as he saw something as a sign for respect. It went back to the wisdom of not judging a man so quickly--something he was still growing accustom to. "..For sure. Next time we meet, if not before I leave, I will show you how far I've progressed towards my goal in contest..if you wanted." He'd say. He saw the scroll on Sanoke's back, and it was similar to what his brother Tatsumi had. Yan needed to concentrate more on his summoning..It was the last thing he had that was Tatsumi's. With that being said, he'd wave as well right before heading off. "Later." He'd say, exitting the scene.* - Tue Sep 22 04:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peers towards the ninja that weren't recognizable, with illuminated green hues. He noticed the garbs that were similar to other kage outfits though different in coloration. He couldn't say for sure, but process of elmiination didn't leave many choices. "Konoha?" He thought to himself, watching the scene.* - Tue Sep 22 13:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Fujitora, may I come alongside you? - Tue Sep 22 13:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: My friends can wait here. - Tue Sep 22 13:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: I'll come alone. - Tue Sep 22 13:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: No. - Tue Sep 22 13:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) thinks: No to what, though? - Tue Sep 22 13:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: It's nothing I can not handle Yan. - Tue Sep 22 13:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods, not really showing any distress towards it. "Hit me up later, at least." He'd say, moving both arms to his chest where they folded against his lean physique.* - Tue Sep 22 13:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Where are ya'll from? - Tue Sep 22 13:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: When Suitengu is around, we're leaving with you. - Tue Sep 22 13:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: We're from the leaf - Tue Sep 22 13:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Are you from here? - Tue Sep 22 13:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Leaf, huh? - Tue Sep 22 13:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I am originally from the hidden sand. - Tue Sep 22 13:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: The sand huh? - Tue Sep 22 13:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Did you leave on your own?? - Tue Sep 22 13:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Excommunicated? - Tue Sep 22 13:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Banished? - Tue Sep 22 13:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: When we defeated Zetsumo in Konoha, we had an enemy take an advantage and he occupied the village.  - Tue Sep 22 13:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It's a long story... - Tue Sep 22 13:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: . . . - Tue Sep 22 13:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You're Tethys's brother, Right? - Tue Sep 22 13:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: No? - Tue Sep 22 13:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peers towards Erebus for the briefest of moments. He killed mist-nin but was allowed to walk around...perhaps because of the absense of authority at the moment--Yan was unsure.* - Tue Sep 22 13:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Huh . . . I thought you were. - Tue Sep 22 13:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I mean, We were kinda close like that but we were just friends. - Tue Sep 22 13:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Why do you ask? - Tue Sep 22 13:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm . . . - Tue Sep 22 13:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: The name's Yan.  - Tue Sep 22 13:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) poises upon his features a benevolent smile as he glanced to Shin and then to Zenaki. He seemed to harbor no ill-will towards anyone, with the exception of his ultimate enemy Edge.* - Tue Sep 22 13:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Can always learn how to use water from an expert. - Tue Sep 22 13:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I could but I have so much else to learn first. - Tue Sep 22 13:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Tue Sep 22 13:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noticed the change in mood and the movement of his hand. Yan didn't want to fight, and wasn't sure what was causing the situation's developments but he simply stepped back. "Nice to meet you...Shin," he'd say, the smile lessening in length yet remaining. "What brings you from Konoha?" He'd ask.* - Tue Sep 22 13:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Following an old friend who ha been promoted to Hokage as of recent - Tue Sep 22 13:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: What made you decide to take hold in the Kirigakure? - Tue Sep 22 13:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I was led her by my superiors. In return, we helped The Hidden Mist during the seige. - Tue Sep 22 13:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: What's that? - Tue Sep 22 13:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Are yu referring to the expresion a favor for a favor? - Tue Sep 22 13:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Oh, I misunderstood. I tho---Yes, a favor for a favor. But we were in the village upon the seige too. It was only right we played out part in the war. - Tue Sep 22 13:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: i see, the war was very widespread, I wonder what it was really about. - Tue Sep 22 13:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Who knows. All I know is my fight isn't done yet. - Tue Sep 22 13:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: And neither is mine. Though some fights are smaller than they appear - Tue Sep 22 13:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Consider the previous war as a single battle. - Tue Sep 22 13:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: For things to come will be far more  . . . expansive - Tue Sep 22 13:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You talk as if you know what is coming... - Tue Sep 22 13:29:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: A long sought after ally of everyone - Tue Sep 22 13:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Has been facading this whole time - Tue Sep 22 13:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) raises a brow at the male. Was Konoha planning something? The boy was too niave to grasp the thought.* - Tue Sep 22 13:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: And is truly the grandest enemy possible - Tue Sep 22 13:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: What a shame, I as enjoying the peace. - Tue Sep 22 13:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Who is that? - Tue Sep 22 13:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: What is Shin talking about? - Tue Sep 22 13:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: If I say, they'd probably kill me right now - Tue Sep 22 13:30:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...Makes sense based on what he says. - Tue Sep 22 13:30:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: You do this and you will probably become an S-ranked criminal. - Tue Sep 22 13:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) began moving forward, forming a singular handseal as five clones appeared at his sides. Two turned and faced towards Shin who was behind him as he progressed forward. No one was going to kill Himura as far as Yan was concerned.* - Tue Sep 22 13:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) kept his eyes on both of them, and as the fireball manifested and headed towareds Erebus, Yan watched carefully the man who they said was immortal.* - Tue Sep 22 13:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Hassan...Should I intervene? I heard this man is immortal. - Tue Sep 22 14:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Huh? who cares? - Tue Sep 22 14:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: As longas they dont damage the property we wont have a problem. - Tue Sep 22 14:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It only means Himura is probably not capable of beating him. - Tue Sep 22 14:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Alright... - Tue Sep 22 14:02:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Thank god Kat isn't grumpy like she used to be in Amegakure. - Tue Sep 22 14:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) allowed his illuminated green eyes to widen in surprise. He took the brunt of the fireball willingly and did so unscathed as far as Yan could see. Was it possible that a man figured out how to escape death so blatantly? It was definitely scary.* - Tue Sep 22 14:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Im pretty sure no one knows. - Tue Sep 22 14:05:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: It sounds like you're more worried than I am. - Tue Sep 22 14:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I am a shinobi of honor, Himura is capable of holding his own, I wouldnt intrude on a fight between men, one on one. - Tue Sep 22 14:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Unless the new one decides to destroy the plaza. - Tue Sep 22 14:11:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Someone get Koeki out of the way... - Tue Sep 22 14:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) folds his arms to his chest and watches on. As he did, he thought to himself if Himura was really capable of holding his own...Yan didn't think so, the boy lacked basic confidence. As for his clones, they positioned before Yan and Hassan and would sit upon the ground before him.* - Tue Sep 22 14:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) thinks: Its a lot more fun to smoke with others around.. - Tue Sep 22 14:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) thinks: I swear if that tag causes collateral damage, i'm going to wring Himura's neck out. - Tue Sep 22 14:21:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Did I just hear that correctly? - Tue Sep 22 14:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Hmm? - Tue Sep 22 14:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Then just stop fighting.. - Tue Sep 22 14:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Fight again some other time. - Tue Sep 22 14:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I took most of the damage from the tag. - Tue Sep 22 14:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: How much to paint the floor back? - Tue Sep 22 14:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: That'd be around 300 yen. - Tue Sep 22 14:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright, sure. - Tue Sep 22 14:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) thinks: Yet. - Tue Sep 22 14:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was pleased to see that Erebus stopped his attack on Himura, and the boy was allowed to live. With that done, the clones dispersed and Yan approached Fujitora. "Can I talk to you in private?" He'd ask, turning to Flexus as he beckoned him with the nodding of his head.* - Tue Sep 22 14:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: Who knows...I may just need you. - Tue Sep 22 14:48:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I don't know. I am going to travel the ninja world and fight the best ninja in order to get the power I need. - Tue Sep 22 14:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Standing around here isn't going to get me to where I need. - Tue Sep 22 14:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Ah, doing as I did as a young Genin. - Tue Sep 22 14:51:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: No. - Tue Sep 22 14:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Why not? - Tue Sep 22 14:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Because, why the hell should a six year old leave a village? - Tue Sep 22 14:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...Good point. - Tue Sep 22 14:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Especially under the current situation. - Tue Sep 22 14:52:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: That was a dumb qustion to ask to take a 6 year old out f the village. - Tue Sep 22 14:52:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: *sigh* - Tue Sep 22 15:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) reaches into his satchel and retrieves a scroll, tossing it to Fuji. "I was told to give this to Koeki. I don't know what it contains." He'd look towards Flexus. "Whenever you are ready, let me know," He'd say as he positioned himself near but not right in front of Fuji who was presently trying to hit a female up.* - Tue Sep 22 15:08:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) looked around one last time, his vibrant green eyes taking note of those around him before he popped Flexus in the shoulder with a beckoning fist whereupon they set out. Yan would briefly change clothes befor exitting the village, no longer bearing the insignias of any village and intended to do so until he was able to place his suna-bred headband upon his features once more.* - Tue Sep 22 15:25:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Max(Roxas The Hokage) says: Maybe? - Tue Sep 22 15:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Flexus, do you know where a furnace is? - Tue Sep 22 15:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Seems like something that would be in any village. - Tue Sep 22 15:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: I remember seeing one in a cave that me and Master Fuji explored. - Tue Sep 22 15:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Do you remember where it was? - Tue Sep 22 15:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peers towards Max. By all accounts, Yan brandished a benevolent smile and vibrant green eyes that settled upon the red-haired civilian. He awaited reply. "So?"* - Tue Sep 22 15:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Max(Roxas The Hokage) says: Sure. . Lead the way I guess - Tue Sep 22 15:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods and turns. He thought about securing the blacksmith long term. They would see about this cave, it might serve as a good place to take refuge for a few days depending on how it appeared. "Lead the way, Flexus." He'd remark as they prepared to set out to the destination.(grab me flexus)* - Tue Sep 22 15:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) traversed through the wood. It was quiet and there didn't seem to be any issues. As he moved through the area, he looked upon Max who was accompanying him--intending to spark conversation to satisfy his own curiousity. "So, what made you take on the profession of a blacksmith?" He'd ask, his pace undeterred by the conversation.* - Tue Sep 22 15:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Max(Roxas The Hokage) says: I had a Desire to serve a friend - Tue Sep 22 15:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Max(Roxas The Hokage) says: I wanted to be the best smith in the world. . . - Tue Sep 22 15:59:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Max(Roxas The Hokage) says: I am a fair Decent smith - Tue Sep 22 16:00:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: How long have you been practicing? - Tue Sep 22 16:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Max(Roxas The Hokage) says: Since I was very small - Tue Sep 22 16:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I see. Well, if you do not have any current obligations, I might be able to retain you for long-term services for Flexus and I if you are interested in  coin. - Tue Sep 22 16:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Max(Roxas The Hokage) says: I don't know yet. . Like I said. . I became a smith for someone else. . if they are dead, as I fear them to be, Sure. - Tue Sep 22 16:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Who is your friend? - Tue Sep 22 16:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Max(Roxas The Hokage) says: Raiden. A swordsmen of the mist - Tue Sep 22 16:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I've been in the mist for a while and I've never heard of the man. - Tue Sep 22 16:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Max(Roxas The Hokage) says: Hmm. . . - Tue Sep 22 16:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Max(Roxas The Hokage) says: well, If he isn't around anymore, I supose I am a free agent.  - Tue Sep 22 16:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I have enough to purchase a furance and put you to work. I don't know how much such things cost. We will rendevous with Flexus and if you want, we can take you back to Kirigakure until we figure out how much your furnace is going to cost.  - Tue Sep 22 16:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Max(Roxas The Hokage) says: Sure, That'll work out for now. - Tue Sep 22 16:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Find out the prices on your equipment and I will front the money for it. - Tue Sep 22 16:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: That being said, I expect you to provide my comrade with whatever he wants..and if you are able to, create a sword that would rival the black blade that Tethys used. - Tue Sep 22 16:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Max(Roxas The Hokage) says: . . If I work for you.  - Tue Sep 22 16:25:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Max(Roxas The Hokage) says: Just protect me, and make sure I have what I need to survive.  - Tue Sep 22 16:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) retrieves a sack of yen, tossing it towards the blacksmith. "Here is fifty-thousand to wetten your appetite. I'm not an unfair ninja." He'd note, nodding in reply to what Max said as well.* - Tue Sep 22 16:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Sure. - Tue Sep 22 16:30:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Nope I do not know it Yan might. - Tue Sep 22 16:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) shakes his head no. "You shouldn't have trouble finding it within Kirigakure though." He'd remark after the gesture.* - Tue Sep 22 16:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Max(Roxas The Hokage) says: I was asking. . BEcause I could teach you both. . If you wanted. .  - Tue Sep 22 16:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: I think it fits Yan better than me. - Tue Sep 22 16:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Max(Roxas The Hokage) says: I also know some fuuinjutsu, I am no ninja. . but I picked up a few things. . in case I needed it you know? - Tue Sep 22 16:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Yeah picking a few things up for survial is a good thing.Thats why Yan and myself are travling the world. - Tue Sep 22 16:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: It also gives us a chance to help those who would not normaly recive help. - Tue Sep 22 16:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Max, are you going to remain here and do your blacksmithing within The Hidden Mist? There's alot of money to be made here. - Tue Sep 22 17:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Max(Roxas The Hokage) says: If we can move the forge, I'll travle with you - Tue Sep 22 17:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Max(Roxas The Hokage) says: IF not, Yea. - Tue Sep 22 17:03:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I don't really care to learn shunshin, but if you could tutor me in fuuinjutsu... - Tue Sep 22 17:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: After watching Fujitora, there should be no issue with you scrolling something like a furnace and summoning it upon will. - Tue Sep 22 17:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Then where are we off to, Flexus. - Tue Sep 22 17:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Max(Roxas The Hokage) says: Alright then. . I can show you both the basics. .  - Tue Sep 22 17:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: After all, this was your idea. - Tue Sep 22 17:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Lets stop by kumo see if they need some help there? - Tue Sep 22 17:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Or Maybe Leaf with their leader having died and all. - Tue Sep 22 17:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: What do you think? - Tue Sep 22 17:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods as they once again set off. "On our way to Kumo, we will pass through Konoha's land. We can stop there first if you'd like." He'd note, moving forward. (grabbing flexus)* - Tue Sep 22 17:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) yawned slightly, a curled hand ascending beyond his lips to capture the escaped breathe. The sun was high at this point, at it's climax in ascention before the inevitable descent. That being said, it was rather hot but nothing compared to what he remembered in his home village of Sand. He missed it but knew that his current level of power was inadequate to take it back. That was the very reason he left the comfort of a village...so that he could endure the hardships that would be necessary to make a change.* - Tue Sep 22 17:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) hadn't seen such a sight; such a monsterous visage of a man since nearly a year ago. Back when Tatsumi was still alive and the village of Sand was under the sovereignty of The Hidden Cloud. As he penetrated the training grounds, passing through the gates, his form would cease movement and from there he watched the man. "....." He smirked. The smile was benevolent, yet mischevious, with illuminated green eyes that progressively brightened as his hands claspeed together to fall into formation.

The speed of his seals were at a blinding pace, being able to easily weave five seals within the span of a second. At the end of the string of seals, with his chakra kneaded, his hand slammed upon the ground which thereafter brought his technique into fruition. Upon the man hitting the boulder another time, it would animate due to Yan's own ability and would project the opposite direction as though moved by Maloth's power alone. It would hurdle towards the gates that enclosed the area but would fall short..He remembered the man's intelligence before, as he had now come to the conclusion of who the man was. "Yo'!" He'd say, announcing his presence soon after he allowed Maloth to react.* - Wed Sep 23 01:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) goes unnoticed. A comical drop of sweat accumulated, descending upon his cheek as it seemed he was over-estimating a number of factors. "Hey, do you remember me?!" He exclaimed, his voice booming much more in volume than before in order to retain the man's attention. Additionally, slender extremities elongated, waving back and forth to gain visual aid if audible failed.* - Wed Sep 23 02:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) frowned. There were many things about Yan that were different. It had almost been a year and his hair had grown out and he had a growth spurt so he was taller than before. Nevertheless, those green eyes and bright smile were unmistakeable. 

"Yan...from Sand. Remember?! I taught you how to place dice..." He'd take a step forward, his grin widening. "It is good to see you again!" He'd say, hoping the friendly demeanor would at the very least make sure the gargantuan man calmed.* - Wed Sep 23 02:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) acquired the very same sour taste within his own mouth once the large man posed the inquiry. Yan's smile didn't fade, yet he hesitated for a moment. "I am training to be strong so I can go back to Sand," he stated simply. With Edge now controlling sand, and those loyal to Chiyari now banned from the village, all that was left was for Yan to prepare to kill the man that had killed his brother.

 His gaze lingered as thought encumbered his mind for a brief moment, at which point he shook himself from the trance. As the man sat, so would Yan, though Yan himself hadn't been training and so he seemed rather fresh. As he got close enough, the young man's nose would twitch as he took in the rank aroma of Maloth.

"So, what have you been up to?" Yan asked this question for the very same reason Maloth had asked him about Sand. From what he understood, Maloth was originally a Cloud ninja and it left him wondering why Maloth was in Leaf of all places.* - Wed Sep 23 02:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) didn't expect Maloth to pry. On the other hand, he didn't hold anything against the man for posing the question. He was another person who had met Tatsumi before his death and so Yan saw the man as a memory of a brother he missed dearly. He yawned slightly, resting both hands curled into one another between legs which angeld inward and interlocked at the ankles. He leaned forward and exhaled heavily--watching the dirt before him push ever-so-slightly as he thought of just how to answer the question.

"The man who controls Sand now killed my brother, Tatsumi..." As he spoke, his eyes stilled upon the ground and his smile's length lessened noticably. As he looked back to Maloth, his smile returned. "Do you remember my brother Tatsumi? He was a good ninja..loyal to our village." He tried to keep his morale up although it was difficult. * - Wed Sep 23 02:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded towards the man, although he wasn't entirely sure what he was saying half the time. He remembered Rymei, but knew nothing about her other than the fact that she was well-endowed and was a bit of a permiscuous individual. He hadn't seen Edge or her since that moment and had been training hard to kill Edge ever since.

"Well, I have to go find my friends. Are you going to be here for a while?" He'd ask, and based on the yes or no answer, he'd provide an additional response.

"We will get together to spar..Loser will buy lunch!" He'd say, if the man was sticking around the village for a few days. Otherwise he would bid farewell.

Either way he would stand and turn to leave. (I am going to bed. I gotta work in the morning. Stick around though man, I enjoy your writing and your character is dope. >_> Yan is traveling with an akimichi and a blacksmith/weaponsmith..so you can join us and you'd get free weapons and armor.)* - Wed Sep 23 02:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Then we will spar the next time I see you. I'd like to see how strong a man of your size is or if he can fare against me and my clones...There hasn't been a taijutsu-foc--...There  hasn't been a ninja that has bested me yet to be honest. - Wed Sep 23 02:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Maybe you'll be the first one. - Wed Sep 23 02:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Anyways, til then. - Wed Sep 23 02:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) waves and heads off. He wasn't fast or anything, and his walk was casual. He wasn't much of a show off, as even in his fights, it wasn't often he even had to move.* - Wed Sep 23 02:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: It's a frightening thought indeed. - Wed Sep 23 11:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) approached the area which the mansion of the leader was located within. He saw faces that he had figure he'd see but nothing he was particuarly alarmed about. With that, he offered both announcement of his presence and friendly greeting. "Yo'." He assumed they would remember him.* - Wed Sep 23 11:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: You . . . - Wed Sep 23 11:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Yan right? - Wed Sep 23 11:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) doesn't remember telling anyone his name but he isn't secretive of his identity so in response he simply nods. "Is your Hokage about?" He'd ask thereafter, adorning a friendly smile as vibrant green eyes settled upon Shin.* - Wed Sep 23 11:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) glances briefly toward Erebus, though he re-averted his gaze toward the man with whom he was exchanging words. He didn't like Erebus and it seemed the feeling was shared by him as welll...gon' bury that nigga.* - Wed Sep 23 11:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..... - Wed Sep 23 11:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: One.. - Wed Sep 23 11:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Two.. - Wed Sep 23 11:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Three.. - Wed Sep 23 11:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Four.. - Wed Sep 23 11:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Five.. - Wed Sep 23 11:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Six.. - Wed Sep 23 11:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Seven.. - Wed Sep 23 11:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Eight.. - Wed Sep 23 11:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Nine.. - Wed Sep 23 11:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Ten.. - Wed Sep 23 11:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) begins building chakra, with hands readied to mash together into formation.* - Wed Sep 23 11:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Got a problem? - Wed Sep 23 11:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was prepared to form seals, and so he did. Based on the distance, he would be albe to get a single seal in which was all it took for clouds to burst around him. Three in total, two on his side and one in front of him. Afterward, he would bend his knees and launch himself backwards away from them. "I'm not here to fight; I came to speak with your Hokage!" He'd call out, preparing to form more seals. Meanwhile, the clone would take the kunai without any attempt to dodge though upon doing so, the clone would burst into mud and would attempt to restrain the murderous ninja.* - Wed Sep 23 11:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: How do you feel about joining the village..? - Wed Sep 23 11:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) narrowed his eyes, his smile lessening until it formed a stern frown. He peered towards Shin. "Let your Hokage know that two ninja named Yan and Flexus are looking for work." He'd say, channeling chakra now downward as he manipulated the terra-form beneath him thereafter sinking within its depths.* - Wed Sep 23 11:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Wed Sep 23 11:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm going inside now . . . - Wed Sep 23 11:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: w-wahh m-me important.....i-i dont believe s-so.. - Thu Sep 24 00:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) approached the area. He had investigated the mansion and acquired the information that the leader had run off. With that, he figured the training grounds might be where the high-ranking ninja would have wandered off to alone. Yan, his usual self, approached with respect and a benevolent smile with shining green optics that peered forward to her.

And then, he also noticed Erebus. The young man's eyes remained on the Hokage whereupon he would begin speaking. "Greetings Lady Hokage," Yan would say, respectfully bowing to show acknowledgement of her title. "I am Yan, you may remember having seen me in The Hidden Mist. Might I speak with you in private..on personal business?" He'd ask, his voice devoid of ill-intent toward her.* - Thu Sep 24 00:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods, pivoting as she past him as to follow alongside her to the manor.* - Thu Sep 24 00:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: uhh. . . - Thu Sep 24 00:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Lady Hokage? - Thu Sep 24 00:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sorry Marissa. Speaking to someone from Kirigakure. - Thu Sep 24 00:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: . . . .  - Thu Sep 24 00:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's important. - Thu Sep 24 00:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Very well - Thu Sep 24 00:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I can wait. - Thu Sep 24 00:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I am sorry to keep you - Thu Sep 24 00:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Although it is important, it's not something I will stop you from tending to your ninja for. - Thu Sep 24 00:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) didn't care either way, he was simply a polite guy.* - Thu Sep 24 00:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll get back to you. I don't have time to pick a great mission for you and the last time I rushed that, I regretted it. - Thu Sep 24 00:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: thank you, but you go ahead. I am sorry to have interupted. - Thu Sep 24 00:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods and heads off again.* - Thu Sep 24 00:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: So...Thank you for seeing me. - Thu Sep 24 00:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I noticed you were around the ninja named Erebus. Is he on your payroll? - Thu Sep 24 00:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I am interested in those who are interested in his well-being. - Thu Sep 24 00:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Let's discuss why you're here first. - Thu Sep 24 00:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If you tell me otherwise, I will back off. As I am here to gain permission for this task. I would like to kill Erebus. He is not a moral man and he cannot continue to get stronger and kill more people as he does. - Thu Sep 24 00:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It would be against why I train as a ninja to allow him to continue. - Thu Sep 24 00:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: No, but I have seen the man...I understand his nature. He killed mist-nin, which their origin is irrelevant to me, and I do not wish to stand by with the knowledge this man stands among honorable ninja. - Thu Sep 24 00:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. I was aware he was..."killy." It'd been brought to my attention very recently.... - Thu Sep 24 00:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't know the details. - Thu Sep 24 00:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I would like to try and rid you of your problem, then. - Thu Sep 24 00:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I wear no headband as of right now, so it's not going to be affiliated with any of the villages. - Thu Sep 24 00:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He's killed no one here. . . - Thu Sep 24 00:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Then would you have me wait until he does...and then kill him? - Thu Sep 24 00:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'd prefer not to, but if that's the measure I have to take then I will. - Thu Sep 24 00:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It's simply a matter of time. - Thu Sep 24 00:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll have to find out more about this. As you may realize I was once Zetsumo's slave. - Thu Sep 24 00:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I myself was forced to do quite a bit of unsavory things. - Thu Sep 24 00:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Things I wish I hadn't had to do. - Thu Sep 24 00:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I can't judge this man without knowing the full story. - Thu Sep 24 00:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I have not heard of this, but you don't seem to be anything like the man. - Thu Sep 24 00:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: That's an honorable decision and I will respect that. - Thu Sep 24 00:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If he attempts to attack one of your ninja, I will intervene. - Thu Sep 24 00:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: This man is dangerous, so be careful around him at all times. - Thu Sep 24 00:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I suggest you don't for only your own sake. I'm under the impression he's very capable. - Thu Sep 24 00:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I wouldn't lift a finger and I suspect I wouldn't need to. - Thu Sep 24 00:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It's not out of confidence I do this, it's out of necessity. - Thu Sep 24 00:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: At the moment that man isn't considered a criminal here. - Thu Sep 24 00:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: As such, I can't let you assault him right now. - Thu Sep 24 00:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods. "Understood." He said, his voice firm yet submissive to the esteemed kunoichi's commands. With that, he performed a pivot, bringing his hand toward the door as to both signify that he was finished speaking on the matter and beckon her toward th exterior.* - Thu Sep 24 00:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: When you decide, let me know. - Thu Sep 24 01:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I will be standing by. - Thu Sep 24 01:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. Just don't cause trouble while you're here, please. - Thu Sep 24 01:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...Also, if you have any work you don't want to set your own ninja to task doing..Myself and Flexus will be interested in aiding you. - Thu Sep 24 01:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I wouldn't dare, ma'm. - Thu Sep 24 01:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Interesting. - Thu Sep 24 01:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Nothing I'm sure about is up for grabs right now, but I'll keep you in mind. - Thu Sep 24 01:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Understood. - Thu Sep 24 01:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) walks off, his hands by his sides and casual in nature. He didn't give off any ill intent and no facade was to be found as the boy stood true to his words.* - Thu Sep 24 01:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) passes through the area, entering the mansion as he had noticed Maloth there and wanted to challenge him to a spar. He noticed Erebus, but no real attention beyond periphial perception was given and so he'd continue unless hindered.* - Thu Sep 24 01:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Maloth! What upppppp? - Thu Sep 24 01:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) notices his comrade, his grin lengthening as a hand moved upwards to wave. "Yoooo! Flexus." He spoke with a grin, and brought a fist toward the ninja to bump it with his own.* - Thu Sep 24 21:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was searching for a specific man. Someone he had traveled here, yet as of late the two had been absent the other's presence and so Yan needed to touch base. After all, one didn't know what would occur from one day to the other and communication between comrades were important. More importantly, Yan needed to once again measure his skill and Flexus was the most formidable opponent he had faced throughout his time as a ninja. As he rode up on him, a lively grin accompanied by two emerald green eyes would be seen. "Yo', what's up Flexus?" He'd ask, aiming to bump the other's fist with his own as he curled his digits and hardened it into one of his own upon extension of his extremity.* - Fri Sep 25 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) removed his vision from Erebus as much as possible. He didn't have permission, and even then, he didn't want Flexus involved either. It was something he'd need to do himself. "Coo', let's head towards the training area and you can tell me all about it." He'd say, turning from him as he began to stroll southward then.* - Fri Sep 25 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: So what did the Hokage mention about jobs? - Fri Sep 25 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: She said she would give us some senstive jobs. - Fri Sep 25 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I see. - Fri Sep 25 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Anything else? - Fri Sep 25 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Ummm  She offerd for us to join her village too. - Fri Sep 25 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...What did you say to that? - Fri Sep 25 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: TOld her I'd think about it just to be nice. I Didnt wanna start no toruble. - Fri Sep 25 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Understood. - Fri Sep 25 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) begins to stretch, his tempo casual. He wanted to train but he wasn't sure how Flexus felt. Such demonstration in preparations might warrant some reply by the taijutsu specialist.* - Fri Sep 25 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Yeah and my current teacher is from Kumo apperntly.. But he feel asleep eating so I tokk care of the rest of the food of course. - Fri Sep 25 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Actually... - Fri Sep 25 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Huh? - Fri Sep 25 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: What's his name? - Fri Sep 25 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Maloth. He is freaking huge like the perfect mix of Muscle and fat . - Fri Sep 25 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I know the guy...I've been wanting to spar him. - Fri Sep 25 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: He knew Tatsumi... - Fri Sep 25 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Oh he did and yeah he eats as much as me I really wonder what  he can do can't wait to find out. - Fri Sep 25 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I actually want to head back to Mist for a few days. Are you good here? - Fri Sep 25 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Yeah I'll be fine. - Fri Sep 25 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Plus Max is aroundhere some where. - Fri Sep 25 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods. "When I get back, we will spar with what I plan to learn." He noted and headed out. "Take it easy man." He'd say as he left toward The Hidden Mist.* - Fri Sep 25 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Make sure he's working on my blade. - Fri Sep 25 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I didn't front him the money for nothing. - Fri Sep 25 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Ohhh yeahhh. - Fri Sep 25 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Here. - Fri Sep 25 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) turns and grins as the sword is revealed. He'd receive it, pullting the blade from the sheathe.* - Fri Sep 25 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) casually walks into the centre of life within The Hidden Mist. It was where all the ninja often gathered to socialize and find training partners. At this moment, it was rather quiet although the man he looked for was present. Upon his approach, he would call out the name that was quite familiar to him as a wide grin was brandished upon his lips and vibrant green eyes were fixed upon the man.* - Fri Sep 25 05:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yo, Fujitora-sensei. - Fri Sep 25 05:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm..Why would I take it easier on children? - Fri Sep 25 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Mmm.... - Fri Sep 25 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: They all have yet to reach their full potential. - Fri Sep 25 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: And? - Fri Sep 25 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Unlike many of us adults and teens. - Fri Sep 25 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I haven't reached mine. - Fri Sep 25 05:56:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: And? Pretty sure she's a shinobi...And a shinobi's a shinobi. - Fri Sep 25 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Not a "child" or "adult" - Fri Sep 25 05:57:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Shinobi must still show compassion for their fellow members. - Fri Sep 25 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peers past Fujitora and onto Kohaku who seemed to be the person that had Fujitora's attention.* - Fri Sep 25 05:58:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Sanoke. - Fri Sep 25 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would pivot and head off towards the exterior of the village. He was no longer held back by obligations of a single village. It felt nice, to be honest.* - Fri Sep 25 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: What is seriously going on? - Fri Sep 25 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) approaches the area, his hands completely exposed. On the other hand, it wasn't an important detail as he over-all seemed without any ill-intent as he approached the area. Quite cheerful, brandishing a friendly smile accompanied by lit green eyes, he scanned over the area. He saw some faces that caused concern but nothing he couldn't work around. Upon ceasing his movement before him, he spoke in a respctful tone. "Good day. Is a man named Niza residing here?" * - Fri Sep 25 06:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Is he within the village? <aka asleep> - Fri Sep 25 06:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: No. - Fri Sep 25 06:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I see. - Fri Sep 25 06:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: May I speak with whoever is in charge? - Fri Sep 25 06:28:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Well, well. - Fri Sep 25 06:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: Ushinawa... - Fri Sep 25 06:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Ushi, this man was bullying me. Kill pls - Fri Sep 25 06:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: omit - Fri Sep 25 06:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Looking as healthy as ever, Yan. - Fri Sep 25 06:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods as he eyed the man. He was devoid of ill-intent, rather the eyeing measured the man. He was someone who Yan was on the ladder about. "I am seeking out Niza for training," he'd continue. "Do you know of his whereabouts?" He'd ask finally, the inquiry directed at whoever would answer though mostly toward Ushinawa.* - Fri Sep 25 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Niza-Sama is thought to have gone on a hiatus. - Fri Sep 25 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) thinks: He knows everything... - Fri Sep 25 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: .... - Fri Sep 25 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If you know of his whereabouts, I'd like to know. He has techniques that I must learn. - Fri Sep 25 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: That's just it, Yan-San. - Fri Sep 25 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I have no idea. - Fri Sep 25 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I see. - Fri Sep 25 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I do have a question for you. - Fri Sep 25 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...? - Fri Sep 25 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: If I had killed Niza-Sama but then. - Fri Sep 25 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: What would you have done? - Fri Sep 25 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: back* - Fri Sep 25 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Probably would have tried to get revenge. - Fri Sep 25 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You showed me much in that way was futile. - Fri Sep 25 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I think its obvious. - Fri Sep 25 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Niza is a good man, and so was Tethys. - Fri Sep 25 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Tethys, a good man? - Fri Sep 25 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hardly. - Fri Sep 25 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I suppose there are two sides to every coin.  - Fri Sep 25 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Tch. - Fri Sep 25 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Anything else, Ushinawa? - Fri Sep 25 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Anything else, Ushinawa? - Fri Sep 25 06:36:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: What do you mean? - Fri Sep 25 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I am not part of Kirigakure. I have my own goals separate from that village. - Fri Sep 25 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Rogue? - Fri Sep 25 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Rogue implies something bad. - Fri Sep 25 06:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I am not a criminal. - Fri Sep 25 06:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: One could say that term is subjective. You have abandoned your home.. Much like Fuji-Chan, right? - Fri Sep 25 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I am not being hostile, I simply wish to understand. - Fri Sep 25 06:39:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: So that I can acquire the power to kill Edge. - Fri Sep 25 06:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Edge has surpassed Niza. - Fri Sep 25 06:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Edge? - Fri Sep 25 06:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: He was mean. - Fri Sep 25 06:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Who's Edge? - Fri Sep 25 06:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Did not really like it when I visited Suna. - Fri Sep 25 06:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: He has more than he could offer simply himself. - Fri Sep 25 06:41:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I wanted to inform you that you may have your hands full. - Fri Sep 25 06:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Perhaps you've forgotten him. - Fri Sep 25 06:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Hm? - Fri Sep 25 06:41:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: He defeated Kastya in one blow. - Fri Sep 25 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: He holds a grudge against Sunagakure. - Fri Sep 25 06:42:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I see. - Fri Sep 25 06:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: I need to get a hold of Tethys' scrolls. I need more power. - Fri Sep 25 06:44:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: At any rate. - Fri Sep 25 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hm? - Fri Sep 25 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If you see him, inform him that I need to speak with him. - Fri Sep 25 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If you will. - Fri Sep 25 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Tetsujin? - Fri Sep 25 06:45:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Understood. - Fri Sep 25 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) had traveled quite far to be turned away. He knew leaving Kirigakure no Sato that this would occur. "Actually, can I remain within the village for a few days?" He'd ask, stopping as he turned around. "This is his home village, therefore I am more likely to find him here than anywhere. Going anywhere else is fruitless unless I do not have your permission," Yan said, looking toward Ushinawa again.* - Fri Sep 25 06:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I am not here to cause trouble. - Fri Sep 25 06:48:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) merely listens, and as he vanishes from view, Yan shifted his eyes to the ones still before him.* - Fri Sep 25 06:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Orakuru was allied with Sand during the war against Zetsumo. - Fri Sep 25 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: What happened to him. - Fri Sep 25 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I fought alongside him in war but I don't know anything about the man himself. - Fri Sep 25 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: He was killed and his body was taken by Zetsumo. - Fri Sep 25 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Who killed him. - Fri Sep 25 06:56:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Interesting. - Fri Sep 25 06:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Do you know anymore...Information? - Fri Sep 25 06:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I don't. One of Zetsumo's crew probably killed him. - Fri Sep 25 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I see... Katsune is on my hitlist then. - Fri Sep 25 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It's also likely that that person is in The Hidden Leaf...if it wasn't Zetsumo himself. - Fri Sep 25 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) thinks: Poor Hideki... - Fri Sep 25 06:59:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: What if they don't. - Fri Sep 25 17:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peers towards the one who spoke, as he didn't recognize the voice nor the face upon observation. "Would they have a reason not to?" He'd reply, as the Hogo clan was part of Mist and therefore their presence within the village would be likely. Even if not the leader, a clans member would be able to help Yan to some degree.* - Fri Sep 25 17:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: I was... just asking if they don't show up. - Fri Sep 25 17:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: They will, at Hogo Island if not here. - Fri Sep 25 17:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Wait... theres a place called Hogo island.... and you come here to meet a Hogo? - Fri Sep 25 17:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: This is where mist-nin gather. - Fri Sep 25 17:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: But...you're looking for a specific type of mist ninja... and theres a place with their name on it. - Fri Sep 25 17:46:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If I could find a Hogo via being on Hogo Island, I would be there. - Fri Sep 25 17:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Chill out, bro. - Fri Sep 25 17:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: We can spar if you'd like. - Fri Sep 25 17:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If a Hogo is not here, then he is probably busy doing something else. - Fri Sep 25 17:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I can wait until they are available. - Fri Sep 25 17:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: That spar is still an opportunity, if you'd like. - Fri Sep 25 17:57:45 2015
