<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Where is it going to take place? In Suna?  - Mon Nov 16 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah here in the court yard. - Mon Nov 16 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: With...some decorations of course. - Mon Nov 16 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Sounds fancy. - Mon Nov 16 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) reaches into his satchel and grabs a blunt, licking the end of it to smooth the intersecting wrap. "Anyway...I came from the training area and he's not there. Best bet is home, probably." He said, although he had no idea where Tetsumi lived.* - Mon Nov 16 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh hey um Yan? - Mon Nov 16 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..Uh, yeah--sure. - Mon Nov 16 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) felt sort of blown off, but then again, once he lit the cherry of the blunt and took a nice, long hit--he cared not. He'd push the smoke out of his mouth as it'd linger in the air. "Mitsunara?"He said as he'd offer it over. "Who'd you beat up today?" He'd ask her, patiently awaiting a reply.* - Mon Nov 16 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Bye Kiyoko, I'll see you later yeah? - Mon Nov 16 05:28:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Wanna just hang? - Mon Nov 16 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: And uh.. I didn't fight anyone today, actually.. - Mon Nov 16 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Uh, hang? Sure...at my crib? - Mon Nov 16 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Whatever, I guess. I'm feelin a bit lazy, if I'm hoenst - Mon Nov 16 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) simply nodded and gestured her forward in the direction of his home. (u grab or i grab your call)* - Mon Nov 16 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm.... Yeah. Let's go eat or somethin... - Mon Nov 16 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You want to go get something at the restaurant? - Mon Nov 16 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Your place or the resturant, either or is cool by me. - Mon Nov 16 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) tried to be a gentleman, though truthfully he didn't really know the nature of their relationsihp. He'd push through the doors, spinning and pushing backwards as he held the door open for Mitsunara. Upon both entering, and moving towards the podium in the middle, someone would direct them to a table.

"What would you like to drink?" The server spoke, one of the ones Yan preferred and he found comfort in the fact they would be taken care of at least. Yan would nod towards Mitsunara. "Ladies first.." He noted with a slight smirk.* - Mon Nov 16 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) sat down and laughed a bit as she ordered her drink. Truth be told, alcohol hadn't really entered his mind though it definitely now was at the mention of it. "I'll have the same..thanks." He'd speak to the server before returning his eyes to Mitsunara as she posed her question.

He tried to maintain the same cheerful smile, though it would lessen slightly as he pondered upon the trip he had taken. 

"As soon as I got out of the caravan, the battle began. He was immediately attacking to kill and I was reacting on anticipation rather than what I saw happening visually." He spoke as the server came whereupon he ceased conversation as they were served the sake.  The server, doing his job, would ask them if they were ready to order.

"Are you, Mitsunara?" Yan said, as he'd likely enjoy whatever she was having. He was simple and they had similar tastes  in food.* - Mon Nov 16 05:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded as she ordered. She could definitely eat, but being someone focused in physical combat, they would tally up an appetite and would need the stored energy to reach their full potential. Yan didn't need it, but he was a stoner, so he could always eat.

"I'll have the same...but make it all spicey." He'd declare with an eager grin, invisioning the food before him already. The server would nod and ensure the order was correct as he poured the Sake. If Mitsunara was satisfied, he'd leave them be.

"Anyways..Yeah, he challenged me and I accepted it. Normally, it's not something I would do but I have goals that I plan to meet before I die and sitting around here without challenge is going to make me soft." He'd add, bringing his sake glass into the air as he wanted to perform a cheers with her. 

Once she lifted it, he'd gingerly tap his glass against her before dropping the base of it upon the table to tap against it. Only then would he partake in a drink of it.* - Mon Nov 16 06:03:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was happy to see that they had left. He enjoyed Kiyoko, yet she was acting odd. And so was Aza, but he didn't have any particular interest in the ninja other than ensuring he didn't pose a threat to the people of Sand.

"Yeah, now that they're gone.." He said as he seemed to relax a bit, and by then, the food was put in front of him and Mitsunara.* - Mon Nov 16 07:04:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Sure, sure. Well, the ninjutsu I want to teach you actually channels earth release chakra into your weapon or whatever you apply it too and it increases it's durability. - Mon Nov 16 15:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Like your sword for example. - Mon Nov 16 15:38:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) , while normally blurring through handseals, would gingerly bring his hands together so that digits would move slowly and quite visibly to each positioninig of a handseal. Upon the creation of one, Yan called out the name of the seal whereupon he went to the next and then the last one. "Perform these seals, and what I do, is picture something hard and durable like a stone version of whatever you are going to apply it to," he noted as he then grabbed a kunai. He'd hand it to her to feel the difference and try to damage it if she was interested in testing it.* - Mon Nov 16 15:42:04 2015
