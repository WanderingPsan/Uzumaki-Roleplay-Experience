<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noticed the glance whereupon he brandished a friendly smile. "Have we met?" He'd ask, as having met so many different people, he often times allowed names and faces to slip from his memory.* - Sun Nov  8 00:27:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) eyes her for a moment with the extension of her hand, switching his bright green  hues down to the hand which remain unattended to. He hesitated for a moment, though within the next second, he had returned teh gesture. "I am Yan. It's nice to see more people investing their time in learning how to keep people alive rather than dead. I am interested in the field myself." He noted. He didn't want to be a full on medic, but practicing the basic ninjutsu would allow him to be more versatile in his ability to serve his village in battle.* - Sun Nov  8 00:34:08 2015

He replied, peering behind her towards Chikyu. "It's pretty much over my head too, but if I can learn something, I'd be happy." He noted, giving off a shrug as his hand returned back to his side.

"By the way, Koji and I are throwing a party at our house this friday. You two coming?" He'd ask.* - Sun Nov  8 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks for a moment before answering. "We are going to have alot of sake, a little smoke and hopefully some good music," he stated.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) shrugs. "I can understand skepticism from a medical standpoint." He'd reply. He knew the risks himself. He wasn't one to drink often, but he enjoyed marijuana and unless it was made illegal, he didn't plan on stopping.* - Sun Nov  8 01:10:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) looks back towards Mizora. She was murmering, so he heard a faint noise yet he did not know what she had said. He quickly fixed his eyes back on Koji and Kiyoko before noticing Bryson station to his side. "Yo'..."* - Sun Nov  8 02:09:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) pats him on the back. "Thanks man. So what have you been up to?" He'd question as he pondered upon the Hyuuga. A minute sense of regret was felt for treating her like that, and yet, her very existence here needed to be justified by her merit and not Sanoke's. He didn't except her status, not at the moment.* - Sun Nov  8 02:13:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched Sanoke as he approached, conjured the mentioned scroll and would utilize an advanced technique of fuuinjutsu that allowed him to write seals with his hand. He figured it was higher tier, and when Sanoke presented it, his words only reinforced that as he would have to use pen and paper. It wasn't something he would learn, just yet, if at all.

Yan would take it, nodding politely. He had been on a different page as of late, but Yan respected Sanoke as a ninja that ultimately wanted the better for Sand. That wasn't someone Yan could condemn. On top of that, he was a man of his word.

"Right..Thanks." He said as he tucked the scroll into his satchel.* - Sun Nov  8 02:50:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) yawns lightly and folds his arms. He paused for a moment, and in the absense of conversation, he'd reach into his satchel and grab Sanoke's scroll. He would run his hand along it before unraveling it, slowly taking in the information with a quick scan. Once he looked it over briefly, he would start at the first portion of information and read it more intently now. He would read the signs and how they were performed, or seals they would call it.* - Sun Nov  8 03:25:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) says: That's right but I hope to learn something in the ways of ninjutsu in the future. - Sun Nov  8 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods, forming a singular handseal. With his fingers working into place, chakra would be molded slowly as it was kneaded and expelled thereafter.

From the ground around Yan, the terrain animated in construction of several mud clones. "Well, I imagine for now this will help you be more fluent in taijutsu." He said, and with that, ten clones would rush forward towards Shokutsu. 

"Good luck," * - Sun Nov  8 03:42:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) recieves the expression within the glance and simply nods. "Well, nice to meet yah then."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) coughs lightly as he blows out some more smoke. He had taken in enough that the euphoric effects of the herb would encumber his senses.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) entered the home behind Fujitora. He looked around, having never been in Fujitora's home. In fact, he felt rather awkward at the moment and that may be sensed.* - Sun Nov  8 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) listened to the nature of the technique. He had seen it more than a few times throughout his experience at a shinobi, yet he hadn't really put forth effort into learning the technique until he realized more and more that it would be necessary. There were many situations in which he had to call upon other shinobi to do this, and after today, he would be able to do this one his own. 

That being said, once Fujitora explained in length--all the while with Yan absorbing the knowledge--the konohamaru-tier ninja would nod firmly and form a T with his hand. With that, his chakra would be kneaded and molded into the correct form before expelled so that liquid earth would spill from his mouth. Before landing, it would harden and construct into a clone of Yan.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) With the information he had been given, Yan looked upon the clone who had positioned himself before him. Utilizing his already somewhat extensive knowledge in genjutsu, Yan would push lock eyes with the clone. Like other low-level genjutsu, Yan would simply attempt to project his chakra into the clone and disrupt his chakra flow forcibly.  In his attempt to successfully induce the clone before him within a genjutsu, it seemed as though Yan misplaced some of the components of the genjutsu and therefore it was chalked up to a failed attempt.* - Sun Nov  8 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) didn't say a word. Obviously, one could not acquire knowledge of an illusionary technique and master it at their first attempt unless it was a field in which their life was dedicated. That being said he wasn't all that deterred in his will to learn the technique at his first failure. Yan would again lock eyes with the clone before him and attempt to disrupt the flow of chakra within the clone through introducing his into the circulatory system. It would be but a brief moment before Yan would realize that yet again he had failed to capture the clone within the interrogation genjutsu--yet he felt he was close.* - Sun Nov  8 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) "......I think I got it," he'd say aloud. After all, Fujitora was awaiting results. Yan centered his focus, and trained his mind, upon the task which he was given to perform. He called upon the epitome of his skill, pushing his wealth of chakra upont he clone who was at the whim of his abilities. He could feel the clone give into his will, thus captured within the genjutsu. With that being said, he would delve into memories that were already known to him yet he could feel them being extracted from the clone, as though new information collected.* - Sun Nov  8 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods. "Thanks." He'd say before following him out. He had no idea about Yoko.* - Sun Nov  8 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) simply takes a seat on the bench. He would ponder some things, fingering his satchel as he thought about smoking some weed.* - Sun Nov  8 06:12:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded. The Konohamaru-tier ninja would enter the grounds of the training field, positioning himself appropriately.* - Sun Nov  8 06:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) fell into a sparring stance with his feet shoulder-distance and his hands before his form--suspended and an inch apart chest-level.* - Sun Nov  8 06:54:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) felt her eyes upon him, moreso than the simple act of it, as she analyzed both his form and stance. Many had seen Yan battle before, and he didn't change it up often. Nevertheless, he formed a single seal. With that said, the girl would soon see a clone of Yan approach from behind at the corner of her eye. As soon as she turned her head, another would materialize and attack from where she was facing originally. Likewise, numerous other clones would appear from the wood work.

Meanwhile, Yan remained where he was and formed yet another seal, kneading his chakra in preparation.* - Sun Nov  8 07:03:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) felt her eyes upon him, moreso than the simple act of it, as she analyzed both his form and stance. Many had seen Yan battle before, and he didn't change it up often. Nevertheless, he formed a single seal. With that said, the girl would soon see a clone of Yan approach from behind at the corner of her eye. As soon as she turned her head, another would materialize and attack from where she was facing originally. Likewise, numerous other clones would appear from the wood work.

Meanwhile, Yan remained where he was and formed yet another seal, kneading his chakra in preparation. In response to the technique coming into fruition, two plumes of smoke ignited on either side of him. Within the veil of smoke, soon revealed within the billowing clouds that would dissipate upon expansion, two shadow clones rested within.

He'd nod to them, and they would nod to him. The smoke would be utilized in his own advantage as well, unless she held a doujutsu to see through the smoke which Yan himself was unable to do. Both clones pushed chakra into the ground whereupon they would dig within and implant themselves. One would move forward, sensing the magnetic forces.

Yan would allow him to move to the extent in which would allow him to sense the adjacent area encompassing the billowing smoke, at which point he would disengage that particular shadow clone. Upon it dissipating, the knowledge of where she was would be revealed--she was underground. Yan would keep the other clone underneath the ground close by. She was an earth release user...Yan was too.* - Sun Nov  8 07:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: You. - Sun Nov  8 07:26:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: Hi Master. - Sun Nov  8 08:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: I've got a new master. - Sun Nov  8 08:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) based on the assumption that she did not decrease or increase the amount of distance in which she was, Yan would be approximately twenty-five feet away. As she dug up from the ground, and came into a stand, Yan would already be performing the singular seal in which was required to let loose another ninjutsu. He kept his abilities low-level, as he wasn't sure if she could handle anymore than that.

With that said, around the time she was pulling out the kunai and throwing it afterward, chakra would well within his mouth whereupon it would be converted into water and force itself from the containment of his mouth. A jet of water shot from his mouth, it's ability only carrying concussive damage as what would essentially be a "water gun" would project the stream in her direction.

Due to his ability in ninjutsu, the stream of water moved at approximately fifteen feet per second which meant that it would connecting her within a little under two seconds unless she moved out of the way. Additionally, it'd be likely that the girth of the stream would encompass the trajectory of the kunai and would engulf it. Lastly, due to the technique, it'd be unlikely if she was able to produce the clones that she would have otherwise.* - Sun Nov  8 08:06:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would shut off the technique well in advanced of her hitting the wall, and instead, she'd simply skid to a stop.* - Sun Nov  8 08:22:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) sighs and scratches the back of his head, looking towards the other. "Well, yeah..." He said, letting off an uneasy laugh as the clone who had been planted in the ground would surface underneath Yoko.

The clone would lift her, and run off towards the hospital. "She'll be fine," he noted as he started walking towards the exit of the training field.* - Sun Nov  8 08:24:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods and waves his hand. "Come on then. The name's Yan." He'd introduce himself as he moved past her, and assuming she moved alongside with him, he'd exchange friendly conversation. "So, new graduate huh?" He'd ask.* - Sun Nov  8 08:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: Should I .. - Sun Nov  8 08:32:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: I can check. - Sun Nov  8 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: I'm somewhat of a sensor, master. - Sun Nov  8 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded as she spoke toward him. "Swordsman, huh? In my younger days as a ninja I always aspired to learn kenjutsu.." He said as he trailed off. His brother's untimely death changed many things, and for some odd reason, it pushed him to become a true blue elementalist...It was also the reason he doned the summoning scroll upon his back. 

Now within the room, he would motion towards the pillows omni-present to the table. "Sit, please..." He'd say as he then moved towards the kitchen cabinets. "Sake or water?" He'd ask, both within reach.* - Sun Nov  8 08:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) switched the positioning of his hand, moving towards the bottle of sake which was nearby some room temperature water. Yan didn't like cold temperatures, and he hoped that the girl did not mind her Sake as he took it himself. 

As he approached, with Sake in hand, he would be carrying it upon a tray with two small glass cups for them to drink out of. He'd lower himself and the tray to the table, sitting upon it as he fluidly fell into a sitting position on the pillow which  he was upon. Of course, by this ponit, his sandals were off and he assumed hers would be to.

"Yeah, well, I was talented in ninjutsu and so I kept learning more and more." He noted as he sat down. "Plus, from my what I've been told, I have an abnormal amount of chakra for a ninja. Might as well use what God gave me..." He said with a light chuckle. He didn't know where she stood, but he was a christian.

Yan would pour them both glasses, and hold his own up to cheers with her. "To a new friendship." He'd say, a friendly smile upon his face. As for the weed, he was about to grab it as it rested on a tray underneath the table.* - Sun Nov  8 08:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded. Of course, there was a degree to which his hardwork could be accounted for, yet there was only so much one could do to impact the reserve of chakra they had. At a certain point, one person simply excelled further than the next based upon the genetic make-up of their being. So, he could easily agree with her statement. "Definitely," he'd say in reply, knocking the glasses together gingerly as he took a sip of his sake as well.

He pulled back the glass from his lips, setting it down as the alcoholic liquid slipped down his throat. He wasn't much of a drinker, and so it definitely did take to him differently than marijuana as that was something he indulged in quite often. "Do you smoke often?" He asked, switching from the metaphysical conversation to something more cemented in the material world...And obviously, an interest they both shared.

As he asked, he had reached underneath the table and took to the lip of a tray. He'd pull it towards his belly and lift it so that he could slide it on the table. With that done, he'd start breaking down nuggets of marijuana as he removed it from it's container. Not that you hadn't already taken in the aroma, but by breaking down the high-grade herb, the skunky aroma emanated and was much more prominant than before.* - Sun Nov  8 08:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) laughed at her question, though honed on other portions of her dialogue. Regardless, he would correct what he assumed to be a misconception. "You can buy weed from the local growth shops. It's one of our largest exports." He said as he finished breaking down the weed. At this point, it was an evenly grinded blanket of weed resting on the table. From there he pulled out yet another device from underneath the table that happened to be an expensive glass bong. "Do you mind smoking from this?" He'd ask, and if she said yes, he would pack a bowl and hand it to her. Otherwise he would begin rolling a joint.

"So, what other hobbies do you have then?" He'd say, taking another drink of his sake as he awaited clarity on the subject.
* - Sun Nov  8 09:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) smiled brightly as he watched her take the hit of weed. Truth be told, regardless of any other factors related or otherwise, he couldn't think of anything more sexy than a beautiful woman taking a hit out of a bong. Odd, perhaps..but that was Yan.

He would taket he bong himself and take a rip from it, the milkiness of the smoke encumbering the interior glass before he released the carb, sucking the smoke out completely. As he let the smoke roll out, it billowed out and streamed across the air before stilling from the momentum.

"Violence, huh? Then you're in the right trade." He noted, setting down the bong. "Help yourself, by the way. I came into the ninja world enjoying violence, and while I do have a taste for it, I've learned it as more necessary than desired." He stated, pouring another glass for Sake and filling hers if she required it. (We can just dialogue whenever you want)* - Sun Nov  8 09:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thought for a moment, hitting the bong again before he concocted a reply to how she interpretted Yan's words. "Well, I don't enjoy the act of killing someone, yet...it's not something that I'd hesitate doing or even contemplating. If I see you as someone that needs to die, you are going to die or I am. Some people think of a reason to let evil exist based on their own compassion. I don't have that anymore." He was lost in thought for a moment following that dialogue. If she looked, she would perhaps notice that. He couldn't help but think of Edge, Baen and Katsune. To Leo. There were people in this world that didn't belong to be here--that created death and violence that just wasn't for the betterment of the ninja world.

 It'd take a second or so, but he'd shake from it as he picked up his glass. "I always make sure to challenge my peers though...Yoko was a girl who seemed to be about her business. I wasn't very impressed with her display." He said, and even though he was unsure if she knew Yoko by name, he hoped she could make the connection that he was talking about the girl he had knocked out.* - Sun Nov  8 09:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Indirectly or otherwise, quite a few. I'm not bragging or anything, but it's hard to find someone who really challenges me....So I take what I can get I guess. - Sun Nov  8 09:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I see... Mrm. - Sun Nov  8 09:35:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I see. I don't see my self as that strong. There are alot of shinobi with ninjutsu, and even genjutsu, that I can't really match...But I have a skill set that allows me to move around that. I'm a pretty versatile ninja. - Sun Nov  8 09:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'd say I'm more clever than the average ninja. - Sun Nov  8 09:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I see.. Mrm. Maybe we'll have a sparring match sometime- a good chance to test myself. - Sun Nov  8 09:38:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Oho? - Sun Nov  8 09:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well...Mitsunara, I think I'm going to jump in the shower and hit the hay. You want some to take with you? I mean, if you have no place to stay, you can sleep on my couch. - Sun Nov  8 09:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods. He'd gather some up, and put in a baggy for her to tote within her satchel or pocket. It held about an eighth of an ounce, or three-point-five grams. "Here," he'd say reaching out to hand her the baggy. He'd finish his drink and stand up. He wasn't well-versed, though he felt it'd be proper to offer a hand in getting up from the one she was perched upon.* - Sun Nov  8 09:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods. "Anytime. And as for the spar, whenever you want, come hit me up. I'm always done to work out kinks in my own strategy." He thought of the last kenjutsu user he had sparred, who was now dead. He kept the smile upon his face though. 

As they walked to the door, he would open it and move so she could walk out. "You're welcome to stop by anytime..." He'd also mention. (once you reply i'm just logging)* - Sun Nov  8 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) arrives upon the scene, yawns slightly as he had just awoken. "Yo',"* - Sun Nov  8 16:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hello Yan. - Sun Nov  8 16:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: How are ya, Lera? It's good to see you back... - Sun Nov  8 16:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm...actually pretty good. - Sun Nov  8 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thanks. - Sun Nov  8 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yourself? - Sun Nov  8 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Eh, I'm doing good. I am a little hung over from a night of drinking but I enjoyed myself. - Sun Nov  8 16:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Good. - Sun Nov  8 16:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Oh there you are Yan. - Sun Nov  8 16:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) begins stretching, working out his limbs as he rolled his shoulder via the movements of his arm. He braced his shoulder with the opposite hand which cupped over it. "I need to get to training soon." He'd note, meanwhile cracking his neck.* - Sun Nov  8 16:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Hey Chikyu. - Sun Nov  8 16:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You and me both. - Sun Nov  8 16:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was hit on the shoulder, and due to Yan not being exactly a athletic individual, it really hurt!

His face scrunched up as a result, yet reverted to a smile as he bucked his head up and his eyes set on the distance behind Chikyu.

"Are we doing this now or later?" He'd say. Lera knew something that not many others knew, and that was---Yan was one of the most energetic ninja around.* - Sun Nov  8 16:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was a little set off by her level of energy though.

He'd simply nod and begin walking towards the training grounds. "Let's go, then." He'd say as he patted her on the shoulder once he passed by her.

While he trudged through the sand, he contemplated the strategy of sparring the young lady. In all probability, he would utilze one of the techniques he had first acquired on his road to becoming a ninja.* - Sun Nov  8 17:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mind if I watch? - Sun Nov  8 17:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I don't see why not. Everyone watches spars. - Sun Nov  8 17:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I won't be showing anything particularly secret...not that I really have anything. heh. - Sun Nov  8 17:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) before he ran off with Chikyu, a guard approached him who notified him of a ninja requesting to gain entrance.

"Hold on, Chikyu," he sighed as he would head to the gate. "Meet me on the training grounds..I'll be there shortly--" He spoke upon his departure.* - Sun Nov  8 17:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) apcould be seen within the distance of the gate. He trudged through the sand, and by his side was a guard who the ninja standing at the gate had spoken with. The chunin-ranked guard had departed to fetch Yan, and upon their return, the blonde-haired ninja would brandish a friendly smile which matched the aura that one might detect if they were capable of sensing such a thing.

"Greetings," his voice would sound off once in range, a friendly wave performed as he haulted nearby the guard. The one who had accompanied him simply nodded and returned to his post and from there one, the ninja had to deal with Yan.* - Sun Nov  8 17:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: So...what's your business here? - Sun Nov  8 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I'm looking for a village to call my own, I hail from Kirigakure, I was working under the late Mizukage. - Sun Nov  8 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Kirie, huh? - Sun Nov  8 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, I was sorry to hear about her demise. - Sun Nov  8 17:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: It was truly, at the worst time. - Sun Nov  8 17:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: There is another Mizukage now, why aren't you following him? - Sun Nov  8 17:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I worked for Kirie, under different circumstances. - Sun Nov  8 17:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I wasn't a shinobi, But a contract. - Sun Nov  8 17:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: The same contract doesn't extend to the new Mizukage. - Sun Nov  8 17:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I see.  - Sun Nov  8 17:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) pondered upon the man's words.* - Sun Nov  8 17:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If you call this village your home, there won't be any contact. You will commit to complete loyalty to our village. - Sun Nov  8 17:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: We don't play games with people that want to come in, leave and join other villages. - Sun Nov  8 17:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) pushes an open-palmed hand forward, as to hault him. Of course, it would remain within the air and wouldn't touch the man. "You're not coming in without proper introductions, ninja. I am Yan." He said. He wanted the other's name, obviously.* - Sun Nov  8 17:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded with a pivot, retracting his hand as he indicated the other should enter the village. Likewise, the guard would move from the path which led within the interior of the village. "Stay out of trouble and you will find that this village is strong, safe and perfect to train within as we all enjoy a good spar." He said, the same smile maintained throughout the conversation. His demeanor was benevolent, yet his words were stern which indicated he was friendly but tolerated little deviation from what was allowed within the scope of Sand's laws.* - Sun Nov  8 17:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Report to Hassan or Fujitora as soon as you find them. Hassan is the Kazekage, an older man, and Fujitora wears a straw hat. You'll see one of them around. - Sun Nov  8 17:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Understood. - Sun Nov  8 17:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would follow behind Ryutaro, forming a seal as he shot wind bullets into his back.* - Sun Nov  8 17:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: <omit> - Sun Nov  8 17:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) followed behind Ryutaro, and as he deviated from the man's path and headed south--he would form a shadow clone seal. That being said, its eyes would be upon him.* - Sun Nov  8 17:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Eh, sorry about the wait... - Sun Nov  8 17:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Don't get tired before you have to deal with me. - Sun Nov  8 17:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) formed a seal, and with that, he kneaded and thereafter expelled a minute amount of chakra as four clones were molded from the terrain around him. They would all be stationed in front of him, apart from one that remained five or so feet from the north once he positioned himself. "Come at me," he'd say, readying himself for the battle which he felt he would have little to do other than spit out chakra like normal.* - Sun Nov  8 17:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Then come on! - Sun Nov  8 17:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) Yan says: Don't get tired before you have to deal with me.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: Barf corrected me - Sun Nov  8 18:12:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: Your a "Tommy Boy" - Sun Nov  8 18:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) shrugs as she protests his clones. "Your dads right, relying on your opponent to give you the time of day to prepare is something that will get you killed." He'd reply. That being said, he'd break into weaving seals as she attacked the clones. With Yan's physical prowess being mediocre at best, the clones which were attacked were no match for Chikyu. The clone was driven through, and reverted into mud. The mud would explode and encroach the girl's sword and arm, serving as a restraint to at the very least slow her down. 

Meanwhile, the clone to the north would form a number of seals before expelling his chakra. The result were earthern pillars which shot from the ground in every direction adjacent to the sword-wielding kunoichi. These pillars, normally spears, were formed from loosened soil and earth, condensed and hardened with a blunt point that would cause nothing but blunt damage. Additionally, it would serve as a restraint to lock her into place. * - Sun Nov  8 18:13:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: YOu would ask after I spark up some herb. - Sun Nov  8 18:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would hit his weed quietly, inhaling and then swallowing. By this point, he was totally stoned.* - Sun Nov  8 18:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: .... - Sun Nov  8 18:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: That stuff smells like mouldy foot... - Sun Nov  8 18:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Why do you think I'm not even going to rest near the wall. - Sun Nov  8 18:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ...Yeah....I'm offf. - Sun Nov  8 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) motions himself towards the other side. He wasn't bothered by their dislike of his weed.* - Sun Nov  8 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Cya later - Sun Nov  8 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You off too, Chikyu? - Sun Nov  8 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Yeah, I was going to learn a new techinique from my dad. I told him to save it later, since if I'm not full strength against him well... I probably would die! HAhAHA! - Sun Nov  8 18:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Izanami! - Sun Nov  8 18:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Spar that guy right there..I'm too high for this shit. - Sun Nov  8 18:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: 'Guess not. - Sun Nov  8 18:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Ah, right... - Sun Nov  8 18:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Come, It'll be fun. - Sun Nov  8 18:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) takes one last hit before smushing the cherry between two fingers. He'd put it back into his satchel and make his way to the middle of the field. "Alright then..I could use some fun." He'd say, referencing indirectly that he hadn't been challenged in a spar in quite a while.* - Sun Nov  8 18:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence)  readies himself "G-oohh" he burped. Smoke seeped into the air as the excess smoke that was lingering within his stomach after hitting the weed earlier. Nevertheless, after the burping incident, he fluidly moved into the match.

With a t, he created three shadow clones. This was a ninja who he was unaware of, and since he had no knowledge of his skill level, Yan would ensure he had more versatility that would be given to him through mud clones. That being said, with his chakra kneaded, he would expel the energy as plumes of smoke ignited in multitudes of billowing smoke ambient to his postion.

A total of three clones would be created, in a tiangular formation before him. That being said, the four would them become a diamond, to which Yan would be at the lower point of said formation.  The clone to the right of Yan would push chakra into the ground, slipping into it. If the ninja had experience, he would know that the most common earth release technique, Hidden Mole, was rather slow. Yan hoped that would factor into the man's strategy.

Meanwhile, with Yan performing seals, he readied to prepare a technique. The other two clones transitioned so that Yan and them would then be in a tiangular formation with their guard up and their chakra readied.* - Sun Nov  8 19:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) wasn't ready. His lips parted and his jaw gaped slightly as the kenjutsu specialist seemingly blurred out of view after chakra erupted around their form briefly. He hadn't fought anyone this fast, yet. To be honest, he reminded him of Sanoke right off when referencing speed. 

While Yan didn't see it, he saw the reaction of his clone as his head went back and he was destroyed. He perhaps saw a blur which was the man pausing to attack, before he left off again. He had no vision upon the man, and so, he would lessen the field of vision necessary. The clone in which hadn't been killed and wasn't already engaged in and also wasn't forming seals at the moment would break into action to quell this issue for him.

Forming a single seal, and then stomping the ground underneath the clone, the terrain would animate. An earthern construct with lift up and rise around Yan, a corridor of sorts, with only one opening. Yan was on the other side of that opening alongside his two clones. One had just performed the technique, and the other was held onto a single seal. 

Yan was simple standing there. While it was a corridor, the ending opened up into a widened room with a dome top and that's where Yan awaited his sparring partner. "Echooooo~~~~" And so it did.* - Sun Nov  8 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: Oh they're sparring. - Sun Nov  8 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) smirked. He knew instantly when his clone was killed. That being said, his plan went into effect. The clone who had been underground surfaced quickly at the gaping hole that was the only exit. It would quickly perform a number of seals before an earthern wall was erected, thus sealing the corridor. 

Yan, on the other side, as Kurt was fleeing towards what would be a sealed opening by the time he got there, would form a single seal--extinguishing his Kawrimi. On the other hand, the measure of a small lake projected from his mouth. 

He aimed it straight into the corridor, surging with increased pressure as it was shaped into the corridor and as such more water needed to move in a smaller area. It would rush towards the mud wall and  Kurt--threatening to smash him into it.* - Sun Nov  8 19:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: 39) - Sun Nov  8 19:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) once the water had been fully released, the other clone would be finishing up a new technique. That being said, another mud wall would appear on the opposite side of the corridor, effectly locking him into a fish tank.

Yan would bend his knees and leap towards the wall, simultaneously transferring chakra into it as he latched on. This would allow him to burrow through the opening where his clone would follow. They would stand ontop of the corridor, and soon accompanied by the clone who had been on the other side of the wall. All three of them would start performing seals simultaneously.* - Sun Nov  8 19:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) heard the wall break. The pressure was too much for the clone's wall to hold in. As a result water filled the container and spewed out the hole at the top.

The pressure of the water soon forced a bigger hole, until it was no longer fueling the momentum of the water. Since no one came out, Yan quickly deduced that the boy was down and would send his clones to retrieve the ninja.* - Sun Nov  8 19:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yo'!  - Sun Nov  8 19:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: .....Yeah, but just a few.  - Sun Nov  8 19:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: Kilm... - Sun Nov  8 19:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Alright. - Sun Nov  8 19:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Thanks for the training. - Sun Nov  8 19:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: I'll be going now. - Sun Nov  8 19:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: No problem... - Sun Nov  8 19:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: H-Hi yan. - Sun Nov  8 19:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: S-See you later. - Sun Nov  8 20:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) says: mm.. - Sun Nov  8 20:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: But you shouldn't have used force aganst that man. I'm sure the situation could of been avoided through words. - Sun Nov  8 20:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) happened upon the scene, watching those in it as he approached.* - Sun Nov  8 20:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Well he had grabbed me, if I don't react I'll surelly be killed with knowing it. Just like my dad said. - Sun Nov  8 20:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So your response to people grabbing you is to attack them? - Sun Nov  8 20:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: What's going on? - Sun Nov  8 20:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) speaks in a way that would perhaps garner attention to his inquiry.* - Sun Nov  8 20:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: If I don't know them of course, and they come up without saying hello! - Sun Nov  8 20:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: A conflict arose and we have an unconscious fellow on the ground. - Sun Nov  8 20:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Someone be a little more specific... - Sun Nov  8 20:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You'd have to ask one of these two females. - Sun Nov  8 20:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: I didn't put enough strength behind the attack. It was only strong enough to knock him out. - Sun Nov  8 20:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Do you both hate him? - Sun Nov  8 20:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: I don't -like- him.. but I don't like him either... - Sun Nov  8 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: I wouldn't have gotten involved.... but I don't like unecessary bloodshed..... - Sun Nov  8 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If anyone puts their hands on you, and you don't know them, you have plenty of reason to use  reasonable force. - Sun Nov  8 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Kuro, you aren't a ranked ninja here. I appreciate your desire to do things peacefully, but this is a militaristic ninja village. - Sun Nov  8 20:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) thinks: Why are all of these shinobi so offensive? - Sun Nov  8 20:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Actions have consequences. - Sun Nov  8 20:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Is everyone in favor of a punishment towards this guy? - Sun Nov  8 20:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Well, I'm alive so I don't care. My life was all I was worried about. - Sun Nov  8 20:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Koji will decide what's to be punished, as well as Hassan. - Sun Nov  8 20:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If you have a complaint about the guy, file that complaint with Koji and he'll handle it appropriately. - Sun Nov  8 20:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: All actions have consequences, it's the rule of the world.  If I take a step, the ground beneath me will get an imprint of my foot. - Sun Nov  8 20:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: However, to use force on an unsuspecting male when the situation could have been solved peacefully, is rather saddening. - Sun Nov  8 20:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I suggest everyone keeps their hands to themselves unless everyone involved is on the same page. - Sun Nov  8 20:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'll be reporting this to Koji, though. - Sun Nov  8 20:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: So he will maybe question some people here over it. - Sun Nov  8 20:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Well, I be open to talk when ever you need me too! - Sun Nov  8 20:18:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) yawns slightly and reaches into his satchel, grabbing a joint as he'd light it and casually hit on it as he observed the group.* - Sun Nov  8 20:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Again with Kenjutsu, I just use this sword. No jutsus at all! - Sun Nov  8 20:27:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) breathes in the marijuana smoke, holding it for a moment before exhaling it. "I'm beat..." He said to Kurt, referencing to the back-to-back spars that had taken nearly half of his chakra.* - Sun Nov  8 20:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hehe thanks for the offer, but I intend to just focus on swords for now. I'm no good at jutsus anyways. - Sun Nov  8 20:31:21 2015
