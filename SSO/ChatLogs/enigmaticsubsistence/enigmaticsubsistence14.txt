<br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It wasn't long ago that I was a refugee in The Hidden Mist though. - Thu Oct  8 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) thinks: Guah.... I hope they don't start kicking out the excess weight. I be the first to go. - Thu Oct  8 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Well. - Thu Oct  8 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Is that so... I guess it was one of the last villages against that Zetsumo guy... or whatever his name was. - Fri Oct  9 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Zetsumo... - Fri Oct  9 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: That's not a name I wish to hear.. - Fri Oct  9 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Anyways, we are coming to train. I hope you don't mind. - Fri Oct  9 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) continues into the training grounds, finding his own area within the enclosed area.* - Fri Oct  9 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Hm, looks like there are more than the normal traffic in this area today. - Fri Oct  9 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Sanoke, Jirun and I are about to be practicing our earth release techniques. Perhaps you'd like to join us. - Fri Oct  9 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) looks back towards Hanae. "What is your favored jutsu style?" He'd ask. If she was saying in their village, stating her technique preference went a long way.* - Fri Oct  9 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Jutsu style? - Fri Oct  9 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I can't say I have one. - Fri Oct  9 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm? Maybe in a little. Was helpin' my lady with her genjutsu resistance. - Fri Oct  9 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: So you practice ninjutsu, taijutsu and genjutsu equally? - Fri Oct  9 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Something on those lines. - Fri Oct  9 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I see. You must be a talented ninja. - Fri Oct  9 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I was once. - Fri Oct  9 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I see. Your lady, huh? - Fri Oct  9 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Alright, well, we will be over here when you are ready. - Fri Oct  9 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) motions towards the south-eastern portion of the training area. Being that it was not large, Sanoke would have easy sights upom them.* - Fri Oct  9 00:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched Jirun out of the corner of his eye. It had become apparent the technique in which the boy was utilized once mud began to animate before him; rising through the sand to take form of a humanoid construct. It was a technique that Yan had made himself most familiar with, and anyone that knew him, also knew that it was his favorite technique.

Nevertheless, he had been looking to upgrade as of late. "Ah, mud clone technique...." He nodded in acknowledgement to the boy's skill, even if it was still blossoming into something more formidable.

"Is that the sum of your knowledge in earth style?" He said, referencing to both the clone as well as the one which he had utilized before near the square.* - Fri Oct  9 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watches the clone, noting the boy already utilizing his clones to perform techniques just like Yan had done when he was younger. A little nostalgia built up within him as he began reminiscing of the times he had with Tatsumi training...Days he'd no longer have. He removed the thought and began speaking. "Those were the very same three techniques that I began training in to learn earth release." He'd note.

He was thinking of a technique to help the boy along, though he was getting into increasingly more difficult and complex techniques. Nevertheless, he had some C ranks that the other might be interested in. He started with the less lethal of the two.

"Would you like to learn another one?" He'd ask, both his expression and over-all demeanor friendly.* - Fri Oct  9 00:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Can we do this elsewhere? - Fri Oct  9 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: It's crowded here. - Fri Oct  9 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Alright. - Fri Oct  9 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) simply nods in reply to the words of the other at first. "Same here..In fact, hidden mole saved me from death just two days ago.." He said finally. It was the complete truth, without the hidden mole and his clones, death would have claimed Yan long ago. Perhaps if not for them, he would have learned something else in order to survive-. Either way, it was a ninja's life to learn techniques in order to enhance their power and therefore prepetuate their existence as well as those they loved.

"Anyways...this is a technique that you might find pretty useful. I know I have." With that, he brought his hands together. Once they met, fingers were loose and nimble, their flexibility shown as he moved fluidly into the first handseal with the entirety of its positioning. "Watch closely," he said as he trtransitioned into the next seal just as cleanly, moving through each formulation with his hands slowly so that the other could acquaint himself with the necessary seals.

He would move through about five seals, much slower than he was capable, and on the last one--he'd twist his hips and push his shoulder forward as a palm would be directed towards the sands. Nearby there were rocks, fallen from the cliff from countless training sessions. Those nearby terrain debris would animate and lift into the air; shooting forwards towards Jirun. Although toward him, they would fly just past him and leave him unscathed. Yan laughed, his joke innocent, though it may have startled the boy.* - Fri Oct  9 00:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) pulled out a scroll from his person, throwing it to Jirun. "Master this and I'll see about teaching you more. Once you become a full-fledged ninja, I will be happy to help you become a strong shinobi." He'd say. From there he'd just plop onto the sand and lean against he wall as he watched the boy train. He should be training himself, though his writer needs to go smoke some pot.* - Fri Oct  9 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yo'.. - Fri Oct  9 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm? - Fri Oct  9 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: WHen's Taiga's memorial? - Fri Oct  9 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm...May need pops word on that one. - Fri Oct  9 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah, I haven't been able to talk to him today. - Fri Oct  9 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) shrugs and takes position nearby the group. A single hand ventured from the fixed position, venturing within the interior of his satchel whereupon it drew from it with a scroll in company. He would take his time unraveling the scroll, it's contents made apparent to his green hues which peered to it. He would then proceed to read, enjoying the silence which enabled him to do it peacefully. * - Fri Oct  9 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Hey Yan.. - Fri Oct  9 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Do you have anymore cool moves?? - Fri Oct  9 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm learning a new one right now. - Fri Oct  9 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: So far I know thrown stones,Mole, subterean Earth Shadow clone Head hunter and earth chakra flow. - Fri Oct  9 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Maybe it's time you teach me a technique. - Fri Oct  9 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Earth Chakra Flow? - Fri Oct  9 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Yeah... - Fri Oct  9 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: It makes stuff much harder. - Fri Oct  9 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Come 'ere and let's talk about it. - Fri Oct  9 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Show me it's power. - Fri Oct  9 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Woah. - Fri Oct  9 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Damn. - Fri Oct  9 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: A nap does a man goood. - Fri Oct  9 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) furrows through his bag, revealing a scroll he had recently recieved. "I know you got one for me," he'd say, referring to the technique.* - Fri Oct  9 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Yan... come here a moment... - Fri Oct  9 01:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) recieves the scroll into his person and nods to Trilliam. "Who knew you'd be showing me new techniques," he said, quite proud of Trilliam. Then again, the shinobi was becoming a good ninja. 

With Violet calling his name, he would venture to her side to speak with her.* - Fri Oct  9 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Are you ready to reward us my Lord? - Fri Oct  9 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: Kirie is in Kiri... she summoned me so I must go... - Fri Oct  9 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Are you asking me permission? - Fri Oct  9 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Ahhh...Yeah.. - Fri Oct  9 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Hassan is available. If you have ties here now, then you will have to clear it with him. - Fri Oct  9 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: No im telling you ... but im uncertain about this...  - Fri Oct  9 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: What are your concerns? - Fri Oct  9 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Koji! Tell gramps about how we got rid of those scoripains. - Fri Oct  9 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: Im uncertain about its condition... Baen is searching for me I know it and if I dont make it out I trust you enough to tell you this... If I die.. I will send a delayed bird of the location of the kiba blades...  - Fri Oct  9 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: If you think this will endganger you then you need to remain here. - Fri Oct  9 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: No... I must go... I dont care or my life... I only care to keep my promises - Fri Oct  9 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: I don't know your relationship with Kirie, but I know that Baen and her coordinate on some level and I don't think it'd a good idea for you to go. Perhaps you'd like to explain the situation more. - Fri Oct  9 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Not bad. - Fri Oct  9 02:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: Please...Yan I have to go - Fri Oct  9 02:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: What is Kirie telling you? - Fri Oct  9 02:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: She just wants me home - Fri Oct  9 02:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ai(Sennalove) says: Eh..Sir? - Fri Oct  9 02:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Yo. - Fri Oct  9 02:08:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: Ok... - Fri Oct  9 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) shakes his head as he turned and looked towards the north where the group of ninja have gathered. "Sound good?" He'd ask as he peered back towards Violet. He reached over and placed a hand on her shoulder, giving her a comforting pat in the direction which Hassan was located.* - Fri Oct  9 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Hmm. - Fri Oct  9 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ai(Sennalove) says: I have a few things I need to talk with ya about. - Fri Oct  9 02:09:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Go away farmer. - Fri Oct  9 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: I need to discuss a few things with him, yet it seems that will not happen. Oh well. - Fri Oct  9 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: ... I dont have time for this I have to leave... - Fri Oct  9 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I have me own business here... - Fri Oct  9 02:11:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) thinks: I wonder if Fuji Hana is eatable?? I do prefer Ramen... - Fri Oct  9 02:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Then you can consider joining the military. - Fri Oct  9 02:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Theres strict rules with being a shinobi in this village. - Fri Oct  9 02:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Like having the sunagakure insignia on your person at all times. - Fri Oct  9 02:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched over the group as he ventured once again into the contents of his satchel. He would soon retrieve a recently acquired technique scroll and so he would unravel it as he began reading of the contents immediately. He saw great potential in the technique which Trilliam had displayed..coupled with Yan's ability, it would be a nice addition to his arsenal.* - Fri Oct  9 02:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: And knowing what it stands for. - Fri Oct  9 02:13:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: And I won't talk to you privately. - Fri Oct  9 02:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I'll have one of my chuunin or jounin with me. - Fri Oct  9 02:15:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Eh, she wants to return to Mist. She's being called back by Kirie. - Fri Oct  9 02:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: There are so more private details that I can't really say here. - Fri Oct  9 02:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Respect the Lord's wishes here in his villlage. - Fri Oct  9 02:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: She isn't even a shinobi of this village. - Fri Oct  9 02:18:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'd like to control the flow of ninja in and out of this village more. Perhaps I could come up with a report to accomplish that. - Fri Oct  9 02:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Yeah. - Fri Oct  9 02:19:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ai(Sennalove) says: Eh...Can you explain the rules to me? - Fri Oct  9 02:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Also, about Taiga's memorial. - Fri Oct  9 02:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Would you like me to set a date for that? - Fri Oct  9 02:19:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I've been busy I nearly forgot about the funeral service for him and Kang. - Fri Oct  9 02:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods, it was something he intended to happen one way or another...he paused. "..Kang? What do you mean?" His voice and the emotion inherent would spike.* - Fri Oct  9 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Fri Oct  9 02:20:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) wasn't going to respond to that. I think his mettle had been proved, but not for her approval nor anyone else's. He would remove himself from the attention he casted upon Katsune and read his scroll.* - Fri Oct  9 02:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: If you can put up with him for a bit longer. - Fri Oct  9 02:57:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) apparently annoys everyone. He'd venture to the training grounds to practice his ninjutsu as he normally did.* - Fri Oct  9 02:59:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) reaches into his satchel and pulls out a scroll. He'd unravel it and begin reading. It detailed handseals, chakra output and various other details concerning a very specific technique. He wold continue reading in silence since it seemed everyone was quiet and busy.* - Fri Oct  9 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noticed the new arrivals out of the corner of his eyes, though his attention would remain on the page. He would practice the seals within his mind, visualizing each one as he attempted to commit the information to memory. Soon he would be attempting to perform it himself, though that would be in more private locations.* - Fri Oct  9 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noticed Susumu's lingering eyes but such wouldn't bother Yan. He provided a friendly smile and a acknowledging nod before he returned his attention to the details exposed to him. He let out a gentle sigh as his eyes moved from one line of text to the next, before raveling up the scroll himself.* - Fri Oct  9 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) feels wind push against him as the momentum from the shunshin sends such force toward him. He looked towards Hassan, wondering why such an arrival was necessary.* - Fri Oct  9 03:52:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: By the way, Tetsumi, if you want Alastor's sand..I can get it for you. I have it hidden. - Fri Oct  9 03:54:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) brought his hands together as to form seals. He would perform one, and then the next and keep going until the last formulation of fingers were constructed to create the last seal. WIth both his chakra kneaded and formed, he would stop just short of activating the technique. He felt a certain level of understanding, and from here, he needed to practice it.* - Fri Oct  9 03:58:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) chuckles at Hassan's comment, looking over Izanami. He didn't particularly care for the name's either, but it wasn't all that relevant.* - Fri Oct  9 04:00:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) passes by Izanami and taps her shoulder, beckoning her towards the exit. "When you are ready, meet me at the gates. I'll explain while we travel," he'd say as he continued on.* - Fri Oct  9 04:02:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) trudged through the sands alongside Izanami. As they traveled across the desolte desert, moon high above them, he would speak to Izanami. "We have the location of the famous kiba blades. We are going to retrieve it in The Hidden Mist." He noted, looking to Izanami as though awaiting questions.* - Fri Oct  9 04:04:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: They are suppose to be powerful. I'd have them in our village for our benefit..not someone else's - Fri Oct  9 04:07:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Are things going to get crazy while we are there? - Fri Oct  9 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I don't know, I think I should go alone just in case. - Fri Oct  9 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You wouldn't be willing to return, would you? - Fri Oct  9 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I'm going either way.~ - Fri Oct  9 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I can handle whatever's out there... - Fri Oct  9 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah, yeah. You are a good ninja, I won't deny you a mission. I just simply think that it's risky bringing you..just because of numbers. - Fri Oct  9 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Everything will be fine if we are careful.~ - Fri Oct  9 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) it began to rain really hard. The precipitation made it hard to travel, so instead of moving through the rain and having no visual aid in case enemy shinobi attacked, Yan stopped their travel. "Hold up, I can provide us shelter," he said as he began performing seals. His seals were quick, and at teh end of them, earthern assimilation began.

Rock terra-form shot from the ground, quickly taking form around both him and Izanami to form a cavern of sorts. There would be a hallway, and an opening at the end of it. As you moved further in, it would be a sort of rough dome in which they could create a fire and stay warm. Both were soaked, so it would be nice to warm up with a fire.

Along the travel, he had utilized multiple clones. Some clones gathered wood while others hunted. The clones returned to the construct with firewood and a deer. "Prepare the fight Izanami," He said as he disengaged the clones. Meanwhiel, Yan was preparing the deer by skinning it and removing it's organs.* - Fri Oct  9 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peered towards her and smiled. "I didn't even think you were going to use your fire release..I guess that makes more sense.." he said as he handed her a slab of venison. "find something to suspend it over the fire and let it cook while I cut up the rest," he'd say as he began putting his blade to the meat again, carving away unwanted pieces.* - Fri Oct  9 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: I think this'll work.. - Fri Oct  9 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) finishes butchering the meat, where he stacked it upon one another on a slab of rock nearby the fire. "Have you ever had deer meat?" He'd ask, the aroma now filling the cavern in which they rested within.* - Fri Oct  9 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I think its much easier to use my fire release.~ - Fri Oct  9 04:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Ever since I've gotten good with it, little things like that doesnt bother me anymore. - Fri Oct  9 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) (*Yan finishes butchering the meat, where he stacked it upon one another on a slab of rock nearby the fire. "Have you ever had deer meat?" He'd ask, the aroma now filling the cavern in which they rested within.*)* - Fri Oct  9 04:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It's not bad, but you can definitely tell it's not farm raised...It's diet is a little bit more diverse in the wild than if you are eating an animal that was raised on a farm for consumption. - Fri Oct  9 04:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) pushes at the meat with a kunai, tearing itno it's  thickness to test how cooked it was. The first batch was adequate, and he pulled it off hte fire and gave it to Izanami. "Eat up," he'd say, the browned slab of meat right before her to be taken and consumed. Afterwards, he would put the next portion of meat which he would eat.* - Fri Oct  9 04:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: How does it taste? - Fri Oct  9 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) 's cooked instantly, because he's hungry. He bit into the meet and ripped it from bone. "Mmm..." He made pleasant and happy noises wiht a grin on his face as the meat was chewed and swallowed quickly before he'd take another large bite. He was hungry.* - Fri Oct  9 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I think we're reallly close. - Fri Oct  9 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah..the terrain looks familiar. It's been a while but we are no doubt nearing Kirigakure. - Fri Oct  9 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I heard things are coming together in Kirigakure, and if they know we are recovering the Kiba blades, they will have an issue with it. - Fri Oct  9 04:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: So what do we do? - Fri Oct  9 04:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I have enough chakra to do this. Let's get on the island and we will move underground from there. - Fri Oct  9 04:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Okay. - Fri Oct  9 04:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: Underground again, yaaay. - Fri Oct  9 04:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Yep! - Fri Oct  9 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: We're here. - Fri Oct  9 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) performed a single seal, thereby kneading his chakra. As a result, two clones were formed from the ground around them. "All you have to do is help dig," he'd say as he and the two clones began digging into the ground below once they had transferred chakra into it and changed it's solidairty to lloosened dirt---easy to move through.* - Fri Oct  9 04:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) utilized the magnetic sensory ability gifted through the use of the hidden mole technique to guide them. "Are you doing okay?" He'd ask as they traveled deep into the earth. They moved at a diagonal pace, so as they progressed towards it, they delved deeper to accomodate the necessary level of depth which the sword was said to be.* - Fri Oct  9 04:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nodded as they continued venturing into the depths. They would now be underenath Kirigakure's northern bridge, and from there Yan would command them to head downwards instead of diagonal now. "It should be straight down from here," he'd say, moving down as he did. He sighed, growing tired. The technique did create a damper on his reserves using it for so many and to this extent.* - Fri Oct  9 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) smiled, unsure of why she was asking. Then he remembered, he was the only one that could sense magnetically where they were. "This technique allows you to sense magnetic energies, thus allowing you to navigate with knowledge of where you are." He'd say, "When we get close to the blades, I'm sure I"ll be able to sense them directly," He'd say as he continued digging deep into the earth.* - Fri Oct  9 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) hadn't considered that, but due to the location, it was unlikely someone else had acquired it. "I'm not that concerned about tha--it's close.." He'd say as he began to move faster, alongside his clones. * - Fri Oct  9 05:17:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) arrived upon the scene, his form landing upon the sands beside Sanoke. He looked at the scene, eyes narrowing. "What's going on?" He'd ask. He noted a battered Koji but didn't respond yet. He wasn't sure what was happening and so he'd find out before reacting.* - Fri Oct  9 21:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I can't even rely on Koji's ability, he's done. - Fri Oct  9 21:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would make his presence more known to Tetsumi who failed to give him a response. He was higher ranking, but Yan's inquiry still required clarity. "Tetsumi, what happened to Koji? Where is the Daimyo?" He asked both questions firmly, though not so much that it was percieved as demanding.* - Fri Oct  9 21:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Koji's down, Sanoke's spooked..Err..I hate this. - Fri Oct  9 21:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noticed the suddenly everything changed, yet the origin of this altered world seemed unknown to even Yan who had become proficient in genjtusu and more notably genjutsu defense. Soon after the clouds dissapeared and the sun itself dematerialized---the sandstorm awoke which alarmed Yan. He wanted to perform a technique and would; his attempt to do so located within the area in which Koji and Tetsumi were. 

Noticing the others, he would call out to them. "Come take refuge!" He said, recollecting Reguel being a medical ninja who sold weapons, he wouldn't leave them out alone. Yan would form a singular seal before earth erupted all around him. It would build and form until a cave of sort was produced within the wake of the technique's fruits. It had one entrance from which the two away cold enter, however the construct was already created around Yan and his squadmates. (Being that this is a genjutsu, I'm not sure how it would work at all. I'm not that experienced with genjutsu.)* - Fri Oct  9 21:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) since no one wanted to take refuge, he would follow Tetsumi..fuckers.* - Fri Oct  9 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) followd Jiki through the sandstorm, taking note their destination seemed to be a horizon devoid of the conditions in which were encumbering their enviroment at hte moment. Upon arrival, Yan would remain silent as Tetsumi spoke.* - Fri Oct  9 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched the grotesque scene of the man who was nailed, his distress family scorned for trying to recover the man's body from the state in which it had been left. His eyes then averted back to the situation at hand before him where Tetsumi was threatning the man he had just encased in iron sand. He kept his eyes on the entire situation. "Where is the Daimyo?" He'd ask the man, as he had intentions of progressing forward to acquire the leader of the country.
'* - Fri Oct  9 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) met the words with widened eyes. He didn't know the entirety of the situation, but from the man's words alongside the Daimyo's, it seemed as though they were fighting on the wrong side. Then again, there was more to take into consideration than what was directly apparent to the eyes. This man represented Sunagakure's longevity as a nation, and killing these people meant that Yan was going against everything he held true to himself.

He looked to Tetsumi, waiting for his call. After all, he was out-ranked and he would do what he needed. "We don't have to kill them all, do we?" He'd ask, hoping that they could simply immobilize them and leave them unconcious or take them into custody.* - Fri Oct  9 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I really don't know what to do..If I kill em'...ughh... I hate this.. - Fri Oct  9 22:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) grabbed Tetsumi's shoulder, firmly yet it was to give the other comfort that he was amongst comrades in case he was losing his cool. "Tell me what you are planning, Tetsumi." He spoke to the jounin in hopes that it would calm him into rational thought.* - Fri Oct  9 22:36:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: We can call forces to detain these men. - Fri Oct  9 22:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: We don't have to kill any of them...they can serve their time or be put to death by the government. - Fri Oct  9 22:40:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) turned his attention from Tetsumi and averted firey green optics toward him--his expression glazed with the emotion of disgust. He was a shinobi, a tool of the village but he wasn't a killer. If they could be detained and sent to prison, then that is the route they would take it. 

"We have saved you, these men will face due process." He stated. He was unsure of the result of his rebellious words towards the leader of their country yet such words spewed from any man would likely be met with the same reaction. He almost rejected Hassan's proposal to send Jirun out on his own yet he knew the boy could survive. This situation was beyond reproach on his moral code. * - Fri Oct  9 22:48:44 2015

(*Tetsumi Jiki "...Peace...Is this how its attained?" the teen was torn into two. It was between his own beliefs and the damiyo's will. He couldn't go through with it, the sand from the crying man, along with the others besides the damiyo fell to the ground. He'd free the man, though he'd still be contained in his sand."..The village..then there is..." he didn't know what to do, a leader had to make decisions. 

"You're free, we only came for the damiyo anyway." if one of the other shinobi wanted to kill the family, they could though he wouldn't and couldn't bring himself to it, to this level.*)* - Fri Oct  9 22:53:00 2015

Each clone would form their own handseals, and by the end of it, they would slam their hands upon the grounds. As a result, a multitude of caverns sprouted from the techniques in which  they used. They would cover the area encompassing the town in an attempt to lock them all from within. Meanwhile, he would call out to Tetsumi. "Let's get the Daimyo and split before they find their ways out." He'd say. It was a half-measure he was unsure would work.* - Fri Oct  9 22:58:08 2015
