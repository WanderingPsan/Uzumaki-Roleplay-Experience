<br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||A glaze of sweat enveloped the epidermis of the boy, even venturing from the surface of his skin to encroach the fabric which he adorned over it. That being said, it was notably hot and he had apparently been enduring the action of training or some other physical excercise that would leave him in such condition. Nevertheless, by all appearances, the boy held no signs of fatique. Illuminated green eyes shot glances around and bright blond hair swayed ever-so-slightly within the wake of a breeze that Yan welcomed with open arms.

As he observed those around him, two being sand manipulators that were seemingly detached from the world ambient to them in some sort of meditative or otherwise unconcious state, those youthful optics fell upon Dravae. He didn't know much about the man other than he had served the village for some time and was quite the ninja when it came to surveillance. That being said, Yan would one day wish to measure himself against the Aburame. 

"Yo Dravae!" He called out, a smile on his face. Even with all the joyful demeanor which he brandished, the thought of his brother's death loomed over his head as though as sickening poison. There was nothing other than intent to become stronger and learn the ways of the ninja so that he could avenge his brother's untimely and unjustified death. That being a consistant thought within his mind, he sought to defeat the thoughts by putting such into action instead of dwelling upon it. Yes, he was an optimist.||* - Mon Aug 31 16:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||As Dravae looked up, Yan instinctively diverted his eyes from Dravae's face and onto the cover of the book which was being read. He barely saw the name, Geneology, and wondered what it was about. He had forgotten that Dravae also excelled in medical ninjutsu, and so he found himself wondering why he was reading it. He brushed the thought off and returned his gaze towards the bug-user as a response was uttered.

"It's going good. Just been trainin'...You?" He'd ask, pulling up toward him and away from the others.(We can just dialogue now.)||* - Mon Aug 31 16:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) cackled, shooting out reply. "Yeah, it's over my head." It truly wasn't, he simply lacked the interest in it. "I am training to learn my...Tatsumi's summoning so that I can continue his legacy!" He said, motioning towards the summoning scroll strapped to his back. Other than that, most knew that Yan was notable for his usage of clone techniques if anything.* - Mon Aug 31 16:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) is just as confused, changes the subject.* - Mon Aug 31 16:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) broke into a blank stare that was indicative of his lack of understanding as Drave went on to explain how geneology related to his use of insects. He didn't really absorb any of it and instead simply stared at him. "Uh---huuh..." He replied, noticing the other approach, he fixed his gaze towards the new comer instead. That being said, Dravae would notice this and probably follow suit.* - Mon Aug 31 17:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) |Yan seemed devoid of interest at the moment concerning those around him as his primary desire was to find Chiyari or Fujitora. The first would provide a mission and the second one would provide some training. Either would be fine by him and until he found them--he would continue training by himself. That being said, one foot performed a pivot which brought his form into a spin to face into the opposite direction as he poised to perform a technique he was still new to.
\
\His hands would extend from the cloak he adorned, clasping together as they thereafter began to dance with each other's respective digits in order to perform a string of seals. With each seal performed , Yan was enabled to mold his chakra toward the goal of completing the ninjutsu's requirements. Being that he was quite good with his seals, he would perform them with accuracy and speed until the final one which he held suspended before him. With chakra built, and aligned with the proper element, dry lips parted to soon be quenched by the water-aligned technique.
\
\As his lips parted, a wealth of water would be released from the interior of his mouth--spitting out a stream which extended many feet before the propulsion would dissipate and it would eventually descend towards the ground at a certain point. He would continue this for a brief moment before the effects of the technique would diminish until it would cease completely soon after.|* - Mon Aug 31 19:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) |Yan would produce a grin with illuminated eyes as his grasp upon the technique's complexities seemed to strengthen and therefore the technique itself seemed more potent and natural as its function came into  fruition. Neverthless, as he had learned from training other techniques, it wasn't quite adequate to the point where he would be able to use it effectively in battle. That being said, as the technique had finished, he prepared to perform it yet again to ensure such a mastery would be attained.
\\
The young boy, full of energy and a wealth of chakra that had only been matched by the bug user Dravae, clasped his hands together as he meticulously performed the string of seals once again, thereby igniting his chakra into animation as it began to mold within his interior to reflect that which he was trying to create. The string of seals were completed quickly, if not almost instantaneously to him beginning the string, whereupon he stopped at the last one and the chakra which had been molded was fully prepared.
\
\Upon him ceasing the handseals that were being wove, stopp=ing at the final one, the same ninjutsu was created and a creation of water was spewed from his lips. It was expelled, exploding from his lips as it projected farther than before and with a power that was slightly increased due to enhanced mastery. As the technique climaxed in function, the water began to slow and eventually it's momentum ceased as it neared it=s end.|* - Mon Aug 31 19:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) |Yan seemed as refreshed as ever once the second attempt at the technique had been performed. His wealth of stamina and chakra were something that allowed him to stand out in comparison to those around him and had earned him many victories in spars based upon his ability to out last his opponent while performed a multitude of techniques while the others were severely limited in that regard. That being said, he was ready to perform the technique again.
\
\As he began performing seals, he listened to those around him. Dravae =wanted to spar, and Yan wanted to entertain him, but he needed to master his techniques and learn more before challenging a ninja of Dravae's calibre. In order to do that, Yan would have to stay focused and disciplined in his training. The seals were again performed so fast some would see them as a blur, and at the end, the last seal would be held as the chakra was completely molded into its necessary composition.
\
\The turret which his mouth had became shot out an moderate amount of water from his lips as it projected before him. He tried to push the length of the water's projection further as to indicate his improvement in the creation of the technique. However,, it still needed work, and the length was moderate at best though he desired it to be more. With that said, the water dissipated and he would thereafter prepare to perform the technique a gain.* - Mon Aug 31 19:29:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) |Yan heard some footsteps beyond the noise polluting the airways from before and a single eye pivoted in C hiyari's direction. He was going to say something , but instead of bragging audibly, he would show Chiyari that he was progressing as a ninja in order to be of more use and full fill his own =desires of killing Edge himself. That being said, he began performing handseals with purpose-filled vigor as he hoped that Chiyari was watching.
\
\The string of seals were performed more quickly than before, his attempt to mold his chakra at an accelerated rate an success as the string of seals were complete=d and his hands froze in the position of the final seal which he maintained as he held it before him in the direction of open land. At that point the jutsu would commense and the stream of water would appear.
\
\The manifestation of water penetrated enclosed lips as they were forced open, thereby allowing the stream of water to jet from his lips at an accelerated pace as it's trajectory sent it heading towards the expanse of sand before him. The projected water would hurle into a dune of sand, a hill-like structure of sand stacked from the winds moving it, penetrating it very slightly as such a condensed form that naturally absorbed the water proved too formidable of a body for the low-level water technique.* - Mon Aug 31 19:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) turned, noticing Fuijtora as he waved towards him. "Check this out!" He said as he turned around and once again performing seals. Fujitora was his sensei, or so Yan saw it, and so he would want the chuunin to see his progression in the technique which he had taught Yan himself. That being said, a string of seals were worked through almost instantly as a jet of water streamed from his lips and once again bombarded the Dune of sand that was before him.* - Mon Aug 31 19:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) watched the stream of water, condensed and almost perfected, as he frowned. He knew Fuijtora was tronger, though on the other hand, it only strengthened Yan's desire to excell. That being said, he turned around and performed the technique vi=gorously. The seals were done, and the chakra was molded whereupon the technique would activate and the water would spew from his lips again. This time, it matched Fujitora almost in terms of skill level with the technique.* - Mon Aug 31 19:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) grinned happily with the comment. but then his rper goes to play poker and he dematerializes from the virtual world.* - Mon Aug 31 19:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peers around, as to gain an understanding of his surroundings oonce he slowed from his south-ward path.* - Tue Sep 01 00:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan noticed the others but he was too involved with his own training to really pay any attention to them. After all, there were very few people that Yan was truly interested in dealing with and that was Fujitora and Chiyari. Anyone else wouldn't hinder his training--not at this point at least. He stood within the expanse of sand adjacent to the ominous structure that was the leader's mansion, poised to practice his water element technique that was dubbed water gun by Fujitora.

The boy positioned himself before the very dune of sand that had been subjected to earlier pounding from his water technique and would serve the same purpose at the moment as his hands moved in unison toward one another. As they were within range, fingers would dance with skill and speed as handseals would be woven in succession with ease. With each seal performed, the network of chakra within him would be distributed and molded into the fashion which would enable him to perform the technique. That being said, the hand came still.

Once the fingers stopped moving, as they were a blur to most within those moments, his hands would be holding the last seal of the technique visibly whereupon his technique came into fruition. Instantenously a beam of water spewed from parted lips, forcing the jaw ajar completely as the stream of water pursued the dune. Upon contact, sand was splattered in every which way as the strength of the stream dug within the thick condensed mountain of sand before them. 

Inevitably the power of the technique wasn't sufficient that it would do any real damage to the full-bodied dune, and after a moment or so, the water would cease and the technique would be disengaged entirely. He was pleased with the results and would perform the technique more as to increase the potency and decrease the consumption of chakra which the technique required.||* - Tue Sep 01 00:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) turned, facing towards Kronos and Dravae as they seemed to be in an altercation. "Dravae, do you need a hand?" He'd ask, his form brimming with chakra as he prepared to start performing seals at the drop of a hat.* - Tue Sep 01 01:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) looks towards Dravae as he awaited response in order to perform any actions thereafter. He was nervous, but not scared, and so he was still quite ready to commense battle if needed.* - Tue Sep 01 01:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) relaxed his posture, looking over to Dravae. If there was any shinobi that excelled in surveillance, it would be Dravae. That being said, he wasn't worried about Kronos doing anything without everyone knowing about it at that moment or just after so he'd leave it in the aburame's hands.  

With the arrival of the new-comer, Yan's interest was beckoned from the confrontation that was dwindling in intensity. He hadn't noticed the other before therefore he made an approach for introductions. "Yo', you another rogue or somethin'?" He'd ask, his usual casual form of expression inherent within his youthful voice as illuminated emerald eyes bared their gaze toward the Sunamaru.* - Tue Sep 01 01:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noticed the expression indicative of having recieved Yan's words in a negative manner, though that didn't seem to hinder Yan from his usual banter when meeting someone. "I am Yan, and a genin as well." He stated, what seemed to be a hardened expression further amplified by a mischevious grin that was full of intent though such lacked in malevolence and more simply imbued with purpose. 

"You just graduated, huh?" He asked, looking over the other in an analytic manner.* - Tue Sep 01 01:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan had every intention of bringing the fight into a more open area, although since Sunamaru had gestured to engage him where they stood--Yan would comply whereupon he would proceed with his own assimilation into both a stance and progression into actual battle. Being primarily a long-ranged fighter, Yan leapt back with bent knees and an angled body, simultaneously bringing both hands together as he performed seals.

His seals were at near blinding speeds, relative to a normal person's visual prowess, and upon the last one--he would hold the technique's last seal before bringing the attack into fruition. Just as he landed, having completed the seals, his mouth would par and his jaw would become gaping as water would surface from within his gullet. The same water would thereafter project from his mouth and form a stream which sought to bash into the other.

 It was a low-level water technique that he was training to become more proficient at, and Yan saw this as a perfect opportunity to become more acquainted with it in battle.||* - Tue Sep 01 02:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dravae(VantetheGreat) whispers: Your mother had many husbands and fiances before she came arcoss your father.You see all of her previous lovers died tragicaly before the weddings. - Tue Sep 01 02:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dravae(VantetheGreat) whispers: When she was instated as Nidanme Kage alot of men tried to  become her next husband that guy with the white hair and gourd was one of them Krons! - Tue Sep 01 02:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dravae(VantetheGreat) whispers: He was obssessed with your mother and when she chose your father over him He went mad and did horrible things. - Tue Sep 01 02:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||The boy grinned as his ninjutsu seemed to connect without any issues, although beyond any on-the-surface meaning that he successfully hit someone with it--it would lead him to wonder if Sunamaru was even a capable shinobi for Yan to be bragging on to begin with. The thought only strengthened Yan's desire to test his mettle whereupon he could determine this with assurance that such judgement was based on fact rather than speculation.

As the water gun ceased, and the other was sent backwards and into the ground, Yan would be performing more seals with the same heigthened level of weaving speed as before that left his hands imperceptible to the average ocular level. At the end of the string of seals, he would proceed with the attack.

 Due to switching elements, thereby being forced to re-assimilate his chakra to reflect that, the other would be provided enough time to regain his senses and perhaps stand up before the ignition of the jutsu. Even with his handseal creation speed, that much time would have been given. Regardless, as the attack connected, plumes of smoke would ignite into existence all around him.

Each plume of smoke that billowed into life around him, amounting to five in total, would contain a figure within the interior of the veil. Such figures would be revealed as the expansion of the smoke caused dissipation from perception, and upon revelation of their appearance, each one would reflect the features of Yan perfectly. Three rushed forward, where two of them launched from the ground, stepping on the approaching three's shoulders mid-launch to gain momentum and air time as they ascended over Sunamaru.

While that was occuring, Yan would be performing more seals in preparation of a secondary part to this attack. At this point, both hands would retract within his cloak thereby concealing them and thier actions beyond some fiddling that would occur on the surface of his jacket due to working digits. That being said, with all the distractions, such actions would probably go unnoticed.* - Tue Sep 01 02:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dravae(VantetheGreat) whispers: I know he has herd the news of your moters death by now and many know the it was due to your birth he may try to take you from us in some wierd delusion. - Tue Sep 01 02:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dravae(VantetheGreat) whispers: Yes never tell him your name or who your parents are okay. - Tue Sep 01 02:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dravae(VantetheGreat) whispers: I think it will be best if you bug testu about him playing with you to keep him around justu incase Kronos tries something) - Tue Sep 01 02:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dravae(VantetheGreat) whispers: so Nami stay away for him avoid him as hard as you can okay. - Tue Sep 01 02:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||The young man, full of vigor, lacked in knowledge. That being said, even if he had seen the activation of Byakugan through the coverage of clones that were in his way, he wouldn't know anything about it. Nevertheless, the clones would be upon her, though they wouldn't put up much of a fight against him. The first one was attacked, and probably defeated, within the first or second strike created by the Hyuuga. The other two would swarm him either way, but if he was good enough, Sunamaru would be able to destroy the clones with relative ease. Nevertheless, their existence wasn't the centerpiece.

Upon the last seal completed, the clones that were air-born were reaching the climax of their upward climb, angling downwards toward him in offensive positions to kick and punch him in the midst of their descent to utilize all the momentum of a downward fall. Simultaneous to this, as Yan had began preparing seals in accordance to this moment, the third technique he would perform would be that of Mud River.

An eruption of mud manifested before Yan, it's creation expanding and accumulating more volume whereupon it would rush into the other. That being said, those mud clones that were around him would serve as a distraction that would prevent him from dodging the mud river. Those above would descend upon him, amidst the mud river which would take him from his feet, to bare down upon him with two fists aimed towards what would assumed to be a defenseless Sunamaru. If it would play out correctly would be dependant upon the Hyuuga's actions in response.||* - Tue Sep 01 02:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Observed the scene as the mud river over-whelmed the other who was doubly distracted by the clones that were attacking in coordination with one another. Yan, who hadn't moved really and had remained unsathed so far, saw this opportunity as a way to again practice his ninjutsu that he was training at the moment.

It took a moment to re-assimilate his chakra, and prepare a water-based ninjutsu, though as he did he would begin performing handseals as he molded and asserted the water affinity properly in preparation of the technique. Upon the strings final seal, he would hold it and a stream of water would jet into the mud river--increasing it's volume and flow as he would attempt to completely over-take the other.||* - Tue Sep 01 03:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) performed a simple string of seals as he would commense a technique that had become second nature to him through the duration of it being within his arsenal. That being said, a total of nine plumes of smoke ignited around him as he produced nine clones that would surround him. With that said, he would wait for  Sunamaru's attempt at a come back as the mud river ceased.* - Tue Sep 01 03:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Due to the extensive use of his clones, while not lost forever, Yan was restricted with his chakra. That being said, each body recieved a similar amount of chakra with him leaving the numerical amount of his current chakra to be 550, though the relevance of that at the moment wasn't much as all his techniques required much less chakra.

Yan would send the clones forward, the first five engaging him immediately in punches and kicks while the other four remained back. They were in such a way that he would be covered, and as he began performing another technique, hopefully such would obscure the other's vision. 

The sand beneath him churned and expanded, loosening as it enabled him a route to traverse within it. That being said, he dipped within the sand and manuevere underneath the ground with the aid of his earthern style technique. As the other would be engaged, Yan would position himself underneath the fighting Hyuuga. At the right moment he would spring his attack, though that would be at a certain time which had not yet arrived. ||* - Tue Sep 01 03:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||With each clone destroyed, the chakra that was not utilized by the replica of Yan would be reverted back into the original host of the chakra thereby re-fueling Yan. Regardless Yan would be moving, intending to catch the other off guard. Due to the nature of his technique, magnetic forces would allow him to hone in on the other's position, and amidst the battle with the clones moments after the explosion of smoke which screened the entire view from normal ocular means, Yan reached out to grab the other's ankles.

Just then, each of the four remaining would begin performing seals. Once they had done so, streams of water jetted from their mouths and headed into the smoke screen. This would be a spread out manner, and would hopefully make it past the puppet being that it was performed in numbers. By grabbing, or attempting to grab the other's ankles, he hoped to further eliminate chances of dodging. Additionally, due to the solid nature of the streams of water, the smoke would be disrupted within its screen and force it to expand and lessen in density slightly.||* - Tue Sep 01 03:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||It was early morning, and the lands were dim as the heavenly body horizon upon the horizon until it's reach penetrated the darkness. The young genin was up and about, doing some chores that were given to him by his parents that involved the market. It wasn't long before he completed this whereupon he was allowed to go out and train. Preparation was key, and if he wanted to kill Edge, he had to train everyday to make sure all of his techniques were sharpened to a point.

Yan had found his usual spot, adjacent yet distanced from the gargantuan structure that was the leader's mansion. A visual on it for some reason inspired and motivated him, as it was enriched by a long history of turmoil and indomitable spirit--something that Yan himself had and wanted to keep as to strengthen his nindo. Needless to say, he would be practicing his water release technique which had been gifted in knowledge to him by Fujitora--the chuunin commander of The Hidden Sands.

Yan could feel the chakra churning within him, it's essence livening as it began to divert from its routine animation through the network from which it circulated throughout his body. Only then did he begin performing each seal of the technique in fast succession that was equally accurate as it was rapidly performed. Alongside each seal which was constructed, slender digits enabling this, the chakra within that was distributed began to assimilate in nature as well as mold into the proper composition to facilitate the creation of the technique.

The quick succession of seals started and began within the same second, and upon completion of weaving the handseals Yan would still upon the last one as it was still within construction upon his fingers. With the chakra properly molded, and every requirement for the jutsu met, the water elemental ninjutsu came into fruition as his gullet felt the sensation of moisture. It eventually came to be, within a span of second, his gullet was encroached and encumbered by water. It would force his release, though such was welcomed as he opened his jaw to a gaping angle.

The water was animated with purpose, seemingly condensed within a stream which was projected from the young ninja's mouth. It's power was formidable to a shinobi who did not have good grounding upon the sands, or even a body that couldn't withstand the calibre of shinobi of one like Dravae. As it emanated, it's route would end at a sand dune from which the potency of the technique could be measured. As it hit, such would be apparent.

The pressure of the water stream being injected into his mouth slammed into the sand dune. Being so thick and condensed with billions of grains of sand compacted by the wind, the power of the technique would only pinch the surface of the dune. Sand splattered omni-directionally from the outside power of the stream, although that which was hit was immediately soaked and inanimated as a result. As the stream ended, he noted that sand was weighed down by water. It led him to wonder if the sand-manipulator's sand would fall prey to the same condition.||

* - Tue Sep 01 12:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) allowed the water stream to cease, though that wasn't concluding his training rather he simply was preparing to perform the very technique again. That being said, as he was about to, Osamu happened upon the scene. He turned and looked towards him, looking for some form of emblem that served to indicate which village he hailed from. "Yo'.." He greeted him, though he knew he wasn't a Suna-nin and therefore Yan remained vigilant and ready.* - Tue Sep 01 12:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) replied with widened eyes. Yan, despite his intelligence, had a bad memory when it came to people. With that said, he hadn't recognize Osamu first but now did as someone that wanted to apprehend him. "Wait....What are YOU doing here?!" He asked, his voice different as it held a less friendly tone.* - Tue Sep 01 12:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) peers past him as he noticed the guards that were positioned there, shaking his head. "Well, I guess justice is served...." He said, noting that Yan was the one that would have been taken into custody without warrant before and not it was Osamu--justified or otherwise. Nevertheless, the young elementalist would inquire as to the situation surrounding his capture.

"Back to training," he'd say as he turned south-bound and prepared to perform the water release technique again.* - Tue Sep 01 13:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan turned around, and with the cease of words, thoughts had become the dominant resonation wtihin his mind. Seeing Osamu here suddenly washed over all the trama and emotional stress of when his brother had died and he was suddenly catapulted into an entirely different enviroment with hostile forces all around him. He hated Edge, that was what these thoughts ended in. That being said, once Osamu spoke again, Yan's expression had temporarily assimilated into something more attuned with anger and spite. 

In response to the captured ninja's words, he turned and scowled at him, something that was uncharacteristic of the normally joyful boy. He realized this, having contorted his expression to something so unfavorable without intent, whereupon he drew it to a smirk that still held a slight amount of contempt for those who weren't on good terms with the current government of Sunagakure. That being said, he walked over to the man to their north and whispered to him, basically ignoring Osama.||* - Tue Sep 01 13:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: This guy was in the village when Edge visited Zetsumo... - Tue Sep 01 13:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: If he has any chance to escape, couldn't he tell them all about what we have? - Tue Sep 01 13:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) whispers: I'm handling it, He's my prisoner. - Tue Sep 01 13:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan simply nodded, and wouldn't bring it up again. He didn't know who the guy he spoke to was really, but he knew that Dravae trusted him to a degree and that was enough for him. Then again, Edge was once considered a comrade as well. That thought was washed away, as it would breed unnecessary paranoia that Yan didn't care to entertain. That being said, he returned to his original position as he prepared to perform a technique. He still wouldn't reply to Osamu, but if he knew patience, he would find out part of his question as to his specialization.

Yan would begin performing seals, though they were burdened by the distraction of his thoughts. Even though they did not falter, they weren't as rapid as before though that wasn't all that releavant as he was in the middle of practicing the technique. As the final seal was completed, with hands that were suspended before him, it was held thereby allowing the technique to come into fruition as the seals provided the molding for the chakra within his body.

The water again spewed from his lips as his jaw was forced to open from the wealth of water that sought to penetrate the opening in a stream. As it was released, it proceeded in the trajactory that would lead to the sand dune in a single, condensed line of water that's pressure bared upon the dune of sand. Of course, as stated before, the thickness and density of the sand due was too much for the water and as a result it simply scattered the surface granules of sand and dampened the thickness of the sand's surface at the point the two forces met.||* - Tue Sep 01 13:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) appeared skeptical.* - Tue Sep 01 13:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan observed the other as he performed the technique, and based on their handseal speed relative to his own, he could make out some of them on the first go as it was a norm for him to view seals moving at a much higher pace despite him having already known those seals before hand. NEvertheless, he recognized most of the seals but missed one or two. As the technique activated, Yan's interest grew more.

The water that was produced had much more volume, and with more volume came more momentum and potency. It was Yan's technique on steroids, though with a thought lingering in his mind he was unsure if he would learn the technique. A bit of blind pride was instilled in the boy, and since Osamu was partnered with Sunagakure's enemies, it was hard to accept a technique. On the other hand, learning this technique would progress Yan towards his ultimate goal and that alone out-shined any reasoning that the young boy could concoct to not learn it.

"Alright, I'll learn it," he stated as he began playing with the handseals that were shown during the first performance of the technique. "What were the seals again," he said, diverting his eyes from his hands momentarily as he peered towards Osamu. If he learned this technique from Osamu, Yan would have to show some form of acceptance to him...Yan wasn't one to hold a grudge, unless it was Edge, and so that might be accomplished as a result.||* - Tue Sep 01 13:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan listened as the other stated the only three seals that were involved in the technique. This was a technique that he would use often, as such few handseals would allow him to do it quickly and have a more effective power. Once Osamu ceased dialogue, Yan would begin preparation to perform the technique.

His hands slipped together, forming the first seal whereupon he moved onto the next as his digits retracted and contorted to fluidly fall into the next set of positions to complete the next seal. With each seal performed, the chakra was molded and assimilated into the water nature which was required of the technique. On the last one, the molding was complete and the chakra nature transformation in complete fruition. With that done, the technique should have commensed although it did not.

"Damn," he murmered as he prepared to perform the technique again.||* - Tue Sep 01 13:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||The blonde-haired boy nodded in reply to Osamu as he prepared to perform the technique successfully. He began performing the seals again, though this time with the initial two practices on which seals were needed, he increased his speed as the accuracy had been acquired. As the last seal was performed, and the chakra molded and aligned to the water element, Yan could feel moisture accumulating within his throat although that was as far as the technique came before dissipation of its effects. "Damnit...so close," he thought to himself as he sighed, though he knew if he kept at it success was inevitable.||* - Tue Sep 01 13:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan noticed Osamu had dipped to speak with Okar, who had asked him a question. It didn't matter though, as Yan's progression to learning the technique had reached its climax and all that was left in order to succeed was to tweak a few components of his preparations. That being said, he began performing handseals thereby molding the chakra.  Incorperating the water element, and imbueing the chakra which was molded with that element--it was then that the technique was performed.

A more vast amount of water spewed from his mouth relative to his other technique. It's mass shot forward, expanding more than the mud river had down as it washed down the area which Yan faced toward. It was definitely something that would allow his clones an easier time landing hits and would be used similiarly to the mud river he used quite often in matches. As the water would cease, Yan would grin as he felt accomplished with a new technique under his belt. It meant he was getting closer to his goal. But while he was growing stronger, he knew Edge was too. He had to train more intensely.||* - Tue Sep 01 14:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Osamu(Assassin241) whispers: You got some burns and were bit, weren't you? - Tue Sep 01 14:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||It was early morning, and the lands were dim as the heavenly body horizon upon the horizon until it's reach penetrated the darkness. The young genin was up and about, doing some chores that were given to him by his parents that involved the market. It wasn't long before he completed this whereupon he was allowed to go out and train. Preparation was key, and if he wanted to kill Edge, he had to train everyday to make sure all of his techniques were sharpened to a point.

Yan had found his usual spot, adjacent yet distanced from the gargantuan structure that was the leader's mansion. A visual on it for some reason inspired and motivated him, as it was enriched by a long history of turmoil and indomitable spirit--something that Yan himself had and wanted to keep as to strengthen his nindo. Needless to say, he would be practicing his water release technique which had been gifted in knowledge to him by Fujitora--the chuunin commander of The Hidden Sands.

Yan could feel the chakra churning within him, it's essence livening as it began to divert from its routine animation through the network from which it circulated throughout his body. Only then did he begin performing each seal of the technique in fast succession that was equally accurate as it was rapidly performed. Alongside each seal which was constructed, slender digits enabling this, the chakra within that was distributed began to assimilate in nature as well as mold into the proper composition to facilitate the creation of the technique.

The quick succession of seals started and began within the same second, and upon completion of weaving the handseals Yan would still upon the last one as it was still within construction upon his fingers. With the chakra properly molded, and every requirement for the jutsu met, the water elemental ninjutsu came into fruition as his gullet felt the sensation of moisture. It eventually came to be, within a span of second, his gullet was encroached and encumbered by water. It would force his release, though such was welcomed as he opened his jaw to a gaping angle.

The water was animated with purpose, seemingly condensed within a stream which was projected from the young ninja's mouth. It's power was formidable to a shinobi who did not have good grounding upon the sands.

The pressure of the water stream being injected into his mouth slammed into the sand dune. Being so thick and condensed with billions of grains of sand compacted by the wind, the power of the technique would only pinch the surface of the dune. Sand splattered omni-directionally from the outside power of the stream, although that which was hit was immediately soaked and inanimated as a result. As the stream ended, he noted that sand was weighed down by water. It led him to wonder if the sand-manipulator's sand would fall prey to the same condition.

* - Tue Sep 01 14:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan sought to train his new technique. After all, his water gun technique was nearly mastered and the eagerness of a young man willed him to practice the new technique he had just learned. That being said, he left them to their own conversation and began performing seals as he prepared to proceed with the technique. As the seals were formed, chakra was molded as well as chakra transformation was done as well.

At the end the creation of the jutsu had come into fruition and a mass of water accumulated within his mouth until it was forced out with the parting of his lips. The mass of water whic churned exploded from the retainment and expanded with momentum and force as it washed over the sand and hit the dune. As it hit the dune of sand, it exploded against it with raging waves as it surrounded and moved around it. Anything caught within the wake of the waves would be washed away as well, as critters scurried to safety within holes.|| * - Tue Sep 01 14:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) noticed the girl practice her ninjutsu as well, though her technique was fire natured. He had no doubt he'd defeat her but for her to be able to use ninjutsu at such a young age was amazing. She was definitely skilled, and with reason, as that was Fujitora's daughter.* - Tue Sep 01 14:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) yawns slightly as he remains rather inactive for the moment. He had used nearly thirty percent of his chakra during the training, and even though he had alot more gas in the tank, he figured a break would allow him to enter back into training with the same vigor as when he initially started this morning.* - Tue Sep 01 16:10:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) passed through the area, as he was bored and was looking for something to do. As he passed Osamu, he shot him a glance but continued on past him in expanse of sand that was south of the village's interior.* - Wed Sep 02 23:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||The young ninja passed across the road which led into the valley of Sunagakure's gates, and would have continued on had he not heard the explosive pandemonium occuring at the gates. Also, at this point, many shinobi ran past him in approach. 

"What tha..." He said, somewhat confused as he didn't really connect the dots, but then a shinobi screamed that they were under attack and that the opponent was ominous.

"Tatsumi..." He thought to himself as he began his own approach to the battle happening at the gates. He would continute he noticed a ninja that he knew personally..at which point he would investigate the events that were unfolding.||* - Wed Sep 02 23:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Explosions and fire bursted into pandemonium in the distance, though the sheer amount of potency involved in the techniques shook the very ground beneath Yan as he neared the battle. In his approach, he noticed Dravae and a wounded Zehl which hastened his path towards them. 

"Who is attacking?" He called out to the two of them, though even if they didn't reply, his actions would remain a constant within the variables.

 He sought to remove Zehl from the area, as the battle was raging on and a wounded shinobi had no place within its barrier of chaos. He performed a few seals, done within a second, at which point the chakra was molded and the technique's function ripened into creation.

Just at the end of his seal, plumes of smoke ignited in every which direction ambient to Yan. Within the billowing clouds of obscurity remained figures whose forms would be revealed upon the expansion and eventually dispersed to imperceptible of the clouds. That being said, five clones that were created in likeness to Yan were created thereby allowing him to do multiple things at once.

The first two went to Zehl, and would attempt to pick him up and carry him into the village and away from the commotion ahead. The other three positioned themselves before Yan and Dravae, in preparation to commense battle or support in defending the two from attacks. From there, the original Yan would venture to Dravae and await response.

"Yo, what are you doing?!" He exclaimed curiously as Dravae put his hands to his ground.||* - Thu Sep 03 00:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dravae(VantetheGreat) whispers: I am about to call for that tribe of sand worms  Zetsumo and his gooons must be stopped at all cost. - Thu Sep 03 00:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan was scared, even though he had been training relentelessly--the fear exposed within his heart welled in his interior to a point that physical pain was almost induced. That being said, he would be quite alert to the battle ahead and the chaos which threatened to come their way.

He hadn't seen anyting like it, ominous demons encumbered with threads and the air of death appeared in the distance. Yan couldn't feel chakra, or had no way of truly knowing, but the masses of shinobi around them heading in the direction to battle in addition to the three of them being within the group, it wasn't much to guess that the demon's intentions were to cause mass casulties if it was possible.

"Damnit, Dravae, we have to go!" Yan urged Dravae, and with that, the three clones retracted their distance from the original Yan as well as Dravae. With that done, all four of them would perform handseals and mold their chakra, thereby allowing them to align their intents to earthern-fashioned chakra and perform a technique that would hopefully save them.

The ground beneath them, as by now all of them were close enough that the effects of each's technique would over-lap into the area effected by the others, began to shift and soften until the terra had assimilated into a texture which was loose enough to be traversed within. Having said that, all of them including Dravae if he complied would sink into the ground. 

Once in the ground, Yan would seek to dive further into the ground alongside those clones which accompanied him. By  this time, each clone had diverted into their own path and dispersed consequently as they were no longer necessary. Yan drew Dravae close, and moved within the sand while the Aburame was within his grasp. 

Simultaneously, the two clones which were holding Zehl took an identical approach. They lowered him and performed handseals, earth beneath them shifting and assimilating to the same state which the other's technique had willed. In the same fashion, they were safe within the terra-formed crust when the fire and wind hit the ground.

While the ground would be ripped up, the process of arriving to where Dravae and Yan were, as well as Zehl who was further, would allow the shinobi to dive deep enough to avoid the devastation which would wreak havoc upon many other lives. Once the flames and wind were concluded, they would ascend, though Yan had plenty of chakra to keep this up until that point occured.||* - Thu Sep 03 01:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Death had been avoided, narrowly. It was clear upon their ascention at what tier this battle was being fought. The desolation that had been shown was horrendous, with the valley almost unrecognizeable in structure as well as animation. Death consumed the valley and the smell arose.

Charred flesh invaded his nostrils, though it was of little concern. The clones which held Zhel would surface and traverse over rubble and fallen rock whereas the other three were previously dispersed therefore only Yan and Dravae were there at that point. Yan didn't know what to do and so he asked Dravae.

"What are my orders?" As he spoke, his voice was layered with fear though such was side-lined by duty. He wanted to show people that he would become strong enough to help his friends, to stop them from being killed...To rise above the weakness which had left Tatsumi to die while Yan was able to live on. This showed more than fear, and with that said, he didn't want Dravae to order him in any other fashion other than to a militant end.||* - Thu Sep 03 01:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Dravae was doing his own thing at this point, as Yan had retrieved him from death once already. As he said what he did, out of nowhere the actuality of that statement became apparent once again. The demon drew near.

The same fear consumed Yan again, and instead of facing the demon, he ducked and moved underneath a grouping of boulders which had an opening. By then Zehl was long gone, and safe from the torrent of winds that would be released from the other demon however Yan and Dravae were not. That being said, Yan had intended to prepare in case such a case came to be.

The demon passed over them, moreso unconcerned with the boy rather than ignorant to his location, though the torrent of winds which caused large-scaled debris to lift up and fly every which way due to the momentum of the powerful ninjutsu. With that in clarity, Yan would hear this and prepare an escape route for himself that no longer involved Dravae, though that was out of convience of location rather than selfish desires. 

The sand underneath him would shift and loosen, thus allowing him to gain entrance into its interior. As the wall of wind washed over the rocks and ambient area which Yan had occupied, the boy sunk into the earth thereby enabling him to evade what would have been instant death within the grouping of rocks.


 He didn't know what else to do, as he was ordered to ensure Zehl made it to the hospital and so he did. He moved himself in the similar direction in which the clones did. He would eventually catch up to them, though that would be far away from the calamity. Yan wasn't completely on point in knowledge about the fire grudge who was entering the village.* - Thu Sep 03 01:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan sought to train his new technique. After all, his water gun technique was nearly mastered and the eagerness of a young man willed him to practice the new technique he had just learned.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||The sun bared upon them more than normal, or at least, to Yan it did. In truth it was the emotional stress and dissapointement that the battle had gone the way it did. There were many casualties, though Yan was able to save some of his friends in all the chaos..the thought of comfort was a drop in an ocean.

There were many familiar invidiudals scattered about many more faces, shinobi who were either mourning or going about their business to handle post-attack statuses. Yan approached from the north-east, stopping nearby the others. He was wondering if he could get some answers.

"Hey," he spoke aloud, and even though it was moreso directed at Orakuru than anyone else, Yan would welcome anyone's information in the end.||* - Thu Sep 03 17:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was ignored and so he pressed forward until he was to their side at which point he spoke again. 'So who attacked us yesterday?' he inquired.* - Thu Sep 03 17:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) |Upon Yan's arrival, he noticed the Aburame who he had saved in the war yesterday and approached him. He saw that he was in the middle of something, but it didn't seem anything that he couldn't talk while performing. That being said, the young man spoke with a smile upon his face albeit weakened from the events before. "Yo'..." He announced his presence, stepping toward him though he remained distanced to respect the other's work "Is your brother going to be okay?" He asked, referencing toward Zehl who Yan had taken to the hospital.|* - Thu Sep 03 17:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) |Truth be told, what Drave had sad angered him. After all, if Yan hadn't been there, Zehl would have been udoubtedly dead. If he could have saved Tatsumi...he would have given everything. At that moment, he wore the emotions on his expression. "You only get one brother..you should go see him." He stated, his voice aggressive but not quite hostile* - Thu Sep 03 18:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||He listened to the aburame, but was still disturbed by his words. Yan was a dutiful shinobi, and sought to serve the village as well as advance his own ability to its end..At the same time, what was all that for if not to ultimately protect your family and care for them? What was such purpose for if not to prepetuate the existence of those you love? That being said, if he couldn't even visit his brother in the hospital, who might even be close to death for all they knew--there was a problem.

"Yo', how about you get out of my face?" He said, fearful yet resiliant to such things encroaching his features. From here on out, he wouldn't care too much for Dravae whereas before he held him high regard. This guy was something else. "I guess I'll go check on your brother then, if you don't care to." He'd say, giving him a snarl as he pivoted and turned to head towards the hospital.||* - Thu Sep 03 18:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan couldn't believe this guy, but as stated before, he pivoted and headed off. He had no interest in dealing with someone who obviously had more on their plate than they could handle. If Dravae tried to stop him, there's no doubt a brawl would ensue as Yan was on edge because of Dravae's behavior.||

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods firmly. Normally he would be overly excited however with recent events and the sentimental value of learning this technique, he couldn't help but be in his emotions and therefore serious. He'd stand from the bench and await Chiyari's blind lead.

"I hope I'm not being rude by waiting instead of leading him!" Yan thought, frowning briefly as a result.* - Thu Sep 03 22:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||The boy was thick in excitement, trailing beside Chiyari as they ventured toward the exterior of the town. Once they were far enough away that Chiyari was comfortable, he spun around at which point Yan ceased and prepared to take in whatever information was given to him. In anticipation, he had already withdrawn the summoning scroll from the suspended position on his back.

"Uh..blood?" He said, observing Chiyari do the very same method so that Yan could see clearly how it was done. He copied, knicking his finger with a shuriken's point, whereupon he unraveled the scroll upon the sands and positioned himself to write upon it.

"Like this?"

He asked as he placed his finger on the contract and began writing his signature in the designated area thereafter stamping it as well utilizing the tip of his finger to do so.||* - Thu Sep 03 22:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) w||Yan pondered upon the process as it was being articulated by his village's leader. He had seen Tatsumi do it many times but he had never asked his brother to teach him, as he had always wanted to make his own way hence the clone technique. He sought to master it so that he could utilize the bunshin in teamwork like his brother had shown with his toad summons. Now he wanted to master the toads like his brother, and given the opportunity to take this endeavor underway with the aid of Chiyari--their leader--instilled a great sense of pride and purpose in him.

"Right!" He said, as then he performed the technique and Chiyari's own ninken appeared to aid. It was awesome, and it only made Yan want to learn the technique all the more.

"Here goes nothing!" He said, and since he couldn't utilize the kunai, he brought his thumb to his mouth. Biting down, he pinched the skin of the thumb thereby releasing an adequate amount of blood which was slapped onto his hands by instructions given.

As he was performing the task of the blood sacrifice, he was kneading his chakra all the while. Yan wasn't the best, but he definitely wasn't the worst either when it came to chakra control. After all, his form of combat which was using his clones to fight required some competency in it. That being said, the task wasn't difficult.

Even though he was great with handseals, perhaps the accumulative effort needed for the first actions clouded his mind on the seals, as he began performing them and faltered slightly. In the middle of weaving the string, he sought to work through it though the molding was imperfect as a result. At the end of his seal, he slammed his hand onto the ground--unfortunately nothing happened.

"Shit, I knew I should have started over..." He said, shaking his hands. "Hold up, I just messed up with the seals!" He gave off the excuse and he wanted to try again. At this rate, his fingers would be destroyed if he kept having to bite them.||
* - Thu Sep 03 22:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan wasn't going to make such a rookie mistake again, as he had become quite proficient in learning techniques as he had shown Fujitora before. He was a sponge, soaking up as much information about techniques as he possibly could. He directly connected the amount of techniques he had at his disposal as a measure to his power--he sought versatility instead of potency, and in that regard--he was developing nicely.

He knicked his thumb with a pinch of his teeth again, ensuring that he received some of the cascading blood onto his hand as the blood sacrifice. Simultaneously, the chakra inherent within him began to knead and mold as he began performing the handseals. He did them more meticulous this time, ensuring that the seals wove were precise and correct. At the end of the the string of seals he slammed his palm into the ground.

As his palm hit the ground, the sand filled the air from the momentum but nothing other than that occured. He snarled and poised to attempt it again. If Chiyari had some input, he would listen.||* - Thu Sep 03 22:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||"This time.." He stated, as determined as ever. As he began kneading his chakra, and performing the blood sacrifice--he couldn't help but think of the many times his brother had defeated him utilizing the toads. In fact, Yan had never stood a match to him when Tatsumi summoned toads, as Yan had barely graduated to the rank of genin before his death. Nevertheless, his heart was empowered by tragedy and his love of the memories.

He seemed indomitable, and once done with the afore-mentioned actions, he began performing seals thereby attempting to mold the chakra. As Chiyari had mentioned, he focused and reached out in an attempt to connect with the toads, and at the end of the string of seals--Yan pushed his momentum into the ground open-palmed.

"!!!" 

Something happened. Upon the ground, the etching of black occured which was indicative of success. However, the summon was not answered and Yan was confused.

"..Do they not want to help me?" He thought to himself. "I am Tatsumi's brother and I want to be like him!" He called out in his heart--his mind. He didn't know if they could hear him and felt silly, but he was going to keep trying until he succeeded.

He heeded Chiyari's words, and on the next attempt, he would apply his advice.||* - Thu Sep 03 23:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan made his fourth attempt at the technique. He brought the edge of his thumb's thickness to his mouth whereupon he bit it and drew blood. He slapped the blood onto his hand, as he was required to, all the while making preparations to his chakra through the kneading process. When he began to perform his seals, he made sure to do them accurately and with fluidity in transitions between one to the next.

When he was done performing the seals, he slapped upon the earth. The technique was a success..somewhat. The kuchiyose's physiological effect of the printing upon the earth was accomplished, and a plume of smoke was willed into existence as a form was within it. Upon the dissipation of the smoke, a tad pole wiggled about. 

"Whoa. I did it! Look!" He said, screaming as he pointed. Of course, this wasn't adequately performed well enough to be called a success. It was definitely a failure.||* - Thu Sep 03 23:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan frowned and posed to do it again. It was true that this was inadequate, as TAtsumi was able to summon toads that were capable of speech and could perform techniques. That being said, he would have to as well. He began to perform the summoning technique.

He pinched his thumb, drawing blood, where he slapped it onto his hand and transitioned to creating seals. Each seal further molded the chakra, and it was further aided by Yan's concentration on preparing the chakra to be utilized. Upon the last seal, he drew his hand from the other and slammed it upon the ground.

The complex symbol appeared again on the ground, following by another plume of smoke which billowed and expanded until it's obscurity was no longe and a larger tad pole was left within its wake. It wiggled, and had small legs. It couldn't talk though, and it definitely couldn't fight. 

"..Almost there.." He said, somewhat disturbed by his lack of success.||* - Thu Sep 03 23:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan was pleased that it was getting bigger, but he was an anxious young man and wanted to be helped by the real toads. That being said, he put everything into this attempt.

He bit his thumb, thus drawing blood, whereupon he drew it upon his hand in preparation. He then began doing the seals. His quick learning in addition to his knowledge of seals was adequate enough that he was now speeding through each seal with accuracy and finesse. Meanwhile, his form was molding the chakra and kneading it properly.

As he did, he called out with his heart to the toads. His emotion brimmed as he thought of his brother.

"Tatsumi, this is for you!" He called out, slamming his hand into the ground with formidable force relative to the boy's normal physical strength. As it hit the ground, the technique ignited and the complex drawing was established upon the terra-form. The smoke billowed in creation, it's manifestation expansive now in comparison to before.

"Oooi, who is bugging me?!" A  loud, booming voice sounded from within the smoke, though the form remained in obscurity. As it settled, a small toad was within the smoke. 

"Who the hell are you?!" The toad asked, looking at both Chiiyari and Yan.

"Wait..I know you---" 

"My name is Yan..I'm Tatsumi's brother!" Yan exclaimed, a smile upon his lips.

"Wait, where's your brother? I ain't seen him," the toad asked, his voice suspicious.

"...A man killed him, and I am asking for your help to fight him! Please let me continue my brother's contract with you!" Yan pleaded with the toad, as he knew his connection to Tatsumi would help.

"Uh...I guess," the toad said with a grumble. "Just so that we can kill the bastard that killed your brother."

And so he had done it.||* - Thu Sep 03 23:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||The toad nodded and said a few things before dispersing, beckoning Yan to summon him later for training and proper introductions.

"Uh..thanks! I am going to train and become a strong ninja so that the next battle I can help more," he said as smiled brightly. Of course, Chiyari couldn't see this, but perhaps he could sense the gratitude in his voice.||* - Thu Sep 03 23:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) gives him a thumbs up. "Lookin sharp." * - Fri Sep 04 01:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) catches the scroll and heads off. "Sorry for interrupting your training!"* - Fri Sep 04 01:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) walked through the area, as he passed, he called out to everyone. "I'm going on a mission, C-rank, if anyone wants to get in on it," he said as he continued on.* - Fri Sep 04 01:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) didn't really want Dravae to come but he also knew Dravae was a talented shinobi and so he complied. Pushing past pride was one thing he needed to get better on, and holding grudges as pointless as the one he had for Dravae was only detrimental to him. That being said, he beckoned him and kept walking.* - Fri Sep 04 01:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) walked outside the village, peering into the distance. "The gate guard saw it run in this direction," he noted. He expected Dravae to do what he did best at this point. "Think you can track them down?" He asked. They would keep things business for the time being.* - Fri Sep 04 01:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) waited patiently as the ninja performed the aburame-specific technique. He didn't know what else to do but keep watch. If the animal was approaching it, Dravae would know before he did, but who cared? He was going to watch out for anything suspicious..."Find out anything?" He'd ask impatiently.* - Fri Sep 04 02:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan was hoping for something a little bit more competitive to fight than a cat, on the other hand, it meant things would go easy and it'd be a paycheck that was garunteed. Little did he know there wouldn't be a fight at all, as Dravae was finishing the job before they even got there. "Well, let's go kick its ass then...I'm sure it'll wake up once we get there," he noted as he walked alongside it. "Let me know when we get close so I can use my clones to confuse it," he said. Again, he didn't know that the beast would be drained upon their arrival.||* - Fri Sep 04 02:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan approached the sleeping his beast, not yet brandishing a weapon as he had numbers to his advantage--even if the help wasn't very much. He peered towards the rookie as he gestured with his hand, indicating for the other to cease movement and stand-by with mid-ranged aid as they had spoken about before.

"I am gonna---" It was awake. He let out a ferocious growl, as it stood up and shook the sleep from it. Yan began performing seals, which due to his proficiency, allowed him to weave the short string within a second. Plumes of smoke ignited all around him, with one of the plumes being relieved of it's form within early as the bunshin sprung into action to intercept the feline in case it went for the genjutsu-user.

Despite his attempt, it slammed through the bunshin, and headed straight for the kid. Yan wasn't fast enough to catch it so he did what he did best, he began performing seals in preparation to intercept the cat with ninjutsu. Of course, if the kid had a plan, it could now be sprung before Yan's intervention perhaps.||* - Fri Sep 04 08:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Include the cat's reaction to your genjutsu) - Fri Sep 04 09:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kahn, Bankai(Rexman122) whispers: right now ? - Fri Sep 04 09:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan wasn't experienced with genjutsu at all, that being said--he had no idea if he was actually doing though he was drawn to the conclusion by the elements surrounding the handseals. Nevertheless, it wasn't directed to him so it wasn't something he should worry about.

Being that he had been performing seals, the smoke bomb wouldn't be thrown or would be done so in futility. At the end of the string of seals, which amounted to four and was performed in less than a second's time, a wealth of water spilled from the suna ninja's lips. The bountiful amount of water, kneaded with his own chakra as was the nature of its creation, flowed like a small river as it aimed to bash into the cat's body. 

With it panicked, it'd likely hit, and if the other threw the poison bomb, the pill would probably get swallowed within the wake of the water technique and if submerged--the poisonous gas would probably be reduced to simply contaminating the water which it bursted within. That would play out well regardless, as the cat would thereby be poisoned.

Nevertheless, the attack would connect though it wouldn't be a killing blow. By this time the other two bunshin he had created alongside the clone that was crushed earlier by the cat were in position and preparing a technique side-by-side. Each wove their different seals, one kneading suiton chakra whereas the other kneaded doton chakra. At the same time, both techniques were unleashed. The D rank water technique coupled with the C ranked mud silhouette were projected though as they formed upon the ground, they were combined.

This caused a massive amount of mud to be produced and envelope the cat--making it hard for him to move.

"Finish him off if you want," Yan remarked. By now, the genjutsu had already been dismantled due to the ninjutsu used upon him that caused adequate damage to shake the beast back to reality.||* - Fri Sep 04 09:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan watched as the other made quick work of the task, killing the animal in a very brutal way. His eyebrow cocked, a little weirded out by it, though he did what he was told. "Cool, let's head back," he said as he turned and headed back into the village. "We are close enough that I don't need this," he said as he retrieved a small water container which he tossed backwards towards the genin. "Wash your face off." He said as it was in flight. With that said, they would make their way back into the village to report. (Chiyari, the leader, isn't on atm so we can't get our rewards until he is on)||* - Fri Sep 04 09:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) notes they had been walking, and just fastforwarded to them being back in the village.* - Fri Sep 04 09:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) shrugs as he wasn't concerned. * - Fri Sep 04 09:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ( Hogo, Tethys OOCS: (Don't think I forgot about that OOC shit talking you did with Patrick, Noel.)
Hogo, Tethys OOCS: (That shit didn't slide but Smith made me promise not to kill off your chars.) )* - Fri Sep 04 18:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would pivot, leaving them be as he sought to check on Dravae. "What happened?" He'd ask, folding his arms to his chest.* - Fri Sep 04 18:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) || Yan couldn't follow his movement, and as he appeared before him, little room was left to speculation. Orakuru seemed to be an excellent ninja. Yan frowned, but stood his ground. "Yeah, yeah..." He said.."Fujitora, you got any new techniques you can teach me? I'm bored.." He said, turning to Fujitora now.* - Sat Sep 05 00:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) took note of the trio behind Orakuru, and with Tetsumi looking angry, he was on guard. He'd leave them be though.* - Sat Sep 05 00:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) shrugged and headed towards the training fields. It wasn't ideal but it was a spar.* - Sat Sep 05 01:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) settles into a stance that was common in elementalist-style shinobi. Having said that, ready to move but moreso ready to form seals. "Come at me," He said, as he prepared for her to come at him. He knew she used fire release, and so he was ready for it.* - Sat Sep 05 01:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan reacted as soon as she brandished the projectile, though he didn't notice there were too. Yan was going to go on the offensive, and in doing so, he would also extingiush the threat of the wooden shuriken. He had a wealth of chakra, so performing techniques to combat even simple projectiles wasn't a big deal for him. If anything, he sought to improve his reflexes in accelerating hand movement to begin weaving seals.

Within half a second, not even--four handseals were created one after the other with speed and accuracy thereby molding the chakra inherent within the boy as he also kneaded it with nature transformation into water-aligned chakra. As he released the technique, a stream of water jetted out of his mouth and slammed into the shuriken(s), breaking through as it neared her position. ||* - Sat Sep 05 01:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan was pleased to see that his attack was successful, though as the girl prepared her handseals, he also knew that she was going to utilize her fire release techniques. Nevertheless, given the fact that she was reacting after observing his own jutsu come to fruition, it could be assumed that the confrontation of two techniques were moreso towards her than him. As the two met, the water beat back the fire yet the fire's technique was inherently stronger and so the two stood on equal grounds.

"Time to make it stronger," He thought to himself, as he transitioned to more seals.

This time he took it up a notch. His hands were quickly performed, perhaps distorted by the steam, sand and debris that flew everywhere from the impact of the two ninjutsu. After all, the fireball technique itself caused destruction upon the land as it traversed right above it. At the end of the seals, with chakra prepared, he let out another water release technique.

By all appearances it was the same technique, although it was much stronger than the one before and the water which was projected was of a higher-volume. He even doubled it's power, increasing the chakra output as a small river flowed towards the girl threatening to over-take her small form.||* - Sat Sep 05 01:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Narrowed his eyes as the water ceased, as she had dissapeared from view, which made the technique useless and therefore discontinued. He knew she couldn't be that fast, and had seen the shunshin technique before, so his eyes would dart in either direction. Of course, that's when he saw her. He smirked and pivoted, jumping back as his hands came together and started forming seals.

While performing the seals, he transitioned to another elemental and established nature transformation to his primary element. That being said, he'd be doing this while she was recovering from the shunshin technique in the event that she was new to it's effects.||* - Sat Sep 05 01:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan shook his head at her words and smirked, though by this time there had been a plume of smoke which ignited to his side. As the smoke settled, it would be a replica of Yan as he had performed the mud clone technique. The clone rushed forward, having every intent of engaging in close combat. 

"I asked if you were sure! Get ready~!" He called out, as the clone headed her way.||* - Sat Sep 05 01:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||The young boy would stand there and watch as the clone took the battle to the girl instead of himself. 

The clone would perform seals as it headed towards her, kneading chakra as it performed the mud river technique. Mud manifested before it, shooting in advanced of it's own movement as it ceased and it continued on towards the girl. Yan wasn't worried if it connected or not, he was just playing around. Maybe he was being too hard on her? He asked for a real spar, perhaps he should have declined her.||* - Sat Sep 05 01:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) |Chakra churned within his form regardless of the battle unfolding that did not presently involve him directly. When she juumped back, thereafter launching into the air, Yan instinctively began concentrating chakra into the ground below him. Slowly the granules of sand shook into animation and loosened--expanding until the ground was fluid almost like water in thickness. With that said, upon the unleashing of the fire technique, Yan was already sinking into the ground.

The fire technique would sear past him, follicles ashed at the top layer as he could feel heat amass atop his head right before he was completely submerged. He would move forward as soon as he entered, moving to safety before returning to the surface. He was going to appear behind her, but seeing as she was somewhat serious, he wouldn't attempt to go to close as she was using some sort of sword.

As his hands were surfaced from the terra, his hands would be working to perform seals and a jutsu would be prepared as a result. Needless to say, each seal was created in fractions of a second.||* - Sat Sep 05 01:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan emerged from the earth, from away from her that she couldn't spring an attack on him upon sight.  "That fire is pesky." He stated, forming seals in preparation. That being said, he'd have time to prepare water release ninjutsu as he didn't want to be subject to any fire release attacks hitting him.||* - Sat Sep 05 02:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) released the built-up chakra, as well as the technique's preparation, as she motioned for a pause in the spar. "Hm?" He'd ask. Hopefully she would quit, this wasn't much fun to him.* - Sat Sep 05 02:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) retrieved the flask upon his side and tossed it her way.* - Sat Sep 05 02:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) spoke and then headed back. He'd wait for her, of course, being that she was Fujitora's daughter he had to make sure she made it back in one piece.* - Sat Sep 05 02:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) enters the area. "Hey...I found a corpse of someone but I do not know who they are." He noted, looking towards the group.* - Sat Sep 05 02:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would nod toward Fujitora before heading off in the direction. Dravae was right there, so he didn't understand why he had to recover the body..Nevertheless he followed orders as a dutiful shinobi.* - Sat Sep 05 02:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan did the blood sacrifice, kneading his chakra and thereafter molding it through a quick string of seals that were performed with accuracy and speed. Thereafter once everything was peformed and preparations were complet; he slammed his hand onto the ground. With that done, the technique was created though his intentions were not to summon the toads as that would disturb them needlessly. That being said, the kuchiyose stamp manifested on the surface of the sand.||* - Sat Sep 05 12:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) ||Yan had performed the technique to it's full capacity before, and was going to do so again, both attempts saving the final scene of summoning the toads. He pinched the epidermis of his thumb, creating a blood letting that was thereafter applied to his hand. He then performed a series of handseals while kneading his chakra; the handseals enabling him to mold his chakra in preparation of the technique. On the last one, Yan transitioned and pushed his shoulder forward while directing his palm towards the ground. The slam would end the attempt, the kuchiyose emblem displayed, before dissipating. Again, he didn't want to summon the physical toads.||* - Sat Sep 05 12:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) notes that the girl seems unfriendly. It wasn't uncommon, so Yan didn't give it anymore thought.* - Sat Sep 05 12:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) cocked an eyebrow at her tone, though he soon reverted in expression before parting his lips for a quick reply. "I am. What's your name?" * - Sat Sep 05 12:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) is a fourteen year old boy, and so he feels quite proud of being referred to as  a man.* - Sat Sep 05 12:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) smiled at the reply. "Nice to meet ya," he said before averting his bright green eyes to Ushinawa. "You apparently know me but I don't know you to be honest." He stated, though he knew as well as anyone else that knew him that he had a horrible memory.* - Sat Sep 05 12:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) allowed a hand to ascend to rest atop his head. "Uh..heh." He laughed uneasily, as he wasn't expecting that. "So what are you guys up to?" He inquired, diverting the topic.* - Sat Sep 05 13:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) narrows his eyes as he transitions them to the earth in front of them.. "Just uh..regular sparring?" He said as he looked back towards her, forming an innocent grin upon his lips. HE didn't know what else to say.* - Sat Sep 05 13:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) was honestly surprised that she agreed to the spar, given her quiet and conserved nature before this. Yan was excited and so as she squared up, so did he. He kept his hands suspended before him, and unraveled, as he was more into forming seals than throwing punches. He didn't know if he should start, or how to start and so he would urge her to instead. ."Uh, show me what you got!" He said aloud, a grin forming upon his lips that took on a more competitive note.|* - Sat Sep 05 13:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) began forming seals then. Once she brandished the kunai, Yan would deduce what sort of spar this would be. That being said, the string of seals performed were accurate and fast. He would breeze through the entire string within a second, molding the chakra as a result as the technique would come into fruition. Two plumes of smoke manifested on either side of him, billowing and expanding until the form within them was released from obscurity. From there, the two identical clones of Yan ran up, one remaining in their line of route while the other transitioned to approaching to intercept Aiyana on her way to Yan. That being said, one clone would be in her way directly and the other would be at that clone's side to the north of him. As they came upon her, they wouldn't attack quite yet.* - Sat Sep 05 13:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) saw a bright light glow within the clone before him, instantaneously it was penetrated and the kunai cleared the girth of the clone's torso. Mud was flung out from the exit wound, whereupon the clone was extinguished into mud which oozed upon the ground. Yan dropped low, narrowly avoiding the elementally-augmented projectile. Even though she had killed one, one kunai wasn't going to be able to hit the other one who was to it's side and not within the trajectory of the kunai. That being said, since she was playing with tools that were meant to kill, Yan would up the antee though not quite to that degree. His clone began forming handseals, simultaneous to him forming his own. The clone would create a mud river which approached her rather quickly. Yan wouldn't release his technique quite yet. He'd see how it played out with the clone who was either to her north or behind her due to her movement.* - Sat Sep 05 13:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) would capitalize on the moment. He had his chakra molded, and kneaded, forming the seals in completion while the earth clone was doing the same. That being said, as he noticed she would stop the clone, he'd release his technique. It couldn't catch her in time to stop her from hitting the clone, although that was the point. The kick penetrated the clone's weak body, though as it moved through she would quickly releaze that it was used more as a restraint than anything. Due to the momentum, she'd push the clone back with her technique and knock him to the ground though still unless she took measures; her leg would be in a thick mud that was intended to slow her down. During the kick, and aimed as she landed, a stream of water would be heading her way. It was a low-level, non-lethal technique but one that if connected would rattle her senses nevertheless.  To further increase the chances of it working, the clone had reformed into conciousness and attempted to grab both of her ankles to prevent her movement.(I'm not sure if they are able to do the last part, but I know it can serve as a restraint. Let me know and we can void the last part if it's not how that works.)* - Sat Sep 05 13:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) nods and smiles. "You were really tryin' to kill me there with that kunai!" He said, letting out an uneasy chuckle.* - Sat Sep 05 14:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) flashed back into his mind of his brother dying, and Edge utilizing the fuuinjutsu that sent him to Konoha through a reverse summon function. That being said, his time in Konoha wasn't by choice and was marked by the feaer of his own death occuring as well. He wouldn't be as cowardly in the future--not anymore. He had to make his brother proud and kill Edge. That being said, she might have noticed his expression take on a more serious composition. "The weather was a bit cold," he'd note. He wished he hadn't even brought it up.* - Sat Sep 05 14:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) also nodded to Dravae in acknowledgement upon his approach.* - Sat Sep 05 14:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) | Yan figured with all of the commotion he would practice his ninjutsu. He'd be sure to utilize it in an area that wasn't occupied as it was one that had killing potential. With his hands together, seals were forming as a result. His speed in forming handseals transitioned quickly from one to the next until the final seal was created, thereby molding the chakra into the proper form. He also ensured his chakra alignment to earthern orientation through nature transformation.
\
\ Lastly he released the function of the technique, and the area before him was the concentrated area. Within the diameter of the effected area, four narrow spikes of earth protruded from the ground. They were at separate points, and each one was angled to come together into a single point where his opponent would theoretically be skewered in place. 
\
\As he performed the technique, he contemplated the manner in which he would trap his opponent into the position where dodging was difficult and chances of connection would be maximized. Using his general specialization of that specific technique, preparing a trap would be much easier. The thoughts were further pondered upon as he would prepare to perform the technique again.|* - Sat Sep 05 15:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) |Yan was pleased with the results of the technique, yet he wasn't accustom to feeling the drain of chakra that it required. He knew he'd have to train with it more in order to acquire a mastery of it which would allow him to perform it with less of a drain. He had a mass of chakra, but such would be dwindled at a rate he was not comfortable with at this point. That being said, his hands came together again.
\
\The quick succession of seals being formed one after another was quite impressive. In fact, without enhanced sight, one might only perceive a blur as digits contorted and angled to form the seals required. At the end of the seal, whereupon all preparations were complete that were required to perform the technique, he would then allow the technique to come into full fruition as he proceeded with his training.\
\
Four spikes would protrude from the ground, the previous ones having retracted back into the earth. As before, they would surround a diameter and as they progressed from the interior--they would be angled inward to all come to a certain point and meet. The technique allowed alot of damage to be induced, as multiple organs would be in the trajectory with four different entrance points formed.
\
\As he performed his technique, he would watch Dravae and was content to know he wasn't the subject of his experiment. He'd shake his head as he finished the technique, as by this point almost a tenth of his chakra had been taken up by two techniques. It had been a while that such a drain ha d been placed upon him. It wasn't ready for battle, unless the connection was ensured.|* - Sat Sep 05 15:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) |Yan had an idea, but he'd have to go into a more open area to do it. And so he did. He moved south of everyone and began performing the technique again. He would rip through the handseals of each one with quick precision until the last one was formed, thereby kneading and molding the chakra into the necessary form to become the very technique he was practicing. 
\
\As a result of his technique's creation, a plume of smoke would ignite to his side until the expansion of the smoke eventually made it imperceptible--leaving a clone in the wake of it. Once that was done, he would nod to the bunshin and they would both string handseals together with Yan lagging behind the clone to allow him time to perform the first part.
\
\The clone would finish their technique, which would cause the four spikes to protrude in an angle coming together to a singular point again, while Yan would complete his seals as his theoretical opponent would have dodged. With Yan's own chakra kneaded and molded, aligned to earthern orientation--his own technique would come into fruition as he yet again pushed the boundaries of his strategy.
\
\The spikes would then shoot from the ground, aimed in the diretions they were facing to fly into the air. A dodging opponent would likely be air-bourne, and as a result, sending these as projectiles afterward would increase their chance of skewering the opponent in the event he was able to dodge. As it was performed, Yan found that it was a great idea but one that would only be used in situations where he had to kill his opponent for sure.| * - Sat Sep 05 15:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence)  | Yan had one more attempt in him. He'd be sure to utilize it in an area that wasn't occupied as it was one that had killing potential. With his hands together, seals were forming as a result. His speed in forming handseals transitioned quickly from one to the next until the final seal was created, thereby molding the chakra into the proper form. He also ensured his chakra alignment to earthern orientation through nature transformation.
\
\ Lastly he released the function of the technique, and the area before him was the concentrated area. Within the diameter of the effected area, four narrow spikes of earth protruded from the ground. They were at separate points, and each one was angled to come together into a single point where his opponent would theoretically be skewered in place. 
\
\As he performed the technique, he contemplated the manner in which he would trap his opponent into the position where dodging was difficult and chances of connection would be maximized. Using his general specialization of that specific technique, preparing a trap would be much easier. The thoughts were further pondered upon as he would prepare to perform the technique again.* - Sat Sep 05 15:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) " | "Speaking of which," the young genin said as he proceeded forward as to gain distance between himself and those ambient to him. Illuminated green optics peered over the expanse of sand before him to eventually settle his vision upon a specific area within that field. "Time to train my new combination technique~!" He said, his voice raising in enthusiasm as he clasped his hands together. With heightened speed, he streamed through a short string of seals before ending on the final one.
\
\Two plumes of smoke bursted into animation on either side of him. Their billowing commotion eventually expanded until imperceptible whereupon two likenesses of Yan were revealed. With that done, Yan began performing another set of seals. As before, they were quick and performed in succession precisely. As for his other clones, one bursted into a run forward whereas the other began forming seals as well with a minute amount of lag between Yan's seals and the clones.
\
\As his chakra was molded through the creation of handseals, earthern spears pierced the sands. There were a total of four, each one distanced from each other yet angled to conjoin at a point. THe function of the jutsu was intended to skewer, of course; there were agile ninja that would undoubtedly dodge this..As the technique finished, the clones would come into play.
\
\By this time, the clone which darted forward would leap over the Spikes, as its intention would be to engage the ninja as they avoided the spikes. Simultaneously, the completion of handseals for the other clone would cause the second technique to come into fruition. That being said, the clone slammed his palm into the ground thereby allowing him to manipulate the spears of earth that were inanimate to this point.
\
\The spears would project in their respective directions, and as intended, one of the spikes would skewer the clone which would theoretically be running distraction. The idea was to force the opponent into dodging, then fighting in the midst not allowing them to fully transition to being able to dodge again. And then with the second technique, dodging was minimalized and damage would be maximized as the momentum of the projectile would make it easily conceived to penetrate the opponent.|* - Sun Sep 06 15:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) |Yan was feeling his proficiency with his new techniques becoming more and more attuned to what he desired when the time come to utilize them in combat. They were ready now, yet he felt they could be pushed further toward efficiency and power. That being said, he prepared to performing the very same combo which he had done before. Streaming through a string of seals again, he would perform the clone technique yet again as clouds of smoke billowed and dissipated from expansion to leave two likenesses of the young ninja once again. With that said, the same would happen as before.
\
\Both Yan and one of the clones would commit to a string, though again the clone lagged behind. Yan created the original spears as his ninjutsu as opposed to his clones were considerably stronger. THat being said, the manipulation wouldn't need as potent ninjutsu as  creating the actual spears. The other clone would charge forward, preparing to engage the opponent. Yan finished his seals, kneading and molding his chakra to the right degree as he prepared to unleash his ninjutsu.
\
\The earthern spears were erected, protruding from the sand and as before, each one was angled inward toward one another to penetrate his opponent's body multiple times to increase destructive power. Additionally, with the clone lagging behind in seals, he would finish just as the spears were completely constructed whereupon he slammed his hand into the ground--forcing the spears into animation as they shot in their respective directions to skewere the dodging opponent.
\
\The other clon e would be in the air at this time, engaging what would assumingly be an air-bourne opponent. The earthern spear, or one of them, would rip through the clone and theoretically his opponent. The other spears would be useful if there were multiple opponents, or an army, which he could inflict many casualties utilizing this combination.|* - Sun Sep 06 15:54:14 2015
