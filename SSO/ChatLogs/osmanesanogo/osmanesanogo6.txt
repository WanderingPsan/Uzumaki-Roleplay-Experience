<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: But Ivel, the Kazakage might actually kill Aza, for Mistunara whispered it to her, and didn't let him know Aza was drunk. - Tue Nov 17 02:51:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Mhm. - Tue Nov 17 02:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) gave a cheeky smile. He'd get into his normal gentle fist stance, easing into it. He was a master at it, odd at his age. Then again, he didn't naturally obtain the Byakugans within his eyes, nor did he learn Gentle Fist the normal way. He'd say "Once I do it, try and break it." He'd start to release his chakra from his body and being to expell it.

Once it was expelled, he'd start to spin, creating a dark blue hue of chakra, shielding him, but also dealing somewhat of an offensive threat. He'd wait for Ivel to try and take it down. He'd give a small cackle within his dome, something that Ivel likely could not hear.* - Tue Nov 17 02:59:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: Right here? - Tue Nov 17 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Sure. - Tue Nov 17 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: Umm, alright? - Tue Nov 17 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Let's see it. - Tue Nov 17 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) was surely confident that Ivel, someone he thought of as his older brother, more so than his adoptive Hokuma clan family, would not be powerful enough to even dent his chakra sphere. It'd be very much to his surprise when a fiery fist would clash it with it, causing it rupture and slightly explode in the form of a mild expelling of chakra, before fading away.

Ivel would probably be moved back a few feet, likely still standing while Shira would be knocked more than a few feet,  and on the ground. Like how in a anime the villian gets knocked back but is still standing but the hero gets flung unto the ground.

Shira would have gotton up and said "Ivel! Your so strong. Izanami doesn't want to train me, do you want to be my master?" He'd be interrupted by Hassan. "Kazakage, don't believe Mitsunara. She's a big fat liar." He'd pin down his Fuma Shuriken and use it to regain his footing. Being flung isn't something many six years can take easily.* - Tue Nov 17 03:10:43 2015
