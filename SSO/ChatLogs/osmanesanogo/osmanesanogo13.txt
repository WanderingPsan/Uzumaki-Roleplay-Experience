<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Osmanesanogo) sighed as he grabbed his hips. In front of him, there was not one, not two, but three academy students. He'd give a mellow face as he wrote down, "Class, today you'll be learning about Henge. Henge is the transformation. If done correctly, it can be a very useful skill." He'd hand the note to the children and give one more sigh. 

He'd demonstrate the technique to the children. After a series of failures because of the children, he'd individually show each of them the movement and signs and how to use it in variety of ways. Afterwards, he'd go and listen to Trilliam.* - Fri Nov 27 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Osmanesanogo) sighed once again. He'd weave a few handseals, and use his Mud slide in order to create a stable foundation. The Mud would quickly harden, and create a large amount of mass, making a house like-figure. It was of higher quality than expected, due to his high control and mastery of the justu. He'd place the walls with higher mud. The mud would turn into Solid Rock soon afterwards. Just to add something, small glimmers of gold was in the rock. Only small amount. Maybe 0.00000001 amounts for every 1 solid stream of mud.

He'd sigh a bit. He'd look towards Trilliam, since he did his job.* - Fri Nov 27 21:05:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Osmanesanogo) wrote a note and passed it to Kana. "Hello. Are you from here?" He couldn't talk, unless there was exactly one person around, and that person was their best friend, which means only one person could hear him talk. He didn't have one, and probably never will.* - Fri Nov 27 23:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Osmanesanogo) Unfortatunely for the little Kuro, he had no Suimen. This was going to be a very grueling task for the boy, as he normally focused only on his ninjustu. He'd clentch his teeth and say "Let's do this." He'd begin the task with an eagar demenanor. The boy had alot to go through, but having a smile through it all would help him in the end. He'd start climbing the rock.

He was at the beginning part of the rock. The rock formation was very large indeed. This task was going to be one of the most daring phyiscal challenges he had to do. He'd continue his endurance of the climbing. This, this was going to be hard, his hands begun to bleed already. He'd persevere and continue his rocky adventure. The adventure, which was no where near the end, was going to help him in the long run.

He was about 3% up the mountain at this point, bleeding slighty more than before. He'd be hit by the pebbles, being stopped and dropping for a small point of time before continue. He'd get angry. Really angry. He'd use this as momentum and charge up. His hands were seemingly starting to bleed less, showing how his body was adapting to physical stress and physical activites.

He'd look up. Eiji was no where near sight at this point. He'd begin to cry, though nobody could hear him at the point, without some hearing perks. He'd continue to gruel through the painful mountains, climbing up and up and up, hoping that the end was near. He'd gave a quick shout saying "I won't quit!" He'd continue his mountain journey, hopefully in bliss, yeah right.

(MARKER 5) At this point, Kuro was nearly exhausted. He'd be climbing with a single hand, using the other to drink water with nutrients. It tasted like literal bull shit. He'd hear Eiji's constant taunts, as he punched the walls. He'd drop the rest of the water and begin darking up. Any time some sharp rock would pierce his hands, he'd use Gold to destory it. He was pissed at this point.

He'd sigh a bit at his current performance. His eyes glimmered, and begun to dull up a bit. He was losing hope. He'd continue his grueling adventure during the daring mountains, giving a pessmistic outlook on him finishing this. He'd climb, climb, and climb some more. He'd hear Eiji's words and stop. He'd try to fly on his Gold, just like he had seen Jiki of the Iron Sand do many months ago. It'd fail miserably as he nearly plummeted to his death, luckily, he formed a pile of Gold to fully cushion his blow. He'd need to learn how to fly with his Gold at some point of time.* - Fri Nov 27 23:25:52 2015
