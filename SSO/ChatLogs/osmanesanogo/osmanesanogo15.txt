<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Osmanesanogo) weaved some handseals. He wanted them to come closer. The sand around both of them would begin to form into a coffin. If they couldn't escape fast enough, the regular sand around them would force them into a coffin. He didn't use his gold sand just yet, while the clones were just chilling.* - Sun Nov 29 20:00:12 2015

Normally, Hiroshi would break through the 34 Gold Sand, but .. He had his clone imbue it with Earth Chakra for the spar, meaning it had a total defense of 68! The Sand would form into a tentacle and try to knock Hiroshi far back away from his. Meanwhile the two clones would form handseals at the coffin'd Momura and shoot Shurikens aiming at her eyes.* - Sun Nov 29 20:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Osmanesanogo) | | Yeah. Momura was caught, while Hiroshi went for a punch. A Clone would throw Shurikens aiming for her eyes, while the other jumped in the way of Hiroshi, and took the brunt. Not only did it take the brunt, but the clone would have reformed into a mud binding unto Hiroshi. Meanwhile, while the Shadow Clones were doing there thing, Kuro would be moving back and weaved a handseal to use Sand Shuriken on the binded Hiroshi.* - Sun Nov 29 20:29:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuro(Osmanesanogo) Even though in normal circumstances, that avoid rp may have not worked, since it was a spar, he'd let it go. Meanwhile, Kuro not being able to fully avoid his attack did something. He'd make his sand shoot 6 shuriken at Hiroshi. If Hiroshi connected the hit, he'd be hit by all six, each aiming at a limb (Right Arm, Left arm, Back, left leg, right leg, head.) But if he receeded his punch, and try and evade, there was a hefty chance that'd he'd only be hit by one. All of the shuriken were lethally strong and may of severely crippled him if not kill him if he lacked suffiencient ninjustu defense.* - Sun Nov 29 20:46:17 2015
