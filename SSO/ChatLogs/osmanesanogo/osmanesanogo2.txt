<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) le socked on le head. He'd give it a quick rumble. He'd put his hand on Chikyu's shoulder. "Chickenru, I know you have Opposite-Gynophobia, but that's not reason to hit your best friend ... Without telling him the game!" So, Shira needs a bit a common sense, mhm mhm. He'd assume it was a game, from the head hit. From Chikyu's Head Hit, at least.* - Sun Nov  8 19:12:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) had two choices. He try and dodge it, be discovered, and possibly targetted. That was an option. The other option was to take it and play it off. He'd slightly bring up one hand to soften the blow. He'd drop to the ground and roll around a bit, before looking at Chikyu. He'd give her a cheeky smile, and said in a croaked tone because of you know, the attack 

"Heh heh, that's a fun game Chickenru. How do you win?"* - Sun Nov  8 19:29:04 2015

He'd bring up his Fuma Shuriken in time, blocking said kick and rolling over to stand up. "True true. Chickenru is right. You are strong!" His mind near fully forgetting about Chikyu entirely.* - Sun Nov  8 19:46:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) was reading a book. It was the epilougue at this point. He was reading about the author and how she acted. "Tamako is a harsh child, she is strict with her subordinates in the gang however that is only to promote efficiency. All her life strictness was beaten into her, the girl only knew this way for a long time however she practiced it in moderation. Her subordinates were her world, they were there to hold her when nobody would, they were her true family unlike that pighead of a father who only liked cruel things and took things to the extreme. She remembers faces easily, she never forgets the faces of those Hyuuga who agreed with her father's ways. When thinking of them her blood boils, almost spurring her to act against them. Only with some good self control saved her from a rash decision, she tried to learn more patience. 

Their time will come but for now she only observed, looking for any weak spots. Observation required a great deal of patience, in her line of work this guided her next step to planning. Most of her raids were successful thanks to these combinations, patience, observation and planning. Running a whole secret organization made her diligent, in this line of work if they were to be discovered by other Hyuugas it would mean severe punishment even for her, a member of the main house. When something came up quick decision was made, always prepared for that possibility has made her paranoid. Tamako would distrust everyone not included inside her inner-circle which contained just a few closes workers. Always doubting what others say, making investigations about the truth here and there.

Why was she so paranoid? Her mother was killed with largely unknown motives and the whole crime was well hidden, the girl always suspected her father knew she was there on that day only didn't care enough to move against her yet only heir. Even for him killing an heir would have been dangerous. Tamako had little friends, most them were older than her with the exception of Midori, her little sister separated by 5 years difference, the rest were the Hyuuga branch members and gang members. Despite not having much success finding friends she tries to talk to people outside of the gang and Hyuuga mansion however her eyes were often the reason other kids kept distance. Raiding together with all of them, not caring for any laws she was called brave, was she brave though? Tamako never considered herself as such, if she was brave Herron would be long dead.

Whenever possible, Tamako thinks logically. Planning was her thing, there were always steps to these and forgetting even one detail means failure. She always took it personally when they failed in a raid, her studies indicated that the leader was usually at fault. Being a clever little girl she learnt from her mistakes, the next time was always better and more prepared. However sometimes her mood swings were unbearable, this was mainly due to puberty, her hormones constantly change and the anger coupled with pressure didn't help at all. She was never the type to just explode but instead took it quietly, generally being more mouthy and vulgar. Later in her teen she would keep this vulgar language, even when speaking with some important people, her father was an exception. Around him she still pretended to fall for his disciple, he often didn't look at her face anyways, when he did she thought about striking right where he stood.

Even this girl could be sweet however, her sister also received harsh treatment, one could say even more so because being born second was a bad thing from where they belonged to. Tamako was a good bigger sister to Midori, treating her how everyone should a child and not some tool. Both girls played together a lot when Tamako was not busy, time was a rare commodity however. The sister liked to sneak off from the mansion at night to visit a local park. Taking strolls and learning about the beauty of the land that bore many wonderful things such as herbs and animals. Never has she forgotten Midori's birthday, never was Midori left without a gift of some value. Of course they never obtained anything from their father, just maybe a nod or so. Outside of Midori she was less inclined to speak, always deep in thought, others thought she was daydreaming." He'd close his book. He doesn't understand women at all no he does not.* - Sun Nov  8 22:59:50 2015

When Ivel walked in, he'd see Izanami trying to sneak attack Shira, and Izanami pushing him to safety.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) remeber that paper he put down? Yeah. It'd start to glow, as he moved diagonally. He'd be able to dodge, espically with his byakugan, the time it'd take for her to come. Unless she decided to persue him of course, but that would result in her taking more damage. The glowing paper was .. a dimmed down explosive tag. It'd just make a few crackles and pops. In a few words, it was a feint. 

In the mean time, if he did dodge, he'd drop his Fuma Shuriken in front of him, so an attack could be prevented.
