<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kuro(Osmanesanogo) opened his hand. Gold would formulate in his hand and shoot at the stone. Normally a small shuriken would not do anything, but Kuro was oddly strong. The shuriken would be deeply lodged inside of the rock, and cutting a small shuriken shape hole it in. Nobody would see him form it, without a sight perk. It'd be likely everyone assume it was just a custom gold shuriken.* - Fri Nov 27 17:36:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kuro(Osmanesanogo) sighed a bit. He'd gain momentum and do a running kick towards the rock. He'd fall miserably. He'd repeat it twice, tweaking his move and failing much less. On the fourth try, and it was as if he was half decent at this point. His eyes felt like he could do better.

He'd write a note "Is that it?"

He'd kick the rock again, after passing the note.

Again!* - Fri Nov 27 17:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kuro(Osmanesanogo) Sighed. He'd continue it. At this point, he was oddly mastering it, to a point where he might be able to teach others about it. He was obviously an immeasurably fast learner, for at the 8th kick, he was near the level of an expert using the technique. He'd continue with his 9th kick. The rock moved 1/1000 of an inch. He wasn't powerful taijustu wise, but his mastery with the technique aided him grandly.

He'd be the the twevleth kick, fully mastering it. He'd learn it, and master it.
He'd write a note asking "Is there something else?"* - Fri Nov 27 17:52:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kuro(Osmanesanogo) Once again, he'd run up, and use Dyanmic Entry. He'd make the move his own, by adding a spin to the kick, increasing the total damage.

Is there something else, or should I come back later on?"* - Fri Nov 27 18:22:04 2015
