He got up, shaking his legs, trying to regain his footing from the shock of the attack. He tried to play it off "Heh heh. Just letting my future student get a hands on." He slowly walked up to him, and got of his stance and layed unto the ground, two steps away before he could fully make it. "Yaaa. Just decided to take a nap here." He in reality collapsed.

Inuzuka DNA is useless too, since it isnt a kekkai gankai, but rather Hiden, hidden moves taught. If they wanted something rare, they'd litterally have to be taught by him, the only one in Sunakagure. Dying as a Shinobi was no biggie, but it would suck after all.* - Sun Nov  8 04:35:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*[Moldy Cauliflower](Osmanesanogo) in his last moment's since Root sealing only stopped his external movements (It doesn't stop all movement, if it did, it'd stop my heart and auto kill, which it doesnt). He'd chomp on the ball, letting it spread out within his body, some expelling from the hole, but the majority going in his body, tainting his body. If he were cooked into a pizza and eaten, he'd kill the eater, unless they had some type of good durability. (ask zeno). Together, it'd both kill him.* - Sun Nov  8 05:21:42 2015
