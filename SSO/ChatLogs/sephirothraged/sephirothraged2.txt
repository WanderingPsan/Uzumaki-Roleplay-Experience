<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) grins and clambers up, smiling wide as she climbs onto her mothers back, giggling as she braces herself there.

"Yah huh!"* - Fri Dec 11 22:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) smiles warmly from atop her mothers shoulders, blinking... then nods, smiling.

"Ahh, hai! Vanilla!"* - Fri Dec 11 22:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) hums gently, as she licks her ice cream and walks along- smiling peacefully as she looks over the square, and simply radiating childish innocence.

"Mrm..." She murmurs- no words escaping her as she focuses on her ice cream, mostly.* - Fri Dec 11 22:55:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) would, while her parents where both out of the house- practice with the trick her mother taught her, a gleam of glee bright in her eyes. She's still proud she was taught it, after all; feeling warm and hapyp inside at her achievement in managing it a whole year before academy admittance.

So she practices it- just trying to get a handle on controlling the flow of chakra through her body, really... wanting to be ready as she can possibly be for the academy.

"I /will/ make my parents proud.."* - Sat Dec 12 00:50:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) looks up- smiling gently. Her face was, mere moments ago, screwed up into absolute concentration; focused intently... but now she's smiling warmly.

"Ah.. hai!"* - Sat Dec 12 14:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) hums peacefully as they walk out to the Arena- occasionally pausing to scrunch up her face in focus, as she works on her- currently still quite poor- chakra control for the sake of that one technique she's been taught early- flushing her circuits slowly and steadily, again and again; scrunching up her face as they walk out.

"Mrm..."* - Sat Dec 12 14:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: How far along are you with the technique I taught you? - Sat Dec 12 14:35:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) smiles brightly- momentarily breaking focus as she turns to smile happily at her mother.

"Hey... can I start spending more time out of the house, on my own, now that I'm a bit older?" She asks softly- before nodding and turning her attention to the spar.. as she continues to quietly form the Kai seal and flush her circuits; practicing the theory, without actually moving her chakra, this time; forming the seal, running her mind through the exercise, and drilling herself silently on Genjutsu.* - Sat Dec 12 14:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mmm..... - Sat Dec 12 14:41:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: You can go first. - Sun Dec 13 04:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) is, as they enter the Arena, sat at it's edge in the sand. She's alone- her mother having gone to bed by now, but herself having headed out after her mother was asleep.

She's humming as she sits on the edge of the Arena, leaning on the wall- a cute little four year old with raven black hair, the tips dyed red. Around her neck is an old, worn burgandy scarf; and she's clad in simple lavender clothes.

She's holding the Kai seal as they walk up- her brow furrowed in focus as she practices and hones her chakra control with that basic technique- but she looks up.

"Huh..?" She murmurs, as she looks towards the two individuals about to spar.

"Whatcha doin?"* - Sun Dec 13 04:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) looks up from her practice, dropping the Kai seal to stare in wonder at the two adult Ninja fighting.

"Ooh.."* - Sun Dec 13 04:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) stares on- eyes wide. The interplay between the two far more experienced Ninja- the weapons, the manuvears..her eyes flicker between the two quietly- little onyx orbs resting on them each in turn, as she quietly practices the Kai manuvear again- as if checking to make sure she is in the real world..

"....Mom and dad never showed me anything like /this/.." She murmurs softly.* - Sun Dec 13 04:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) starse quietly onwards, a gleam in her eyes. The jutsu used are few- but all of them new to her. The movements are fluid and swift- she can't follow them except in the form of seeing blurs of movement and activity, a gasp escaping her.

"Wowww.."* - Sun Dec 13 04:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) stares on- as the battle seems to end.

She gasps queitly, as she stands up and quietly walsk forwards.

"Woww... That.. was.. so.. COOL!" The tiny child says energetically as she runs up, giggling happily.* - Sun Dec 13 05:13:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) scratches her head as she looks on- blinking a few times as she looks on....

"Ah.... huh..?" She murmurs- as she realizes she has been mostly ignored, so far... * - Sun Dec 13 05:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Come on, I'll tell you about it. - Sun Dec 13 05:39:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) turns and smiles at them gently.

"Ah... I'm Ketsuki Ryouto!" She says brightly, waving at the two women. "I was just.. sitting out here, practicing Kai because my mom taught me it a while back- but then I saw your fight and.. Wow! Ah... It was really cool, mhrm!" She says brightly.* - Sun Dec 13 05:42:08 2015

As she licks the lolipop and begins to suck on it, humming.* - Sun Dec 13 05:48:06 2015
