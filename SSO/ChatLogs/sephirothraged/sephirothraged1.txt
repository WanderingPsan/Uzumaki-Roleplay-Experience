<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) stirs from atop her sleeping mother. Her cheek is pressed against Mizora's, and they are both asleep underneath a brown blanket- just their heads peeking out... until Ai speaks after entering, and the adorable baby stirs, yawning.

"Myah..?"* - Wed Dec  9 02:33:10 2015

"Daddyy! Dattebayo!" The tiny baby says with a giggle, arms spread wide.* - Wed Dec  9 02:37:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) giggles as her slow little baby hands bat at her fathers big adult hands- the struggle against the titan that is her father compared to her epic in her mind, and adorable in all others.* - Wed Dec  9 02:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) giggles at the nose rub- smiling broadly and reaching to wap her father weakly on the cheeks, before nodding.

"Hai, hai! Ketsuki good!" She says cheerfully- the tiny red rose hairclip that Chikyu gave her still in her tiny black hair.* - Wed Dec  9 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) shakes her head and giggles, pulling on her fathers cheeks and stretching them out as much as her meager strength can.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) makes it as a sleepy, gentle sound, as she sways within her mothers lap- sitting on her mother's lap, and leaning her head into her father's belly- yawning sleepily.* - Wed Dec  9 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) pushes herself up back into sitting upright, pushing off of her fathers belly and stretching.

"Jes.. drowsy.."* - Wed Dec  9 03:33:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) is, around now, a four year old child, leaning against the side of the couch and smiling. She never did get rid of that rose hairclip- it's still sitting in her, now notably longer, soft, straight black hair. She's a toddler, now- and she's getting the hang of speech and walking, as of late..* - Wed Dec  9 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) thinks for a moment, then turns with a peaceful smile as she nods slightly, hands clasped over her lap as she speaks. Her voice is soft and gentle; peaceful, even- with a firm note of certainty.

"Ah...I've thought about it... yeah."* - Wed Dec  9 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) shrugs gently... scratching her head quietly and adjusting the rose pin.

"Ah.. I think I would like to.... yeah, just like mommy and daddy.." She says with a gentle smile.* - Wed Dec  9 21:07:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) leans back against the couch, thoughtfully tilting her head to the side.

"Ah... I hope I'm good at it... I don't want to dissapoint anyone.."* - Wed Dec  9 21:12:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) scratches her head and smiles sheepishly, thinking quietly. She knows it's odd to ask for- but it is the early morning, so... maybe she can get away with it, she thinks to herself.

"Ah... Pancakes?"* - Wed Dec  9 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) smiles gently. She seems to have been reading a picture book about a rabbit and a turtle, while she waited for her mother to finish the food. She bows her head gently as the woman approaches- smiling peacefully as she slides over to the table to sit down.

She bows her head before eating- and speaks softly.

"Ah.. thank you." She says- beaming happily as she goes for the food; and begins to eat with the voracious appetite of a growing young lass with a high metabolism.* - Wed Dec  9 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: No need to bow; you're welcome though.~ - Wed Dec  9 21:57:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) shrugs, sheepishly rubbing her head. She's a quiet child, on the whole- and while she want's to strike up a conversation, she isn't sure what to talk about, really- leading to an awkward silence as she rubs the back of her head..* - Wed Dec  9 22:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) turns- smiling gently.. and nods, shifting over to lean her head against her mother's shoulder as she hugs her from the side- always happy to cuddle.

"Ah... nice and warm.." She murmurs softly.* - Wed Dec  9 22:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) gently snuggles into her mothers side- sighing happily.

"Ah... I love you, Mom.." She murmurs gently. "..Hey, mom..? Why is dad so busy all the time..?"* - Wed Dec  9 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) nods slowly, thinking quietly as she relaxes peacefully.

"Mrm.... Ah... so daddy is someone important, then?"* - Wed Dec  9 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mhm. All ninja are important, but Ai's one of the more important ones. - Wed Dec  9 23:01:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) scratches her head, smiling as she thinks- then dropping her finger on the golden yellow flower; the one that has a smiley face drawn onto it!

"Ah... I think that one!" She says brightly.* - Thu Dec 10 21:20:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) hums calmly- ending most lessons with either Mom-Sama or Mom-Sensei, almost playfully so; finding it amusing with how mom is already a title, to attach extra honorifics to it* - Thu Dec 10 21:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) hums gently as she shifts to sit in her mother's lap, leaning back and smiling gently.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: I wasn't playing when I said I wanted to become the strongest. I'll take whatever I can get. If I have to break a few bones, then so be it.  - Fri Dec 11 21:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) hums as she sits on the bench- a little four and a half year old, with a soft lavender coat and a burgundy red scarf wrapped around her neck. She is sitting there- cross legged, smiling gently... humming.* - Fri Dec 11 21:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) hums softly, a peaceful smile on her face as the four-and-a-half year old walks out into the 'arena' towards her mother, waving happily.

"Haii!"* - Fri Dec 11 21:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) smiles happily- warmly embracing her mother back. She squeezes gently, before letting go and nodding warmly, smiling gently as she looks up at her mother- nodding slightly.

"Ah... hai! Sure, mommy!" She says brightly, little onyx orbs gleaming brightly as she gives her mom a great big peace sign with her right hand.

"Hahh! I'll do real good!"* - Fri Dec 11 21:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mmk.. - Fri Dec 11 21:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) nods slowly- soaking in her mother's words attentively and quietly. She scratches her head a few times- trying to puzzle out exactly what the older woman means... but she does her best to attentively listen; her general inclination being a studious one, after all.

"Ah.... I... think I get it?" She says- squinting about. "Chakra is this stuff in your body, Tenketsu is the word for the places you push it out... and you do magic with your chakra?" She says- scratching her head. "Andd... it all flows through your body- like uhm.. a river?" She says- squinting curiously.* - Fri Dec 11 21:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mhm. - Fri Dec 11 21:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: The release of genjutsu involves halting the flow of your chakra completely, then suddenly surging it. - Fri Dec 11 21:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Genjutsu relies heavily on the flow of chakra, because it deters the flow of it within the target it's used on. - Fri Dec 11 21:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) nods slowly, frowning slightly as she thinks about what her mother is saying. It's heady stuff for a child; complicated in concept, even if the reality of the situation is really quite simple. So she screws up her little face, and nods slowly- thinking quietly.

"And.. Genjutsu... that's the word for illusions, right? So.... you stop your chakra, to stop the bad Genjutsu chakra from changing what you see, but..." She squints a little- frowning as she scratches her head.

"Why does messing with your chakra change what you're seeing? How does that even work, if chakra is your energy..? I don't get why it works that way.." She says, frowning as she scratches her tiny little chin.

"And.. if your chakra is your bodies energy, does stopping it hurt?"* - Fri Dec 11 21:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Your chakra regulates through your system like your blood. It's only natural that a hinderance of it would hinder your ability to  - Fri Dec 11 21:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Perceive properly. - Fri Dec 11 21:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: It doesn't hurt to break genjutsu. - Fri Dec 11 21:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) says: Okay.. - Fri Dec 11 21:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Alright.. watch closley now. - Fri Dec 11 21:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) nods slowly, as her mother tells her to watch closely. She pays attention quietly- noting the single handseal performed as she tries to adjust her hands into the same symbol- having a bit of trouble pulling of the complex handseal, at first.

"...Ah... so how do I..?" She inquires- unable to see any of the chakra manipulation going on- just the strange hand symbol.* - Fri Dec 11 21:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) thinks: Mmm... - Fri Dec 11 21:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) is a reasonably quick learner, but has a habit of questioning literally everything she is told- showing a fervent curiosity as she listens to each lecture. Physically, she is less than impressive- showing little attention to physical training, comapred to her voracious curiosity when it came to everything else.

Still- she listens attentively and eagerly.

And eventually, they are back in the Arena- and she's smiling gently.

"Ah... what now?"* - Fri Dec 11 21:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Now that that's out of the way, how do you feel about trying out genjutsu breaking? - Fri Dec 11 21:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) scratches her head, nodding slightly, smiling gently.

"Ah.... I'd like to try, mhrm!"* - Fri Dec 11 21:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) nods slowly- squinting as she smiles at her mother- and then nods. Her chakra control might be decent for her age- but compared to any adult it is, for now..? Slipshod and poor; abysmal, even.

She winces as she forms the handseal and attempts to stop her chakra- and while she briefly slows the flow... it just returns to normal on it's own..

"Ah.."* - Fri Dec 11 21:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) sighs- waiting a while.. breathing in and out. She centers herself- calming herself as best she can. She does her best to stop herself from throwing a fit- calming herself intently....

And then, she tries again- halting the flow of her chakra this time.. but having trouble surging it back into place, as it rather seems to simply slowly drift back into proper place.

She sighs in frustration- taking another few moments to calm. Her chakra reserves are tiny- so it takes a few before she feels ready... but once more- she attempts the technique; and this time... a surge of chakra fills her after she shuts herself down- and leaves her feeling lightheaded, her stores mostly emptied by that simple technique..!

"Oy vey.."* - Fri Dec 11 22:02:36 2015
