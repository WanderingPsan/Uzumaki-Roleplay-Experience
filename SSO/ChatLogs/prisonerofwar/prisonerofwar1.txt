<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) made an entrance at cavern walls of the village. The battle raged on as the girl softly approached. She was lost for words, she was not too accustom to quite the gruesome scene.

"W-What? " She mumbled to herself.* - Wed Sep 02 22:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) was late to join but the as the flaming debri filled the sky, she would attempt her best to quickly head for cover. She used the nearby wall as she places her back on it.

<What did i walk into > She thinks.* - Wed Sep 02 22:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) takes a seat on the wooden bench.* - Sat Sep 05 00:21:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) approached the group

"Excuse me " She says onto them.* - Sat Sep 05 00:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) spoke the latter word with a rather weird tone.* - Sat Sep 05 00:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) looks over towards the vested individual She gets closer 

" Ushinawa is what ? "* - Sat Sep 05 00:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) glances over towards Dravae. She listen in to what he had to say about Hiru. Was it the same Hiru she was talking about?* - Sat Sep 05 00:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) shook her head from the thoughts running through her mind. She complained about others falling into a trance but here she was doing the same. She lowers her gaze towards the ground before turning around and heading over towards the bench on the other side. She takes a seat.* - Sat Sep 05 01:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) keeps walking as if nothing.* - Sat Sep 05 01:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) turns to look at him straight into his eyes.* - Sat Sep 05 01:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Hey. - Sat Sep 05 11:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) glances over towards Ushinawa as he takes a seat. She then shifts her glance towards the Horizon.* - Sat Sep 05 11:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: Yes, Brother? - Sat Sep 05 11:25:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: I need to bring you up to speed. - Sat Sep 05 11:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: There was a war in your absence. - Sat Sep 05 11:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Kirigaure is most likely hunting me, oh, and yeah... - Sat Sep 05 11:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: But the fighting force was comprised of my own men. - Sat Sep 05 11:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: We've taken heavy losses but the enemy has been pushed away, and by enemy I mean Zetsumo, essentially Konoha. - Sat Sep 05 11:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: I thought our battle was with the Raikage...To avenge our brother... - Sat Sep 05 11:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Well, several things have happened. - Sat Sep 05 11:31:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: You mean eye techniques? - Sat Sep 05 11:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Doujutsu, some people have white eyes, others red with black tomoe bordering the eye. - Sat Sep 05 11:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: Meaning you...or rather our whole clan. - Sat Sep 05 11:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Indeed. - Sat Sep 05 11:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: But noone knows aside from you, and Zhen. - Sat Sep 05 11:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Of my ability. - Sat Sep 05 11:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: Remind on who is Zhen again. - Sat Sep 05 11:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: The person with white eyes. - Sat Sep 05 11:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Hes' quiet, usually. - Sat Sep 05 11:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: But he's probably one of the strongest people you can meet. - Sat Sep 05 11:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: I see..So what is the plan now. - Sat Sep 05 11:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: We wait for Sunagakure to be stabilized. - Sat Sep 05 11:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: We train. - Sat Sep 05 11:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: But we can trust noone. - Sat Sep 05 11:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: As always. - Sat Sep 05 11:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) clenched her fist as she closes her eyes as the protocol was rather standard. She opened them once more before standing up and whispers to him.


She then turns around and walks off.* - Sat Sep 05 11:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: I don't trust anyone regardless..Not ever since the village. - Sat Sep 05 11:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: I need new clothes.. - Sat Sep 05 11:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Therre are no npcs) - Sat Sep 05 11:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: For clothing) - Sat Sep 05 11:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: (admins need to make thm here) - Sat Sep 05 11:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) could not find anyone so she decided to make use of her own clothing. The Kimono was ripped off and replaced with shorts and long sleeved shirt. She needed to change and adapt as soon as possible.* - Sat Sep 05 11:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) looks down towards the ground as she speaks her mind

" A shinobi is a tool that swears itself to a common practice, they grow and bloom in said practice...only to walk a fine line between backstabbing and blind loyalty "


She shakes her head
" I won't go down like our brother did ".* - Sat Sep 05 11:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) would nod to her brother's wise word. She never looked at him in that way, in fact she always viewed him like any younger sister would. Over protective, bossy and sometimes annoying but in these times...Things change. She matures and see things in a new light.

" Train me...If anyone can watch your back, Then it should be me ".* - Sat Sep 05 12:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) takes the scroll and would looks at it. She was instructed to not work on it and of course maybe it was the degree of diffculty. She would put the scroll away before shaking her head.

" I'm still a novice at using it...I will make it my goal to master it ".* - Sat Sep 05 12:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) felt chills as he spoke. She had no idea what was comign to her but she had to be ready.

" Yes brother "

She would follow the man if he decided to go back into the main part of the village.* - Sat Sep 05 12:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) narrows her eyes at Yan as he approached.* - Sat Sep 05 12:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) looks over at Ushinawa waiting for a reply or a reaction.* - Sat Sep 05 12:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) is a straight up bitch.* - Sat Sep 05 12:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) glances back over towards Yan seeing that Ushi did not reply back. She glances at him from head to toe. She remembers him from the meeting yesterday.

" Are you a Shinobi " She snarls at him.* - Sat Sep 05 12:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: He's okay. - Sat Sep 05 12:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) looks at her brother and then at Yan. It was true, spar were limited for a reason. Skills were shown and sometimes it just went out of hand.

"What kind of spar ".* - Sat Sep 05 13:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) spread her legs as she brings her arms up. She squares up the best she could.

" Alright ".* - Sat Sep 05 13:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) stares at his hands, as the string of handseals begin to form up. A hand reaches into her backpouch to pull out a Kunai. She holds it in place as she rushes forward. 

< Close the distance >

she knew what would happen if she did not get close enough. She would not be able to get close at all.* - Sat Sep 05 13:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) She assumed that techs were going to be used in fact, she was well aware of this and for this reason she did not approve of spars. Unless it was for teaching purposes. She did not stop running as she pulled up the Kunai. It lights up with her chakra. Lightning runs through the metal increasing it's cutting power, She hurls it towards the duo that attempted to intercept her.* - Sat Sep 05 13:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) //
Assuming that clone did not do anything to her as she runs up on them, she would now be within proximity of the earth clone.  She jumps in an attempt to kick the clone while he was attempting make the technique. She would attempt to engage the clone close range hand to hand combat.* - Sat Sep 05 13:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) grunted in anger as she was blasted with the jet of water. She was sent hurling backwards. She sucks her teeth staring at the boy, it seem that she took him too lightly. Ushinawa did commend the boy. She stood up and lifted her hand up vertically.

" I see what my brother was talking about..." She lets out.* - Sat Sep 05 14:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) notice the boy changed his facial expression. Maybe Konoha hit a soft spot? She stayed in silence waiting for him to reply.

"I see " She said


Dravae approaching broke the tension as she glances at him. The usual narrowing of eyes of course, despire him wearing a Headband from this village (?*)* - Sat Sep 05 14:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) glances over towards Orakuro who happend to be looking in her direction.* - Sat Sep 05 15:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) simply narrows her eyes over at Orakuru and Mariana.* - Sat Sep 05 17:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) Turns around and walks off.* - Sat Sep 05 18:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) turns around yet again to walk away.* - Sat Sep 05 18:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) //
The woman's breathing became sporadic. She seem to be getting agitated.

"Tell me where are the other two, huh ? ".* - Sat Sep 05 20:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks
<She seems to be getting the wrong idea, No matter >


Aiyana looks at Mariana from head to toe rather subtletly. Her nose flare ever so lightly has she closes her eyes for the moment before speaking once more.

" I don't trust you, i don't care how long you have been with nor any childrean you bear from him "

She opens her eyes 
" You all will betray Ushinawa if the moment demmands it.." She lets out.* - Sat Sep 05 20:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) turns around and would proceed to walk away.* - Sat Sep 05 20:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) idly watches the transaction taking place.* - Sun Sep 06 17:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) would proceed to walk away from the scene if allowed.* - Sun Sep 06 17:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) glances over at Ushinawa.* - Sun Sep 06 18:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) was feeling very froggy as she notice that Ushinawa did not approach her. She then follows his sight back over towards Tethy's who of couse would now be taking a single step. The Woman trembled ever so slightly as her mind was running a mile a minute.

She waited for something else to happen but that of couse would change as Ushinawa took charge. A Kunai was exposed in her left hand as she narrows her eyes at Tethys. Feet slowly sliding apart as she grit her teeth. She appeared to be mumbling to herself

" Not today.." She mumbles,* - Sun Sep 06 18:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) bite of more than she can chew as she was surprised to how fast things progressed. Her reflexes were not enough to processs the strings of attack. She gasps, hesistant as she was face to face with death or so she thought. The lightning strike from above but of course maybe it collided with his wind shield.

Seeing she was not fast enough to capitalize the moment with a secondary attack, her strikes would of course lag behind.  Chakra was imbued into her weapon as the Kunai lights up. She aims it towards Tethy's in an attempt to strike him.

<No one else is interveening, they simply want to preserve that treaty.. > She jumps to conclusions assuming as such,* - Sun Sep 06 18:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) would wonder how he was able to make contact seeing that their locations oppose to Tethys was mirrored. If he went on with the attack to strike the Kunai then of course it would hit Tehtys seeing that Kunai was thrown straight towards him. * - Sun Sep 06 18:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) Stopped in place as the man perfom feats that she could never actually posses. The Kunai that seem to missed him entirely despite her having the advantage put her mind in disarray.

"Can this man se- "

She was not able to even speak before nearly gasping at the man that charge at her yet again. Another set strike that who knows if she was would be helped, she actually grew tired of always being helped out.

If the attack by Nigen was in fact succesfull ,she would let out a breath of exhale and would glare at Ushinawa. Wondering if he had something to do with it.

If the attack by Nigen failed then she would reacive a wallop of the lift time. SHe would be sent spiraling back across the pavement. Vision groggy and panting. She sustain MAJOR damage as her body shut down. Ribs broken and more than likely some internal bleeding.

<What? > was all that she thought Blacking out.* - Sun Sep 06 19:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) was in the middle of looking over at Ushinawa wondering if Ushinawa was the culprit behind this. She then stares up at Chiyari, he eyes narrowed at her as she growing angry at the situation. She dared to protect a treaty despite on the danger it would pose on others. She looks down towards the submissive induvidual and would glare at him for the moment.

She opened her lips to say something but would fight against it. She turns around to approach Ushinawa thinking that this was trully over, for now.* - Sun Sep 06 19:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) grogily stands up ever shaking from the pain. It hurt to breath seeing she had two broken ribs from the sheer power of Tethys. She bends foward holding her torso with both of her arms as she stares at the man that was in a submissive state. She did over hear CHiyari speaking about letting them fight for that brought more frustration.

Her anger would send a spike in pain all around her torso as she limps towards Ushinawa ever slowly.* - Sun Sep 06 19:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) would look around wondering were did Ushinawa went off to.

"Shit , she muttered "

The pain of her ribs continue to assault her as she kept on breathing.* - Sun Sep 06 19:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) nashes her teeth as she glares at the man from behind. Pure rage as she stares at the man walking freely among them.* - Sun Sep 06 19:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) was in the middle of sending death glares towards Tethys from behind. That of course was disrupted as he turned around to walk towards her. She gasps slightly before regaining her composure to step back, it was a feeble attempt to gain distant. One that ended upon him grabing her by the collar.

"L-let g-go of me " She struggled to snarl out as the pain raged on. 

Being placed around the group of Sunagakure shinobi would only make her angrier. She did not want to be tended to and would remember the words that she told Ushinawa
<A shinobi is only a tool, i wont even be a shinobi...>

Pain rings through her body as she stands ups and would attempt to limp away. She declines the help from Fijitora feebly moving her arm or wrist, whatever he attempted to grab, and would say

" I'm fine.. "

She attempts to get away.* - Sun Sep 06 20:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) assume she was allowed since she was not physically stop. She makes her way towards Ushinawa.* - Sun Sep 06 20:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) then would have walked in the last direction she remembered seeing him.* - Sun Sep 06 20:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) could only accept the sand seeing she could not do much. She grew angrier as she struggled to break free. This cause more pain to ring through her body. In the end she stopped strugling and would remain silent.* - Sun Sep 06 20:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) was still covered in iron sand.* - Sun Sep 06 20:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) was currently in the hospital strapped down.  She gave up all hopes to walk away, in fact it was not about her hurting herself. It was getting aid from the people of Sunagakure. She lets herself be worked on as she wallows in her thoughts.

< I should get accustom to betrayal, it will happen to me...> She thinks.* - Sun Sep 06 20:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) was in her deep thoughts before noticing the door opening up. Seeing the man from before she simply just narrowed her eyes.

" I had him on the ropes.. " She lied.* - Sun Sep 06 21:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) clenched her fist causing the broken ribs to create a shock of pain through her body. Her resolved was made the moment she left with him.

"If i can't proctect my family then i have no reason to stay alive ".* - Sun Sep 06 21:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) was strapped up.* - Sun Sep 06 21:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) If finally release from restraint she would get up slowly. She was still in pain but she would power through. The pain killers that the  nurses gave her would help her out for now.

"Let's go, i knew those chants were for more than nothing ".* - Sun Sep 06 22:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) would follow as so. She made her way leabing this god for saken village.* - Sun Sep 06 22:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) looks at him from the stretcher.* - Sun Sep 06 22:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) looks at his brother who was filled with pain. 
<What is going on > She thinks* - Sun Sep 06 22:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) shrugs but would wince in pain. That movement caused more pain to ring through her body.* - Sun Sep 06 22:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) would lay back.* - Sun Sep 06 22:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) appeared to be held by someone bridal style. She glances over towards Ushinawa before gesturing the man holding her to take her to him.* - Mon Sep 07 21:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Be careful. - Mon Sep 07 21:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zhen(Whistleblower) whispers: So no one here knows where Zetsumo is? - Mon Sep 07 21:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) the man silently did as he was told.* - Mon Sep 07 21:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) fist clench causing pain to erupt through her body. The man standing next to her placed a hand on her shoulder and said

"Six weeks..."

Upon listening in to what he said, she would attempt to calm down.* - Mon Sep 07 21:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) The man standing next to Aiyana looks over from the Mizukage and back to Ushinawa. He placed a hand over her shoulder.

Aiyana felt this and knew what was going to happen next. 

<I can't leave " She thinks.

She remains standing there with a poker face.* - Mon Sep 07 21:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) face clenched up as her she listens on to what the man had to say. She ignores her current state and would just let her emotions run free, despite the medical consequences.

<You bastard...> She thinks.* - Mon Sep 07 22:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) ignores Keyshawn.* - Mon Sep 07 22:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) started to feel frogy once more.* - Mon Sep 07 22:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) watches the man making his way. She hesistates to move; the man next to her holding her back.* - Mon Sep 07 22:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) The man next to Aiyana slowly scoops her up before making their way out of the courtyard. Not a word was utter to Keyshawn, of course this was the reason why.

The man would walk on ahead waiting for Ushinawa.* - Mon Sep 07 22:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) the man continues with the lady hoisted.* - Mon Sep 07 22:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: Where is my brother. - Tue Sep 08 22:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) whispers: Eh..he's around.. - Tue Sep 08 23:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) whispers: Just finished getting destroyed by the Raikage. Most likely picking a fight. - Tue Sep 08 23:02:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I'm okay. I'm trying to learn something, how are you feeling, Aunt Zenaki? - Mon Sep 14 15:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) glances over her shoulder at Zestumo. Lenghty white hair, she assumed it was a female with rather broad shoulders. She looks back over towards the ware, the owner did not mind the lenghty stare of her clothing.

< This man, Zestumo? Yeah that, rather has a lively village > She thinks.* - Mon Sep 14 15:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Alright... Hmm.. - Mon Sep 14 15:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: @I guess I can still tell Zetsumo.... But I can also take care of it myself once I see her...  - Mon Sep 14 15:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) thinks: I guess I can still tell Zetsumo.... But I can also take care of it myself once I see her...  - Mon Sep 14 15:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) was casually looking over the wares the village had or rather what remain. She would doubt she stuck out like a sore thumb but she would let that slide. The booming voice cause the female to tremble slightly. Was he actually speaking to her? She did not need the extra attention so turning her head now would only cause her to fall into the bait. That and him being twenty five feet away would have her doubting that he was even speaking to her. She simply reaches out and pulls a sweatshirt from the store.

The storeowner smiled in anticipation of a sale.* - Mon Sep 14 15:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) dropped the shirt back on the rack. The owner pouted. She backed away from the store and would turn towards Zestumo, Giving him full view of her face. She nods towards what Ushinawa just said about her.

" My name is Aiyana ".* - Mon Sep 14 15:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: Crap.. - Mon Sep 14 15:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) would look over towards the sideline to see Ushinawa and the figure. Before she got started however, she decided to tackle on something that Zet said and rather Ushinawa did not denied.

"Ushinawa may not be my Kin but it is the only person i trust in this world...Were he goes ill go...and his god shall be my god "


She spreads her feet apart
"Ill show you what i'm capeable of, and i do hope i do not displease "


Her hand begins to contort as fast as her dexterity allowed her to. The speed resembled nothing too fancy, rather average. Three dopleganger appeared infront of her, all resembling the female of course. They took charge and rushed forward towards the man, The real Aiyana behind them would do the same. A kunai was unsheathed, probably hidden from the Zetsumo. She realized that these people people ment business so it was all or nothing.* - Mon Sep 14 15:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) The other hand would shift through backpouch she would hope such rudimentary tactics would give Aiyana the upperhand. Being under estimated is her only tactic.

Four shurikens were pulled out  and hurled through the bunshins. Being that they were basic, they would simply phase right through attempting to hit it's mark. From Ushinawa description of Zetsumo, he was the man that could probably chaneg the tides of war due to this she was riding on faith that her tactics would work in her favor.* - Mon Sep 14 15:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: Is this all a ploy? People only use the basic skills when they have nothing else up their sleeves. - Mon Sep 14 16:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) could barely see what was happening but the sound of the shurikens bouncing off his torso.  She was not sure what this was but of course it was all the same to her.

"Ninjutsu" she lets out

The clones, continues it's trek but of course it was of no use to get close to the man. The dopleganger's purpose at this point was to simply to cover her attacks. Unfortunetely for her the clone lack advance fighting moneouvers so they kept running forward. The Kunai on the other hand would light up with her affinity. She imbues the Kunai with her lightning style as she flicked her wrist through the clone. 

The single Kunai attempt to hit it's mark.* - Mon Sep 14 16:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) took notice at the fact that he did not let Kunai enhanced with chakra hit it's mark. All she could assume that the armor he had on was simply for physical attacks. That of course in all her offensive actions, she would not expect a counter measure to be taken so sudden.

The inhuman strings that simply blocked off the attacks and would then come directly at her would leave her to bealive that side stepping or rather evading them was something that should not done in her skill level.

She jumps backweaving through her handseals yet agaimn. The clones served it purpose and would be poofed away. Her hands lowered towards the ground as she unleased a torrent of electricity. Her volatile affinity would race forward towards the beelining threads. If contact was made, she would have prevented the attack for that turn, damaging the threads.* - Mon Sep 14 16:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) did not have the skills to instantly send out yet another wave of electricity. The technique was new to her so send out on the fly was something out of her skill range. The Jiongu threads made it's mark on her, It was at the moment she realised she needed a new justu in her arsenal. She watches the man as he stood infront of the specatators. She was trully pinned and she could even look at Ushinawa in the eye.

She remained silent feeling the grip of her legs and waist. She lacked any cutting tools to cut through, she wish she had taken the short sword from the leaf village. Something inside of her did tell her that cutting through them would be rather impossible.

" Correct.." She softly replied to his claim about her proffesion.* - Mon Sep 14 16:59:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Yes. - Mon Sep 14 19:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: Weird. - Mon Sep 14 19:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: It's fine... Nothing real heavy. - Mon Sep 14 19:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Perhaps you can test your hand with your shortblade? - Mon Sep 14 19:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Mmm...Maybe. - Mon Sep 14 19:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: such tenacity.. - Mon Sep 14 19:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) thinks: much lightning. - Mon Sep 14 19:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) thinks: wow. - Mon Sep 14 19:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: That's his fire. - Mon Sep 14 19:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: I need to go and train. - Mon Sep 14 19:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) would now know that time was not of the essence. Time and time of again she was placed under the fire to see how well would she react to the flames. To test her purity in these dire times, she understood that her strenghts must increase. She manage to rescue her weapons from her prior spar and frankly she would need to master something before she could move on. She finds a rather alone spot for her training, something she needs to do ever since she was healed from her broken ribs. The kunai was unsheated as she made her way towards a specific spot. There was a single tree in the area one proved good enough to withstand her training.  The kunai in her hand help by the loop and pratically was twirled around until it was time to tacke action. She catches it in her hand and would hold it tightly right before she imbues it. She looks at the trunk of the tree aiming for the higher regions, she did not want to topple it over. Even though she knows she could but that was something she wanted to avoid for now. She focus on the high frequency vibration that was running through her sharp object, enough so that if she did let go, the blade could retain its chakra. She hurls it and throws it in the direction of the tree and it would of course land with a huge thud. The lightning chakra gave the edge weapon a boost in cutting power, something the in battle she has seen that was something to not be taken so lightly. The rushes towards the tree to gaze at her creation or rather what went wrong. She took notes as to how much the kunai push through and where she needed to improve. In short she was novice at this technique, she was well away from being an expert but she had no reason to to just give up and not try at all. She channels chakra into her hand picking up the kunai, She needed to have an existing source of chakra to not complete the circuit and fry herself with her own technique. It  would be rather embarassing if she fell victim to her own technique if she manages to simply fall prey.* - Mon Sep 14 19:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: I am interested in buying a technique off of you. - Mon Sep 14 20:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) felt the wind behind her shift her hair around. It was rather odd of course but none the less she turn around to see Zetsumo. She would attempt to go on the hostility but his whisper made her rethink her actions.

She replies back with out looking, almost as if she was expecting him to be there but in reality her heart was pummping too fast.* - Mon Sep 14 20:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: Purchase my technique? - Mon Sep 14 20:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) though it over the moment, that was an insane amount of money. Enough to make people go crazy. She looks over towards Ushinawa.

"I never said he was my brother " She softly replies back


she uncrosses her arms and continues
"Regardless i'll see what he thinks about this..".* - Mon Sep 14 20:31:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Okay.. - Mon Sep 14 20:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) would cross her arms upon the boy getting closer. She eyes him from head to toe and would just attempt to remember what exactly happened during the match. It then hit her what happened.


She whisper to him.* - Mon Sep 14 20:43:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: Why not. - Mon Sep 14 20:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: Atleast, I hope he's not aware of my eyes.. - Mon Sep 14 20:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: What would he do to you if he found out. - Mon Sep 14 20:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: I was told by a certain someone, that they have a bounty out for people with red eyes, and white eyes. - Mon Sep 14 20:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: What if he took my eyes for himself? - Mon Sep 14 20:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: So it's not bad enough that Kirigakure is out eliminating but there is a bounty? - Mon Sep 14 20:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: Yes..A bounty.. - Mon Sep 14 20:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: I also.. - Mon Sep 14 20:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: In the spar saw Zetsumo behind you, so his line of sight was probably blocked. - Mon Sep 14 20:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: Who told you of this bounty. - Mon Sep 14 20:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: First, let me ask a question. - Mon Sep 14 20:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: How do you know of the Uchiha's power? - Mon Sep 14 20:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Right then. Restrictions are simple. - Mon Sep 14 20:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: No flying -- I hate flying. - Mon Sep 14 20:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: I'm in close contact with the man you just sparred. - Mon Sep 14 20:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: Ushi? - Mon Sep 14 20:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: Yes. - Mon Sep 14 20:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: How do I know this to be true? - Mon Sep 14 20:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: You can ask him yourself, came to this camp with him. - Mon Sep 14 20:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: I see.. - Mon Sep 14 20:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: Ushi, told me of this bounty. - Mon Sep 14 20:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: Then it's probably from Kirigakure. - Mon Sep 14 20:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: He told me all villages know. - Mon Sep 14 20:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: ... - Mon Sep 14 20:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: I don't know if Zetsumo knows of it or not.. - Mon Sep 14 20:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: Dam it... - Mon Sep 14 20:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: Tell me.. - Mon Sep 14 20:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: Miss uh.. - Mon Sep 14 20:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: It is getting hard to trust anyone...I cant do it dear brother... - Mon Sep 14 20:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: Aiyana.. - Mon Sep 14 20:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: Well.. Aiyana, do you wield the same power? - Mon Sep 14 20:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: What makes you assume as such?\ - Mon Sep 14 20:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: It's obvious of your concern for my well being when I used it in that spar. So I'm only assuming, what relation do you have with Ushi? - Mon Sep 14 20:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: He is only someone i hold very dear- - Mon Sep 14 20:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) would remain silent as she looks at Hanabi and the fact that she was able to wrap her arms around her shoulder with out actually being detected until is was too late. She moved the arm that was more near to it move her arm and would remain silent as she simplys glances at her rebreather.* - Mon Sep 14 20:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: This chick is mad fast. - Mon Sep 14 20:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: She is just as fast as Ushi. Wonder who'd win in a race. - Mon Sep 14 20:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: And is she going to do it? - Mon Sep 14 20:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: What is your name girl? - Mon Sep 14 20:58:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I can become one. - Mon Sep 14 21:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Or something close enough to one. - Mon Sep 14 21:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Are you able to teach it to me? - Mon Sep 14 21:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I could. - Mon Sep 14 21:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: But you must prove to me that you are worthy enough. - Mon Sep 14 21:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: There is a theme here. - Mon Sep 14 21:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: .... - Mon Sep 14 21:04:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: Show me - Mon Sep 14 21:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: How can I prove to you? I guess.. - Mon Sep 14 21:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: I don't like it...So much room for betrayal... - Mon Sep 14 21:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: If you'll excuse me.. - Mon Sep 14 21:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Yeah. - Mon Sep 14 21:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: ..Lord help me. - Mon Sep 14 21:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: That is for me to know and you to casually stumble upon~ - Mon Sep 14 21:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: ...I'm not good with trick questions. - Mon Sep 14 21:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) continue to train her rather tough technique, well tough to her of course.  The tree would by be reduce to shreads by the time she was finished. She manage to practice enough so that her skills have actually flourish much more than what she needed them to be. She moves on to a different target and rather instead of focusing on the projectile aspect, she focused on what exactly the kunai was made for and that was stabbing. She holds the kunai away from her body and would unleash her torrent of electiricity upon it. The Kunai was imbued lighting up the area around her and she would in short get to work. She begins with stab on the base of the trunk. She was looking for a clean break but of course that would not be the case. The Kunai sinks in rather violently causing the area around it to simply crack off.  She pulls it back out with a lot of effort and would let out a "oof". She decides a different approach instead of the stabbing and would simply attempt send a diagnol slash towards the center of the trunk.The lightning imbued Kunai made a startling sound as it made its way down. The cut itself was not as deep as she would of liked it so she knew that she had to step it up rather quickly if she wanted to do so. More chakra was channeled into to retain it's vigor and volatileness. The female simpy attempted to once send a stike in the opposite direction. She was huffing and puffing hinting that her stamina was actually running thin. This combination of Bukijutsu and even Ninjutsu did take a lot of out of her. The female did give up on her assault however. The sound of lightning cutting through wood could be heared through the forest. She did not give up the assault until she felt her lungs burning which would not have taken so long. The woman gave up and would look at the trunk to see what she had accomplished. There was a deep X about 4 inches deep and it was rather impressive. She was able to keep the control of lightning affinity to spread around to other parts of the tree. There was running cracks ofcourse hinting that she was a bit away from mastery.* - Mon Sep 14 21:08:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) would look into Hideki, regardless of what he might be showing her. He would see the same reflection. The burning passion that is the window to her sole. The Uchiha blood coursing through her very veins. The feeling of being betrayed and fear of loosing the one closest to you.* - Tue Sep 15 00:21:58 2015
