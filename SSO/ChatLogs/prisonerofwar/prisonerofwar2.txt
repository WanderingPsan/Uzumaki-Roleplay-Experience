<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) could feel the skills coursing through her. Everyday she was making some sort of progress, enough so that she did not trail behind. The woman had to accomplish mastering her techniques, enough so that she did not have a problem doing so. She crouch down just infront of the tree, mirroring the amount of space that she had from the spar with Zetsumo. She was able to understand that this was the amount space she could work on for now and the amount that needs to grow. She begins to weave through her handseals as she narrows her eyes at the tree. She envision that the tree was one of the many enemies that she would meet or rather have in the past. She was not known through out the shinobi world and rather it should stay like that. The handseals were contorted and her chakra spike. The volatile element escapes her hands as it races through the ground. The lightning chakra crumbles through the ground and attempts to thit the base of the tree.  She was aware that upon the lightning hitting the tree, it would simply leave a dark impression of an attack. She had a long way to go.* - Tue Sep 15 15:20:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) was right to look at emotional circumastances that would be apparent on her face. She flances from Mariana down towards the ground. She was frustrated and unable to process certain things. Listening in to what her brother said, she would reply

"I don't wish to intrude you taijutsu session, Ushinawa ".* - Tue Sep 15 17:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: .. - Tue Sep 15 17:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) lets out an exhale, the lack of caring by Mariana only added fuel to the way she felt about her.  She nods towards the command from Ushinawa and would step towards side taking her position. She had support but for than likely she would not call for it.

"Very well then " She replied.* - Tue Sep 15 17:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: How are we doing this? - Tue Sep 15 17:29:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) rush foward at the end of his statement. SHe wanted to come at him will full ferocity and force. Uchiha blood coursing through her veins simply charged up her pride. She had never been the type to run away from a fight.


Mariana's stall however hindered her movements. Her scooting over caused an uneasy feeling but she ended up hearing her out. Glancing at Ushinawa and the area that they were in, she would attempt to come up with something. The woman glances at Mariana before speaking rather sternly.* - Tue Sep 15 17:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: Every action should be backed up with another action. - Tue Sep 15 17:37:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) was not anticipating the first move. The quick speedy arch type of Ushinawa was something she did not need to take lightly, especially after seeing him in action. The sarcastic tone of Mariana only proved to make Aiyana angrier despite fully showing a chance to remove any ill will until the spar was over. That flew out of the window of course but not before she had to prove to her brother that she was worthy.

The hit did cause Mariana to stumble into her but of course she attempted grab the stumbling Mariana and spin off her for a a high kick towards his torso. This re-stabilzation of Mariana's footing would allow for a less lagged response from her should she decided to attack. She attempted this attack with the use of her improved reflexes.* - Tue Sep 15 17:55:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) // mariana probably mis read or even missunderstood what was going on. Her foot landed on the ground. A miss that cause her to suck her teeth. He evasiveness and quick strike caused the hit on Mariana to land on her as well. She stumbles towards the side quickly attempting reclaim her center of gravity.

"Your attacks are too slow Mariana...." She snarls out.

She runs back in stepping side to side to attempt to elude him.

"Follow my lead this time.." She exclaims. * - Tue Sep 15 18:32:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) met up with the man that once again was on the defensive. At no time did they have in on the ropes and this greatly made her discrourage. The first high kick was reacived with cross block of her fore arms but she was not expecting a low kick towards lower portiion of her torso. She was struck getting sent stumbling backwards. Seeing that all this effort would not go to waist as she notices Mariana attempting to tackle him

Should that go through, she would attempt to leg drop his torso or rather any open area that would be lethal or greatly hurt him.* - Tue Sep 15 19:14:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Hm? - Tue Sep 15 21:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) felt empowered. The training session with her brother was a great push for her to see where it that she lacked was. Her taijutsu was truly in fact lacking but it made her see that there was more to fighting than just ninjutsu. Regardless of that, she was told to master her basic Ninjutsu for the moment. She takes position behind the tree and would begin to weave her hand seals. Her techniques at the moment were simply hand me downs from her brother. This did not bother what so ever knowing that she had the chance to join the elite ranks of the clan. Her chakra began to spike once more as she remembers her earlier training for this technique. Her volatile nature only gave birth to a static discharge, something that she needed to master and promote growth. Her hands gave out this torrent of lightning that through her will, she would make it so that the stream would push out and attempt to make it towards the base of the tree. With a loud snap, the tree base would erupt into black smoke, it was obvious that wood is not a great conductor but it serve a good measurement to see how much exactly can her technique puncture through. It was to no use at first try but Aiyana did not give up at all. The woman began to weave through the hand seals yet again, with all her dexterity she attempted to pull through. The female made it believe that she was in the heat of battle trying to cast out a jutsu that would save her life. Her chakra spike yet again as she holds out her hand towards the tree. The woman unleashes the wave to hit a different spot on the tree hopefully attempting to puncture it deeper. She kneads the technique to do her very bidding as travel through at great speed.  It finally hit its mark with same the ferocity as before but it was not enough to rip right through. She felt rather discourage only to ignore this ill feeling for now. The more she kept on practicing the technique the better she was at using it.* - Tue Sep 15 23:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) felt invigorate as her skills and technique simply improved with the more she tackle this technique. She felt like she was a veteran at this technique. She decided to test out the technique on a better field. She makes her way down to the river side to test out a theory. The female took position a couple of feet away from the water side and would begin to weave through the hand seals. This was standard procedure and the more she kept on trying to do this, the better she felt at it. Her hands weave through a blur like motion or rather so she thought. She was becoming rather use to the hand seals, enough to pull the technique on the spot. She needed this for her advantage and rather she needed to practice this to pull all the stops in the battles of the future. Her chakra began to spike from the moment the first hand seal was executed and in short, she would aim her hands towards the water. She knew that water was a great conductor for electricity but how else could she use this to her advantage. Lightning chakra escaped her hands as it travelled straight towards the water's edge. The roaring of the electricity was enough to let anyone of her position but she knew she must do this for practice purpose. The female watched as her lightning chakra hit the water and quickly it began to spread as the perfect conductor rage through the area. She was able to get a wide spread of the technique without any extra fuzz. The female once again attempted to do this but this time she wanted to control the outburst but with a series of angle attacks. The woman weave through the hand seals until finally a torrent of lightning escapes her fingers. It was sent diagonally towards the edge and in short she got the same effect. The wide spread but of course in a different direction. She pants knew that this was the end to the session.* - Tue Sep 15 23:25:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) word of an tournament filled her ears as they spread throught the village. It was as if the Gezo goverment ran deep into the village. She was in the middle of an conversation with her nephew but she had to cut it short.

"There is matters what i must attend to or rather find out...If i survive it, you can ask me anything about your father "

She would turn around and proceed to speak to the official that was spreading the news of a tournament. He pointed towards the caravan and would nod towards him. She would curve every instinct to attack the man.* - Sun Oct  4 02:24:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) the woman simply stares at Sabo remembering him from Amegakure.

< Zetsumo- "
She looks at Haruna.* - Sun Oct  4 02:30:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) stayed there for the moment with her eyes lingering on her for the moment. She had a deep though for the moment but would curve it as she followed Sabo's match.

<Don't recommmend it, huh ".* - Sun Oct  4 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: The child speaks as if he has seen so much. - Sun Oct  4 02:35:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) would end up turning around and would look at Rymei. She of course would attempt to see if he was sporting any headband on him.  Most likely she would not find any.

She however says something.

" Is your match over' She inquiered.* - Sun Oct  4 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) the handseal was rather a form of hostility. Haruna of course warned her to stand around until she was attack and knowing the Gezo goverment why would they have any curtesy to warn someone. The female picked an appropiate place to start especially with the other battle so nearby but it is what it is. Aiyana knew that this could be her last moments on this earth, she braced herself for what may come next.

"I see " She lets out her tone of voice changing putting up a wall of faux courage. 

She reacts accordingly to her seal of confrontation and would jump towards side unsheating a kunai from her pouch and engulfing it in her own chakra. She hurls it towards the woman.* - Sun Oct  4 03:56:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) her plan to infiltrate the turnament was brought to an abrupt stop. She did expect this to happen but not not so quickly of course. The female was binded by the genjutsu, she felt petrified as she stared at Rymei. She grits her teeth as she puts no resistance in the assault from her. The punch that came to her surely caused Major damage. Lucky for her she did not see it coming with the speed she might have possesed. The female quickly knocks out seeing that her brain was rattled and would be laying on the dirt ground a feet away from her.* - Sun Oct  4 04:12:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) comes forth from her unconcious state as she looks up. She was thrown back into the village. She survive like she hoped she was but she did not claim nothing to valuable...rather bits of information on who is a contender of being a Private. She woman slowly walks back towards the wall and lowers her head in defeat.

< What was i thinking...> She thinks.* - Sun Oct  4 04:18:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) wipes the blood before looking at her nephew. Despite him not having full features of Ushinawa, she would shake her head and straightens herself up.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) attempts to steer clear of looking over in Niza's direction. She curveed every behavior to stand up and say something.

" I see, that is a pity i did not get to meet her ".* - Sun Oct  4 04:51:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) she walks over towards Heiwa and would crouch down to look at him. Her black eye was rather not an appealing sight so she would curve her glance towards the side.
