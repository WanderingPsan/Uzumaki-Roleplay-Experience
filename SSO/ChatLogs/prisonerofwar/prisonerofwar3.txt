<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) decided that now was as best time as ever to simply get some training done. In wake of her brother's death and the loosing badly to private tournament for the Gezo, she would succumb to a rather deep hatred to the feeling of unusefullness. Picking a elevated area that was fenced in, she would get right down to work. The female got into the right state of mind and would lift her hands up to about torso high. She begins to weave three handseals at moderate speed, nothing too flashy there, and would focus her chakra to bend to her very will. Her chakra began to move around as she was experiencing this feeling for the first time. She had a similar technique that was taught to her in the academy but this time it was it's upgraded counterpart. With her volatile electric nature, she would begin to expell outwards as in a puff of smoke came out a dopple ganger. This clone resembled  Aiyana in every way and with her upgraded power, it had a better knack for battle seeing that it can cast Elemental techniques. This was something that she had to be able to use on the fly with no probem. The clone nods towards Aiyana as it jumps backwards and would begin to weave her own handseals. These were techniques that they both had in their arsenal and of course mastered through out the days. The clone pick earth flash as it race to finish her handseals. Pointing towards the ground, the clone unleashed a torrent of electricity and would race forward. This was stop short upon the clone reaching it's apex of power and in a quick discharge of electricity it was gone.* - Mon Oct 12 22:50:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) uncrossed her arms partially satisfied with the answer, for the moment. She did not exactly recognize Kuro or rather should she (icly?). She tilts her head to the side 

" Well as i did mention...He is my Nephew ".* - Tue Dec  8 03:46:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: Which is why it strikes me as odd that Heiwa decided to live in Kirigakure despite the past. - Tue Dec  8 03:56:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) was deeply confused she could of sworn that her bewilder expression and questions would have implied that she was judging him by his choice of words and not on his attire.Nonetheless she presses on.

" Let see where your story ends, Because as one of us it's either one of two things "



She closes her eyes letting out a deep exhale. She was filled with resentment of the past

" Strong and six feet under or weak and alone "
