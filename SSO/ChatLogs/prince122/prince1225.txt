<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Thu Nov 12 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ishi(Prince122) sighs as he watches the two lovers lollygagging with one another. Like Akira, he too believed that there was no time for pointless "lovey-dovey" shit. Walking off, he'd find a nice spot to train.* - Thu Nov 12 04:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ishi(Prince122) withdrew two Kunai from his weapons pouch. Looking at the tree in front of him he weighed the weapons. Tightening his grip around the two weapons he'd think back to what he had say a the man in Konoha do before. <So He just threw them.... then hit one off the other, right?> thrusting both of his hands foreward he released the kunai, throwing them at an angle so that after a certain distance they would hit off one another. 

Watching them soar through the air he clenched his teach. "C'mon now...", as they neared the point at which he expect them to hit each other the Kunai deflected off one another, he tensed. The blades collided, yet inside of flying towards the tree he wanted it to hit the both flew in completely different directions. One sticking in the ground, the other flying a bit further but hitting the ground as well. Sighing, he walked forth and retrieved the Kunai from where they laid, disappointed that it hadn't worked the first time that he had tried it out.* - Thu Nov 12 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ishi(Prince122) sighs. The technique probably couldn't be learned on its own. It did seem like a hard technique when he had seen the pull it off. "Guess I'll practice something else then." pulling out his Tanto he held it in front of him. He'd never reallyed practice much with it, and didn't really thing he needed to. However, he had seen a lot of people with some pretty strong jutsu, and at the moment he really didn't have anything. Weighing the weapon on his hand he looked at the weaposn sharp edges. If he were able to utilize it correctly he'd be pretty strong, probably one of the strongest genin around. Then he could reclaim Konohagakure and make a name for himself in the world.* - Thu Nov 12 05:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ishi(Prince122) swinging the blade forth he attempted to make the blade feel like an extention of his body. After swiping downwards he would swing the blade to the right, then to the left, and lastly up. Each movement looked alright, but was still a bit sloppy and completely far from perfect. Continuing this motion for several minutes Ishi would practice until he was able to bring the blade up in a somehwat decent motion. Drenched in sweat he brought his blade down and took a break. "Damn that was tougher than I expected."* - Thu Nov 12 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ishi(Prince122) continues to heave in gasps of air. Howe,ver he was not done yet. Brining his blade back up to chest level he stuck it out, the tip pointing straight foreward. Jabbing it foreward he'd take a step with his attack, to make it flow better and easier. Taking a step back he resumed the position/stance he was in early. Stepping foreward again he'd jab the blade just as he had done the time before. Continuing to do the same thing over and over again, he'd wait until his body felt sore from doing the same motion over and over again. However he also hoping that he was encoding the process into his mind through muschle memory.* - Thu Nov 12 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ishi(Prince122) exhales another large amount of breath. He was getting tired, but still had one more thing to do before he was completely exhausted and could no longer practice. Standing straight up he closed his eyes, attempting to slow his heart rate in order for him to catch his breath. <Almost done Ishi, you can do this.> opening his eyes. He got in to a simple Kenjutsu stance that he had been shown many times before. Bring his blade foreward he began to prance around, looking like he was doing some sort of dance. making a complete circle around the area he found himself back where he had begun. However, unlike before he was barely sweating. Unlike the other pratices all this one required was simple footwork, not movement with the blade. Sheathing the blade he stood up and looked at the square. "I guess I'll go back since I'm done...."* - Thu Nov 12 05:20:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ishi(Prince122) looked forward. The village of Konohagakure was bare and abandoned. The vast majority of ninja that used to reside within and protect the village having left after the death of the most recent Hokage of whom Ishi didn't even know. "Those damn cowards...." He said, hate carried within the tone of his voice. Taking out his Tanto he looked at it, watching it glisten in the sun of the village. "But I'll redeem the village..... Bring down those who left us... I'll kill them if I have to." With that he set forth to the training ground, ready to begin another day of training.

As he arrived in the field he noticed it, like everything else in the damn village, was empty. At one point and time the village was flourishing, probably one of the strongest villages in the entire shinobi world. Now look at it.... it was.... Nothing. Only spurring his need to become stronger more Ishi began his usual routine, swiping the blade from right to left in constant motions. After a certain amount of time, he stopped, lowering his blade to his side to catch his breath.

Bringing his Tanto back up, he began to jab it forward in as fluid of a motion that he could maintain. "I'll become stronger than ever!" he roared, jabbing faster and faster as he used his emotions to fuel his energy for training. After a while his pace slowed, and he kept it constant. "Fifty-three.." He counted, making his way up to one hundred. Once he was done, he'd set his blade to his side and heave in breaths of air again.

Now it was time for him to begin the last part of his Kenjutsu training. Brining the blade forth he held it in front of his face. Then, like many times before, he began to "dance" around, making sure his form was as good as he could possible make it. Shifting around he moved in a complete circle, then finally moved to the center of where he had begun and sat down. "Damn that was a good practice." He'd say, putting the weapon in its sheath.

Closing his eyes, he began to meditate, in order to catch his breath and in a sense he also believed that he helped him retain any type of knowledge or experience he had gained while practicing. Breathing in and out, he controlled the pace of his breath, making sure to focus on what he had been doing while he was practicing.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ishi(Prince122) opened the first scroll. "Guard Duty" it read. Sighing, Ishi took of in a jog. Once at the gates he simply stood there, looking out into the wilderness. He hated getting stupid missions like this one. But, if wanted to get himself anywhere in this village he was going to have to do what the Hokage assisgned him, even if it was a waste. Sighing he looked up at the clouds, watching the clouds pass him overhead.* - Fri Dec 11 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ishi(Prince122) turned his attention back to the task at hand: focusing. He did that often, thinking about stupid shit and drifting off. Putting his hand in his pockets he looked around to make sure that no one was around to watch his laziness. However, as his gaze looked over the area he thought he saw movement. Darting his eyes to a nearby push he withdrew his Tanto. No point in taking any chances* - Fri Dec 11 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ishi(Prince122) tensing he quickly moved forth, ready to strike whatever was in bush. Letting out a war cry he brought his tanto down in a fluid moton hoping to skewer whatever laid in the bush in front of him. Almost as instantly as he moved a shadow shot out of the bush and towards a tree. Startled, Ishi leapt back and looked forward. It had been a bunny. Ishi had let himself get frightened by a -bunny-

"Some Shinobi I am, huh?"* - Fri Dec 11 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ishi(Prince122) walking back to the gate he posted his back to it, his focus better after having his little stupid scare. Gazing into the distance he looked around, scanning the area. Once he was sure everything was fine he grabbed a little pouch of Purple Drink Mix: modern day cocaine for the black man. Pulling out a water bottle he poured the mix into the water, then closed it. Shaking the bottle he made himself some grab drank as he stood there.* - Fri Dec 11 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ishi(Prince122) sighing, he set the bottle of grape drink back into his belt place. Looking around once more he made sure nothing was wrong. Once assured a hand would touch his shoulder, a fellow chuunin motioning for him to leave. Nodding in appreciation Ishi pushed himself off the wall. Walking into the village he took one final swig of his delecious purple drank before embarking on his very next mission.* - Fri Dec 11 05:26:24 2015
