<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) takes a walk heading to the south away from the center of the village. He remembers the words of the girl calling for those staying here to help. He wondered what he could do or what she really meant, but for now he guessed he just follow Yan's advice to work on his jutsu that might save his life again one day. Nodding to that, he quickly tried to finish up on the one jutsu that actually accomplished that goal.

His hands folding into a concentration seal, before he began to leak out the chakra from the bottom of his feet. The chakra quickly slipped inside the underground. He then used this chakra to grab hold of the earth. Distrubing its bond, and slowly falling beneath it surface as the earth overwhelmed him.  His body soon swallowed up by the soil, and lost beneath the layers of the world.

Building up his chakra he used the extra chakra to continue his tunneling in the soil. His chakra rotating and pushing forward acting as a makeshift drill. The earth being destroyed to make room for the genin squeezing forward. His legs and arms pushing himself forward, as he concentrated keeping his chakra up. His lungs squeezing down on themselves, as they pushed his held in air through the body.

Could feel some pain in his chest as he continued to hold in his breathe. His body pointing upwards, as he quickly drilled back to the surface. Coming up to take a quick breathe, before he nose dived right back beneath the earth. His chakra easily taking care of making space for his body again. His hands coming out in front of him, as he pushed forward. 

Continued his mud swim, travelling across the underground. Feeling free to go as long as he could ever wanted. His body feeling much more natural traveling under the ground. His magnetic senses had increased to a large amount. His earth nature chakra letting him better recieve the incoming signals from the surface and all around him. The pulses making  him easily grasp a good understanding of whatever was going on around him.* - Sat Oct 10 09:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) lifted himself out of the earth just for another breathe. His chakra spiking, as he already took to building a new space for himself in the earth. His body tearing up the grounds to open up enough for him to take the dive. Slipping in between an extended opening just big enough for him to slip through with ease. He then quickly closed it up, using the residue chakra to shut the hole by closing in the earth.

He then continues the circulating chakra, pushing it outside his body. He concentrates making the line of the energy even thinner. Increasing the density of it, while removing the amount. The strength of his chakra ever so subtly increasing, breaking through the walls of earth. Giving him a quick route of movement, as he pushed forward in the liquifying earth. Body easily making its way through what should've been a solid stopping block.

His fingers digging into the earth which he pulled forward. His boyd heading upwards, as he skimmed under the surface. Chakra ready to spark upwards to dig himself out a hole to breathe from. His legs pushing forward, as his back brushed across some of the deeper rooted grass that were hanging above him. His eyes looking at the territory of earth he was inside. Reminded him how glad he was that he didn't have to wash off his clothes each time he did this.

Jirun continued working on his jutsu. Learning how to manipualte its energy. Noting how each change in shape and amount effected moving through the earth. Each change was only minor to keep him moving through the earth. His body just wishing to crawl forward as much as possible, silently in his head he missed the clear laps he could make in Sunagakure. Here only moved in straight lines avoiding every so often a barrier of rocks.

Stopped for a moment, lifting his head and the rest of his body out of the earth. Sitting down cross legged for a moment. Residue chakra still clinging across his body, as he himself knows he was willing to go back down again. His body already to dig down, pierce the earth one more with his jutsu. But, he took a moment to rest. Letting the eagerness of his body slowly wear off until. He had finally calm down.* - Sat Oct 10 10:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) feeling fully rested this time. He then took a moment, before leaning back his head hitting the hard earth. His chakra then spiked out seemingly just on the read. His energy already converted into earth element. Pulling him down, as he sunk under the ground while looking up the sky. It was sort of disconnecting to watch the sky in his view get swallowed by the dark earth. Finally, realizing how alone the genin was when he did this jutsu.

The silence was suddenly aggrevating, as he mindlessly went in a direction on a flat plane. Not going up or down, just slowly drifting forward like he was floating on the surface of the sea. He wished to hear noise, besides the one in awhile groan of the earth shuttering in a movement. <Maybe this wasn't as peaceful as I thought it was.> He said to himself inside his head. His mouth afraid to open to fill in with dirt. His mind having a flash back to the potential Kush, Angio trapped underneath rubble right now.

Ignoring these thoughts the genin pushed forward. His whole body moving in a way to help him move faster in the mounds of dirt.  Still his mind would drift into different thoughts thinking about the solemn nature of the earth. The prison he was so willing to dive down into every day of his life. He then swam forward upwards, quickly breaching through the surface. Pulling himself up, and sitting down in a curled ball. Waiting for himself to calm down, not physically... but mentally.* - Sat Oct 10 10:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) takes a seat at the south edge of Kumogakure again. The village was nearly lifeless, not much to do but sit around. At least, he was managing to scavage some food and water for himself. He let out a sigh admitting that he might just need to leave now. Still, he was waiting for the appropriate time to do such. He decided until then he might as well practice. Quickly fluttering his hands through a series of five seals.

Pulling out the chakra from the center of his body, filtering the energy into nature of Earth. Once he had put up the nesscary storage of energy, and extended it to his seals. He trigged the activation of the jutsu. Chakra pushing outwards into the soil looking for a few of the bouldars that came out form the destruction of the Kumogakure mansion and mountain. Using these as fuel for his jutsu.

He then connected his extended chakra attaching it on to the rocks. Using his energy, he began to pull it upwards into the atmosphere. Pushing them completely off the ground. Three rocks hover over the genin, wavering back and forth. He then held each them for a moment. Before, clenching his hands still stuck in a seal. Controlling his charka through, as he sent out the rocks forward. The chakra chugging them across the empty grounds of the village. Crashing into the earth several feet away.

Using his energy quickly going through the ground to grab the boulders again. He uses his energy to lift them off the ground once more. His body taking deep breathes as he concentrated. Keeping the rocks from falling until he wished them too. His hands and knees trembling as he felt the weight of them, even from so far away. His chakra extending out let out weak signals trying to hold the weight stones up.

Before his chakra completely gave out. His chakra spiked for a moment, shuttering the rocks up and down. The vibrations were only the first sign of movement. All three of the pieces of stone dropped for just a moment, only to suddenly be pushed upwards. Flung through the air once more until they hit the earth with a thunderous crash.* - Sat Oct 10 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) begins going through several seals, building up chakra in his stomach. Extending his chakra up to his shoulders and down his arms into his hands. Building up the energy keeping it in store, as he prepares ready to activate the jutsu. He then uses this pause to send out the chakra outwards across the earth. Grabbing hold over several large rocks. His power raising up above the surface of the earth.

Continuing to hold each of the rocks upwards, as they slowly levitate in place. His chakra keeping them suspended like puppets hanging off of wires. His body shakes for a moment as he puts his concentration on keeping them afloat. He soon then waves his hand out in front of himself. The rocks taking flight, and quickly move forward before they crash in a scattered pattern in front of him. His head shaking at his poor accuracy and precision.

He pauses looking at all the rocks, and nods to himself. He then sends out his chakra against lifting all the same rocks, except for one that was a good distance away from Jirun. He then begins to raise each of them upwards. Then one by one flings each of them forward. Tryin to land them all next to the rock that was acting as target practice. Most of them just missed their mark, while a few flew way overhead.

Taking a few breathes, the genin gathered more energy from himself. Then used it to once again lift each of the heavy boulders for his attack. He then waited a moment to focus his eyes on the single boulder laying out in the middle of the otherwise empty ground. He then brings up one rock, and shoves it across the field at the rock. Completely missing, his chakra trying to adjust for the miss. Throws the next one but still inaccurate, followed by a similiar result from the rest.

He  lets out another sigh, before doing the seals  again having plenty of chakra to spare, as he grabs each of the rocks once more. Lifting them all up above his head, as he chunks them one after another at the center of his target. All of them while having good speed a great deal of force behind them. All completely miss once more, leaving the genin complete flustered and frustrated. Letting out a low groan, as he looks at his numerous failures.* - Sun Oct 11 14:41:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) traveled out of the ruined and nearly abandoned Kumogakure. Deciding their was no future there except despair. His feet quickly hit the road traveling a good pace off the hard dirt of the mountains. Leaving the rocky landscape and heading towards the green Fire Nation territory. Taking out across the field of nothing that seperated the two. When he got close to the territory, he stopped and paused for a moment.

Leaning down he sent chakra going through the earth, errecting two clones of himself. Direction them to bunshin, they change into the shape of two earth shinobi he saw in the village. Making sure both properly wore their headbands in sight. He might change as he left the fire nation, but for now he was sure these would do. He then continued forward attempting to cross the border between the two nations, and head back to his original village. Nothing else left to go to.* - Sun Oct 11 22:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) continued heading southwest on his travel path to Kirigakure. His body and the rest of his clones swerving through the numerous blocking obstacles in his way. His body sadly much more used to travel then he wished by now. His feet feeling like lifeless cinderblocks. Glad that he atleast got a few days rest at Kumogakure before leaving again. While, still groanning that he had to leave it anyways. 

The clones stomped behing Jirun as they finally passed into smoother territory. His feet now stomping on the roads to reach the south. Finding much more ease then the forest bundled pathways hes been using so far. His legs extends up and down bobbing through their travels. His legs carrying him through so many journeys so far wouldn't give up now, as he makes his travel through the lands. Hoping at some point they will finally get him back hoime.* - Sun Oct 11 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) continues on a very familiar road. Going down it with his two clone body guards,  that he uses to continue on his way safely under disguise of being in a group. He lets out a sigh, as he passes through the grounds. Hoping he wouldn't come across the three that wrecked his village and Mizukage in the first place. He was certain if he met them it be certain death if not worse. Taking in a breathe, he had nowhere else to go. It was his only choice... correcting that, his only option. He had no choice in the matter.

Making his way closing in distance he began to notice a familiar envirmorment. He quickly identified as Kirigakure. His feet lightly picking up pace, as he rushes towards the area. Imagining it as some kind of line to cross in  a race. Like if he got this far, he would be safe the moment he took a foot past it. He knew that wasn't really the case, but on the other hand. It was one thing that kept his mind off the fact of the attacks of Kirigakure.* - Sun Oct 11 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) pushes himself to continue feeling himself finally feeling at home in the large more dispersed trees that Kiri had. Much more suitable for moving then the other thicket that surrounded Konoha. His body feeling a slight relief, the tension in his body released in a cleansing wash over his body. Feeling he was much more capable of doing this, and making it back home in peace. Though, he never really felt terrified this was one of the few times he did.

His body shuttered to a stop, as he took a moment to rest. His continous walk having some serious side effects. He took in the energy from biting into his food storage, and drinking it all down with his water bottle. Taking a few heavy breathe a light sweat coming down his brow. He never felt such knots in his stomach. He could only assume it came from his close encounter with a serious and painful death. He... never experienced something like it before. It was really taking a hold of his heart.* - Sun Oct 11 23:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) crawled back into the familiar sight of the academy. Even, if he had to crawl over a massive crater where he knew someone had be blasted to bits used to be. He then came over to the open grounds, burying his head into the wreckage. "Finally....I'm back..." He then laid face down in the dirt for a moment, recovering himself.* - Sun Oct 11 23:05:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) stands up and walks over to the rubble again working on another path. Quickly going through the seals nesscary for doing the jutsu. He then carefully began to lift up the rocks again that were stuck between the opening of the walls. Being careful to lift the rocks, so didn't hover over anyone's heads. The rocks bouncing up an down, as they traveled in the air. Slowly depositting themselves in the corner away from most traffic. While not being far enough way that it exhausted Jirun from doing it.

He continued until he empty up that line up of rocks. His body doing the jutsu again, to continue clearing out the smaller rocks. He had an idea for the bigger ones. But right now, he was just focused on working from small to big. The clearing he made slowly growing in size, as he moved aside the left overs of Koeki's attacks. His mind slightly joking in his head, that it was once again his own villager's mess that he was cleaning instead of an enemy.

He then turns around, looking over to the converstaion between Sanoke and Mizukage with a slight shaking head, before going back to his work. Something  he didn't ask that he should do or some order he was given. Somewhere in his heart it was just making up for the fact he left up in the village. Though, it be hard for himself to guess why he was doing. It was just something he did naturally. A responsibility that came from inside of him. * - Mon Oct 12 01:17:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) leans over charging his chakra for a moment, he then plants his hands on the ground. He takes a moment to take in a deep breathe. He then summons two mud clones out of the earth. He then points them to the largest wrock that was about the size of Jirun himself plus being wider. He then instructs both of the clones to get on either side of it. Both of them wrapping their arms around the giant boulder.

He then lets out a deep breathe, that was as if he was deflating his lungs. He then does the five seals. His focus going entirely on that rock. Placing his chakra underneath it, and pushing it upwards. Even with all his focus on it, he couldn't completely lift it. However, with the help of the two clones they grab on to it pulling up themselves. Using the combine force of all three of them to lift and slowly begin carrying it away.

The mud clones slowly trudging to the side, as Jirun himself let out beads of sweat to continue holding up the massive piece of harden earth. His body pushing the limits of his control and concentration. He continues use his energy from a far to keep it up, as the clones give most of the force to give it direction. Soon they made it far enough to to be a few feet away from the stack. Unable to keep it up anymore. He simply drops the rock. Both of the clone's arms being crushed beneath it. The force enough to dismantle the rest of the clone's body into nothing but pile of mud.

Taking a few breathes, he continues but only one smaller rocks one that one clone nor his levitation jutsu could lift on their own. Using his energy to pick up the rocks, and then have the clone of the genin push them along. Their arms carrying the rock to the proper positions to where they belonged. Taking a few minutes to drop the first rock in.

He continued with another one. His chakra noticably fluttering for those who could see the physical energy. His concentration keeping up another medium sized piece of rubble. Holding it together just long enough for the clone to push the rock the towards the rest of the growing stack. Then, dropping to once again splatter a helpful clone that was only made to do its one singular purpose. Before, the genin dropped backwards to rest and regain his strength.* - Mon Oct 12 01:56:28 2015

The earth began to pull up, as he summoned two brown figures of himself that slowly gained his color and pigment.

One already letting off five seals, as he stands in the back prepared to act when called for of course.

Sending them help removed the mud with their bare hands. Digging up the slowly drying earth in large clumps, as much as they could. Then, using Mud silhouette to pull the very last of it. Jirun himself then used the Flying thrown stones jutsu. Pulling up the rocks that now were nothing more then an empy shell. Throwing them back into the pile with the rest of the stack of rubble.* - Mon Oct 12 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) builds up his boiling chakra into his body. Preparing the stock of energy, as he began to spread out his chakra across the surface of the earth. His hands going through the five seals, sending the energy into his hands. His chakra that had spread across the earth, wait for the signal. Which comes out the moment, that Jirun sparks the energy in his hands. Completing the last handseal, and sending out a large burst of energy through his chakra network.

The chakra that was spread out across the ground suddenly begin to spark. The leylines of chakra, dig into the earth breaking up the surface. Peeling off of the layer of surface raising up a piece of stone off the top of the soil. Making his own fuel for the jutsu, continuing to destroy the surface of the earth to get more rocks for himself to use. Until, he had several rocks levitating in the atmosphere. His head letting out a sweat, after pulling up the rocks.

He then held one out in front of the rest, holding it for a moment. Concentrating a larger amount of chakra on to it. He then leans it back, and then throws it forward with his energy. The rock is taken for a ride, as it travels across the sky until it splashes into the ocean splattering the water.  Several more heavy wet claps of the water come out, as he flings several more pieces of stones into the water.

He then uses the ground once more to his benefit, as he pulls up more of the earth to rip out more rocks. The pieces of stone all flying up in the sky above his head once more. His eyes then turning back to the lake for a moment. His rock, rocks back and forth as he was waiting to throw them. The piece of stone then was pulled backwards, as if it was literally in his hands to be thrown. Then, he slings it off at a high velocity towards the dirt.

He then uses the remaining amount of rocks still floating in the sky. Chugging one after another into the lake. The water splashing upwards with each rock displacing atleast a liter of water each time it hits. The lake quickly swallowing each of the projectiles whole in quick splurts. His teeth gritting as he finally throws the last one into the water, and then letting out a extended sigh.* - Mon Oct 12 14:30:49 2015
