<br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) holding out a seal to concentrate his chakra, the genin filled his chest with a tight firm ball of chakra. Dividing this mass of energy into two halfs, he sent down one through each leg. Passing it through his lower limbs until they touched the top of the soil. Sinking in like roots, the strings of energy quickly took hold of a chunk of the earth. The strands taking the earth like a puppet pressing and squeezing it to their desired need.  Soon the strings lifted upwards, tugging their emotionless earth doll. Breaking through the top of the soil,  and spraying forward the loosened mud int a thick spray that shot forward before falling down into a long line of a mount of dirt. 

Looking at the lengthy line of dirt that source came from him. The genin just quickly let out a small frown, as it wasn't strong ast he girl's that showed him this morning. Building up his energy again, the earth natured boy already pulled out his energy for another shower of earth. The chakra quickly leaking into the earth, building up another usable resourace for the attack. Until the mud, came out of the ground as if shooting out of a broken pipe spout. Showering forward stacking up the already line of thick mud with another layer.

Concentrating his forces energy again, the genin carefully took to watching his chakra consumption when doing the jutsu. Noticing when and were most of his chakra use came from.  Noticing that molding his chakra took the longest part of the process. Though he doubted moving such earth took only a small portion of his energy. Shaking his head free of such theories, he just swallowed the hesistation in his throat throwing out the jutsu. Sending another shootiing layer of mud that this time traveled near the surface going over the small miniature hills of the mound of drying dirt. Riding across it with ease until this one fell a part as well. 

He noted to himself that the molding took most of his chakra about two and a half fourths of the jutsu. While throwing it out with force took the rest of the jutsu along with other natural wastes of energy that came from human error. This time he decided to test something. He spend three fourths of his chakra molding the earth below. Giving the energy the strength to crush and moist the earth even more before, turning what used to be a thick paste. Into a thinner fluid, he then shoot it out of the ground the earth spitting the brown water outwards. 

Leaning back the genin let out soft gasps, as the energy use got to him for a moment. He then recovered having enough chakra supplies to easily continue. He noted the more he loosened the earth before the jutsu the easier it was to send out with force. Thus taking this he began to focus more on how he loosened the earth. This time doing it with another big burst of chakra more then his previous attempts. Using it too quickly break down the soil, shooting it out once in that near transitioning physical state of solid and liquid. Leaning down, as he felt the ease of shooting out with power velocity at the end.* - Fri Sep 25 02:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) bringing his hands up once more to do his jutsu. He builds the energy in his stomach and then down his legs. Already crunching the soil beneath him into a liquid mush to be used for fuel. The chakra tugging the large mound of earth under his control out of the soil. Flying up in the air, as it shoots out from the soil. Maneurvering up and down like the undulations of a serphant, it comes splashing outwards in a debris of particles of earth.

The earth underneath the genin was already swirling underneath him. His chakra already destroying the bonds the held the earth together. Loosening it and dispelling the unnescary stonoes and organic materail. Just manipulating purely the mud and getting it to the thinnest consistancy as possible. Soon the mud would've easily been able to flow in its own river. In this state, the genin then sent out the mud shooting out into a small wave that cloaked the area in front of him with the muddy grime.

Could feel himself grow a handle on this jutsu, getting a little better grip on using the jutsu. Slowly he dropped his concentration seal, and instead just focused on using purely his body's chakra. This would be quicker and less noticable then if he didn't use a seal of any kind. He closed his eyes imagining his energy gathering inside of him. Taking chakra from every inch of his body, the difficulity increasing without the hand formation to bring out this conventration. His body twitching, as he slowly congregrated his energy until his was big enough for himself to use.

The genin then sent the energy downwards into the earth. Without the direction of his hands, the genin had to stand still arms hanging loosely trying to grind the earth with as much finesse as before. His energy was fluxating and its form loose as it took orders purely mentally from the genin. His mind doing its best to work around the such difficulties. It felt his chakra was swirling down their for almost a before he finally managed to grind it to the usual thickness. He then took in a deep breathe that expanded his thorax.

Exhaling out that breathe he had on hold. The genin took his entire concentration on the earth closing off his senses including sight just to grab a mental image of the earth below. His mind gave large tug on the foundation that Jirun stood upon. The earth reeling back, as the chakra gave a sloppy pull upwards. Soon the mass of brown slude came outwards, spraying forward with a noticable lack of pressure as it force was mainly spread out in a wide area instead of a single wave of mud. Leaning back the genin just let out a few sighs, his head falling to rest on his shoulder. Just glad he managed to do that without collapsing from mental exhaustion.* - Fri Sep 25 12:18:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) stands still, as he charges up some more chakra from his body. Standing at a complete still, the only thing moving was inside him as his heart and chest pumped nesscary oxygen through his body. His energy slowly building, pulling faster then he did at first. His body pulling his earthy chakra downwards, the weight of the energy naturally falling with gravity. Sending out the rest of the energy through the soles of his feet.

Spreading the chakra through out the ground below him the energy quickly surrounds an area of suitable soil. The soil warping in a rotating sphere, that pressed inwards on itself. Soon his chakra grabbed this now rotating sphere of fluid soil. Pulling this volume of soil out of the earth, sending it forward in a pressured spray. The high intense wash of brown rising upwards before arcing downwards. The drilling into the grass with a an explosive vigor.

Looked over at the splash zone of mud that was made by his previous jutsu, taking a silent pride for his work. Already building up the energy inside himself again. His chakra already drilling the earth to its will. Sucking out the liquified sludge out of the ground, it shot on in one long stream hitting across the grass field Jirun stood in. Coating a portion of the place in a chocolate brown drizzle. 

Creating another portion of chakra to use the jutsu. He pushes it down into the soil, and blends it up once more. Using the loosened earth, he then filters out of the ground. Sending it flying forward with a mere thought. The river of mud coming out spinning on a concentrated point, a vortex of the condensed mud that quickly splattered on its target coating the area with a pile of the sent out flood of earth.

Actually began to feel the earth beneath him swirl, as he sent his chakra inside to force it rotation. This helped loosened the whole thing, and use the chakra to blast the earth out in the atmosphere. The earth shooting forward until it crushed on its target. Wave splashes into the tree, an never ending flow until every last drop was used.* - Fri Sep 25 15:01:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) did several seals in a row, before sending his chakra down in the earth using his previous mud to his advantage to ease the chakra use on his next jutsu. The chakra soaked into the pile mud, before it began to rise morphing itself in the image of the caster himself, Jurin. Jurin pointed to it ordering it to dodge, the earth genin nodding its head in compliance. The real Jurin then took several steps back away from the clone.

He then forced chakra into the earth, already prepared to send out the jutsu. He then looked to his replicated double, giving him a nod to be prepared. He then closed his eyes before opening it up, and then forces his chakra forward the earth slushing forward at the clone which quickly dodges to the side. The slow moving sludge missing completely.

The genin already building up his chakra, crushing the earth beneath him. He then looked over to his clone. Who was slowly shifting back and forth. Predicting his movements the white haired genin sent the attack to his right guess he jump. Only for the clone to stand completely still, turning his head over to watch as the spray of mid completely miss him.

Bitting his lip the real Jirun gets angry starring at his clone. Quickly filling the chakra, then clapping his hands on the ground to speed the process of the chakra flowing into the earth. He then sent the flowing mud that he used his extra energy to speed up the flow. The clone opening its eyes in fear holding up its hand. Only to have its head taking off body falling apart, as the mud starts to disentigrate. Forming his seals, he quickly rebuilds the clone letting out a sigh as he had to use more chakra to fix the decapitation.

The mud quickly grew to form almost a orb of mud on top of the flat cut end of the neck. Slowly, it was shaved until it turned back into Jirun's face. He made sure it remembered that it was supposed to dodge. He then sent another serphantine wave of mud at the clone. Which quickly jumped out of the way again, and took a few steps back as Jirun pulled the on coming stream of wet mud in the direction of the clone. 

Dropped the stream, as his pulled stream was too slow to catch up to the clones side steps. The genin sent another burst of earth mud to the genin clone. He sent the torrent of liquid soil towards the clone, and as he began to move. Jirun curved the wave flowing it to ninety degree turn. The clone's eyes opening, as it gets taken from from behind. The pounding pressure of the water slowly made the clone lose its figure. Only for the water and figure made of mud, to splatter in an explosion of soil and earthly debris.* - Fri Sep 25 18:50:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) holds out his arms in front of him forming a tiger seal. He gave himself a mental groan noting how much a drain the tiger seal always was. He then built up the chakra, as he faced down the genjutsu's illusion. His head slightly giving a sweat of relief glad seeing this wasn't something intense. He then built up the energy stocking it inside of him, waiting to reach its apex. Once his the limit of his container was met, he sent the chakra on a one way path through his body. The streak of the nerve exciting bolt made a full circuit. Frying his brain as it passed on through forcing him to tilt his head in a twinge of pain.  One hand lifting up to hold the side of his head. <Errghh... I guess I have to make sure it reaches through out my body.>

He then brought up his tiger seal again, holding it out in front of him. Constructing another charge of his chakra. Letting it tieter on being full, he sends the burst out again. This time in a more singular matter. Like a wave of cold water splashing over him, that forces his mind to shock and his skin to goosebump. The illusionary figures disappearing from sight, and leaving the genin just slightly shaking his newly restarted mind. "Bwuah! I guess I really need to work on this. I wouldn't want to be in a battle with a headache. Its already enough of a pain."* - Sat Sep 26 01:01:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) looks over, <She already told me what the jutsu did. Did she really have to shout over here after showing it.> He then held out his tiger seal, charging up the chakra to his feet and through out the rest of his body. His body burning the fuel it had naturally stored up inside at rapid pace. Throwing all that energy at his legs at once he tried to take the distance jump in one single movement. Only, to not move at all and just wear himself out. The chakra not being enough to make the move big enough.

He then tries it again, stealing chakra and energy then storing it all at once in his legs. Then with a quick release, the genin disappears in a cloud of smoke only a few leaps away. His body quickly throwing itself on the ground, kneeling as he lets out loud groans from the bottom of his curling stomach. "Oh-Bwrhh!" He says, rubbing his forehead into the grass wondering when any of this pain would stop. Only to have it slowly subside and leaving the genin quite breathless.

"I...I think thats enough today."* - Sat Sep 26 01:18:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) sending chakra into the earth, spreading it through the dried turf. Slowly earth pulling up, the extensions of mud pressing on the surface. Another large splurt coming out, also pressing only to fall apart as it come out.  The horrible melting figure finally began to stand up, the mud sliding off slowly harden to the body. The chakra inside of it spreading through the limbs and holding the mud in place. Soon, the body took shape and formed another Jirun.

The clone already knew what it was made to do. It watched the real Jirun standing there most certainly charging his chakra. His attention turning to the bottom of Jirun's feet, watching a soon bubbling mud pour over the surface. The cloned tensed legs twisting as the rising geyser of brown mire finally broke its seal on the surface. The clone jumping side to side to avoid the snake muddy stream coming at the clone. Missing the two large curves the real genin could only manage.

The real genin let out a little growl from under his breathe, as he slapped both his palms on the ground. The earth bubbling up and outwards forming into it looked like the ground was about to burst, and it did. The shooting raising mud flying upwards in a upwards angle then bringing it down upon the earth where the clone was standing. Who rolls off to the side only getting splatter by the spray of the thick river landing.

Just as the clone got on to his knees, he looked up to only see another oncoming river that Jirun had already prepared when he sent chakra down the earth for the previous blast of mud. The mud held up its arms, being sent backwards at the lighter attack. The mud clone rolling across the grass, as it barely managed to hold up its from the attack.  Pulling itself on all four.

Jirun didn't seem to hesistate still hunched over on the grass. Chakra pulling up the earth, and sending out the rampaging vortex on top of the helpless clone.  The weight destroying the clone, but not only that the mud stacked upon it. Soon a clump of mud covered the clone locking it in a burial of earth. Jirun lifting up an arm and wiping off the sweat after finally taking out the clone. * - Sat Sep 26 14:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) 's chakra came out of the soles of his sandals. Extending his control beneath the pile of carnage he just made. He restores the state of his clone, letting it dig itself out from underneath the pile of mud it was left under. Finally digging out of its grave, it was met with an oncoming stream of mud that the clone gasped at, quickly using the mud it was stuck in to block the attack of the real Jirun.

The clone angerly glared at the genin, and quickly made another mud silhouette jutsu at the real him. The genin dodged out of the way in the same fashion of his clones, by leaping to the side. He then clamped his hands summoning the river of mud at the clone, who once again countered with his own river of mud. The two streams clashing against each other until both drained of power, and the mud simply stacked itself in a line. 

The two Jirun's stared at each other before running clockwise. Both of the two running in complete circles, as they thought the same. Finally, one of them made the first move leaning down and shooting mud at the other. The other Jirun responded with a quick roll to the side. He then ran up as the stream of mud continued to travel right next to him. He then stopped right in front of the other Jirun, placed his hands on the grass sending a stream of mud from right under him.

The Jirun hit from below didn't defore revealing he was the real one. However, he was flying upwards before being pushed aside by the force. When he came close to landing, the clone was already starting a new one. Just before he touched the ground and would be able to recover. Another stream of muk hit the boy and sent him flying and when the stream finally stopped all there would be was a pile of mud.

The clone smiled to himself walking over to help his real self out of the stick sitatuation. Only to realize, as he pushed away the mud that he wasn't there. He then turned around to see the real Jirun coming out of the earth through the Hiding like a mole no jutsu. He then placed his hands on the ground, squashing the clone beneath another layer of mud. "Yeah... no way I'm reving that clone again... Hes too good." His eyes squint at the pile of earth.* - Sat Sep 26 15:12:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) seperates his leg apart, a tiger seal held out in front of him as he build up a static charge of chakra. He continiously gathered energy, closing his eyes with a small frown curling on his right cheek. Feeling his energy out, he then let it release. Sending it through his body letting it travel around his vessels. The sudden burst of energy dragging along the residental energy that took up the space. Passing through it, and leaving behind new fresh chakra in his body.

Feels the tingling of the nerves as they reset and react to the new chakra flowing in them. He begins a new charge of chakra. He builds it up as much as he can, and  sends it out. The flow of blue energy sparking in quick jumps, the hair rising on Jirun's neck. The cold chill as all the energy is wiped clean and the new energy setting in. His body giving a shiver, before he let out a sigh.

Shaking his head clear which he thought was the point of this justu. He then brings out his hands and hold the seal. Suppling the chakra for the jutsu, he activates the seal with a spark. Sending the energy he had stored through out his body. If someone had touched him it almost be crertain that a static shock would hit the person. His spine shakes and the chills run over his body, before he feels clear again.

His fingers extended upwards to form the tent of the tiger seal, and he already has stocked up the charge of chakra. He took his moment of preparing himself to identify his own jutsu. Just letting himself try and visualize what was going on in his own body. Then he could find a way to improve it just like he did with his summoning jutsu. More then just practice with it over and over until he just stumbled on to an improvement. 

Feeling finally prepared to take the shock, he pulls back the valves on his chakra. Letting them rush though his bod in a overtaking flood. His body could barely handle his chakra vessels stretching to take in the amount of new energy being pumped in. His old chakra swept under the rushing torrent. He then leaned back feeling it travel through out every nerve ending. Then shoot back forward feeling the mental sting of such a reboot of his systems.* - Sat Sep 26 18:02:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) had already was stirring chakra inside of him, pulling the pieces together into one single center. The genin kept his eyes close missing last time how the jutsu traveled through him. Preparing himself for the burst, he lets loose the chakra with activation of his tiger seal. The charge traveling through his body's wiring. Brushing into each nerve ending of his body, sending all the signals in one big burst to his mind. Sending him into a daze.

Holding the sides of his head, as both of his ears rang inside of him. He waited until he recovered into homostasis. He then held up his tiger seal, and the chakra was set at the start line. Activating his seal, the chakra was propelled around in a circuit of thier body. The train of chakra taking an entire course through his body.

This jutsu was jarring to his system, and was no surprise but still.  He did begin to have the faintest sense of the jutsu. Noting how the release of it was done, and the effects it gave him. Pooling the chakra inside him until it filled up his inner vessel. He then pushed it, forcing the chakra to go through him. The vessel of chakra shutting off the valve for each check poitn it made. The pressure forcing to push itself until it made a full travel.

His body trembled after the huge momentumous energy traveling through him. His eyes twitching, as he felt the nerves endings were hit by the chakra. His arms and legs shivering from the shock. Taking a quick  gulp of air, he managed to swallow the pain of the jolt in his head. A few breathes escaping from him. 

Standing straight up on after his mental shock. He prepared another jolt ready to fire. He built up a charge inside of him. Setting it to travel through out his body. Then let loose, firing it forward and true to that description it shot through him. His body constricting and releasing in a whole body systemic shock. He then lifts his head, before dropping it again and recovering with another series of resporations.* - Sat Sep 26 23:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) pulling out his full power of energy in his stomach. He quickly let it flow until it pressed on the tracks to the rest of his body. However, Jirun kept it pent up again those entrances. Building the pressure until it felt like the chakra would bust the valves before he gave the signal. Taking one quick breathe unsure if he would burst by the end of it, he let go of the boiling chakra. Which streaked across the insides of his body tumbling inside of him, as it clumsly charged forward taking over his insides. His circuits only to be described as fried, before he slowly recovers.

Still feeling the intensity of his last jutsu, he noted that he needed to make the chakra more refined. Building up his energy once more, he kept the pressure up but not the point that he had it before. Feeling himself far more prepared for this, he let go of the burst. The shock to his body was much less felt, though it still didn't feel any better then his first attempts. Giving his knees quite the feeling of weakness.

Groaned noting this wasn't getting much better, and the only thing fluctuating was his ability to build up energy faster. He hoped he get the hang of sooner or later, finding the fault must be in his energy shock itself. This time getting a hold of himself. The genin slowly built up chakra, stopping far before his maximum. He then held the energy for a moment slowly molding it inside of him. He made more stream line.  Turning what usually was a ball of energy into more of an arrowhead.

He then put this newly shaped energy up to his valve. He then let it go, giving it only a small push with his chakra. He could definately feel the energy course through his body. Though, he had made it too low for it to be called any kind of success. But it was much more efficent still sending a well enough tingle across his skin. His chakra network not wiped clean, but could feelt it pushed along by this new form of energy.

The genin tried it again, feeding more energy to this new design of his Kai. He then set it ready to start, giving it a harder burst to make it travel faster. It quickly pushed through, the tip of the arrow of chakra driving away anything that got in its way. The genin leaned to the side gritting his teeth feeling the chakra rack through his body. Then to reach his head to send it shaking, before clenching the other side of his waist. Finally free as it completed the circuit, he could easily guess the issue... it was too strong.* - Sun Sep 27 06:19:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) charged his chakra once more, however a notch smaller then what he had before. Forming the arrow head, he sent the sharp charge of his chakra through his body again. Still, he felt himself cringer as the sharp point of the dagger hit into his walls. His body pushing out each time it crashed in its highspeed run through his body.

Letting out another groan as he felt the sting still reside in his body. Feeling himself filled with the right amount of chakra. He changed the shape of the arrow head, and made it more rounded. Making a protective cap so it wouldn't bruise itself against his own body. He then pressed it at the starting point.

Releasing the new designed model of chakra through his body. The rounded point stretched his vessels. The round head still helping to scoop away the chakra. Traveling through his body. Successfuly clensing his chakra and knocking itself against his nerves. His body and mind while still suffering from the effects did feel the freshness. 

Shaking off the chills, Jin once again changed the morphology of his chakra when he did Kai. Making it smaller, he made it fit better in the tubes of his chakra vessel. He also made it more mallable letting it bend through the tight curves and space. Feeling like he had the perfect chakra set-up to do this. He held his tiger seal up in front of him.

Activating the seal, he opens the valves for his chakra to travel through him. Teeth already gritting waiting for some terrible mistake to happen or the since of his equilibrium going out the window. The shock did come however, it wasn't as bad as his original arrow head design. Though it was still too effective, as it not only cleansed his chakra network but overloaded it with a painful bite to it. Taking a few breathes as his brow dripped some sweat. The genin silently nodded that he still needed to adjust it. 

Collecting his energy hestinantly, almost at a slow rater of droplets collecting in a bowl. It took him a minute to actually gain the amount of chakra he wanted. Actually afraid of over filling and the consequences of that. Having the right amount of chakra the he felt was relatively harmless. He took too squeezing and manipulating it to his new design. Then place the rounded core read to be sent through his body.

The chakra traveled through his body. Taking his regular flow of chakra as it came down his pipes taking up the entire space. Stretching and compressing as it enters the various tunnels of the chakra network. He could feel it pass through each chakra point, shocking him as it touch those sensitive areas. Not slowing down one bit until it covered every inch of Jirun's insides, much to his own grief.

Though he wasn't satsfied with the feeling of Kai. He knew he had to work on mastering the techinique by doing this. Learning how to quickly form this energy type to shake off any genjutsu that might latch on to him. He then closed his eyes gathering the right amount of chakra multiple times. With each new ball of chakra, he manipulate it to take the shape of his rounded thin air head design.  Doing it over and over again to set the idea into his mind and body's memory.

Once he felt like he had a grasp on the form, the genin put it to the test. As quickly as he could manage, the genin formed the new shape of his kai. He then sent it down every track of his chakra system. The bullet like chakra rocketing through his body streamlining through his vessels. His nerves shouting a piercing yell into it trying to alert of the well known chakra going through his body. His head shaking until it too was hit with the bump of chakra. Giving him something akin to a brain freeze before he felt the ease of it passing.

Couldn't keep this up any more, giving one last shot of chakra through his body. Just grimacing as he gave the order through his tiger seal. Clenching in fear as the the genjutsu breaking jutsu washed over him. His whole body giving him shivers until it finally passed. Silently thinking that he should hold back training this jutsu any more for now. Needing to take a break from the mind shattering jutsu.* - Sun Sep 27 07:10:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) forms a quick seal to concentrate his energy, and then he disperses through the ground. Something he was quite familiar with from mud silhouette, and then he pulled up the earth tearing it from its roots. He then molded the earth until a form of himself, and told him to quickly run and hide somewhere near by the moment the real one closed his eyes. The real Jirun then slowly slipped under ground diving beneath the surface. With his his closed, he began to focus in on the magnetic pulses shooting around from the area. <I got him.> He then swam forward before popping upwards, his upper chest coming out of the earth. 

Only visible head quickly looked around in the middle of the grass spot near the bushes. He looked side to side, only to finally lift his pupils upwards to see a tiny scared mole on the top of his head. The mole quickly freaked out on being noticed scratching itself off his face. "OOWWWHWWHW!" He shouted as its claw cut him. Shaking it off he grumbles, wondering where his clone could've gone off too before sinking back below the earth with another Hide like a mole jutsu.

Floating freely inside the endless pool of dark earth. His sight cut off, as he closed his mind to his senses to heighten his new jutsu given sense. Trying to find his hidden clone, though he felt smaller sparks he remembered what the last one led to. He tried to stretch out his senses, forcing his chakra outwards trying to catch a glimpse of the magnetic force. The more he stretched the harder it was to maintatin, like building a bridge without the proper support. Leading the genin to give everything to his concentration. 

The genin continued to hold out his branched out chakra sensing. HIs eyes twitching as he think he catches a glimpse. Only to quickly open his eyes, and quickly fling his arms up and down. His legs trying to propel him forward a few more, as air escaped from the corner of his mouth. He then breaks the surface, taking in oxygen as he was left running short while trapped underground. His chest taking as many gulps of air until he felt his body back to normal.

The genin dipped back under the earth with now a full storage of air. He then sent out his chakra to sense magnetic pulses. Literally sitting still trying to find the clone who was now bunking near a group of bushes waiting for his caster to find him. However, this wouldn't happen as a near minute passed by. Marked by Jirun popping back out of the earth, asking for help as the clone came over out of hiding to pull up the gasping ninja to his feet.* - Sun Sep 27 14:56:00 2015
