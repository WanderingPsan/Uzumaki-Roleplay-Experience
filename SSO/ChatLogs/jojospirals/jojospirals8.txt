When the wave finally ended, while soaked. Jirun came out literally unscathed.  

He then frowned lookoing behind him to notice Violet had already gotten out of the way. He then looked down at his soaken body, and then quickly shrugged. He was going to get wet anyways, he wasn't quick enough to dodge. He then sat down back on his soggy cushion for a chair.* - Sat Oct 31 02:34:27 2015

The dark rings under his eyes give off a terrible outline from him. His teeth gritted into a frown that sparks with the limits of his anger. His aura sickening and disturbing, as he lets his hatred leak into the atmosphere around him. Distoring what once was a normal and peaceful atmosphere.

After a few steps, he suddenly stops then takes one breathe. Then, he lets out a sigh. His entire menacing appearence completely fading away. All of his facial anger dispersing into a tired sniffling frown, and shut eyes pointed downwards to the dirt. "I'm too tired to keep that up... ugghhhh-"* - Sat Oct 31 10:36:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) let out a yawn, he really didn't have anything else to really do. He just felt a deep pit in his stomach, as he brought up his hands together. Chakra swirling inside of him, as he got up the courage to take on the jutsu. His fingers lifted up to form the tiger seal. The chakra that he had been building up, surges to the bottom of his legs. His energy sparking as he looks up towards his target goal. An open spot in the middle of the grass.

He closed his eyes, and with one burst of his energy he disappeared. Vanishing in a bustling smoke. His shunshin tracing across the grass until he stopped just barely short of his goal. The genin not putting enough energy into his legs to get there properly, nor enough to stop properly. His body being flung with the speed, as he went across the field. His body rolling like a log down hill, trampling the grass down flat as he was thrown across.

When, the genin tried to get up his body immediately came under attack. His senses were completely distored from the travel. His mind racing to correct itself. The inner balance in the ear completely thrown off, as the speed knocked it around sensless. His head bobbing up and down, as the extra spins his body made didn't help make him steady. However with enough time, the genin managed to finally get back on his legs. Willing to atleast try the attempt once more.

The genin looked at his actions, quickly realizing the mistake. He was scared to go any faster then he had too. On the other hand, it only made his ordeal worse.  Holding back chakra was a bad idea, and he knew this time. His body pouring a lot more of his energy into his legs. Packing them full with a little more then the nesscary amount. He took one breathe, and possibly letting out a prayer under his breath.

He then vanished disappearing once more from his original spot. The genin came out, actually managing to make and stop the spot he wished for. However, his body quickly gave in on him. Knees turning to muscless flesh shaking as they struggle to keep him up right. His head only throwing his body in disarray as his stomach churns. He falls completely on his face, laying their in the grass until he recovered.* - Sat Oct 31 17:33:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) "God damnit...I swear." He says under his breathe, as he concentrated his chakra for a moment. Building up his energy, as he sees the kid leap into the air. He then plants his hands on the ground, as the earth beneath begins to shake. The stones begin to let out loud crackles, as they begin to shake harder. He then watches Arata push back Kyubishu in the air. 

The genin then takes a breathe, and the stones lift up off the ground. They all begin to attempt to collide with the bone user on his side the moment he touches the floor. If they hit then, the stones would begin to stack up upon him until, he was literally covered in a small pile of rocks. * - Sat Oct 31 21:24:16 2015

Gathering the rocks that he had flung at Kyubishu, and pulling the pile off of him at once. Slowly, he put them back in their proper place. There wasn't much he could do for the mud though.* - Sat Oct 31 21:43:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: What the fuck... - Sun Nov  1 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) stopped in front of the Mizukage's mansion. He let out a small groan from the bottom fo his chest. Looking down the stair case that led to the mansion. He walked around for awhile, never really being near such a place. He weaved around the hallways looking for doors that could lead to the cleaning supplies. After some mindless wondering, he finally managed to find a broom to sweep the stairs for himself.

Starting from the top, the genin slowly brushed off the steps. Sweeping the dust off the floor to either the next step or just off the steps entirely. He honestly wasn't one to concern himself with how dirty someone's stairs were. Which made it rather frustrating for him, Jirun forcing himself to do a task he had no care for. He didn't see how this was really helping the village, besides keeping the Mizukage's sandals clean.

Still, he bit his tongue from openly complaining. He didn't really feel like that it was appropriate coming from a runner. He couldn't complain to a village he left to...well die. He didn't even think it would ever come back, but as he looked across at the slowly reparing village. He wondered how long it before, it was back to running like it was before. The thoughts kept him distracted, as he continued to sweep. It wasn't long before, he stepped down on to the bottom ground. He had already ran out of stairs to clean.* - Sun Nov  1 01:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) went back to place the broom, he used to sweep up the staircase, back in the closet. At the same time, the genin took out several trash bags for himself. Stuffing several under his vest, sure they be able to stay there while he did his work. He then shook out one, popping it open to be used. He then went all the way down the steps. Putting on a plastic glove, and began leaning down picking up the trash that laid across the streets.

He looked over the streets, the sides and corners still filled with trash from the long ago attack on the village. There was plenty to fill his bags, quickly filling each of them with plenty of material. Pieces of wood, plastic, and various boxes left out after moving or just being blown away in the destruction. Lifting up the litter off the ground, and throwing it into his bags. Once he filled one, he tie it up and take it all the way to the dumpster. He didn't want any animals to tear up a left over bag.

This time during this mission, he was rather silent in his thoughts. Thinking this was something more appropriate to spend his time. His hand reaching for trash without a second thought. This was the kind of mission he felt born to do, rather then some action packed adventure. Just him lazily doing side missions for clean up rather then actual performances or feats. Once he was done, he slowly jogged his way to the next mission to be done. Throwing hte last bag in the dump as he passed by it.* - Sun Nov  1 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) Heading out to the forest, Jirun stretches both arms out wide like antennas. He lets out one tired yawn. His mind just wishing to finish the last and most annoying of his set of tasks. He opened up the mission scroll in front of him, slowing down his pace to a near snail's pace. Only taking slow steps, the genin trying avoid crashing into the trunk of one of the many large trees. Reading over the description of the lost cat, that escaped his owner's grasp. Shaking his head, as he memorized the information.

Slowly tripped and wandered through the forest. His head trying to duck and weave through low hanging branches, only to manage to smack himself several times. He was not one to be out in the wilderness. He was much more suited for city life, with a clean path in front of him. Here he was looking for a cat in the shade of the trees. Hoping some how, he would finally stumble upon the creatures.

His head tilted down every so often to look for tracks, but he had no skill in tracking. Most of the obvious signs of wild life went past his head. He had no clue to look for, he was completely lost on this fact. His head just slowly surveying the area hoping for once he find something or see the cat. However, he spotted nothing as he head even deeper into the woods.

He didn't head in any other direction. Just continuing to go straight, so he wouldn't get turned around. However, he quickly realized how little ground he was covering. He then paused for a moment, as he then started to build up chakra for himself. He then hit the ground with the chakra, spreading into the deep depths of the earth. The ground began to pull upwards until two clones came up charging outwards from the genin. They then headed off looking for the cat.

It wasn't long after several clone search parties beings sent out. A call came out from one of the clones. Hearing the call, Jirun followed towards the sound. Soon, he came upon the clone pointing to the cat burried beneath the roots of a tree. He groaned knowing that if the clone popped while trying to get it out. The cat could get stock in mud. With a sigh, the genin crawled under. The yells of a genin and the hisses of the cat were heard for miles. It wasn't long before that, a mangled Jirun managed to get out of the forest. Covered in minor scratches and wounds, but still with the mission task achieved.* - Sun Nov  1 01:25:45 2015
