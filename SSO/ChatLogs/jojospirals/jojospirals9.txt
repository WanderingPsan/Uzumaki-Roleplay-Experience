<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) opened up the first mission scroll with a sigh, that could be heard for miles. He shook his head, before rolling it back up. He shouldn't have been surprised to get again, another mission that involved being order to pick up the garbage...again. He didn't mind, it was something he guess he was well deserving of his talents. He once again gloved up and bought some trash bags before heading out.

This time unable to abuse the previous areas, he had already swept tidy. The genin decided to head to the farther outskirts of the village. While, the main streets were always just layered with discarded objects. He also knew the genin would be always swiftly picking it up thanks to all their shared tasks. Instead of the popular choice, his lesser traveled path was quite successful. Those of broken materials from the destruction of village just tossed out of view where plenty to pick up. Besides that, the piles of trash left to rot in the back woods had plenty of time to build up.

The genin continued picking up the trash that was begining to mound up against he tree lines. His nose wretching in the stench of old decay. His eyelids half fallen over his eyes. He seemed lifeless, as he picked up the trash. It wasn't surprising he wouldn't be energetic in this situation. However, he for all his talk about being suited for this job... made him hate the fact. Left picking up for nearly an hour, the compose quickly filled up ten bags which he threw over his shoulder. One by one he carried them over to the dump site.* - Mon Nov  2 19:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) Pulled open the next scroll, Jirun almost groaned seeing the familiar missing pets mission. He shook his head, he thought he could've guessed the third mission was to sweep the steps of the MIzukage mansion. However, he was at least relieved that it was a C-rank mision so it was impossible to be that, which was some what a relief. Finally giving up on hesistating, he headed off to the house where the pet was lost. Quickly hoping, he could nip this mission in the bud soon.

Jirun walked quickly to the house of the owners of the cat. The genin asked a few questions to get a good idea where the cat like to go to and what he looked like. The genin sighed at what he quickly learned. The cat of course loved to go travel into the woods, when previous lost. Shaking his head, he began to have a terrible case of deja vu from the other day. The genin travled head lowered down to the ground, wondering what in the world is wrong with all these animals.

The genin looked at the walls of the trunks of trees in front of him. He took a deep breathe, guessing it was good that he had previous experience with the woods. His mind shutting down as he began to force his way through the shrubbery. This time, he pulled out a kunai striking it across the bark to mark his path. The genin then summoned several clones of himself out of the rich earth of the forests. They all dispersed looking for the feline in hopes that someone managed to pass by it randomly.

The forest then had several skittering copies of Jirun managing through the green rough. Multiple heads peaking around corners to find the feline. Other animals were found by the handfuls from birds and racoons; however, the one cat they were seeking was one needle in acres long haystack. The real Jirun continued to push forward through the heavy shrubbery. He was beginning to feel used to this familiar treck through the woods.

Finally, he managed to find a positive sign for his mission. Kneeling down, he managed to spot a piece of orange fur. Standing up, he continued to follow his path forward. His eyes pointed to the ground, not in a manner of disappointment or grudge but to look for signs. Soon, he began to notice some subtle clues to where the cat went. Claw marks, broken twigs, and bent grass gave the genin a path to walk. Then, he heard the meow of the low feline. Hanging up in a tall branch of a tree, the genin managed to quickly and safely retrieve her with Suimen jutsu. Climbing down with a happy sigh that things went so quickly and easier then the last time.* - Mon Nov  2 19:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) pulled out the last mission scroll, eyes rolling in his head at the thought of what this mission could possibly be. He extended the paper musing in his head if it was to clean the Mizukage statue or to make the streets sparkle. Howver, the answer he found was  so much worse for the poor genin. He read through the information provided through the scroll. His head shaking as he realizes he was to act as a chaperone for some foreign merchant. The goal was to give them a good idea of how the village was doing, and giving them some idea that the village of the mist was safe and profitable to do business in.

He took to walking, he didn't want to keep the person waiting. It would be a bad sign of the village if they kept someone waiting. Not that Jirun really care, he was just a person following the mission objectives. He was a ninja and he accomplish his job,  if he wanted to keep it. His thoughts vanished while he started to focus on his job. His feet picking up his normal sluggish pace to a more moderate one. Reaching the gates where the merchant waited, he was foreign while the gates were being guarded against such visitors. However thanks to the mission scroll and Jirun, he finally managed to get the merchant through the gates.

The merchant was rather pieved at the wait, especially since he was their guest. However, Jirun always the one with little life him didn't react to such rants. Jirun just simply nodded his head to the man, escusing the issues with getting through on himself. He didn't personally care how the man felt about him, he didn't care about many people's feelings about him. Jirun just continued to lead him away from the gates on the path towards the village. 

After his rant, the merchant began to quickly drill Jirun with a series of questions. Jirun tried his best not to lie to the man, though he did fib if the answer was... unfavorable. "Is the village safe." Well the answer would be yes, Kirigakure did have over ten thousands troops. However, Jirun knew even that amount wouldn't keep them safe from the men that attack previously. "How is the village finances?" The ninja are getting missions every day to do more.... though they were all financed by the government.

Jirun noticed the man's eyes were more then ready to peak for his own answers. Though, Jirun wasn't too worried about that as he almost let out a snicker to himself. He wondered if the merchant could even guess what he was doing. His head shifting to the left, almost peering through the buildings in between his little escort service and the part of town still being repaired. He had thought of an exact route, but he was pretty sure he could get away with avoiding the sight of most of the towns worst repair zones. The merchant would only at best get glimpses of those taking material to those sites. 

Jirun then went to all the places, he could possibly think to show the merchant. The first since it was on a nice path, he went to the farms. Showing the large acres that was suitable to farming and the various live stock they had to offer. Going further east, he then was able to show the vast expanse of the forest left mostly unharmed. It was easy access to be used for the  logging industry. After showing off the natural resources, Jirun decided the best was to go and show the facilities to help show their economic and military power.

The genin then led the merchant towards the center of the village. However, he stopped first at the storrage facility where they held the food given to them from amegakure. He then traveled farther south to show off their numerous boats for shipping. Then, he went westwards where he stopped at the accademy. The merchant questioned it, but Jirun insisted that he had towards their new training grounds. The merchant followed, and was quickly wowed by the underground training facility filled with a mountain, lake, and other training equipment. Jirun stating that this was all thanks to their hard earned funds.

Taking out of the academy, the genin traveled around a bit more until the merchant couldn't handle it anymore. Jurin quickly leading him right back to the gates for him to leave. The genin more then happy enough to end the little tour. He of course though stood by until the foreigner had left the view of the gates. Jirun now sure he had left the village safely and happily. Jirun then went back to the academy to wait for the next set of missions.* - Mon Nov  2 19:46:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) began to start his first mission. Grabbing the second scroll handed to him, he knew this take the longest. He didn't want it to reach dark by the time he began his look out. He then pulled out the scroll. Reading the description of the missing pet written in the report. His eyes rolled in back of his head, as it was a very familiar previous customer. His eyes darting to look at his arms which for a day held some nasty scratches. Shaking his head, he just folded the scroll back into his jacket. Walking towards the woods.

His feet stopping on the dime as soon as he reached the edge of the forest. He stopped bursting his chakra to manipulate the earth. Several clones rising out of it, and standing next to him. The clones then let out a sigh, as he nodded. It was the good same old job they were used to. He then pointed in several directions, ordering the groups to go out through the woods. His feet picking as he went forward into the woods himself.

The boy and his clones began to weave through the trees. His hands getting better at whacking away the branches in front of him. He shook his head, going straight forward through the brush. His hand carefully avoiding getting bit by any insects. He was sick that he was actually getting used to this. Biting his lips, he continued to swivel his head on look out for the missing feline.

His eyes adjusting to the shades of the tree. His eyes looking for the color of the cat, that would clash with the greenery. His mind nearly completely empty, as he mindless took care of the job. His other clones were having similiar issues, finding the energy to push through the forest. Their minds all sharing the same disappointment and grief with the mission. Jirun and his clones though soon would nearly cover the entire forest. All them now having a blaring thought, 'any time soon we'll find it... just keep going.'

The sudden call from one of the clones let out a signal that the cat was found. This led to the amplified sigh of relief from every clone .The combined happy laze exhale led to the trees shaking. Running over, Jirun went over to find the spot where the signal was called. He went towards the clone, who waved him over pointing to the cat  once again digging itself in a small hole in the ground. The threatless hisses were ignored, as Jirun grabbed the mission objective taking it back to its home.* - Sat Nov  7 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) Looked at his time, the sun still pointing to the fact he had plenty of time to finish the picking up trash mission, before going to help the elder. His hands forming several seals, as he made several clone handing them each a trash bag plus a stake to help pick up the trash. The group then split up, heading for different streets. The real Jirun plus another clone aiming for the recent sites of the attacks on Kirigakure. The destroyed mansion, plust the violent path of the snake gave easy places to pick up some leftover debris.

The clones quickly got to work on their own area. Each motivated by the split up work, all them happy to have some easier work for once. Though still, they had to keep the pace up. They didn't want to be late for the last mission of the day. Their hands picking up speed, as they shoved their metal spikes into trash. Pulling up the spike, then tapping the garbage loose till it fell in the bag. This helped keep up a nice pace, breaking down the need to bend and huddle over each piece of trash.

It wasn't long before they all converged in the center of town. The real Jirun and his partner clone, getting enough for their bags first. The other two taking a bit longer to find some human waste to pick up. Still, they were all very relieved to see how quick they managed the job. Then, handing his trash bags to the clones. Jirun let them throw away the trash and dismiss themselves, as he headed ot his last task of the day.* - Sat Nov  7 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) leaving his clones behind to finish the trash duty. Jirun paused himself before the house of the elder he was supposed to help. His hand reaching up to knock at the door. The woman slowly stepped out of her house, nodding her head respectfully to the genin even though he was a teenagere. Jirun let out a mental sigh, he was good with getting respect he had found was for no deserving reason. He shook his head at her, at her attempts to thank him for coming just saying they should hurry and do the mission.

Leaving off, she slowly walked her way through the crowds heading towards the market. The elderly woman stating that she was quite frightened from the recent attacks. She looked at the boy smiling a bit, it was quite reassuring to have any level of ninja around. Jirun's frown only growing bigger, as he begins to feel a lot of self guilt in himself. Thinking silently, he really wasn't the right one for this kind of mission. It was probably the most painful out of the bunch, including his several scratches from cats.

Soon, they finally reached the market. The woman was very specific on what she wanted. Her list small and short, as she began to pick out her ingridients for various meals and a few layers of cloth for her knitting hobby. Jurin more then happy to hold on to most of it for her. Feeling like he would hate himself even more if he didn't. The genin loyally following the woman around, no matter how much she pack up on him.

The rest of time that wasn't spent shopping was her stopping and talking with everyone. It seemed she knew every shop keeper in the village. Always, she have something to say to a passer by. So, instead of being a mission based on how much he could carry. Jirun was just being tested on patience. His legs turning to jelly at times just from mere inactivity. Having to let the old woman stand by and talk to all her acquintances.

Finally, the old lady seemed to have finished with her dialogue. What he thought would be a short mission turning into something much longer. Though, he was glad all he had to do was carry this stuff back. He followed all the way inside the house, where he placed the recently shopped items where ever the lady wished him too.  The old lady thanking him happily for doing all this for her, Jirun just shaking his head again. He said it was a pleasure for himself, but secretly as he stepped outside the door. He was happy to get away from her.* - Sat Nov  7 01:00:09 2015

Thinking silently, he really wasn't the right one for this kind of mission. It was probably the most painful out of the bunch, including his several scratches from cats.

Soon, they finally reached the market. The woman was very specific on what she wanted. Her list small and short, as she began to pick out her ingridients for various meals and a few layers of cloth for her knitting hobby. Jurin more then happy to hold on to most of it for her. Feeling like he would hate himself even more if he didn't. The genin loyally following the woman around, no matter how much she pack up on him.

The rest of time that wasn't spent shopping was her stopping and talking with everyone. It seemed she knew every shop keeper in the village. Always, she have something to say to a passer by. So, instead of being a mission based on how much he could carry. Jirun was just being tested on patience. His legs turning to jelly at times just from mere inactivity. Having to let the old woman stand by and talk to all her acquintances.

Finally, the old lady seemed to have finished with her dialogue. What he thought would be a short mission turning into something much longer. Though, he was glad all he had to do was carry this stuff back. He followed all the way inside the house, where he placed the recently shopped items where ever the lady wished him too.  The old lady thanking him happily for doing all this for her, Jirun just shaking his head again. He said it was a pleasure for himself, but secretly as he stepped outside the door. He was happy to get away from her.* - Sat Nov  7 10:26:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) walks over to the residential district. His legs stretching with each step, as he comes over to the door. He always felt awkward knocking on doors of people he never met before. Though last time was... almost pleasent, so he had hopes that this one would be good too. However, this was quickly smashed as he began to knock several times louder and louder to be heard. When finally, "YEAH YEAH! I can hear!" shouted from inside the house. The old man coming out, quickly swatting Jirun in the leg with his cane. "Be a bit more quiter next time I can here you!" Jirun didn't respond as the cane bounced off of him, but his eyes beaded on the man. "Yeah... I'm sorry about that." 

The old man continued to whip the boy to move on. Something that only made Jirun want to slow down. The boy huffing under his breathe, as he just shakes his head. There wasn't anyway this could last long enough to kill him. Another swat did bring out another thought, as he quickly noted mentally <It could last long enough that I will want to kill the old man.>

Finally, they began to stop at the market place where he began to shop. The cranky elder was quite loud in his demands. The man not easing up on any employee that gave him a 'unfair price' or was being 'too slow'. Honestly, Jirun would've felt sorry for them if he too wasn't being hassled. Whatever, the man bought was quickly piled on to the load for Jirun to carry. The man not taking even the smallest object on his person, instead leading Jirun to do so.

Soon, Jirun was stacking many bags upon bags. The man ordering everything from food, clothes, and even firewood. The boy wasn't the strongest man, even though his body was tough of rock. He struggled to begin making steps, as the old man even continued to shop more. His genin donkey continuing to follow, only to be abused more as he continued.

When the shopping was finished, Jirun had bags every where along his arms wrapped in his belt. He even had one in his mouth. The old man then spitting on all this hard work of Jirun, saying he was taking too long. Still, they were finished. Jirun continued back home to the old man, but this is where he was done. The genin dropped the entire stock on the front step of the man. When, the man yelled at what the genin was doing. "I was told to help you shop, not stock up. Thats your own job." He said, before walking off not really carring for the consequences.* - Mon Nov  9 17:25:45 2015
