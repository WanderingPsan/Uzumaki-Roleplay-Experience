Before, he took a dip under the earth. Starting his sensing the moment his head dipped out of sight.

Lines of chakra traveled outwards from the genin, all them searching to take in a stray elcotrmagnetic signal to mark the location of his clone. However, there were so many signals from tiny beeps to more consistant pulses. Taking his mind and focusing it on every pulse he felt. He began to sift through them looking at every one of them with an observing eyes. Slowly forming an image, before pausing his work and traveling upwards for a quick gulp of air.

He then dived back beneath the earth again. Feeling the signals, he began to map out the area beneath him. First acquiring the geography of the place he was working with. Noting the the small brief glimpses of plants and trees. He then worked his way on the smaller signals. Noting those that appeared to be the frisk moving insects and animals that took shelter inside the depths of soil.

Popped back up out of the surface. Taking a few quick breathes before reeling his head back. He pulls himself under watching the radar like signals that he notes every so often. He soons gets a better image noting the bigger animals, and one pulse that was different from everyone else. Smiling, as he turns to the direction of the clone.

Quickly flaying his arms and legs, pushing towards the direction. Jirun slowly pulled himself out of the earth behind the clone. He came fully out, grabbing the clone by the leg. The clone jumping in surprise as it was found. Then the genin quickly dismissed it, returning it back to its original muddy form.* - Sun Sep 27 15:50:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) walked out back to the clearing where he trained, and summon another mud clone for himself. Just like before he told it to hide. He then closed his eyes and cloaked himself in a minor layer of chakra. The chakra slowly push away the dirt from beneath him and away, as he slowly was dragged into the earth. Finding himself in the familiar darkness he took not time to getting to work. 

Closing his eyes he formed his chakra network to pick up magnetic signals. He then quickly swam to a big notable spot, coming directly towards the clone that tried to sneak even further away. However, unable to mask his magnetical prescence the real genin popped out right in front of him. Catching him a matter of seconds from beneath the soil.

He then decided he was too good for just one opponent. He then summoned two more clones quickly sculpting them out of the earth. He then told them all to hide while he would go off finding them one by one. When they left view, he dove below the soil's surface once again. Taking shelter in the surrounding rock and debris.

Tightening his concentration to its peak, he quickly sent out a blast of energy to pick up the signals giving out the surface. He quickly picked up two targets on his radar, quickly swimming below the soil and coming up on one of them. Touching them to signal they were found, before going under the earth again. Traveling the complete opposite way and tagging the other who was hiding behind a building. He then came up only for a quick breather, before he fell below the surface again.

Holding his head underneath the earth, he tried to find a signal. He began to swam but still he could only sense the two clones on the ground that were standing still.  He continued this until he came back to earth for another tank of air. Then fell bellow using his lungs supply for as long as he could. Continuing to travel in the area that he must have been in, but still he found nothing thrugh magnetic pulses.

He then closed his eyes sending a blast of chakra to force his range to increase. However to only recieve nothing. He then knew the last clone must be out of his range. So he held in his chakra building it in more and more, feeding it all the energy he could. He then let it go in explosve shockwave that pushed out of the ground and into the atmosphere. The returning signal as it reacted to magnetic waves quickly pointed out that one clone was up and the tree, and Jirun quickly jumped out of the earth and tagged it as well.* - Sun Sep 27 19:41:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) doesn't notice the Violet's death stare, and just continues looking forward. Trying to find something interesting.* - Mon Sep 28 17:48:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) puts his hands together to form his tiger seal. He finally felt his head was clear enough to start where he left off.  Driving up the chakra in his chest, he builds up the energy he needs for the burst of chakra that travel through his body. He then prepares the energy at the entrance of his vessels. Giving himself one quick run of his progress, performing the jutsu. Sending the energy through his body, pushing up the explosive chakra through out his body until it raced a full track around him.

Shivered as the pulse pushed through his body. Recycling the chakra that was in slow circulation that was already lying inside his body. He took a few breathes remembering the headaches the jutsu caused for him. Silently shaking it off with nothing more then a scowl on his face. Feeling himself recovered, he leans down slightly before standing straight up. Letting out another breathe, before holding his hands back into their designated seal.

Perked his attention to the inside of his body, concentrating his mental vision of it. Stocking his chakra to the level he thought was best. The genin took a moment of silence to manipulate the chakra. He the squeezed it with a powerful shot of his chakra. He then  squeezed the vessels propelling the chakra through pure tension. The blue mallable energy taking its course with great speed.

The energy quickly slides through the maze like tubes of his chakra network. Passing through it with astounding speed. Pushing forward as fast as it can. The chakra makes an entire treck through his body. Passing through every checkpoint and nerve it could manage. His spin letting out a resonating chill that sends vibrations through his body. Leaving his teeth clattering after the experience.


Recovering from the shake up, the genin takes a seat to rest. Thinking hes pretty much managed to make this jutsu chakra sufficient. But, not able to handle its effects on his body and mind. Letting out a tiny yawn from his early morning daze. He decides to let his mind rest for a moment, and come up with the plan the moment he decides to train again.* - Fri Oct  2 13:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) lets himself fall backwards on the grass. Spreading his arms and legs out as wide as he can before letting out a yawn. His white jacket fleshed out behind him, revealing the white t-shirt and black vest he wore beneath it. His light silver blonde hair falls out behind him. His head slightly tilting backwards to spot Lera. He waves a hand, whose arm doesn't even move an inch still laying outwards on the earth.  "Oh hey there Lera... didn't see you there."* - Fri Oct  2 14:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hey there. - Fri Oct  2 14:12:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) flops over on his front side, and pushes himself up. He then goes to standing hunched over and rubbing the corners of his eyes with the back of his hand. "Well want to train together or...something. I don't know anthing is good with me." he says in the usual droning tone.* - Fri Oct  2 14:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *shrug* Depends on the training. - Fri Oct  2 14:19:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) lifts up his hand, and nips on his thumb causing a tinge of blood to come out. He then stamps his hand on the ground a series of seals coming out from his palm. Then with a sudden poof, a new rabbit shows up not the normal Izumi. This one was was large and covered in fluff. One couldn't even see its legs or its neck. It was just one ball of fur. The bunny stares silently eyes big and round.  She then speaks in such high voice that one may believe it was pure helium. "Master! Why have you summon the great, Jinia!" Jirun rolls his eyes. "What should I do training wise?" he asks it. 

The rabbit then closes its eyes and lets out a verbal hum that buzzes out loudly. "With my might eyes that see everything.... You should... train more of your summoning jutsu." 

Jirun "Sighs... I already mastered it. Izumi told me so." The rabbit...then goes silent.* - Fri Oct  2 14:29:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) looks over to the sound of the summon appearing behind him. He looks over letting out an "Awww.... wolves are much cooler then rabbits." He then hears a sharp shriek behind him. "Master! Master! Carry me away from this wolf!" She says trying to budge but her fat and large fur making her incapable of moving. Jirun sighs, and picks the rabbit up. Placing her on top of his head, making her look like a furry cap for the lad.

She then presumably points down to the wolf. "Hahaha! You canines can not possibly fight the combined power of my universal sight of Jinia and the ultimate power of my master!" 

Jirun ignores the shouting rabbit and just says "Why are their so many people starting with J in their name?"* - Fri Oct  2 14:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) stands still as the rabbit shouts down from the top of his head. "Oh please! Us rabbits are the ultimate summon isn't that right Mas-"

Jirun "Yep pretty cool. Do you get to play and pet them all the time?" He says lookin over to Jenna being scratched.

Jinia jaw drops "Master! Ho...how could you!" She begins to tear up, only being stopped by Jirun petting her back. "You're cute." Jinia turns her cries into a sniffle. "Cuter then wolves... thats for sure." she whimpers.* - Fri Oct  2 14:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yes I do get to pet her all the time. - Fri Oct  2 14:51:18 2015

However, he holds it in letting it build up inside him.  He then looked over his body. He didn't seem out of position, and his seal wasn't out of order. He then took a breathe and took a look inside himself.

He looked over his body, and how the energy of Kai always seemed to back fire on him. No matter how low in power it was. He then decided the only way was to prep his body to handle the blast of chakra. He began sending chakra around his vessels. Giving them a small layer of protection.

Now fully surrounding his chakra vessels with his energy. The genin then concentrated the blast to the entrance to that puzzle of routes. Holding the seal and sending some chakra into the seal. The spark activated the chakra sitting in his chest. This sent his molded chakra through out his body, and reset the circuit of his chakra flow completely. The chakra around his veings was push and pulled, and still he manage to feel the tinge of the energy being rushed through him. However, he could already feel the difference of intensity.

Was already for another attempt. Clenching his hands together in a tight hold. He charges the energy into his chest first. He then molds it to his will forming it to the most suitable shape for clearing through his body.  He then adjusts the level of the energy making sure it wouldn't be harmful to his body. Analysing it for a moment he feels it was completely balanced.

He then spread the chakra in an equal level across his chakra network. Letting the energy form a shock absorbing layer over the travel route. He then empowers the energy that he was using to protect his insides. He then closes his eyes, and lets the chakra race through his body. Letting the energy go wild with it speeds. He clenches his teeth waiting for the buzz that he thought would run through him. Only to open and realize that he had done it, he had mastered Kai.* - Fri Oct  2 22:09:55 2015
