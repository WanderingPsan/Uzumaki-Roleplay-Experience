A whistle would escape his lips, when the sudden return of the caravans forced him to look up.

Seeing Hachirou, he just lay his head back down.* - Fri Nov 13 03:08:09 2015

However, Jirun's skin was nearly rock hard though he couldn't ignore the damage off of his throat. The boy flailing out of position, as he takes several moments to cough. Completely exposed to another attack if Hachirou wanted to try it again. Though, he was hunched over so hitting his throat was a rather hard possibility.* - Fri Nov 13 03:31:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) looks at the massive beast coming towards the village wall. He looked at the creature with a rather look of disbelief that something so stupid and ugly could exist. Though, as for his mental integrity being broken. Well, that was far long gone for that to happen now. He then turned to the other two that are here, and stated. "Yall should probably go."* - Sat Nov 14 18:41:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: What you gonna' do, talk to it? - Sat Nov 14 18:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Well, I mean if its pretty talkative. I won't mind a good chat. - Sat Nov 14 18:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) watched the war of jutsus begin to be released. The reature easily destroyed the several defenses that Kirigakure had at its disposal. He then looked completely impressed by the fact the beast manage to take them all with nothing more then a yelp of pain. His eyes focusing on how the beast was sealing the wounds it made. The dark chakra that hit him suddenly opened his eyes reminding him of Koeki.

"Maybe they should stop attacking....It looks like they're just making it angry." He says continuing to take out a seat.* - Sat Nov 14 18:49:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Well, it only destroyed the defenses.. and we attacked it first. - Sat Nov 14 18:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Hell, it hasn't even damaged the walls yet. - Sat Nov 14 18:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: But...now with them trying to blow it to kingdom come...I don't think it will let us off with just an apology. - Sat Nov 14 18:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) watched as the creature was clearly beginning to do something that looked like an obvious attack. He then turned his head to the men attacking on the walls. "RETREAT YOU IDIOTS!" He shouted loudly, the first time he had expressed any emotions in awhile. "God damnit.." he says as he stands up.* - Sat Nov 14 19:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) gets pulled backwards by kana, she notice his body was almost limp towards the movement. He had no energy to fight back, as he was taken away from the area. "Damn.... just like before."* - Sat Nov 14 19:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) thinks: Hahaha. - Sat Nov 14 19:14:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) thinks: We're all going to die! - Sat Nov 14 19:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) when Kana finally stopped pulling him, he looked at the oppening in the gate. He shook his head. "If that thing entres the village and people try and fight it, innocent people will die." he said, as he began to work out a few seals. He then placed a hand on the dirt. A mud clone rising from the soil, of where he stood. "Maybe its not too late to reason with it." He said, sending the mud clone out towards the beast.

<Hmm...wonder if that acid breath hangs around in the air.> He said watching the clone to see if it just start melting before it could complete  its task. Which was to use Mud silhouette to draw an arrow to go back and if allowed to live long enough. Start shouting apologies and warnings to go away.* - Sat Nov 14 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: And, I hope it doesn't have a sentient brain because if it hears you.  It will kill you first and- - Sat Nov 14 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) presses his hand on the ground, a Mud silhouette spraying a rive of mud in front of Rosa. "Just let me try something, before we start a war where people will die!"* - Sat Nov 14 19:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) //clone notices the mouth being open. The genin's clone presses its hands on the ground. Mud begins to shoot up and hit it into its open mouth. Hopefully distracting it, or pissing it off that it brings its attention to the clone.

Jirun on the other hand stood up looking around. He really was too slow to get out of here. His breathe letting out a shaking sigh. He began to think this really was the end for him.* - Sat Nov 14 19:29:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) began to channel chakra to himself. The energy building up in him, as he watched the battle began to go. He had no enjoyment at trying to help Ortho with something. On the other hand, the beast was risking on destroying the village. He shook his head, as he stood still beginning to work through a series of six seals which took him awhile, as he twisted his fingers into the seals. He was  not even sure if what he was about to do would even work. Though, he helpedi n the laast bit.* - Sun Nov 15 00:21:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) finishes. His jutsu seals, as he then plants his hands on the ground. He then sends out his chakra through the earth. He then begins to break the ground, pulling out slabs of stone from the soil. He at first thought to attack Nigen, but he then realized the floating aircraft trying to yank Ryutaro. He took a breathe, and then sent the rocks hurling at the spinning blades above it. He had no clue how the thing worked, but was sure those were how it kept afloat. 

Once, the rocks began to fly at the winds trying to block its rotation. He then press his hands down, and attempt to shoot mud at the winds as well to only further clog them up.* - Sun Nov 15 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm? - Sun Nov 15 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Why do you call for me?!~ - Sun Nov 15 01:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) summoned an earth clone of himself. Building up his chakra along with the clone, both of them planted their hands on the ground. He didn't have any ability of flight or a way to ascend himself closer to their level. Instead, he just had to do his best from the ground. His energy began to liquify the earth, holding it steady as he waited to see if there was any retaliation at Kana. If he saw anything he could try to prevent, he would shoot two mud silhouettes in hope of intersecting it.* - Sun Nov 15 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Slither-kun..you know I can't stop until..that slug is delivered.. - Sun Nov 15 01:43:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) watched seeing that there was no counter attack to Kana, meant that they were just focused on the anchored Ryutaro. He knew their defense was near unbreakable with those walls. However, he wondered how they would handle two attacks from different sides. 

He and his clone moved northwest for a moment. They both began to pull out the wave of mud that they been making using the earth below. Two rivers of mud, rose up attempting to once again clog  up the chopper. Both rivers striking from the north while Kana did another attack from the front of the aircraft. * - Sun Nov 15 02:10:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) took several large breathes, as he watched once again his jutsu canceled. He shook his head to see how Kana was doing, only to notice her sudden fall to the ground. He and his clone hit the ground once more, a flood of mud would come and rest under the growing shadow of the falling female shinobi. Hopefully, the extra mud would act as a shock absorber for Kana to 'safely' land.* - Sun Nov 15 02:26:20 2015
