<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) took a seat with three pieces of paper next to him. He then picked up the first sheet of paper holding it in his hand. He then flashed back, going all the way to one of the early years in the academy. Remembering holding the chakra paper only for it to crumple away into dust. He knew regular paper was in no shape like chakra paper. But that was the important part, it wouldn't be easily suspetible to the most minor amount of chakra. He wanted to train his chakra element.

Channeling his chakra to his two hands. The genin made each hand a container for a portion of his energy. His mind closing as he tried to concentrate it in such an area. His mind's eye focusing its maximum attention to his chakra network. Closing off the normal pathways, and trying to divert as much as he can into his hands. The energy only slowly coming in and gathering. The small pieces of his energy soon came more noticable only after a long period of time.

Continued breathing slowly as he tried to manipulate against the natural flow of his body. His hand slowly crickling the paper, as his extra chakra increased the pressure his fingers had on the sheet. He continued trying to concentrate even further on his finger tips. However, just the slightest slip in his concentration disperses the chakra. All of it either going back with the flow or simply disappating out of the hand.

The genin bit his tongue for a moment, just out of quick disappointment. He then took focus again, magnifying his intensity on his finger tips. Squeezing the energy out of their vessels, and pooling it into his hand. He then had to press himself even further as he brought the energy to his fingers. All ten of his fingers, were unstable with their flow of chakra. That if someone could see it would notice how fluxated the energy was. Spiking up and down as the perimeter of the contained chakra met different resistances for it seeking an escape from its confinment.

Continued to do his best to hold on to the chakra in his hands. The energy seeking for some point to break, but Jirun wouldn't let it. He continued hold it while trying to cut off extra flow to feed the untamable energy. Seeking to hold it just a bit longer, so he can then work transforming it to Earth nature. Only for the sound of a loud rip to disturb all his work, and the sheet of paper now in halves.* - Sat Oct  3 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) sitting down he pulled out the second sheet of paper he had. Holding it in his hands, as he slowly began to bring the chakra to his hands.  Syphoning more of his body's natural energy into his hands. Chakra's finally taking place in his hands, still sporadically searching for some exit to take. Jirun closing his eyes trying to enforce the chakra around his hands give it a shape to be contained in until he was ready to send it out on the paper.

Chakra was still acting erratic turning and around in his hand without rest looking for somewhere else to go too. His chakra pressed on the small layer of control the genin had. The forehead of the shinobi dripping with a bead of sweat, as he gave it his all to contain it back with his hands.  Only for a small dent in his hold on the chakra to break wide open. The chakra seeping through his fingers. His grip charged by the new energy quickly shreds the paper apart, and leaving the genin with one last piece of paper.

Taking his last paper, Jirun let out a sigh. He then held it in his hands once more. Chakra being led straight to his hands again. Being herded together the particles of chakra quickly grew into an absorbing sponge. Taking in more and more and growing to the point it was already a too full to take in anymore. His hands twitching with sparks of pain as they tried to hold back the energy. 

His energy pushing to his tips, he slowly let out the chakra. Letting it fall through out the papers. The energy of both hands slipping into the middle of the paper. The energy was making the paper waver very so subtly, as he tried to limit the flow coming from his fingers. Trying to keep it the so leak he had currently. The chakra still crossing in waves over the paper. His fingers slightly shaking as he held on to the frail sheet, and with one slip of his chakra he tears the paper in half. 

Shakes his head picking up one strand of the torn paper. Holding it up he gives it one last shot at trying to send earth element into the smaller portion. His chakra quickly making a conection between the two chakra holding hands. Like the link of  electricity between to points of energy. His energy shooting back and forth over the paper. Jirun then began to think of how to turn his energy into to earth nature. Only able to think of trying to pull out what hes done for jutsus before, and to just try and manipulate it to feel like he believed earth energy to feel. 

Jirun began to try and morph the moving energy coming out of his finger tips. Concentrating on making it slower moving. More stable in itself, and just imagining it taking on the form of earth. His energy did slowly turn to a more humble speed, but it didn't change into his nature. He continued to think on how he did his jutsu, how his chakra fed into the earth. Increasing his strength on the paper, only to lead to once again ripping it with pure grip pressure. "I guess I still need more work on chakra control..."* - Sat Oct  3 16:46:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) stepping outside to do some more earth jutsu training. The genin quickly forms a series of seals, before hitting the ground with his hands. Chakra sparks from him to form three clones. He then tells them that hes extending the range they can go. They can also use mole jutsu like he was going to do. He then sends them off, forms a seal then dives under the earth. Resting there for a moment to give the pulsing energy above his head to disappear.

He then sat there in the floating abyss of earth waiting until finally the magnetic pulses stopped. He then popped his head out and took one breathe, before cloaking himself with chakra yet again. Looking over to the northwest and the south. The two directions he watched the clones split up in. He took a quick descion to go after the one to the south.  Swimming off towards him under the ground, learning to use his chakra to push through the earth even faster. 

He traveled in a long line along the shore of the island that he had limited the clones to stay on.  His body every so often lifting up out of the dirt to take a free breathe only to dip right back down. It seemed the clone had avoided easy detection on the flat beach. Turning around, Jirun decided the best way to cover ground was to swim diagonally. At the very least he would cut the space he was looking for in half. Then he could continue wittling down areas to search until he found him.

Continued down the path he had set for himself, flying through the earth only turning out of his way to avoid the foundations of the buildings. Finding himself going in a stair case pattern down the streets. Yet, after passing through the entire town. He still had not found any signal coming from the clone he was looking for. His head popping up on the side of the street with a frown sketched on him. He shook himself and decided that the best way would to just travel northwards now. He said pulling himself out to recover his chakra for a moment.

Once recovered, the genin easily sunk back under the earth. Chakra quickly pulling apart the physical space of the world itself.  He then swam upwards heading to the north, as he this time went in a snake like patern. Using the best of his ranged tracking skill to find the clone, making sure every inch of the northern triangle he had made with his path was searched. Yet, even once he had cleared the entire area there was still no clone. He pulled himself up again, and nodded that left only one place left for him to go, the south.* - Sun Oct  4 18:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) Finally headed towards the southern end of the village, flowing unseen under the surface. Suddenly, his head perked upwards to the left. He coudl feel his other self hiding in between two buildings. He quickly popped out and came running at the scared clone of himself. Who quickly tried to use mud silhouette to slow him down. Only to have the weak attack pushed aside, and deemed captured. 

Taking a seat he dismissed the random clone he had. He then sat down, and began to recuperate from the continous earth swimming. His chakra needed a break to recover along with his physical body. Laying back on the dirt as he took a few heavy breathes. His lungs squeezing up and down pumping air back into his body. His eyes closing imagining his clones snickering in their hiding spots. Pulling himself up, he slipped back into the underground and went towards the area of the south he had seen them going.

Traveling for a few minutes using several strokes of his body to push him forward. He quickly got a quick spark to his attention. A magnetic pulse coming from the farthest reach of his range. He turned to face the direction and gave chase. Every time he got close enough to sense him the other would dart away. It didn't take Jirun long to realize that this clone was under earth like him. Deciding chasing until he drowned under the soil wasn't smartest thing to do. He popped his head upwards and took several more breathes.

He then concentrated extending his range of his sensing. Trying to force itself to extend so he would have an upper hand on the clone. However, it was fruitless he had reached his peak at the moment. He took a moment holding himself in a frozen state, sitting waiting in the stillness of the earth. He then decided he would have to cut the clone off. He then used the last point of where he knew the clone was. Going completely around him to push him to the west. The genin then swam sending the dot on his radar forward. It ran away until it finally stopped in front of a street of houses on each side.

The clone looked worriedly wondering if which was his purser would come from trying ot keep up his magnetic radar. Suddenly, it hit him coming from down the street. At and angle as if at some point to push him into the wall of the street.  He decided to continue looking for any escape. Finally, he saw a turn come up ahead. Taking the new route immeaditly, he thought he had found escape only to stop and find that the alley he had taken was blocked off by the walls of one of the majore buildings. Popping up to jump over, it was too late his leg being caught mid leap. THe clone disappearing at the touch.* - Sun Oct  4 18:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) shoved out both arms out of the earth, pulling himself out of the liquid state his chakra had left the Earth in. He sat there rubbing his face. His cheeks were beat red from all the swimming he had done. The exercise and blood boiling chases were absolutely exhausting. Though he was comforted enough to know that most of the village was already looked through. So the last bit would take very little time. 

He then let out a confident nod that he could end this soon. Building up his chakra the genin then took to going under the surface of the earth. Plunging into the rock and dirt ocean, and quickly going to swim through it. Using his chakra to help push him forward, as he headed further to the east. Looking at the one area the other clone must have been in, since he had searched every where else. 

Looking around the area he was sure the clone must have been in. He traveled the streets, using his magnetic vision to find any sign of a person. He found numerous ones sensing people in their hoems or walking the streets. But, none that gave off the same pulse strength of his clones. Pulling up mid-way through the search he took another break. Though, his mind did wonder if he may have skipped a spot to look. Wondering if he had made a very foolish descion.

Continued looking examining the area he had left. Going up and down the streets twice just to make sure he didn't miss a spot. However, he had looked all over this section of  the map. There shouldn't have been anyway he had missed one of them. He then thought for a moment. His mind then clicked, and he let out a groan it would be something one of his clones would do.

Keeping in with his deal, he swam back to the north. Going all the way ignoring even searching for the missing clone. He was certain where to find him. It wasn't long until he actually found the place they started at. There lying in the grass was the other clone sleeping, Jirun figured he must have backtracked after the first clone or second was caught. Then waited here. Not even letting him wake up. Jirun dispersed him.* - Sun Oct  4 18:31:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) pulled out three brand new pieces of paper. The genin took a seat at the docks, feet hanging off the end of the wooden boards.  Holding the paper, his fingers were strating to be charged with chakra. In a few momemnts, the blue energy had already taken home inside of his fingers and palm. The energy were then sent to travel through out the paper from both sources soon the paper itself was taken in by the chakra.

The genin then focused on just holding the chakra. Letting it rest there and no leave his control. The energy just resting itself in a slow circulation. Energy went through both hands going back to cycle through his body. The paper soon becoming an external route for his chakra to take, as it bounced back and forth from the left and right. His inner chakra feeding this movement to Jirun's discretion. 

Continued hold this rotating chakra, letting it stay in stability. Waiting to make sure his control over it was perfect not even letting himself wrinkle the paper. Feeling confident with the energy movement of the paper. He then closed his eyes going back to trying to change his chakra to its nature. Trying to seek to conform the normal chakra into earth. Concentrating on what chakra he sent to the paper still trying to only give in the normal circulation.

Kept his sight sealed off, letting his mind ignore the distraction of his vision. Instead he began to feel the chakra deep in the center of his body, the source of all energy. He began to grasp it, holding it trying to bring it together. Gathering the energy that felt different, chakra that was heavier more solid. It gave force and weight to something that should be weightless. Its power could be felt but at the same time a sturdiness... control to what otherwise should have none.

He then began to bring out the chakra. Taking it slowly to his hands, splitting it in half and bringing it to his palms. He then took a moment sensing the flow of his chakra across the paper. He then waited for a moment, before sending the earth chakra through his finger tips directly pumping it into the flow of the chakra on the paper. Soon before Jirun's very eyes, the chakra paper began to disentigrate like it was infected with some horrible poison. The earth chakra destroying any bonds it had, and turning it all to dust. Fading away in Jirun's very grasp.* - Sun Oct  4 21:03:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) looked at his two hands, the same ones he been working with manipulating his chakra into earth nature. He took a moment bringing chakra into his hands, as he held it there. The power coursing in a slowly building container. He then took a moment only managing to transform some of it into that heavy earth nature. The movement of his chakra noticable slowing his hands, as the chakra element began to build in his hands.

He then moved the energy through out his body, moving slowly transporting itself towards the bottom of his feet. The energy seeped into the soil, finding a natural home inside of the earth. The chakra quickly chained to the earth, mixing and demolishing the earth to a liquid state. With ease, he raised his hands a bubbling rise of mud came out of the earth in front of him. Then with a quick raise, he sent out the wave of the flowing earth forward a greater quantity was made but the speed was still notable slow. Still, Jirun could feel the difference in ability.

The genin built up his chakra once more, sending it to his peek. He then manipulated and pulled out his earth nature once again out of his source. Pushing this energy, he placed his hands on the grass. Then sending his chakra deep into the roots of the grass past the top soil into the deeper layers that timed had stacked so tightly. He then used the earth nature to pull out two earth pillars. Both of which begin to dissolve much quicked into the form of Jirun himself.

Looks at the two clones, asking them to move around. Which they did, moving their arms and legs feeling a new since of easeness to it. Seeing it was going well, he quickly dismissed all the clones. He then did another group of seals, before disappearing beneath the surface. The little earth nature chakra seeping out of his body eased the descending into the Earth. The earth pulling apart and floating beneath the earth. He then pushed himself back to the surface.

Sat down pulling out one of the papers he had used before. He then put chakra thorugh the paper it was much quicker getting a better grasp of sending energy out like this. He then brought out the nature. Pulling what he naturally had inside of him, focusing this chakra into the paper. He then made it disentigrate into dust with  one burst of that nature energy on the paper that made it self destruct. Disappearing into the wind as it fell apart into sand.* - Mon Oct  5 14:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) pulling up is hands, he gathered the chakra inside of him again. Building it up until it was a rotating vortex inside his body. The moving chakra slowly grinding to a hault, as he then focused on the energy he had built up. The shinobi then pressured his chakra, condensing it. The movement it had now finally stopped. He then began to transform the chakra, changing it from its normal properties slowly making it into earth nature. 

Though the portion he created was completely imbalanced. The energy that went into making the chakra nature was far more then what came out. He had the idea to make more then just one clone using purely this energy, but he didn't have enough to perform that. Instead he let out a sigh, and did a series of seals. Then leaning over, getting on his knees before placing my hand on the grass. Then, channeling his energy into the earth. He let soak until the ground absorb the chakra he had come up with.

Then pulling up on the earth, manipulating the chakra from within the earth. Jirun gave rise to a pillar of mud his height. It quickly in a puff of smoke that covered the pillar leaving only the sight of its silhouette being projected among the billowing grey. Once it cleared, the clone stood there while it didn't look much different. Jirun could feel the difference. It felt much more improved though he couldn't put his thumb on why, besides how little chakra he had to put into it. 

He then sat down, looking over to himself wondering what it could be that made the clone seem much more notable. He then decided to test it out. He then took a few steps back, and charged his chakra again. He then placed his hands on the earth, and pulled another clone using his normal nature. He then ordered the two to fight. He watched, and within a moment the fight was over. The clones exchanged attacks, but the Earth nature clone overpowered and outsped the normal clone.

Let out a quick gasp at how fast it was, and began to notice how poor in quality his own clones were. He didn't put enough chakra to let the clone perfomr its own jutsus, but he was sure just like with his other jutsus. If he could master earth element chakra. They become much more stronger and easier to perform. It was clear he had a lot left to learn, even though it didn't appear that way.* - Tue Oct  6 10:55:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) looked over at the mess that was going on, and was clear to figure he was way out of his league in this fight. As he saw two people begin to literally glow with chakra, the other people summoning puppets with scythes. Then chains popping out of the ground, and taking someone else out of here. Was rather too much for him, and he knew it so he quickly took two steps to the left. And began walking out. He was sure the others could handle themselves, one was the Mizukage after all.* - Wed Oct  7 02:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) continues on his merry way.* - Wed Oct  7 02:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) hears the crash of the heel behind him, and turns his head looking at the destruction of the front area of the school. He shook his head, and turned right back to the wall he was heading too. "Nope...nope...nope..." He said, as he continued briskly jogging his way out of this place.* - Wed Oct  7 02:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) finally manages to make himself towards the wall, as he moves close enough to touch it. He then stands there for a moment, as he weaves several seals together. he builds up his chakra before thrusting it into the the ground. Standing there for a moment knelt down on the ground in silence, as he stands there waiting for his energy to do its work. Then he sinks underneath the earth's surface, going underground. Then swimming underneath the walls, and comes out the other side pulling himself out of the front yard of the academy.* - Wed Oct  7 03:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) pulled himself out of the ground, and came crawling out of the confines of the outer walls of the academy. Shaking his head, he groaned wondering how come a fight was now going on in front of the school. Not really able to help in the fight, he decided what be best is for him to just book it at the moment. Sure that if he stayed here any longer he surely be dead or risk of major injury.* - Wed Oct  7 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) bringing up his hands, he formed the energy inside him. Changing his chakra form to that of the Earth nature. He  held the energy letting it circulate through his body. Trying to let it become something more natural to him instead to a sense of foreign invader it gave him. He then let his body contain the energy.  Holding on to it with a sense of ease, as he was now used to using it. He just sat and let it continue through him getting used to its chakra flow.

Continued to hold on to the earth nature that was inside him, while also generating more. Working on the process of converting his energy into earth at a far more proficient pace. His body slowly getting used to making it, though still his body making half the amount he put into it. The process was also slow not increasing in speed as he tried to wor on both efficiency and time.  His body slowly reaching its cap, not able to sustain the earth energy that he had made.

Pressing his hands on the ground, he let out his energy into the earth, his chakra and earth fusing perfectly together. He then used this rising energy to make anothe clone of himself. The mud bubbling up, and quickly taking the shape of Jiruin's form. He then took a step back, and charging his energy. Once again manipulating the chakra inside of him to bring out his earth nature.

Sending it into the earth, it quickly took hold of the earth beneath Jiruin's feet in his control.  The earth nature breaks down the earth sending into a swirling mass of muddy water. He then pulls it out of the earth, and sends the wave crushing down on his earth clone that quickly only adds to the vast supply of mud as it is dissolved in the hit. The genin lowers head for a moment taking a breathe, before building up energy again.

His body trying its best to quickly break down his chakra and then reconstruct it into earth nature. However, the process was still slow. Pulling a part the energy piece by piece, shredding it into numerous pieces. He then put these pieces together changing their substance their purpose into Earth. Forming the chakra nature, and using the mud he just splattered the area with to bring up the mud silhouette. He then shot the mud out into the ocean watching it fly off.* - Wed Oct  7 16:15:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: With Kirigakure destroyed. You can stay here, try to rebuild. Or leave, find a new home. - Wed Oct  7 18:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) has a bag hanging on his back, it was stuffed with something. His eyes looking over to Suitengu, and blinking a bit as he began speaking to him. He gave a blank stare, as his thoughts resounded at the back of his head. <...Did someone figure out I was booking it already?> He though before turning his attention from inward back to outward, as he looked over to Suitengu. "...Uhhh...who are you?"* - Wed Oct  7 18:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I'm the other person who lost their home. So, I suggest you leave quickly. - Wed Oct  7 18:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) tugs on the straps of his backpack, and moves on forward pass Suitengu. "No need to tell me twice. Mizukage is gone and the academy is wrecked along with my home. Nothing else do." he said without a taste of emotion. He then took a few steps forward more then well enough prepared to get on the move. Though, to be honest he had no idea what direction to go in. He just probably keep walking until he hit somewhere that just wasn't here.* - Wed Oct  7 18:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) took his few steps out into the wilds outside of the village, his backpack filled with food could carry him most of the journey without rellying on hunting somehting he had no skill at. He then traveled across his way, just taking a walk through the trees that stood outside the water sides of the Kirigakure village. Traveling to the west with no real direction to go in, and just deciding his best bet would be to go for the first village he comes across.* - Wed Oct  7 18:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) continued his walk watching the trees drop their leaves on to his path. His feet crushing each one of the dry foilage with a crinkle. His head dipped downwards, as he continued onwards not really knowing what will happen next. His breathe letting out a sigh of rest, as he leans down to sip some water he finds in a river. Dipping a water bottle into, and filling it to the max. Then continuing on his way forwards making his path across the expanse of grass and trees. His feet already sick of walking away what used to be his home to rest.* - Wed Oct  7 18:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) continued on his way, moving forward until his legs began to ache. His body forcing himself to move a few more yards before he took a seat. His legs stinging him, as they empty themselves of the wastes of their movement.  His hands leaning down and rubbing the sides of his thighs. Hoping to quicken their rest, and spread out the tight mass of muscle strands. Though, soon he just leaned back and hope he could get back to moving soon.* - Wed Oct  7 19:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) finally felt the energy to get back to moving, taking another sip of his bottle. The water a refreshing cleanse of his dry throat sheered of his tired breathe passing back and forth against his esophagus. He then stood up, stretching out his backpack to make sure it was fit comfortably over his shoulders. He then continued his walk dragging his feet along his set path. Deciding going off course would only get him lost.* - Wed Oct  7 19:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) His last steps crossing him over a field of green, and leading him into a heavy dried dustland.* - Wed Oct  7 19:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) took a long walk through the dark dirt, dried from days without rain. The heat of the sun unabsorbed by anything left the genin feeling dry. He began gulping down the water, hoping there be enough for him to continue. Already using half the bottle he just filled. His steps leaving imprints on the ground, as his feet sink into the earth. His body still managing to move itself on a track forward.* - Wed Oct  7 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) didn't want to stop and rest. He felt like he boiled alive if he did, and worse he didn't think he could move if he rested here. He just fall asleep and never wake up, drinking the last of his bottle and discarding it to the side losing the extra weight. He then pulled out a honey bun from his backpack biting into it for energy. Using it as good as he can to hurry out of this wretched area. Curse to be blighted by the sun for all eternity. Already too far to ever turn back.* - Wed Oct  7 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) coontinued the sun beatign down onf him. Making him pull of his labcoat and wrapping it over his head. Giving him some shade and protection from the rays beating down on him. He hoped the village wasn't much farther, as he begins to drop extra supplies to the side. Hoping that the less weight the quicker he move. His feet still only keeping to a slow march but enjoying the less weight the genin was carrying. * - Wed Oct  7 19:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) continued to push onwards. Sweat beeding down his face, as he let out heavy gasps moving forward. He had just dropped half of what was in his back pack, and was eating one of his left over honey buns. The weight was helping him, but the fact he still was continuing on was burning him badly. He didn't know if he could go longer any time soon. Or else, he might just pass out.* - Wed Oct  7 19:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) lets out heavy pants, as he comes across the entrance to Sunagakure. He lets out a "huh?" as he notices the person in front of him. "The homeless guy from the village.... Why are you here?" He said looking exhausted and tired, and completely drained of energy. * - Wed Oct  7 19:35:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) sits down and concentrates on his body's chakra. He quickly begins manufacturing it into earth nature. The formation and properties of his chakra quickly morphing to suit his earth jutsus. His amount building with each passing moment as he concentrates. With enough time he finally gathered the energy he required. Quickly clapping his hands on the earth, sending energy beneath him to make the earth depart aside. His body falling into the hole meant just for him, as hides beneath the surface.

Pushed apart the earth, as he moved around under the layer of grass. His chakra easily manipulating the earth, forcing it to change to his movements. His speed and senses increasing dramatically with the use of chakra, though having to force himself to pull up quickly afterwards.  His chakra was still not a high enough amount to make. His hands quickly taking up the tiger seal to concentrate.

Began building up the chakra inside his body, he gathered more and more of the ninjutsu fuel. He then stoppped filled to the brim with chakra, as he soon begins to warp it into Earth nature. Working greatly on the amount of earth nature chakra he was making, and soon begins building up his speed in making the chakra. His amount quickly building by the second with each moment.

He then made as much earth energy as he could, but he would need to learn how to continously fuel it. Closing his eyes, he quickly activated the hide like a mole jutsu once more. His body disappearing beneath the earth, and vanishing from sight. Beneath the earth hovering in the darkness. He used his chakra to continue holding the Earth in a liquid state. Making sure he could continue to stay inside.

His energy continued to travel out of him into the earth. His breathe being the first to run empty, before he went up to gasp for some more. He then dove back down. His eyes closed and hands perched. His body slowly beginning ot naturally focus on making Earth nature. His chakra began filtering into earth nature, as it travelled his vessles to the outside of his body. He then had a continous cycle of energy coming in and then going back out. Fueling his stay in the earth until he finally felt satsfied enough to crawl out.* - Thu Oct  8 13:09:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) looks to the floor of the training grounds, and then everyone standing in it. Yan seemed to be geeting acquinated with everyone. Something that Jiruin wasn't too interested in. He then turned to his side, and began building up energy. His chakra begin to saturate, before he then began turning it into earth energy. He then leaned down pressing his hands on the earth, and begin sending out the energy. He then stood up pulling the ground with him until there were two towers of mud. That then transformed into him. He let out a quick tired sigh, making earth nature was still something he wasn't used too.

He then look over his shoulder to see Yan motioning to the south east portion, he then looked over to his clones. Throwing his head to the direction, ordering them to follow. As the three Jiruins, come over to join Yan.* - Fri Oct  9 00:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) shook his head for an answer, as he then cracked his neck to the side. He brought up a seal to concentrated, but then lifted up his head in rememberance. He then pointed to the clone to the left and ordered it to do the first jutsu. The mud clone letting out a sigh, as it lefted its hands up. It then built up some energy, before sending it through the ground. Sending out a torrent of mud to the near by wall. 

"That thing... and the mole jutsu are all my earth jutsus."* - Fri Oct  9 00:13:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Alright. - Fri Oct  9 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) looked over, as Yan stated that the genin wondering. <Hmm... he stayed some time in Kirigakure.... though they are basic techiniques... Well considering Zetsumo I guess I shouldn't mention any other names.> He then nodded his head. "It be nice to learn another. Its better to have more jutsus to work on in my spare time or use to survive.... Honestly, if I didn't learn that hide like a mole jutsu. I probably be dead." he states rather bluntly, as he continues in a very dry tone. * - Fri Oct  9 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) looks over to Yan, as his eyes continue to watch. him begin to do the jutsu. Watching the man do the series of five ears. His mind quickly catalouging the nesscary seals in his head. Listening them out in the darkness of his mind. The jutsu formula soon being marked inside of it. He then drifted his eyes into the terrain that suddenly began to shift away from its original spots.

He watch the rockes levitate in the air for a moment, before beginning to tremble before they began flying down hitting the ground with several thunks and blowing up the dusty sands. He then looked over to the last one, as it flies past him. His half lidded eyes not even budging as the rock goes on past him. He then nods, "Okay...so it goes like this." He states, as he turns around to face the direction of his clones. "You guys better watch... no dozing off if I can't sleep neither can you." The clones groan before nodding "Just hurry up!"

The genin then went through the seals, slowly just to make sure he had them correctly listed in his mind and his hands were following those orders. It was kind of creepy how quick he was to pick those up. He then began building up chakra, passing it through his seals. He then place his hands on the earth shooting out the chakra to the rocks that Yan had sent into the sand. He concentrate trying to bring them up... only to make the pebbles around them tremble for a moment. He lets out enough air to deflate his chest, as the two mud clones react in a rather bitter manner. One lets out a quick "Boo." as the other crosses his arms in an 'X'. Jirun only giving a minor scowl to the two.* - Fri Oct  9 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) begins trying the jutsu again, as he this time takes a moment to build up the energy inside of him. His chakra spiking as it tried to build up to the amount he wished, raising above his normal ceiling. He then channeled the chakra to his hands, as he began to manipulate it. The seals giving the direction the chakra needed. He then placed his hands on the ground to give it a better channel of the chakra to the rocks. He sent it out with a burst, and let it sink into the boulders. Feeling some control on them, he attempted to lift up the displaces of stones. They shoook for a moment, Jiruin gritting his teeth showing off the most expression he had this entire time. His body lurching to help guide his mind into trying to lift the rocks, which begin to float inch by inch off the ground.  Only for Jiruin to drop them all back into spot, as he loses his grip on them.

Jiruin quickly began building up the energy again. Passing even his previous ammount, and began to close his eyes as he concentrates on each individual of the rocks. Only to hear Yan, hand him a scroll. The genin let out a shrug. It was better then nothing. "Thank you for the scroll." He said, as he took. Then sit down to begin opening the scroll. Eyes dashing throug it to begin reading it over continuing to do a helpless attempt at physically working. (He then study the rest of day because. His writer needs to go rest.)* - Fri Oct  9 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) took a seat and continued to read about the jutsu that Yan gave him yesterday. He had read it for most of his time, finding nothing better to do. Besides practicing his other jutsus. He quickly breezed through the low level jutsu, gaining a basic understanding of how his chakra should connect with the earth and the rocks that he should be able to lift with the right use of his chakra. Instead of wasting so much chakra on tugging them to do his bidding.

The scroll then went into the details of the purpose of the jutsu, the obvious being throwing rocks at your opponent. The other though was interesting to him, as it mentioned being able to constrict an opponent with rocks then sealing them. Though, he didn't know any sealing techiniques. At the very least, if he had someone on his side he could. He should note the extra use, and abuse it to the best of his ability.* - Fri Oct  9 14:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) let out a sigh, as he stood up then tried out the techinique again. Building up the energy in his hands and body. Then sending out his chakra through the earth, going straight towards one of the rocks connecting it. Then just like was said in the scroll, he put all his chakra at the base of the rock. A single push was made by the chakra concentrated on only going up. The rock quickly rose in the air as if it was levitating. Though... Jiruin had no where to go after this. Dropping the rock, and going back to reading through the scrolls.

He then read the next step of giving momentum to his attack. Reading how one had to keep the pressure from the bottom of the rock to keep it raised. Then using the chakra extend some of it to the opposite side that you wish to go. Pushing full force from the bottom and that side. It would then propell the rock up and in the direction that someone wished it to go. So mastering how hard to push and what amounts would dictate the accuracy of such a jutsu.* - Fri Oct  9 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) tried it again, doing the series of hand seals that he learned from Yan. Following them as precisely as he could. Channeling and morphing his chakra through the se seals, he sent out the chakra connecting to the boulder in front of him. His chakra hissing, as it slides beneath the underbelly of the piece of rock. The genin concentrates as he begins to lift the rock. Bringing it up hovering five feet in the air.

He then closes his eyes visualizing what the scroll had said. He continued to hold the rock, but slowl began to leak chakra out to the right side. He the took one single breath. His chakra then reveberated, as it was sent the signal. All of it pulled back the rock dropping for just a moment. Before both sides hit it at once, the chakra pushing the rock forward and up sending it into an arc. Until it finally crashed into the ground four feet away. * - Fri Oct  9 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) took a seat pulling open the scroll to read thorugh the lines again. Reading the numerous angles and timed pushes to get the throws and movement one would be looking for from this jutsu. The genin moving his eyes downwards across the paper. The reflection of every single word coming out of his pupils, as he continues to read thorugh. Finally, he closes the scroll knowing he had to test out the ideas for practicality sake.

He then stood up, and weaved the seals for the jutsu. He then molded his chakra into earth nature and sent it out to the boulder in front of him. His chakra lifted it up into the air until it slowly bounced up and down in a mostly stationary state. He then pointed forward, his chakra pushing towards that direction. The rock this time going far more straighter with a push from the bottom first then a push from behind. He watched it sore before it skipped across the sands like a rock on the surface of a lake. * - Fri Oct  9 14:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) sits down taking a small break to recover his chakra and begin filling his stomach with two honey buns. Once he was finished with his food break, he paused to think about what he could train. His shadow clones were near completion, but he also wanted to work on this new jutsu he had just learned.  He decided that the clone jutsu was still one of the most useful jutsus and that he should work on that. Nodding to himself. He then channeled his chakra into earth nature, and then pressed his hands summoning two muddy clones of himself.

He then looked at the clones padding them down for any inconsistancies but couldn't find anything wrong with them. Kind of still irritated that, the route for improvement wasn't anything obvious. He decided to dismiss them quickly. Keeping his eyes open as he concentrated chakra to make another single clone. He watched its formation come out slowly, as it made its way up through a mduddy tower before transforming. Which gave a small idea of something for the genin to improve upon.

He then stood to the side, charging his chakra for a moment. He then took a pause to concentrate on his chakra and where it went too. He then though for a moment about what he wished to do, and nodded to himself. He then charged his chakra then put his hands on the ground. Another muddy tall form appears however, this time it already came out almost humanoid. The shoulders and a rounder head already sculpted. But, Jiruin was displeased with it. Haulting as soon as he saw most of it. Which caused the figure of mud to collapse into a pile of mud once more.

He went to quickly do it again, building up his energy and piling it through the mud. He began to raise the figure. This time it came out much more human. Though the head was still nothing more then just oval. This one had noticable arms and a seperation between the mud clearly made to be the legs. The chest was also more box like, though too edged and too thick in certain parts, but it was much better then the last. The genin then paused its transformation into a real clone, and just eyed it for awhile. He then nodded, and let it collapse again.

Already prepared to do the jutsus. He infuses the earth with his chakra, and quickly begins molding the mud just as it rises. The figure comes out with defined features, noticably looking almost an exact replica of the genin molding right behind it. Once it comes out, it stands as a equal sized replica to himself only in the color of a light red brown. He then sent the rest of his chakra into it, which gave it color and life. Making its trigger to act much quicker then before.* - Fri Oct  9 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) looked around at the spot he was standing in the training grounds. He then looked at the square pace and quickly noted it be a good spot to go around in laps. He began building up the chakra inside of him, and then dove underneath the earth. His chakra slowly tearing apart the earth beneath him. Until it fully disappeared, he then traveled under ground following along the foundation of the earth. Digging himself across the area and closing the hole he had left. 

He continued to travel, every so often coming up for breaks of air. Then diving back down to continue his movemetn across the training grounds. It was then he began to notice the intense dryness of the earth in Suna. It made it much more harder to manipulate and the earth was almost cemented together. Still, he managed to get through using his earth nature to continue drilling through this hardened earth. Another noticable moment of him missing his home village though he wasn't so attached to it. 

Following the track laid for him. Jirun continued to move across the sandy enclosed field. His body moving through the earth chakra leaking from all around him to take apart the earth.  He just managed to cross a complete lap for his first time. The slow pace of the chakra drilling through the earth, and the breaks to take a new breathe of air made the laps long process. The genin trying his best to increase the speed of his travel. His chakra being shoved outwards in front of him while lowering the amount on the other parts of his body to hopefully break through it quicker with more chakra.

The extra chakra did help him travel forward slightly more, but it wasn't too much of help as he continues his run. His body slightly wearing down, as it continued to pump more chakra in the line going across his body. His body shifting through the undgergound moving with more stable movement. His hand every so often brushing across the rocky barrier the walls of the enclosement made. underground. Following it to use as his path for the two laps he was making. Already half way to finishing the next one.

Pulling himself up for one last breathe of air, the genin dove back under ground. His arms in front of him pushing him forward noting how close he was to finishing. His body burning from the mental and physical work of both energies. He ignored it just for a few more minutes. Until, he finally reached the end of his lap. Digging himself out through a hole to the surface, and standing up at the finish line before quickly sitting back down to recover his chakra.* - Fri Oct  9 16:41:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) steps outside of the village, before turning around. He looks over to Yan raising an eyebrow. "Hmm?"* - Fri Oct  9 17:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm sorry that you are unable to stay in the village. - Fri Oct  9 17:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It's for a reason, though. - Fri Oct  9 17:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Where do you intend to go? - Fri Oct  9 17:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) shook his head. "Its fine, I didn't expect any of the villages to take me in at all. But, I'm out of luck in that case. I'm just glad I filled back on water." He then paused for a moment looked over to the east. "Well... apparently we have a genin as Mizukage now... and in a wrecked village like that. It sounds like death to me, especially if those guys come back looking for the sword." He then paused. "I think I'm going to head South.... Hopefully avoid Kiri and Konoha all together." He says, as he leands down planting a hand on the ground summoning two earth clones. 

He then has then weave some seals as they bunshi into two shinobi that Yan might notice work some patrolling work and are wearing the Sand village headbands in full display. He turns around "Hope you don't mind me borrowing the image of your people. But its death for a genin to go alone without someone, so I just fake most bandits out with some chuunin looking clones."* - Fri Oct  9 17:37:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You'll have to pass through Fire Country, then head north-west and you will get there. - Fri Oct  9 17:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) turned around, waving a hand. "Thanks." he shouts, as he begins to walk away. He stops for a moment. "You're a good guy, don't know if someone like you should be a shinobi. Hope, we don't ever meet on bad terms." He says, as he goes back around walking away with the fake guards. Hoping the chamoflauge would be good enough for his walk.* - Fri Oct  9 17:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) walked across the sands which more ease this time thanks to the set path, with a better set path on where to go. The fact he actually knew which way he would be heading this time also eased his worries. His feet no longer having to worry about crawling up and down dunes, but instead enjoyed an easy walk on the flat path. He had also filled his water before he had left, and he made sure to use it much more sparringly this time. Drinking small amounts as rewards for certain ammount distances he made. Helping him keep his throat wet and not letting it dry out like it did before, though he still emptied the bottle by the time he had passed through most of the dry lands.

Finally, breaking on to some more water ground. He could see the dry dirt change to a wet sand. Then taking notice of a lake near by. The two disguised mud clones in the form of shinobi took watch. Waiting for Jirun to fill his bottle, as they waited for any possible danger. While, Jirun just hoped that they managed to frighten off any bandits that might seem. Noting that his fighitng power probably wouldn't be enough to take on such guys. Still, he was able to get a nice rest and drink for the moment. Being prepared for the long journey ahead of him.* - Fri Oct  9 17:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) followed along the main road, while it was more possible for him to get sighted while doing this. He felt confident enough that his guards would ward off any bandits. He was far more worried about potentially crossing paths of other ninjas or entering bases of operations that they might be running. So, he took the main path thinking that most villages wouldn't send high ninja through this way. Though, it probably be up to personal choice.

Let out a sigh, as he crossed the river half way through the trail. He rememered running through the foilage of the forest before when he left Kirigakure. Now he felt like he was doing it all over again. With no choice, but to continue onwards. Hoping he run into someone like Yan at this next village. Then, he could hopefully find a place to stay among. Though, he wasn't even certain if they let him in let along hear him out to stay with them. He didn't mind if he had to work as a ninja or spill some secrets. He was sure his village was done for anyways. He just hoped that there was something he could pay to be let in.* - Fri Oct  9 18:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) taking in a breathe. He continued to head forward on the path. Not knowing where it really would end up until something quickly came up on the horizon. It was the walls of Konoha standing tall in their bright orange colors the green doors wide open. He looked at the symbol at the top instantly recognizing what it was, and turning to the west knowing this is the way that Yan had told him about.  He didn't even think about going into Konoha, he rather go back to Kirigakure then that.

He then continued onwards finally taken off the beat path with his clones. All of them slowly moving through the bramble into what seemed to be nowhere. Though he doubt that Yan would lie to him. The feelings of paranoia were getting to him. He didn't have any clue where he was at, and if this would lead him to the right place. He sighed, still this was his only clue to get to the other village. Hopefully, he could make his way there in one piece.* - Fri Oct  9 18:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) following the advice by Yan. Jirun stair cased himself going to the northwest. The several barries made by the trees made it hard to just go straight in the direction. Instead just switching on and off viable paths that normally just headed straight north or west. He continued his clones ever so often getting seperated from him through the foilage forcing him to wait to catch up with them. Or worse, simply lose sight of each other thanks to the barriers of bark and leaves.

Soon, he came across a new type of land devoid of the trees that blocked his path. His first guess was that he certainly wasn't in fire nation any more. Walking along the dirt, it reminded him much of the dry dirt of Sunagakure. Though, this soil was filled with more minerals and felt much softer then that wasteland. Which pleased him, since he wasn't suffering the horrible effects of the sun beating down on him every waking moment.* - Fri Oct  9 18:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) enters what he believes to be Kumogakure looking around, at how he didn't somehow pass through some sort of gate or wall. He wondered maybe he had pass through the wrong area. He looked over noticing three people around him, though who was sure if they were even Kumo ninja. He paused silently, closing his eyes as his lips waver in a frustrated frown. His eyelids sut tight, as he wondered and grumbled about what to do now.* - Fri Oct  9 18:31:02 2015
