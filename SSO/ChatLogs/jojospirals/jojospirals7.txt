His feet slowly padding along, as his clones cleared the way on their travel path. His body not really to excited to move too fast without any need. His thoughts were only that he hoped they woudln't get in to any annoying obstacles or fights. Especially considering, his mind flashing back to the supposed leader of Amegakure the village saw last time. Who he himself was rather abbrasive and stupid. * - Thu Oct 15 20:16:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) quickly took leave from Amegakure, as he walked with his clone in the direction right out of the town. His feet quickly stamping on their footprints that were directed towards the village. Jirun having no interest in ever dealing with the trouble of the Amegakure leaders ever again. Head throbbing jsut from the mere thought of their previous encounter. Just hoping that they get home as fast as possible.

Coming back and going through the gates. Jirun let out a happy sigh of relief. Walking through the maze of walls and bridges. Finally, he walked back into their starting place of the academy front yard. * - Thu Oct 15 20:50:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: We all experience pain.  We are humans. Those of a prideful nature must understand that they can't rely on their pride alone. - Sat Oct 17 06:55:34 2015

But are willing, to spread pain to others in hopes of teaching them a lesson to your liking. Even if it, the pain is something towards the basis of their life. - Sat Oct 17 07:07:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) stood still for a moment bringing up his hands to form the tiger seal. He flashed back to those old times where he used his genjutsu to train himself. The aggony of using that disorientating jutsu on himself over and over again. However, this was the jutsu he was warned about being truly painful which made the genin's stomach shiver for a moment. Still, he swallowed his unwanting pallet of jutsus away. This was the only thing he had to concentrate on at all so he had no choice in the matter.

His chakra spiked for a moment energy gathering in his stomach. The power slowly rushing through his body reaching a container in his chest. He then spread it through out his body sending it towards his legs coating them with the power of chakra itself. He then notices a patch of stones that he could use as a goal line for his jutsu. His energy sparks for a moment, his legs bending with the boosted power. He then creates a cloud of smoke before he vanishes from sight. Only to appear face first on the ground, his hands clenching his stomach tightly.

The genin groans, he was almost as durable as a rock yet this left him huddled on the ground. The whole world went into a vertigo esque state for him. His sight going in and out, as his head tried to wrap around where in the hell he was at the moment. His body quivering as it tried to take in the intense strain that was left internally on him. It took him awhile, but slowly he climbed back up on to both his legs. The cold shiver of the jutsu still not disappating from his body. 

He shakingly wrapped his fingers together once again to form the tiger seal. His arms felt weak like a jellotin like substance. The firm muscles and harden bones all fading away to nothing more then wasted fat. He let out a shiver biting his own lips at the painful experience of doing this jutsu. Still, he continued onwards looking back to where had started using this jutsu. Using that as his knew point of focusing his effort. His energy gathering once again, before dispersing as he takes offf.

Once again, he comes out face first falling in the middle of doing the jutsu. His head digging into the dirt. His arms seeking to set himself right only to fall on limply on to the ground. His body shivering as it felt like he was melting into the earth. What should be harden ground felt like a weightless muk that took in his body. The genin lied their near lifeless, as he waited for his strength to come back to him. The stability of his mind slowly reconstructing, as his mind and eyesight clears.* - Fri Oct 30 12:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) mangaged to slowly get the feeling back in his body. His body slowly lifting itself off the ground. His stomach feeling like it was doing flips inside of his abdomen. His mind slowly grasping on to his positioning in the world, feeling like he had disappeared off to a foreign world for a moment. His balance still lopsided as he took several steps to straighten himself out, only to lean back and forth trying to balance his head straight up.

When he finally found some cement to reality. The genin took a stand for a moment. His feet spreading out distrubiting his weight through both soles of his feet. His weight finally slowly stablized to the point he could keep a normal balance. His hands finally managing to find themselves on equal planes. His fingers slowly tenting upwards to make a tiger seal.

The chakra seeped inside of him into his chest. Building up his chakra once more to manage to take on the intense drain of shunshin jutsu. His energy pushing down his body into the shaking legs, the new fround energy holding the building chakra into his lower limbs. His feet digging into the dirt, soles building into the top layer of the soil. Toes clenching as the chakra sparks through out his whole legs.

He looked over to his starting spot reaching over to the stones he was once near by, though he aimed towards a few feet away just avoid one bad jump. The genin eyes squinted slightly shaking as he looked at the spot of the grass. He held his breathe taking in a small breathe into his lungs. Swallowing his hesistation into the bottom of his stomach. His energy charging and being simulated in his head to what appropriate amount to use.

Using the energy that he had gathered to his legs. He sparked it all, letting it loose in one burst of muscle and energy. The jump several feet forward, the lines of his movement carved into the dirt as he traveled. Soon, he landed  on his feet. Standing their for a moment, before dropping to his knees on the grass. His arms planting his hands on the grass. His stomach churning, holding in the fluids in his currently chaotic gastro system. * - Fri Oct 30 13:25:58 2015

The genin slightly whinced thinking about how hard the fall would be, but let it go holding up his fingers. Connecting them together. His chakra was pushed down to the bottom of his legs, slightly wavering even with all his nature training. He then began pressing into the flat stone. His body slowly scaling up one step at a time. Reaching a good ten feet off the ground. Thinking he had already got it, only for his chakra to spark making him lose his grip falling all ten feet and smacking on to the astro turf.

Without a second thought, he get back up practically unscathed brushing off the dust. He then tried it again, this time the bruises across his body annoyingly reminding him not to get cocky again. Scaling the wall with a notable, frown on his face as he reached to the same height of Mizukage, looking to her for a nod of approval on the rock climbing.* - Fri Oct 30 17:53:55 2015

His body stopping as he looked down at the water. The smooth surface was clear as glass though the ever slight movements could be noted from time to time just by the natural movements of earth and wind. The genin then took a deep breathe, before taking a step on to the water. His foot standing there for a moment only to quickly sink in. The chakra on the other foot the only thing that had kept him from falling in. His body using tha tone leg to pull him completely back away from the water. 

He took a few breathes, just a little shocked how quickly he nearly slipped in. Taking his time, he held up a seal to concentrate. His chakra become more fluid then the simply hard stick layer he had before to cling to the sturdy rock surface. He then took another step into the water. HIs shoes slowly sinking a inch under the surface before they caught themsevles. He then tried the other foot taking another sinking step. He continued, but each step taking him deeper and deeper until his whole body was just swallowed whole by the water.

He let out a gasp, as he swam back up to the surface and to the waters edge. His head letting out an exhausted sigh from the strange training for this justu. Still, he was sure he had gotten the hang of it. His body sending the chakra to the bottom of his feet. The boy taking a stiff pace as he stepped forward on top of the water. His mind concentrating at the bottom of his feet, adjusting them to each ripple on the surface of water. Where, he slowly but surely made it completely across the water surface.* - Fri Oct 30 18:03:18 2015
