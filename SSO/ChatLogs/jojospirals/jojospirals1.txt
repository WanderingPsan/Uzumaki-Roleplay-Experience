<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) lifts up his hand away, hiding himself away in the corner of the village where nobdoy would be disturbed by his actions. He then bit down on the skin of his thumb with his canine, pushing inwards until a dot of iron touched his tongue. He then pulled back seeing the growning stablized semi-circle of blood. He then  concentrated his energy to his finger tips, and slammed his hand flat on the ground. The blood spreading across the patch into numerous seals, before pulling back giving room for the beast. Smoke appearing, spreading into an eager tower that spread as far as it could until it slowly faded away. Lying under it, came out a small brown bunny. Ears twitching, as it waited commands.

Took a seat looking at the creature, and feeling his chakra drain due to summoning it. He then chuckled, before waving a hand. "Sorry for summoning you guys. Just practicing, but I'm sure you won't mind having some free time to run arou-" He then sighed. "Oh no..." He muttered under his breathe. He then looked towards the rabbit, that ears perked up. It shouted out, "RUN?" He then posed himself, and speed himself around the genin several times. "I'm faster then lightning.... I scoff at time as I pass it by.... I am...speed." Shouted the rabbit, unable to show off its only prowess.The genin then let out a sigh, waiting for the bunny to finally get out of breathe. "Can I unsummon you now?" The bunny then turned and nodded, "Have I done agood job, Lord!" The genin nodded. "Now please go back, you're going to wear yourself ragged." With that the excitable ninja's summon vanished.

Leaning back the genin opened back the clogulating wound once more, and used it to once again press his palm on the grass. However, this time he merely was testing his control of making the seals. His thumb stinging him as it was placed on the foreign grass, before more blood was seeped out of him. Crawling across the floor until, it made the numerous letters and markings to form the formula to summon the animal. The chakra use light to just once again simulate the use of the jutsu but not actually perform it.

Then with a closed eyes the genin turned to his left hand, and bit into that one's thumb too. Stamping another bloody mark on the earth, as he used his own fluids to scrawl across on top of the grass and dirt the summon markings. The genin waving off the pain of his finger after finishing, and looking at the markings to make sure everything was right, and that the formula was done correctly. Because in the middle of baddle, a bad jutsu seal could end the life of any shinobi. But, especailly for Jirun who relied on these techiniques.

Quickly doing another seal after his first one with his left, he made another pressing out the chakra made seals. He then looked at it once again, this one was a lot more flimsy. He had done it too quickly, without enough practice. Looking that some of the seals were off just a slight amount, and the summoning matrix was actually in threat. He might not have summoned anything if not put a lot more chakra if he wasn't careful. This just showed that the genin needed to work harder on these types of things. Or else, he be in a bigger threat during battle.

He then unplugs the ink bottle, and dips his brush inside of it. Before, he begins writting seals and amarkings across his paper. If anyone was familiar with summoning jutsu, they would notice thats what he was clearly copying. Of course only minor differences, thanks to the different animals being summoned. He continued of course, just silently keeping to himself as he worked.* - Tue Sep 22 07:28:12 2015

Though, that was considering how long his hand could keep up with his want to work. The wooden brush already digging into his skin, as he continued to write. Making the genin shiver a little as the harsh wood continued to rub.* - Tue Sep 22 07:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) began writing a new third seal. Pulling out the last bit of his scroll, writting the circular mass of appearingly nonsense mass of black marks and made up symbols. However, it was needed to be very precise with such techiniques. Those that relied on seals were always much more intense on focuse then the other jutsu. Let out a mental sight to himself, though they normally had much more impact then he himself ever did with these jutsu. He then finished the last scroll over looking all three for any mistakes he possibly made.* - Tue Sep 22 07:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) lifting up his hand again to his mouth, the genin bit into it form a droplet of blood and exit for more to come out of.

He then slowly leaked blood out from his hand to match with the symbols beneathe, before following it with the second one, and then finally the third. Until each now were layers of ink and blood forming the seals that matching his summoning techinique.* - Tue Sep 22 07:58:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) bitting out another droplet out of his thumb, as he let out the crimson syrup out of his thumb. Touching the droplet till it spreads on a single blade of grass, as he then sends chakra through the blood. The red ink becoming the form of a seal that goes across the green landscape free to be painted by him. He then stopped taking a few breathes, as he took a cut of his chakra to make such an  immaculate and multiplex jutsu. 

Rubbing his thumb continuing to press out more of his blood, and not letting it coagulate to himself. He then stamped another bloody thumb print on the plants. Markers and symbols crawl out of under his thumb. He then sends chakra through it spreading out to its full length...only to cut the supply off just before it activates. His eyes then looking through the laid out jutsu formula in front of him. Pulling open his scrolls to get a side-by-side comparison to make sure he was abosultely correct with his jutsu. Marking once more any mistakes he may have made.

Nipping his left thumb, he already soaks the skin in blood once again. Already forcing out another swirling circle of text for the summoning jutsu. This one noticably crawling out at a slower speed, having to work with more concentration. He wasn't one that training often with his lesser hand. However, he knew the need to master this with both hands. Don't know what ever may happen to his trusty right, but he'll have a second option.

Pulling out the last jutsu he can do out of his blood. Manipulating his chakra through his left arm to force the letters out on the earth. Making sure the marks made tough imprints to make sure they wouldn't be wiped away from the wind. Soon the blood turned black, as the scripture of jutsu continued until it covered up almost two feet around the genin. He then pulled his hand back, the genin was pretty much done using his blood a pay toll for ninja beast transportation.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) lets out a long yawn, as he starts his morning off once more practicing with his summoning jutsu. He didn't have much else to work on besides this, not that he didn't have much else to work on. He then chewed on his finger until the droplet of blood came out. He decided he might as well start off with the real thing. Taking a deep breathe, he then spreads his hand out on the dirt. The seal coming out of his own blood across in a circle. Before, smoke comes out and a tiny bunny rests in front of him.* - Wed Sep 23 10:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) sat back for a bit watching the bunny look around before hopping over to get petted by Jirun. Looking at his own seal the genin pulls out his scroll with numerous seals written in ink and in blood. He then begins checking for their similairities and mistakes. Checking the formula to make sure it was efficient and that he was able to actually master forming the chakra network with his previous works since he didn't actually perform the jutsu those previous times.* - Wed Sep 23 10:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) begins to write out another set of summoning jutsu seals. Curving his brush to make the elogant and lengthy list of seals that made up the summoning jutsu. He continued until the back of his scroll was now covered inot him. He let out a sigh, laying flat behind his back. His chest taking in a suction of air expanding his chest, and then releasing out the air that held in his aggrivation with doing this training over and over. He was getting sick of seeing the seals inside his head. Wondering when they would ever stop.* - Wed Sep 23 14:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) bought a new scroll already wasting the space on his previous one. He then got down on his knees, and began dipping into the his fresh bottle of ink. Hands waving across the blank sheet. Making jumps and bounds, skipping across the surface of the white fiber surface. His hands making out the easy to confuse and similair shapes of the seals used to summon. Some appeared to be simple dots as other made the form of caligraphy of a foreign language.

He continued his hands dexteritilously making symbols even when they been flipped upside down when coming out of the center of the seal. His hand not moving to move the paper, as it be impossible to move the ground itself in such way when making it with one's chakra. He had to learn it in all three-hundred and sixty degrees. Ignoring any issue the enviroment might give him in the future. Finding himself working on it purely with his own skill.

He took a few heavy breathes chest spreading out, as he finally comes near completeling the first seal he made in this set. He bites his lip, as he pushes himself to finish the task while still trying to keep the near perfection that was required. The black ichor soaked tip of his brush still waving  sliding its marks on the paper. Only brief moments does it take itself off the paper, just only to start a new symbol with a stroke. Until, the genin finally pulls it off letting out a heavy breathe to heat up the ink to setting itself in the paper. "Jeez... thats one down."

Takes a sigh out of his stressed body, dipping the tip of his brush to soak in more ink as he pushes the scroll farther open. A new page being displayed for  the genin to copy his jutsu on. Dragging across the black ink once again on the scroll, staining the paper with more seals for the jutsu he had in mind. The hairs on the brush clumping together under the weight and coagulation of the dark liquid. The shiny seals glossing with sunlight as the ink still refracts the light before it hardens.

Cutting across the paper his next mark on the gigantic list of seals to be made. He drives his brush over the paper, swerving it in to numerous curved marks on the paper. Sticking black stamped copies of the seals on paper. He continued feeling his arm grow tired of doing such mechanical movements over and over. The repeating movement rubbing his shoulder and muscles together until it was completely sore. 

Continued dragging his writing utensil across the seal. His fingers rubbing against the wood until the imperfections of the wood grabbed him as he rubbed his finger. His finger tingling as he continued to rub himself sore. His body shivering as he feels the pain. His hand writing harder on the seal only to make himself hurt more. Continuing until he finally made the sting too much to bear, as he finished his last mark for this seal.* - Wed Sep 23 15:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) begins his scroll work, copying the formula down from memory this time. Not using his other attempts or the real jutsu this tim. Just surfing through the fragments of memory to find each individual mark that the jutsu made. His brush much slower then his other times, as he had no reference. Simply looking his head to the side gave him no answers, as he paused brining down another mark on his paper. He continued scratching out his seals the best he could.

He continued letting himself for once spin around the paper. Hoping that looking at it from a different angle would give him a better clue on what part to do next. Sometimes it did help, others it just gave him a spinning headache to look at the mess of symbols that were jumbled together. All of it in his mind melting together to form an unpentrable orb of confusion. Giving up several times and summoning a random symbol from memory.

Continued scratching his hands through his hair, nails digging into his skin as he wonders how in the world he thought he was capable of doing this. Finally resulting in him tugging on the white locks of his hair. He let out a exhausting sigh, as he lightly teared up from the continous labor. Taking out a few sniffels, as he finished his last few marks on the extended piece of paper. His body letting out a few heavy breathes, as he takes in some oxygen.

Pulling out the rest of his scroll so he could see and compare his work. The genin let out a sigh, as he pulled out a red ink bottle. His brush now stained with crimson, and as if he was paying for his own blood with his mistakes. The red ink was slashed across numerous seals and marks which were incorrect. He also made marks to point out when seals should've been at a different positions. Either farther or closer to the center, or even more to the side then were they stood. Letting out a sigh, his hands dotted with red and black. He finished his own corrections.

Jesting at his own failures, the genin leans back sighing undering he still had far to go. He knew he would have to work much harder to understand such complex jutsu. Biting his own thumb, as he thought about his failure it drew out a bead of blood. He then pressed it on the ground, the blood seals spreading out. Then with the all too familair poof, a rabbit appeared which he quickly greeted with a pet. The rabbit closing its eyes and letting out a sigh as it was treated as nothing more then a servant of a human. 

Laying back for awhile, and just enjoying stiting with his summoned creature. The boy thought about his village and pondered if it was worth staying here. Everything was so quiet and the people here... well they were strange. They treated somethings too lightly and all seemed broken. Shaking his head and waving away such thoughts the boy dismissed his summon thanking it for its time and letting him get used to the jutsu. The rabbit happy that it could go back to resting.* - Wed Sep 23 22:04:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) flipped his scroll upside down again, and attempted to try writing another seal of summoning jutsu from memory. Using the previous one marked with mistakes to hopefully remember what he did right, and what he did wrong. He also began using his fingers to measure out distances for the jutsu, and also tried to this time logically figure out the issues when he hit a road blocks. His hand writing just a bit quicker now, but still plagued with long pauses of thought.

His script continuing long past his want to continue boggling his mind over the mathmatics of a space time jutsu. Remembering every seal and symbol, and what their purpose was for just to make sure it correctly transfered or cut some use of chakra to the minimum. Continuing all along that two feet diameter of a circle of black ink into that ona scroll. Hoping that some how he could successfully copy it without mistake.

Finally, finishing the genin wanting to quicken his time to quickly grade his work. Not even pulling out the red ink this time. Just marking his incorrect choices with black scratches. Not even trying to look at his measurement issues. With this he did quicken his own check time, but there would be no way to look back on this for successful review. Though, he just did this to tire himself out before he took a long well deserve nap.* - Thu Sep 24 02:06:30 2015

Though, he just did this to tire himself out before he took a long well deserve nap.

Wakes up with an exhausted yawn following his eyelids lifting upwards. Just almost by natural reaction. The genin opens up his scroll, and begins tiredly writing out the summoning jutsu. Eyes barely open to even look what he was doing. His strokes having not a single pause of writing, even though he needed so many before. He continued letting out yawns, slowly realizing what he was doing. Though just silently accepting his work.

He continued, hand automatically moving on its own. Clearly having a mind of its own, one that wasn't very sharp at all. It made lousy flicks of his wrists in substitute for giving out curves that needed to be near perfection.  Of course, his quality wasn't any where near the nesscary needs for such complex jutsu. Letting out a groan, as he finished. Sandy eyes looking at his work blinking for a few minutes.

He begins to wake up this point, and begins to actually examine what he wrote. Looking at the numerous mistakes, and errors that even an academy student could point out. Jirun letting out a low groan that rumbled from the back of his lungs. Before, tearing up the piece of extensive parchment, not caring for his previous work. Letting the shreds get picked up by the wind and fly off to some where unknown.

He then bit his fingers and pulled out the nesscary blood. His clenching the ground, began extending outwards its controlled chakra. A bloody summoning seal now taking up the dirt showed that he could still use the jutsu. Something he thought he would lose after making something so awful. Letting out a sigh, as he leaned back thinking to himself that he should never do it again while tired.* - Thu Sep 24 12:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) went and bought another scroll, after destroying his previous one with a long exhausting sigh. His wault feeling the pain of continous scroll, brush, and ink purchases coming from him. However, this was one of the few ways he could train without bothering his summons. He didn't like pointlessly summoning them beyond to get to bond with them. He also didn't want to test his chakra limit pointlessly. Though the war has passed them, it showed being prepared was important for any shinobi. Just in case of an attack.

His eyes drifted on the paper below him, continuing to move his brush. Taking breaks to dip the hairs of his brush into the glass bottle of ink. Shaking off the excess to bring it back to the paper, stroking slowly. Only to lift up with a brief look to the correct seal work, and copying it with a slow drag. A portion of the seal already complete left the scroll drawn with a good portion of it already coated in drying ink. Yet the genin didn't take notice to the familair sight of so much black. The smell of the ink particles lifting the air, and the slowly losing freshness of the fibers flying off the scroll.

Continued with a low hum from under his breath, as he wrote down more of the jutsu. He continues to slide the brush numerous ways to make the complex ink trails that made the seals. Going down the papers and rotating clockwise until he was able to complete the circut. A formation of a complete flat sphere of letters and symbols. The space and time ninjutsu that connected to where ever the rabbit summons lived their daily lives. 

Completing his task, the genin waited for it to dry then ran his chakra through it. Feeling his chakra syphon through the ink seals.  His energy being taken and he could feel the seal almost activate, before he turned the valve shut. Closing his energy to the circle preventing it from summoning a creature that wasn't needed to be summoned.  Taking a deep breathe satsfied with how he was able to manage working this far.* - Thu Sep 24 15:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) pulling out his scroll that he worked on this morning. The genin sat there tapping his head with the end of the brush he always used for his jutsu seal copying. The hard wood tapping againist his thick skull with an audible thunk each time it hit. Every so often he actually dip his brush in the red ink and make adjustments to the space time ninjutsu formula. Making it more efficient.

Read marks of different seals to identify a better route for the chakra to take. Figuring out better angles for his markings, and drawing arrows to how much he should rotate them. Some seals being cut out entirely for better replacements. He then checked distances adjusting the spaces in between each seal and  using his fingers to measure how far apart the new seals should be from the others. Making sure they didn't over lap or extend too far for the chakra to pass over.

Feeling rather proud of his work, the genin then quickly bit his thumbs pooling the blood on its surface. His head twisted to look over the scroll and the adjustments he just made. He then planted his hand on the ground. The seals slowly scrolling out, as his eyes traveled back and forth as he copied out his adjusted work.   Soon, he finally completed the new seal circle. He then sent chakra from it, but half way through the traveling network he noticed a spark of energy peeling his hand off from the shock. The energy then leading to a loud "POP!" and a sizzling black smoke that Jirun never seen before.

Letting otu a sigh, the genin's one visible eye scaled over the scroll wondering what in the world he did wrong. Looking at his own work, and the red ink he made. Not knowing what in the world that could've caused that. He then wondered if it was his own chakra, or possibly just a flawed formula that collected the energy and expulsed it out. But, he couldn't solve it no matter how much he pulled back the scroll and twisted his head. 

Letting out a loud sigh, the genin hit his head with a thunk on the stone pillar behind  him. "Ahhh... I'm so sick at looking at these jutsu formulas." he said, holding out the scroll in front of him. His arms keeping it pulled open tightly, the light of the sun feeding through the paper. The ink providing shadows of the seals he had across his face... just before the genin dropped the scroll and let the piece of paper cover his entire head.* - Thu Sep 24 16:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) throws off the scroll paper, and leans up. "I wish I had something else to work on."* - Thu Sep 24 17:02:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) leans up, until he took a stand. "Mind passing me some of those jutsus? I've been stuck with summoning jutsu all this time. I swear I'm going to gnaw through my thumbs." he says showing off two little indentions in his thumbs were he has constantly bitten them.* - Thu Sep 24 17:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Some Doton jutsu? - Thu Sep 24 17:34:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmmm... - Thu Sep 24 17:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Which to teach first... - Thu Sep 24 17:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Start with the easiest I guess. - Thu Sep 24 17:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) looked over to Lera watching what she was doing with a half open eye. The other covered by his hair anyways. He silently watched, as she suddenly manipulated the earth to splatter the wall. He wondered who was going to clean it up, but quickly passed that off. He then himself turned to face the wall. Forming a seal just to gather the chakra required. He then tried to send it too his feet. Trying to manipulate the earth to his will. However, all his chakra simple sunk in and dispersed through out the soil.

Trying again, he sent the chakra through his feet again. The genin closing his eyes to hold on the chakra, honestly not used to keeping control of his chakra once it leaves his body. His mind trying to concentrate and keep the chakra connected to the sole of his feet while he attempted to manipulate it. The chakra began to build in the dirt. However, its attempt to crush the earth and turn it into the slick fluid he fails. Only getting the earth in fronto f him to bubble.

The genin lets out a sigh, and pulls up his thumb bitting on it for a moment. He chews on it. Until, finally he clamps his hands together to form the seal. He then once again sends the chakra out moer then this time and at a harder pressure. He then begins to manipulate at the earth in front of him. He continues to hold and swirl the earth until it begins to liquify. He then grimaces, as he tries to send out the jutsu only for the earth to come out almost looking successful only to splash a few feet in front of him.

Jirun shakes his head throwing off his recent failure noting he almost had it. He then holds his hands together. He then fills the chakra under the soil, and grinds it once more. Crushing the harden material and pulling apart the roots that held the earth together. He then sends out his chakra in one big shot forward, the earth pulling up then sends it flying out through the earth. It then lightly crashses into the wall. Clearly not as strong as Leras, but it was still good in Jirun's book.* - Thu Sep 24 17:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Not bad. - Thu Sep 24 17:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Straight onto the next. - Thu Sep 24 17:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) torso falls forward, choking up at the words of hard work. Before leaning up, as he nods. "Okay... next."* - Thu Sep 24 17:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I guess I'll do some training while I wait... - Thu Sep 24 18:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) takes a deep breathe, as he looks at this next one. His eyes closing as he thought about it. <This one also looks hard.... Well, I'm already stuck into doing it.> He then holds out the seal he had used to concentrate before. Leaking his chakra into the earth before him. He attempts to soften the earth just like he did before. However, this only led to having a muddy lay underneath his soles covering them with wet dirt.

"Jeez... " he pants using so much chakra in a strange way in a row. "You guys always have to do this when you use jutsu?" He says, before attempting again, slowly grinding up the earth beneath him even more. Soon the earth actually does begin to give way. However, the genin only manages to sink ankle deep. His body shivering as the weird jello like earth coldly clings around his skin. Naturally trying to pull himself out only to find he was stuck as if he was in a sand trap.

Calming down and realizing he just was going to have to do it. He attempts again, sending the chakra further down into the earth. Sinking until he got knees deep this time. The earth slowly encroaching higher and higher, as the body of the teenager falls lower and lower. Until his chest was sticking out of the dirt. A small gulp as he pauses, hoping her really wouldn't get stuck down beneath the earth.

Using what little maneuverbility he had. He concentrated all his energy through his body. Sending it over him like a layer of chakra that slowly began to eat at the earth that held him so tightly. He then quickly falls beneath the soil, until his head entirely disappears. He was gone for a few moments. Only to suddenly pop back up. His mouth a gape as he takes in air.  Pulling himself up, as he shakes his head. Thought not obvious what he did wrong. 

The genin then took another dip into the black sea below. This time he concentrated in the darkness. The chakra escaping from him to loosen the earth. Slowly seeped out around him. Taking in any minor energy pulses from that coming from above. Then alerting him. Soon, he could actually manage to form an image of where Lera was thanks to his jutsu. He then swimbs back up, laying flat on his back as he manages to get all the way up the surface.* - Thu Sep 24 18:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Or...not. - Thu Sep 24 18:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Not bad again. - Thu Sep 24 18:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Looking a little tired. Still good to go? - Thu Sep 24 18:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: I think... uh..uh I could handle one more. - Thu Sep 24 18:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmm...Which one though - Thu Sep 24 18:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Clones or headhunting... - Thu Sep 24 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) a wind whispers into Lera's ear that sounds like Jin's voice. "Clooonnneeessss~" -omit-* - Thu Sep 24 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Guess clones is the more useful one. - Thu Sep 24 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Now i'll train. - Thu Sep 24 18:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) lightly bobs his head, up and down feeling more like an empty rag doll by now. The genin quickly assumes the tiger seal. His body sweating a bit, as he sends out chakra beneath his feet again. Only to notice how bad the earth was below him, and also loosening it up to the point he sunk under the soil to his knees again. Pulling himself out with a quick burst of earth chakra. The genin pulls out and gets back on the surface standing to the side of where he originally was.

He then builds up the energy inside his body, and concentrates for a long time. Letting himself take in the chakra and hold it for as long as he could. He then sent his chakra downwards in front of him. Grasping on to the earth and pulling it upwards above the surface. Leading to a single mude pile in front of him. He then attempted to send his chakra into the mudpile which did slowly rise upwards into a dribbling tower only to fall splash back downwards. 

Jirun looked at the mudpile, putting his focus on it. He tne tried to build it up once more. Sending chakra out in a direct line to the mess of liquid earth. He then tried to force the chakra to maneuver it again. Causing it to defy gravity, and lift upwards once more. The wall of mud being harderened into a more solid states to hold its own weight. However, the hardening was too much and it begin to crumble. The spaces in the earth giving in, and crumbling into dust.

Began to faulter, though his feet kept him glued in an upright position. His upper body swayed side to side like a flag for a moment.  Finally catching himself, he builds up his chakra for a moment. Leaking the chakra down beneath his feet, and into the soil. He held it there for a moment. Taking a few heavy breathes, as he moves the pile of earth back to a mass on top of the soil in front of him. He then loses his hold of his chakra dropping the jutsu, just as he got it up.

Giving his last bit of energy. He sends his chakra back to the pile of soil in front of him. Then, like a person molding clay in their image in their mind. Forming the body of mud upwards, and shaving off the excess into a the form of a humanoid. Pushing a little bit more chakra into the chocolate looking Jirun in fornt of him. Manipulating the minerals inside of it, until it finally takes the proper colors and giving a full clone of the genin... Only to fall apart, as Jirun falls forward landing face first.* - Thu Sep 24 18:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) mumbles into the grass. "Thwr-unk... Yhwhoz... fur dah training." he says being too lazy to even move his head to the side to clear his mouth. So he could be far more audible then having his face planted in the dirt. His eyes closed as otherwise if he opened them he just seen green blades of grass trying to poke them out. His hands and arms twitched only feeling the strain of having so much chakra being concentrated through them, and his feet feeling like the earth his been moving around so much, thick and heavy.* - Thu Sep 24 18:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm - Thu Sep 24 18:28:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You can make it back? - Thu Sep 24 18:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Or do you need a hand. - Thu Sep 24 18:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) waves his arms beggingly outwards while still laying flat on the ground.* - Thu Sep 24 18:33:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) silently appreciates the gesture, as his useless husk of a body was dragged over. When they got back in the courtyard, he asks just to drop him by the pillar. Where he goes back to laying flat on his stomach, his cheek resting on the dirt with his head pointed towards Lera.* - Thu Sep 24 18:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Thank you again. - Thu Sep 24 18:37:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) lifts up his hand, and bites his thumb. He then presses it on the dirt. The seals like an army of ants march outwards from the center of his hand. When they finally stop spread, a circling mass and lines of seals is made. He then sends his  chakra through out the network of seals. A pile of smoke comes out of the seal, as he pulls back his hand. From beneath the smoke two yellow eyes that glow even under the intense debris.

"My master, I have been summoned to your will. Those who have angered you shall now your wrath- Zoo Zoo. Those who have injured you shall taste a pain a thousand times worse- Zoo Zoo." The smoke clears, and there rests a brown bunny. With a small pair of black shades that hang off his nose. He then looks over to Jirun "AH! Master! How many battles have you fought today to end up like this mess- Zoo Zoo. DO NOT FEAR I Shall guard you..." He says turning to Lera "Is she the foe I'm ment to face-Zoo Zo!" Jirun then extends his hand thumping the rabit on the head only after he finishes his speech. "No Izugi... I summoned you because..." he then holds out a hand fingers clenching back and forth beggingly. "You have a carrot to spare."

The bunny gasps. "Of course, master. I always have one for you." he nods handing out a carrot from almost nowhere. "Please delight yourself on it!" He says, before Jirun turns over taking it and nibbling on it. "You want one too?" he asks Lera.* - Thu Sep 24 18:47:40 2015

But none of them are threatening I promise you. "* - Thu Sep 24 18:51:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) grips the rabbit tighter, as it tries to struggle out of Jirun's hands. Before, he looks over to Izugi. "Can I have another carrot." the rabbit tenses, and looks over. "Master... I have one more... but its my last carrot. I'll starve if I give it to you." Jirun looks at it with a straight face. "Didn't you say you live off grass? Aren't the carrots treats... but... OH as I starve... I couldn't dare..take food from my subordinate. I'm sorry..I couldn't go farther my loyal Izugi-bleh..."

Izugi jumps out "No master! You can have it I do not need such useless glutton inducing Carrots." he says holding it out, that quickly gets snatched by Jirun who munches on it. Already feeling better as he gets some energy from the food, and begins leaning up on the pillar. He pets the rabbit happily. "Oh thank you Izugi... You have saved my life." he drones out in a monotoned voice. The rabbit gasps and shakes its head with a blush coming from beneath its fur. "Mas-master! I...I do not deserve such praise. I'm just a humble servant!" he exclaims forgetting his last carrot has been taken.* - Thu Sep 24 18:57:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) pulling out his scroll he laid it out in front of him. He then slowly shifted through the seals he already made. Remembering his last failure with trying to improve his jutsu. He dip the red ink carefully making edits only when he was completely sure he was making a form of improvement. Only a few fresh red marks that were done to the paper, hardly enough to make any improvements to his jutsu. 

Taking a sigh, the genin began flipping through his scrolls of the original jutsu. He groaned looking back and forth in between the two groups of black seals. His red paintbrush driving itself a few more times over the seal. Before, he beat the wooden end of the paint brush on his temple. Hoping that some how rattling his skull would produce a new idea. A thumbing coming up to his lips, as he thought until a voice came from behind him. Jumping him a bit, and splashing some red ink on his shoulder.

He turned around looking at Serge, as he called out to him. His one visible eyeremained open though kept a dull look. Though, he didn't seem made at the sudden interuption. Just confused why someone would even bother talking to him. He let out in a low voice slightly a grumble "What do you want?" He said, head tilted.* - Fri Sep 25 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) got pulled in by the genin, looking over to him. Silently being shaken by the sudden grip around him. "I have no clue who you are."* - Fri Sep 25 00:23:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: I don't have a bed for either of us to sleep in. You're better off giving up on your sexual preferences and sleep with a girl named Lera. She has a huge bed that she could share. - Fri Sep 25 00:41:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Serge(Reddestror2) says: Got it - Fri Sep 25 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) continued on his work to bring out the maximum potential of his jutsu after the distraction. The directions of the chakra was noticable spreading out too far. So he had a chain link to each of the spreading lines that made the wheel like spokes seals of the summoning jutsu.  With this, his chakra would better distribute itself through out the circular seal. Giving more flow to the jutsu, when he send his energy through out it. Which is something he was quite happy with thinking for himself, though he didn't display it.

Jirun continued to seek more formulas to be improved on inside the circle. Looking through the complex mathmatics of the jutsu. He did notice another thing, was the center of the jutsu. The concentration of the point of the chakra. Centering the energy to bring out the fullest power to use for transportation on the other side. Sending a few mathmatic seals, he focused the energy even closer on a pin head size center for his chakra to be focused on.

Sat for awhile silently studying his own work. Reading it up and down several times, tryings to be critical of his own work. It seemed so cynical for someone to look at their own work and find the faults in it. To destroy what that person had built up from the start, a hypocracy. Though, he was quite used to it by now. Finding his own work insufficient most of the time. Until, he put down the scroll with silence. His shoulders rising and falling with his breathe.

He then planted his hand on top of the center of the seals. Chakra coming from his stomach escaped into his chest, flowing down his extended arm. The blue energy coming down his chakra vessels, until they escaped out of his finger tips. The skin becoming permable until they fall onto the seal. The power of the ninja coming in contact with the seal, send the blue energy fluttering across the paper. The sparks of blue electricity coming from the chakra hopped over the black ink several times until the energy had fully passed through out the circle. Then fading away, unable to summon without the nesscary blood sacrifice.* - Fri Sep 25 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) taking a deep breathe, the genin let in chakra inside of his body build up. Pressing it inside, he held it as he turned his hand to his summoning jutsu notes. Forcing out another blooding nip on his thumb. Holding his hand out, and pressing the grass flat. He began to send energy through out it. Underneath the hand, sent out the all too familiar seals. Again, slowing as he took his time to watch the careful copying work of his new edited work. Finishing, but still rubbing his thumb to keep the wound from stoppping. He stared at it noticing a few mistakes.

Shaking his head, the genin once again held his hand on the ground. Sending out his chakra and even more slowly sent out the nesscary seals in only slow bursts of one layer of the jutsu. The math needing to be perfect for his efforts to take effect. His eyes carefully darting and noting the length of the seals their width. The interstital space betweeen each inky mark made from his darkened blood. Finally, stopping and pulling back his hand to look at the effect. He then nodded gently to see his work was well done.

He then put his hand on top of the new seal. Chakra discharging from him sparked across the seals. The whole thing glowing, as the energy took in effect. The space around the area quickly distorting , as the genin pulled back his hand scared of what he had accomplished. Soon, in a flash of light and smoke. The rising tower of the fumes cleared to reveal the familiar rabbit Izugi. One of Jirun's secret favorite summons. Leaning down he pet the rabbit, then asked him what he thought of the seal.

The rabbit hopped around quickly accepting his task. His eyes hidden under his iconic shades examined with great intensity. Feeding in his belief that his master truly needed him for this task. He then looked up yelling out happily. "Master! This looks amazing. You're truly ready for the next step -zoo zoo! I'm most ceratin of it." The genin blinked and leaned down to the level of the rabbit. Shocked to hear this. "You sure?" The rabbit nodded. "Of course... its only been expected from you since day one. -Zoo Zoo!"* - Fri Sep 25 01:07:24 2015
