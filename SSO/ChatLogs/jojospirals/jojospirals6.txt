<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Well... I'm off to go do all these jobs... - Tue Oct 13 01:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) starts with probably the worst one to go out and do, as he reads his scroll to take out one of the dogs that have been eating the village dead. He sighs and lets out a hesistant shiver, as he thinks about even trying to perform the act. Still, this was his job as a shinobi it was something that needed to be carried out. Not like he himself, would want  some canine on the street be the one to bury his bones. So, that thought some what helped him go out and perform the task.

Taking his steps around the village, the genin went to where he was sure the most bodies probably were. Taking a stop near the hospita rubble looking over the sight that was now nothing more then a flattened piece of landscape. Noticable smell of corpses still escaping in between the cracks of the layer of destruction that rested on top of them all. He looked slowly around, as he quickly took a stand on top of some of the rubble.  His body straightening up, as he slowly twisted his head back and forth scanning the area.

Soon his scoping finally noticed some movement in the south western corner. He quietly took to moving over to the noise. The sounds of scrapping and ripping of clothes, as he came closer to the slowly growing organic rips. His eyes both closed, as he was sure to see and when he open them it was just as he thought in his mind's eye. A group of dogs fighting one another over the scraps of the torsoe of somebody's body. The rest seemingly resting in portions in the stomachs of the animals. He tried to cover his mouth to hold back the gagging, but the sensitive ears of the canines perked noticing the presence of the human. All of them breaking apart and spritting off in the distance. Jirun jumping out of his hiding spot to follow the closest one.

Followed as quickly as he could trying to keep up with such a speedy animal. Only able to keep up thanks to the noise of stomping over rubble and debris, and the tracks it left over thanks to its hasty retreat. He quickly begins to fill his chakra as he continues the run. His hands slowly clinging to form several seals. His eyes quickly shooting side to side finding the animal's last path and pushing him out into the open. The canine begins to run faster thinking it could just out run the genin. However, suddenly the rubble beside it lift up and crash together. Forming a small mound, that the canine fails to climb over falling back down.

The dog looks quickly around wondering what in the world just happened. The shock stunning it before he quickly shakes his head back and  forth looking for a new escape. Only for Jirun to already finish his five hand seals. The genin closing his eyes, as he lifts up the broken rumble around him. A small silent prayer is given to the dog that he was order to get rid of. Then, showered the canine's body with rocks. Crushing it underneath the weight of all the thick masses of earth. * - Tue Oct 13 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) noting the next task on his list. He notices the rather solemn note of helping give piece to their loved ones by placing flowers amongs the graves of the fallen. The genin was used to dealing with dead bodies... not ones being consumed by dogs. However, his experience with death was still more numerous then a genin should probably be comfortable with. Still after running from the village, this seemed like a good task to form some inner faith in the village into the boy. His feet planting down on the ground as he heads to outside rim of the village. 

Staying procted within its confines of the rather destroyed wall of Kirigakure. Punctured holes in what used to be impervious and everlasting now looked frail and decrapeted. Still this was the least part of the village with some greenery especially on the southern and eastern sides. He then leaned down forming two clones his maximum at the current time. He then ordered to help gather the flowers which they all dumped into three sacks just to spread out the flowers from crushing each other in their containers.

All of them searching for those that wouldn't appear to just be simple wild flowers or weeds. Instead look for bright pure petals. Those that be appropriate for each grave. The numerous ones he had to place a reminder for. The hands of him and his clones all being covered in dust and marks of green as they continue to pluck the wild life around them. Once they seemed to drain the place, they moved on to not just completely ruin what little flowers Kirigakure had left. He wanted something to atleast grow and thrive that gave a better color then that of brown and grey wreckage that was now their enviroment to call home.

Taking on their packs full of the light weighted plants, the heaviness of their emotion was pressed on to their backs. Carefully  carrying the bags so the contents wouldn't suddenly be removed of all depetalled. The three then slowly make a long march in the morning carrying their packs across Kirigakure. Stopping in front of the graveyard, where the little portion of free shinobi forces were stuck digging more graves. Clearly, Jirun wouldn't be done with coming here any time soon. The work of the other shinobi, a preview of his own future business there.

Taking different corners of the graveyard, while trying to stay out of the way of the current burials. The group of cloned genin slowly dropping a flower on each grave. Kneeling down, before lightl sliding it on top of their gaves. The numerous errections that were still clearly recent. The freshness of the upturn soil not escaping the nose of each Jirun as they done their job. Slowly, they completed their task filling the entire graveyard with their flowers. However, Jirun knew he still wasn't done. Dispersing his clones, as he headed to the waterfall. He then paused looking at the three graves there, dropping two flowers there. Then, he paused holding the third looking at Koeki's grave. He didn't know her well, but he still took a moment to give a silent pause for her. Jirun then left a white flower on top of the grave.* - Tue Oct 13 16:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) looked at the destroyed buildings that scattered the areas to fill them with nothing more then debris and ruptured stones and wood. Letting out a sigh, the genin lean down already beginning his work to move away this mess so new buildings could be remade overe this site. Not only that, the extra leftovers could be used for something else. However, right now all of this was simply in the way so the best way to work was to get it out and sorted.  His chakra spiked for a moment, as he brought up two mud clones to help begin his work. Using himself and them to carry one of the large support beams in the wreckage.


The three carried the beam stretched across their arms and poking under their neck as it was hold. Taking the long pole through the city streets avoiding having it hit a wall or accidently smack a citizen. Their legs shifting them over until they reached on the edge of the woods. Where it was decided that the extra rubble dropped here wouldn't get in the way of any construction. Thus, the boys dropped the snapped lumber into a spot lining it straight. They then headed back towards the removal spot, continue the work of sorting through all this mess.


Later that day if you asked anyone in town if there was anything strange they quickly point to the three boys carrying lumber. Jirun and his clones continoully going back and forth. Grabbing one beam then taking all the way across town. Dropping it besides the last beam they placed, and heading all the way back to where they started. Pulling out another one from the wreckage, and taking the long cut wood back over to the pile. Until, a rather messy uneven stack of ruptured wood was beginning to be made into a pyramid. The lumber being piled into this large pile for easy removal or use later.


Finished with the support beams, the clones and Jirun scatter across the area they were supposed to clean up. Each one then began to grab that of trash that would've been big enough problem for the construction workers. Most focused on, at first, the extra wood and tile that made up smaller frames or furniture inside the rubble. The clones and real Jirun coming back down the streets this time with more managable bundles of woods. Dropping them in a smaller stack next to the destroyed lumber.


Continued hurrying back and forth from the site. Slowly, the genin began to carry the tiles and metal bars that came from inside the rubble. Dragging and dropping each new item and making it a new pile to be recycled in the future.  This was then followed by piles of large pieces of glass that didn't shatter, numerous broken tools and most together furniture. Until, they cleared most of the large debris out of their rocky tombs. A variety of piles stuck lined together with still enough space to move the stony rumble. Which, made Jirun let out a sigh as he headed back with his clones knowing well enough the work this would take. 


Standing in front of the numerous destroyed layers of rock from the broken foundations of homes or some of the infrastructure of  the walls. The clones and the genin take a corner of each home. In almost a unison they form the five seals nesscary. Numerous bits of rubble begin to rise out of their places, and then take float five feet off the ground. With the help of the two other clones, Jirun was able to lift almost half of the foundation. This amound coating the ground with a rectangle shadow in from the rocks blocking out the sun.


While one backpeddled, and the other two followed from behind they led the chakra infused rubble towards their dumping grounds. Making sure to be careful that they didn't drop their cargo. Potentially causing more damage to the city or accidently hurting someone. The two moving forward shouting at people to stay away or warnings to the one moving backwards of any potential danger. Slowly but surely, the mass of rocks was finally carried back to the rest of the salvagable piles. Dumping the rocks farther away knowing theirs much more where that came from, and the impossibility of stacking these up efficiently enough.


Taking a long walk back, the genin took towards their work zone. Looking at the large rubble still taking up their slot. They all leaned down taking a few gasps for air. Then, standing back up they wove the Flying Thrown Rock no Jutsu again. Using it to lift up the rubble, taking formation as that they headed back towards the eastern woods.  The flying mass of stone flew over with easy, only a few minor dips as Jirun's chakra fluctuated. Only to be dropped with a thunderous rumble, as the stones clatter beneath the previous dump. The shifting of their wegihts, as each rock finds a spot to get wedged in. The clones taking care of any ones that had escaped from the pile carrying them back.


Took a moment to rest after disposing the second load of rubble. His head held down as he gather chakra back in himself. Moving the rocks across that distance and spreading his chakra to three clones was exhausting. Actually using more of his chakra then he was used to using. Once, he felt complete he stood up and helped the clones take back another load. Bringing it across the village and back. His body shaking lightly as it gets used to the heavy duty work through chakra usage.


He then looks at the left overs after clearing out all the minor rubble. What was left was easy solvable, with only large chunks of rocks left. However, thanks to the other day. Jirun was more then used to carrying these around. Using his chakra to grab the boulders, and then have the clones come under and to help carry and move it along. This was a lot easier then using the jutsu multiple times through the clones ,and let him really ease back as they moved the thicker boulders of rubble back through town. Then, they dropped them farther away from the rest of piles. With no way for them to be stacked or probably used besides individually being broken down.


Takes a seat down to rest up again, already going back and forth so many times to transport this rubble. The rest of his missions and this one was getting to him. Eating up his energy storage, still he ordered himself to continue onwards. Finally, managing to pull out the last pieces of boulders from the sight. The last obstacle for any worker that wish to build up the land and use it for construction. Finally planting the last rock with a bang into the earth, and then laying up against it to rest for the hour.* - Tue Oct 13 16:54:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) stood near the lake, and began weaving seals while inflating the chakra in his chest. Growing both his concentration and his energy, he shot one spark of his chakra outwards until crashed into the ground. The single point of energy soon spread, carving a circle out of the ground. Then pulling up a chunk of earth. Then, using that same chakra Jirun used it to lift the slice of earth. Throwing it outwards about twenty feet from him.

Looked over to the spot he designanted as his target zone. He then built his energy up again. Shooting out several more sparks of energy into the earth, though these wer emuch smaller. Pulling up out of the ground several fist sized rocks from the earth. He then threw one by one over to towards the target. Noting every miss, and noting it down in his memory. Then, worked on trying to change his power and chakra with each throw.

Soon after mutliple clanking of his rocks some of which hit the target, while others laid close by scattered around it. Jirun summoned another set to use, pulling out from the earth ten more pieces of stone to use as ammo. His chakra bursting, as he threw each single piece of earth at the rock. The sounds of him successfully hitting actually growing more and more common as he practices. 

Digging up more chakra from inside his body, he gathers a rather large load then spreads it through the earth which immeaditly begins to crack. Soon five much larger pieces of stone float behind him. Using these much more ridiculous objects as projectiles. He quickly begins to shoot them off one by one, noting the much more energy it required then the smaller stones. Each one letting out a rumble, as the boulders crash into the ground.

Took a moment to look up at the scattered rocks found near the target. Noting while two got close, the other three were far off. Doing five seals again, the genin lifts up each of the rocks. Then powering his chakra up, Jirun shoots out each of the rocks. The boulders slowly throwing themselves out of the air, falling down around his target like rain. Still, he didn't seem close to actually hitting his target at all. He sighed, letting it go for the day. Since, he had other things to do, and being too exhausted for taking missions wouldn't be happy with him.* - Wed Oct 14 19:00:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) quickly gets to working on delivering the food since it was the highest priority. Since, the food itself could spoil if they didn't deliver fast enough. At some point even in a safe storage, the food would eventually go bad. In either case, he quickly ordered his clones to grab bags of food. Each one taking enough portions to feed several individual families. He then order them to follow him, as he took a step back out of their storage area. Carrying the delcious smelling food towards the south of town.

Jirun knew the best way to distrubite the food would be to go by each house individually in a precise pattern. That way, the clones and the real Jirun would get mixed up giving someone double what they deserved. Jirun and the clones would bring over the food, up to houses in literal rows of three. Staying in sight of each other so they know which houses to visit, and could quickly go through a street of them fast. All generally doing the same thing knocking on the door, and if it opened handing the food to the person. If the door didn't open they look for a back door place the food there, and if not worringly just place it on the front hoping someone wouldn't take it in such a time of need.

Emptying themselves quickly, the group of two clones and the singular genin would then walk all the way back to the storage area. Gathering another set of food to carry, and coming back to the south. Him and his clones marching back in a line with the food in there hands. Sadly kids would come and ask for some, but all Jirun could tell them is go back to their homes and wait there. It was pretty understandable though, people asking for some. However, Jirun knew with supplies running so low. They had to properly hand this out, or only more people who could've gotten food would be left starving.

Continued to do his path back and forth through the south first, making sure he had completely gone through every house in the area. He then walked back with his clones, happy that this time he was lifting the heavy rocks of the previous missions. Though, silently shaking at the thought of moving wood over to the hospital. Grabbing the next set of food this time they headed to the north saving the center of the island for last since it would be the quickest route to get done. To Jirun, the best idea was to take the freshest food first to the farthest areas. That way, it should manage the trip at least that was how it worked out in his head.

Starting in the farthest north-west corner, the traveling food bearers started their delivieries on the northern lands of Kirigakure. The genin would continue as usual, going down the streets at three houses at a time. This time most people were already prepared sitting by their doors, and eagerly taking the free meal. The attacks on Kirigakure clearly showing the harsh effects on its people. Leaving them all desperate to take any food that was given to them. Many forsaking their pride to let their children have a meal.

Walking back, people continued to ask questions of the food delivers. The people hoping that wasn't the last they had to offer. Jirun quickly shaking his head no, and promising they had more food coming and to wait at their homes. Though, it didn't seem quick enough for the people as many waited with fear that they wouldn't recieve any. While those cheered happily when they food was brought to their house. The clones and the genin himself speeding up to deliever as much they can and faster. The three quickening their pace thanks to the pressure of those who feared getting nothing at all. This little kick in the gears, helping them speed along finishing delevering across the entire northern part of the city.

Let out a sigh of relief as he made it back to the storage of food. Leaning on the wall with one arm, as he wiped the sweat off his brow with the other. He and the clones took the food and quickly began the distribution of it across the center of Kirigakure. Some people quickly thanking them for helping in the time of need, while others were too busy taking it to make something to stuff their empty stomachs. Whether it was thanks or a over eagerness that greeted him. Nothing stopped or slowed Jirun from delivering the last meal with a happy smile.* - Thu Oct 15 02:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) began on his next task after letting out a long sigh. Finished with his delivery job, it was back to doing hard labor. His first stop for this job was going to the weapons store, that was still being rebuilt. Getting a quick axe out of the owner who stood near by still taking orders when asked. He then walked all the way to the eastern woods which thankfully was still standing. Pulling out his new axe, and looked at the tall threes that could easily squash. Then shaking his head, he handed the axe to the clone next to him.

Stood besides watching his clones from the back of another tree, not ever having to be the one to chop the wood for his family. Jirun taking a seat back, as he watched the clones pull back their arms. Swinging back to cut into the trunk of the trees, as he slowly dug into the bark. Slowly, a slice of the trunk cut out in the shape of a cut pie. The other clone without the axe, quickly began to push back on the trunk. Pushing it away from the three Jirun's falling it over safely backwards.

The clones continued to chop in place of the genin. Each strike of the axe, sent out a thud through the woods. Slowly but surely, the sound of the trees come crashing down would follow.  Jirun watching over a safe distance, and providing chakra to the clones to continue their hard work. Though, there were a few lost clones. Some of the trees didn't go exactly the way one would wish.  The splattered mud of the trees the left overs of the clones that didn't move quick enough. Each time, he saw this sight grew justification of Jurin being the one to sit back and watch.

Once they finished cutting down enough wood, the genin quickly gathered around one pile of wood. They then began dragging the lumber across town. The long stretches of fallen trunks, with their branches cut off to lose the extra weight and space. The three people able to at least move at a snails pace. Dragging the first one for a near fourty minutes to reach the hospital that rested close to the forest. Dropping it off for the workers to cut up and use to rebuid the hospital.

Continuing back and forth, the genin made lines of where their feet shuffled forward with their weight. The paths of them carrying logs across town a near rail road for how much they stook to it. Staying on the rails, and carrying the weights like a dedicated cargo holder. Finally, dropping the last log with a haevy thud on the ground. All three boys laying backwards on the grass and letting out a sigh. Wondering when they finally be free of carrying all these heavy materials.* - Thu Oct 15 03:59:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) lets out a hefty yawn to great the morning sun, as he stands by the large rocks he pulled out himself with his jutsu training just the other days. Turning to the formation of randomly placed pieces of earth. He quickly got to using them for today's training. Weaving five different seals, and slowly leaking out his chakra until its clutches surrounded the rocks. Each stone now slowly lifting out of place, their heights rising until they float almost four feet off the earth.

Jirun reeling the rocks back towards him, had the five large stones he had used for ammo the other day hanging around him. He paused for a moment chakra fuming out of him, as he kept the stones floating. He then decided there was something at the moment he needed to learn first besides aiming. He then pointed to one of the rocks. Slowly, shifting it back and forth for a moment gaining its feel. Letting its weight sink through him by the pressure given off by his chakra.

Using this base to judge his ability with it. He then looked towards the water. His hand slowly moving back and forth to give forth a swinging motion to the singled out stone. Then, Jirun released it at the pinacle of its motion swinging outwards. The rock was then let go quickly descenting until until it hit the lake. The water splashing upwards, and the acquatic gulp lurching out as the water sucked in the rock.

Giving it another try, the genin used his chakra to boost the movement of the next rock in line. Building up momentum by simple pushing it back and forth. He then gave it a spin with a burst of chakra on its side. The rock now swinging on an invisible circular path.  He then let it go, the strone flying like a frisbee riding its own air going just a bit farther out then the previous one. Draining just a bit more energy as the cost.

Continued throwing around the rocks into the lake. Trying to throw each one as far out as he could. Some making the disstances he wished, while others falling short. Running out of ammo, he quickly weaved the seals. Tearing out new bullets out of the earth itself. A series of large rocks hanging behind were now free to use at his disposal. Bringing them up one by one to be lost under the surface of the sea.

Finally getting used to thse rocks and their weight. Jirun once again tore holes in the earth to gain more stones. He then looked at the target slate, he had place yesterday. His chakra quickly throwing the stones one by one. Each one of the rocks let out a clink of success as they impacted the surface. The target rock now left with numerous marks of Jirun's jutsu lined across it.* - Thu Oct 15 16:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) building up his chakra again, the genin took time to pull out more of his energy. The handseals his fingers naturally weaved through giving a path for that energy to travel. Sinking into the earth, it quickly went to breaking apart large chunks of the rocks. Pulling them out of the soil, Jirun gave it his all throwing the entire group at once as fast as he could. The rocks all were sent flying forward, slowly arching downards in their projectory until they smash the target they were designated to hit. A small mound of stone now rest together in a large clump.* - Thu Oct 15 16:20:28 2015
