<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mokutsu(LordxPatrick) Sits on the rock, his head buried into his arms. "Why do I always do this..." He muttered.* - Fri Oct 16 07:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mokutsu(LordxPatrick) thinks: I...Thought maybe... - Fri Oct 16 07:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mokutsu(LordxPatrick) He would raise his head, tears steadily streaming down his face. "It's too late for me. This...Life...If it could even be called that..." He thought, remembering the last time he saw his parent's faces. He recalled how long it had been...So very long. "They just..LEFT!" He said to himself, the contempt obvious. He gripped the withdrew a kunai, gripping it tightly. "Now...I hear voices in my head too!" He said, the tears making the words choked.

His hand was shaking from the sheer despair he was feeling. "I can't do this...I became a Shinobi...Hoping one day I'd live a life my parents would be proud of. Maybe, just maybe, if my name spread far and wide...I'd be remembered!" The tear flow continued, as his entire body convulsed with sobs. "I'm just not memorable...I guess..." He said, as he took he took in a deep breath. 

His hand shook harder with each silent sob. The tears streamed..."Seeing Marrisa...Talking to her...She's so much like my mother was. At least, I think my mother was like her..." He paused, realizing he knew very little about his mother. "I just want the pain to stop..." He choked out.

With his trembling left hand, he drew the kunai to his right wrist. "I could end it all..." He muttered, the tears slowing down. "I wouldn't have to live in this endless torment..." He thought. It almost seemed to good to be true. "I could...FEEL...Something...Again..." He thought. The tears had stopped streaming, as his grip became more steady. He would quietly drag the kunai across his right wrist. "If I sever the vein...I'll bleed out faster..." He thought. He held the kunai there, attempting to decide on what he was to do.* - Fri Oct 16 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mokutsu(LordxPatrick) Blood was slowly pooling from the shallow wound. Mokutsu jumped a little. "It feels...Bad...But good..." He muttered. He had been so numb for so many years...That even the feeling of pain was comforting. He quietly pushed the kunai down, a small smirk appearing on his lips.* - Fri Oct 16 07:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mokutsu(LordxPatrick) A voice had been persuading Alastor. "Do it. Finish it...You'll feel better in the end!!!" it said. It kept commenting, pushing Mokutsu to dig the kunai deeper and rip it across. Mokutsu struggled. He knew he shouldn't...But to feel something again. Meanwhile, an aura of chakra had envolped him. It felt sinister.* - Fri Oct 16 07:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mokutsu(LordxPatrick) thinks: It'll all be over...The bad...The numbness... - Fri Oct 16 07:19:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mokutsu(LordxPatrick) Mokutsu was oblivious to anything except for himself and the kunai. "I can do this...End the pain..." He repeated after the voice inside his head. Suddenly, he felt a warm sensation. Something he had not felt since his mother had held him in her arms all those years ago. He could faintly hear a voice...The voice of his mother. "I came like I promised! Be strong! You're stronger than this!" it said.

Suddenly, the chakra would condense back into Mokutsu's body. With a faint grunt, he would lose his grip on the kunai and visible pass out. Whether he fell or was caught, or simply leaned onto something, was now out of his control.* - Fri Oct 16 07:29:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mokutsu(LordxPatrick) Suddenly, Mokutsu's eyes shot open. "MOTHER!" He shouted, as if he had just awoken from a trance. With a confused look on his face, he noticed he was resting on a table. He attempted to sit up, looking towards the masked man. "What...Where?" He asked...His mind was still fuzzy.* - Fri Oct 16 08:03:24 2015
