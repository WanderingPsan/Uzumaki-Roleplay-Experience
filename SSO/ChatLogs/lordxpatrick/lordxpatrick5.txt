~~Memories~~
Alastor grunted as he dodged to the left, narrowly avoiding a set of five claws being swung at his face. Flipping into a handspring, he plucked a kunai from his pouch and flicked it with a practiced ease at his opponent, scowling when it was knocked aside by a bracer-clad forearm. Vaulting off his fingertips, he tucked into a roll in mid-air before landing on all fours, looking up just in time to see another claw swipe aimed at his head again. He spat out a series of curse words as he launched himself backwards, the laughter from his opponent only serving to irritate him even more. Alastor had always prided himself on two things; his speed and his strength. Those were the two things he had going for him in most any fight.

So of course his older brother was faster and stronger than him.

"Come on baby brother, you can do better than just dodge. Or are you a whipped dog??"

Baring his teeth, Alastor dug his feet into the ground and pushed off with an incredible amount of strength; enough that he tore up the grass and earth under foot and left a cloud of debris in his wake. His brother sidestepped the attack but didn’t follow up with a counter. Alastor landed on his hands and grunted as his arms absorbed the impact before an idea sprouted from the crevices of his mind. Leaning into the ground, he made a similar motion to a push up but at the last moment launched himself backwards, his feet held out in a donkey-kick like fashion. When he didn’t feel his feet connect with anything until he hit the ground, he glanced around and saw Xian staring at him as if he was some kind of idiot before he shot forward. His aim slowly raised and Alastor’s eyes widened as he saw his brother's hand swing forth a fully-fledged kunai. So far all his attacks had been with his non-damaging attacks but now… it appeared he was getting serious. Or annoyed.

Alastor’s legs swept around suddenly as he came within range, twisting onto his side and using his left hand to keep himself somewhat upright. He was just as surprised as his brother was when the sweeping attack connected, causing Xian to stumble in his forward assault. Quickly following up, he threw himself up off the ground, twisting around and pushing against the ground with his hands to do so, and pushed his back against the stumbling Xian. They both fell to the ground in a heap but Alastor quickly hauled himself up onto his feet and shifted his feet and weight until he settled into a basic fighting stance. As he had shifted into position, Xian regained his footing and stared at Alastor. He took his chance and darted forwards.

Xian raised his leg for a side kick as Alastor came into range, a move which the younger brother mimicked. Their ankles met for barely a second before Xian pulled back and he once again copied him, retracting his own kick. This time they both attacked with their kunai-wielding hands and clashed at the wrist once more. Xian smiled at Alastor as he grunted and tried to push his arm back. Slowly he pushed it away before putting on a burst of strength and knocking it down. With his balance shifting downwards and planting his hand on the ground, Xian unleashed a brutal shoulder tackle that had Alastor quickly backpedaling from his assault to avoid it.

He moved forward again, this time with his arm cocked back. He stepped past Xian's kunai attack towards his chest and unloaded his own swipe, straight towards his face. Xian batted the attack aside with his hand and brought his still outstretched palm around to the back of Alastor’s head, delivering a quick slap across the back of his head. The small smirk he wore was enough to make Alastor realize he was being toyed with. With a growl, he attacked furiously with kicks and punches all of which were nimbly dodged or batted aside before they connected. As he drew back for yet another wild punch, he was subject to the same kunai strike he had almost copped at the very beginning of the training match. Instead of being sent sprawling across the ground, Alastor had managed to tense a second before impact and was only sent reeling backwards. Xian followed up with another few short, quick thrusts which kept pushing him back until he had his back against a tree.

This was a bad situation and he knew it. He watched as the kunai of Xian's attack came hurtling towards his face. He knew it was most likely a fruitless effort but nevertheless he threw his hand up and whether through fate intervening or sheer dumb luck, he caught Xian’s hand with his own. Not willing to lose this advantage, he threaded his fingers between Xian's and used the tree against his back as leverage to swing both of his legs up into his older brother's side. The blow connected and he was sent toppling to the side and Alastor quickly let go of his hand as to avoid getting pulled down with him. He slammed against the ground, hard enough that he bounced and hit it again albeit a little more softly that time. Caught up in the throes of battle and not really thinking, Alastor brought his leg up as high as he could before swinging it down as fast and hard as he could heel first towards his brother's chest.

Xian’s quick reflexes kicked in and he rolled out of the way; however the heel drop still managed to clip his shoulder before he completely escaped its range. Thankfully he stayed down long enough for Alastor to regain his breath and try and clear his head a bit. The reprieve however didn’t last long as Xian was up and in his face after a few moments. Doing the only thing he could think of at that particular moment in time, he brought his head down and slammed his forehead against his brother's own as hard as he could. Fortunately for him, Xian wasn't wearing his forehead protector. Unfortunately for him, he wasn't wearing his own either. He stumbled back from the blow and shook his head to try and clear it of the loud thumping going on inside his skull. It felt like his brain was banging against the bone of his skull over and over again. Before he knew what was going on, Alastor was swept off his feet and found himself staring at the overcast sky, which was quickly blotted out by an incoming heel drop. Eerily similar to the one he had tried to deliver not a moment ago. He brought his arms up in a cross in front of his face and yelped at the heavy impact of the heel digging into his arm. He was surprised he didn’t hear a resounding crack of his bones snapping under the pressure. It certainly felt like they had broken.

He lifted the arm that hadn’t been directly hit, having been under the other arm when the heel hit, and grabbed onto Xian’s ankle before rolling over onto it. Alastor listened him cry out as he was forced to the ground to avoid snapping his ankle and the younger of the siblings used the time to quickly crawl back onto his feet and stand at least a meter away from the older brother. He didn’t want him trying the same trick he had just used. That would hurt like a bitch. He looked towards Xian as he slowly stood up and realized his vision was blurry. Bringing his hand up to his face, he realized his eyes were watering and his face itself was very tender, especially around his eyes and left cheek. His preoccupation with his current wounds led to him completely missing the incoming shoulder barge that drove Alastor straight into the ground. He stood over him and he couldn’t help but feel like some kind of insect about to get squashed. Fight or flight was the question? His instincts were screaming flight. To get the hell away from the clearly stronger predator and live to fight another day. His pride, however, demanded he continue fighting. Unfortunately for him, his pride won out.

He kicked his foot out towards Xian’s ankle and grinned when it collided and he fell to the ground. He once again found his way to his feet and was about to deliver the finishing blow when he heard clapping coming from… behind him? He spun around to see Xian standing at the edge of the cliff, smiling at him before he swung back around just in time to see the Xian on the ground before him burst into a cloud of smoke revealing it to be one of Xian's shadow clone’s. The damn thing had been a shadow clone the entire time!?

With a growl and then a sigh, he fell back on his rear end before flopping down onto the ground and staring at the sky again. He could hear Xian approaching but he didn’t really feel up to talking to him right now."Ah come on baby bro. Don’t you at least feel like you’ve learned a little bit?" The Genin grunted and nodded. "If it's any consolation, you've definitely gotten better since the last time we scrapped. You lasted at least a few minutes this time. Last time was what? Twenty seconds?"

"How many times are you going to bring that up?"

"For as long as I live, baby brother. For as long as I live."

*Clink, clank, shhk shhk clank* The sound of shuffling feet & flesh clashing against flesh could be heard bright and early behind the family household - continuing well on into the noon hours with no sign of stopping any time soon. From an onlookers perspective, one could only interpret such noises as intensive training between two Shinobi determined to attain formidable taijutsu prowess. Well, sort of. Since Alastor had become a ninja he hadn't really had much time to spend with his old man, Alastor's father, decided it was time to do some 'bonding' using the guise of training as a reason to do so. 

At last, the blows ceased & both skid to a halt several feet away from one another panting - well, Alastor was anyway. To Alastor’s father, exchanging blows at a level slightly above Genin quality was well..child's play. “Don't tell me you're tuckered out already, son?” Alastor's father asked, raising his right hand up & swaying his index finger from side to side jeeringly. “Oh fuck off...” Alastor thought to himself, taking several deep breaths followed by slow exhales to ease his heart rate. “C'mon give me some credit! We've been at it since day break,” Alastor replied. He wondered how his father wasn't the one needing a breather considering the fact that the two had been decades apart - shouldn't old people feel the effects from this kind of thing? Then again, this was Alastor's father we were talking about. “I guess you have a point. We'll take a short break and then get right back to it. Gotta build up that stamina of yours or else you'll get left behind by your peers.” Alastor tried his hardest not to furrow his brow though for some reason he felt like it only made him look awkward.

For now, the fighting had ended & Alastor could afford himself some down time. However, while he did in fact rest his physical body - the young man’s mind had been fast at work; analyzing points in the exchange with his father that cost him time and energy. Two vital things that would do best to be conserved in the Shinobi world. “One thing's for sure: For an old man, my Father definitely is as skilled as any Leaf higher up. I couldn't break his defenses because of the time it took me to transition from offensive strikes to defensive counters..” Alastor sighed before laying his back on the soft brown dirt and green grass - funny how from this position the skies seemed not so distant.. “Man..I wish I could just drift away, forget all about this ninja nonsense...Yep, that's the life for me. Care free and easy going.”

“Son?”Just drifting along not having to worry about protecting anyone or anything.. “Son?” Riding the winds going from place to place. “Alastor!!!” “Eh? Oh, sorry about that.”

 “You've really gotta get your head out of the clouds Alastor. Lets continue.” 

“Break time over already, huh? Ah well, a man can dream.”Alastor thought to himself while getting off his back, quickly standing to his feet. After a few short & simple stretches both men were ready to pick back up where they'd left off earlier. Only this time, Alastor wouldn't forgo the capabilities of his father & even more so - entered the fray with a better understanding of his own skill. He knew what needed to be done & how to go about it, the hard part was putting what he'd learned about himself to the test. *Zzzt* The sound of Alastor's father arming himself with a single Kunai had been captured in Alastor's ears & he knew that the time for playing around had officially ended - so he did the same. 

Gripping the warmed, wrapped handle firmly in his left hand with his index finger slipped inside of the small loop on its hilt. Alastor then bent both of his legs placing his right leg shoulder length apart from the other while simultaneously sliding it up by twelve inches - somewhat of a defensive stance seeing as how his left hand raised just shy of chin level leaving his right (and empty) hand closer to his stomach. Additionally, the left heel sat at a slight elevation of two inches off the ground, Alastor made mobility in this case his top priority considering that his father was both stronger and considerably faster than he'd been. Now, he was officially ready.

For the longest time the two stood watching each other as if to be sizing one another up or simply waiting for that one minute shift to tip the scales of tranquility, the calm before the storm. Alastor's father, stoic & unwavering like a statue. Alastor, calm & calculating. It must have been a family trait because neither of their facial expressions betrayed what the other had been thinking and then - like lightning striking the ground or a snake lurching after its prey, the fighting began without warning. Alastor's father dashed forth clearing the distance between them kicking things off with a single diagonal upward strike forcing Alastor to retreat in a swift dodge though this time around the attacks were relentless. Alastor's father would not ease up as he followed through with yet another strike toward his son, this time in the form of several thrust attacks that played on their arm length. Alastor couldn't even get close. “Your enemy is aggressive and won't give you the time to mount an offensive! You'll have to think on your toes if you want to conquer them.” Alastor's father spoke through grunts of effort as he continued to swing his kunai around. 

This hadn't been anything like the first round where Alastor had been given leeway to act. Alastor's father was really going to push him to his limits. “Tch, I knew it.” Alastor thought to himself as he continued to shuck & jive, duck & dodge, Bob & weave. At this rate, he'd end up tiring himself out which was what his father was probably banking on. Admittedly, Alastor was beginning to grow frustrated and he was more than tired of running - but what could he do?! His father's constant barrage of attacks had put him in a tough spot & getting out of it wouldn't be a cake walk. “C'mon Alastor get it together! You've got to counter attack!” Alastor thought to himself before making his first attempt at attacking his father; a quick rightward swipe with his Kunai knife that had been easily deflected by his father through brute strength. Tch, so much for that plan. Before he knew it, the young Genin found himself dancing all around their back yard from end to end. “Damn! I've had enough of this!” Exclaimed Alastor which seemed to catch his father by surprise seeing as how typically speaking, Alastor was not the kind of person who would openly display his frustrations which could only mean that the child was serious about his development. 

Lurching forward once more, Alastor's father attempted a thrusting attack only to be met with an unexpected counter. Rather than try duking it out with his father, Alastor lept backwards and snapped his thigh holster open only to launch several shuriken toward his father in quick succession. “What?!” Alastor's father thought to himself while quickly attempting to recover from the vulnerable position he'd been in by placing his right leg out in front & turning to the side while using the kunai to deflect the shuriken. However, before he could move to transition in his assault again, Alastor was upon him. Thrusting, slicing & even throwing several well placed kicks in to put his father on the ropes. “Heh, I'm starting to get the hang of this.” Alastor remarked. “Not so fast.” Alastor's father replied before grabbing a hold of the young Genin and literally flinging him across the yard. 

If not for his training as a ninja Alastor probably would have landed on his back but he'd instead been able to recover in air and land, albeit with a skidding stop, on his feet. “Heh, had you worried for a second there didn't I?” Even though he hadn't quite pulled the win in their short exchange, Alastor applied a quick switch between defense & offense which for a moment, gave him an edge. To him, that was confirmation enough that he could beat a skilled opponent given enough training and time. 

“You've definitely improved just over the course of this fight - that much I will say. What you did in shifting from defense to the offensive on such short notice requires a keenness of instinct that not very many ninja have. Of course, you've still got a ways to go before you can beat your old man.” “To think he'd be able to transition with such seamless skill so early on...I never pegged him for the Taijutsu savvy type. Then again, he has always been quick in the mind.” Alastor's father thought to himself, unable to help but be proud of Alastor for his quick change in the face of a problem. 

While it wasn't exactly the conventional means of transitioning, Alastor had been able to use a combination of his Kunai and shuriken to bridge the gap in his offensive & defensive capabilities, therefore allowing him to forgo the effort and energy expenses it'd take to deal with an adversary of considerably higher level. Alastor's father only hoped that Alastor would apply this new found skill in the future as it could potentially mean the difference between being cut down & surviving. ~~End of Memory 2~~

~~Memory 3~~
The clouds above Konohagakure this morning couldn't stop the sun rays from piercing Alastor's bedroom curtains and forcing him out of bed. He was still recovering from his last team training, but he figured he shouldn't become too lazy. After a quick breakfast, he rushed out of his place to go meet with his brother Xian on the training grounds. Alastor managed to convince him to arrange a training spar this morning. His number one motive for training was to surpass him. He wanted to compare his skills against his to see how much of a way he still has to go. It wasn't in his expectation to beat him this cloudy morning. He wasn't late, but his brother tends to be early at times. It was still just a bit past dawn, and the slow wind was clearing up the clouds, to reveal a clear sky. 

The Third Training ground was still pretty much the same. Three wooden posts, the river, the solid grounds surrounded by the woods. A beautiful landscape. Alastor approached the three posts and climbed on top of the middle one, looking for signs of his brother. Xian was already a Chuunin, a middle ninja who knew his way around this training grounds. Alastor was sure that he was in for a treat. 

The sun was now completely visible and it was bothering Alastor's drowsy eyes. The sun, while blinding Alastor, almost prepared him for his brother. He came in like a flash, striking Alastor with a heavy punch and knocking him over the post.
"Heya, brother!" he screamed with a gravelly voice and a grin so wide, it wasn't even appropriate for someone his age. 
Alastor was so surprised by his brothers idiotic entrance that he was left speechless.
"Oh, sorry. I just thought you would be more prepared, brother. Especially now that you're a full genin and all" he was scratching his head while Alastor was getting back on his feet and dusting himself. 
"Buuut, I was wrong" he was provoking Alastor even more, knowing that this would get him fired up in no time. 
"Good morning, Xian!” Alastor answered with an irritated voice, sarcastically looking at his brother. 
"You ready, then?" Xian was preparing himself for the match by doing a few jumping jacks. "Come on, just come at me whenever you feel ready, lil' bro!”

Alastor speechlessly took a running start with a prepared fist and took a little jump before he faced his brother. He tried to lay a punch, but Xian ducked and dodged it. Alastor almost instinctively swinged his left foot in his brother's face, but Xian blocked it with his arm before Alastor even got it off the ground. Xian took a good grip of his brother's leg and pulled it on the side, making Alastor fall on his arse. 
"Wow, I was sure expecting more from a full genin" Xian smiled when he jumped back, leaving Alastor on the ground. He was still a bit drowsy, that must of been it! He didn't wait too much before charging again, trying to speed up as he was running towards his brother, who took a defensive stance, spreading his legs. Alastor was a bit more angry this time, and he decided to just try and lay a single punch. When he arrived in front of Xian, he just simultaneously tried to hit his brother with both of his fists. Xian was just backing up and dodging all of his brothers attempts. Alastor jumped forward, focusing on one fist only. This forced Xian to take his fist and just pass him on the ground. Alastor withdrew a kunai from his holster and stabbed it in the ground, which allowed him to maneuver himself and turn around to kick Xian, who clearly wasn't expecting this. He finally took a solid kick in his abdomen, allowing Alastor to keep coming at him. 

Alastor was now back on his feet, and his brother took a pretty harsh kick in his stomach. Alastor quickly flickered behind his brother, who tried to dodge his next shot. Luckily for Alastor, he was too slow and took in a punch in his face. This forced him to flee from the scene and back up a couple of meters away from Alastor. They were both trying to catch a breath.

"Nice work, Alastor. But you're just a bit lucky this morning, that's all. Anyway, now's my turn" Xian frowned and was looking pretty serious. Not the look Alastor was looking forward to, but he definitely was prepared.
Xian was running in zig-zag motion to confuse Alastor, who was confidently staying his ground. Xian finally made a turn and tried to swing at Alastor with his left leg. Alastor used both of his hands to grab his brothers leg, which was inches away from his surprised face. Xian did manage to use his brother's hands like a mirror object, and rougly hit his brothers head with his palm, making Alastor, not only to let go of his leg, but to almost fall on his arse again. 
"Damn it" Alastor wasn't getting ahold of his brother. But this time he felt more powerful than the last time they met. The thought that he improved from the last time was enough to fuel him enough into another charge. He madly tried to punch his older brother, but it was just not enough. But, the anger was making him do it again and again. And, after an hour, he was exhausted. They both backed off, desperately trying to catch a breath. Alastor couldn't think of anything but his tiredness and the pulsating pain in his muscles. Maybe they started a bit too early. His legs were trembling and he wasn't hoping of accomplishing much further today. 

On the other hand, his brother was firmly standing and developing a wide grin. He looked tired, but it just seemed that there were more important things to him then that. This infuriated Alastor, who tried to charge, again. Xian prepared himself, a bit excited that his younger brother was this decisive. But, midway to his brother, Alastor just couldn't take it anymore. He just stopped and flipped over on his back, while the sun was showering his face.

Xian smiled."Come on, say it. Say it! You're a loser!" 

~~End of Memory 3~~

~~Memory 4~~
A mean laugh of a child was echoing in an alley, close to Konohagakure’s Ninja academy. A small bunch of kids with rucksacks on them were gathered around the end of the dark alley. 
They were surrounding two other kids, while making jokes, laughing and cheering. A skinny boy with crimson hair, just a bit smaller than anyone else was ruthlessly being strangled with both hands by his classmate. His pale skin soon turned red, and his classmates hands were soon soaked with the victims tears.

"I thought you were a ninja! Ha-ha!" the bully was soon to let go of his neck, but that wasn't the end. He started punching him in the head, all to the joy of his crowd. The kid soon started to sob and tried to ran away, but with no luck.
"What's the matter, Alastor? You want your mom?" the child was hysterically laughing. He was obviously feeling very confident, smacking around his classmate and getting more and more approval from his other classmates. Just as he gathered his fist and prepared to swing at his young friend, a loud voice stopped him.

"Stop that!" 

Everybody turned around in surprise, only to see a tall boy in a flak jacket, wearing the Konoha's forehead protector. His figure was shining on the red sun behind him, and he had a look of a serious man.

Alastor had to shake his head several times to figure that it's him. Xian, his older brother. And everybody looked intimidated to see his jacket and his facial expression.

"Let him go, brat. And find somebody else to fuck with.”

Yep. That was definitely a full Chuunin ninja. Not many people tend to curse like that. The young academy students were staring at him in silence. Not much time has passed, and they all started running. 

Everyone, except for Alastor.

His older brother would always tease him, avoid him, boss him around. But this time, he looked at his older brother and cracked a smile. And a tooth. Or two. 
That must of been his favourite memory. He'll never forget that walk from school to home, when his brother hugged him with one hand and walked home with him.

"85, 86, 87..." Alastor was loudly panting while counting his pushups in his room. A red face and a tired expression, and a painful gasp every once in awhile. He sure was pushing himself. Not everyone is determined enough to train almost the whole day. 
Xian was away, on a mission, but it was a saturday again. A day when the two brothers would traditionally train taijutsu at the training grounds. But, since he was away, he just had to do it alone. 

After a few more sets of pushups, he stepped outside. It was a beautiful, cloudless day, and the hot sun was already half way on the sky. Since he was the close-combat part of his team, he wanted to work on some taijutsu. And he remembered a maneuver that his brother would always show him, except he never got around to do in it. It was a body spin, and it sure wasn't easy. He started to walk towards his team's training grounds, and he got loaded with sweat by the time he got there. His headband was soaked and all he wanted to do was find a shade and train quietly. He took a running start to maneuver himself over the high fence and land inside the 44 Training Grounds. 

He knew he had to walk cautiously, because this place was filled with traps. Wires, holes, logs - Alastor's mortal enemies. He was still embarrassed to remember how he activated several traps here during his training, and nearly got himself killed. Alastor found a place in the shade of the dense forest on the northern part of the training ground. The smells and sounds of nature were soothing enough to get Alastor relaxed. 

After he was well relaxed, he started to remember the way his brother would do it. It was surely one of his favourite taijutsu moves, and he would always perform it so smoothly. He would jump and turn horizontally, twist his legs around and land over an obstacle. He knew that his brother would be proud of him if he ever managed to train this one without his professional guidance. 

Alastor stretched his arms and legs, before he started to run towards the clearing. He then did a promising jump, and turned horizontally, only to end it with a faceplant. 

"Damn it..." he got up pretty quickly and eyed his surroundings, to make sure no one was looking. Anyway, it looks like this wasn't enough for Alastor. He started to run in the opposite direction and repeat the same process. Only this time, he didn't faceplant, instead he was skilled enough to land on his arms. That was definitely a move forward, which made him happier. And it was still just a bit past noon, he'll surely handle this move before the sun goes out. 

Without much thinking, he tried again. Jumped, and actually managed to do a bit of a spin. But, this time, he didn't take care of his landing and face planted again. The burn on his red face made him think his next try through. Maybe, he should start with something easier. After all, he never saw his brother do this spin technique when he was a genin. He laid on the ground and frowned when he looked at the sun. It was slowly draining sweat out of him. He laid for a few minutes before he figured that he should probably get up and try again. After all, he could bet that none of his teammates were slacking off. 

"Let's go, Alastor" he whispered when he twisted his legs and jumped up. Wait, wasn't that a spin? It took him a few seconds to process what he had just done. He would almost always get up from the ground like this. Isn't this a better way to start doing it? Alastor lied on the ground and twisted his legs before he mirrored off the ground using his arms. He got up pretty quickly and rotated a couple of times, making him almost lose his balance when he got up. Yes, that was a good start. But he still needed to work on the technique. But, this was sure promising. He laid on the ground again, this time confident that he'll do it even better. He jumped horizontally, without much mirroring with his arm-* - Tue Oct  6 12:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Alastor(LordxPatrick) arms, and he did a fast spin. 

Alastor was now getting the hang of this technique. He smiled as he layed on the ground and did the process several times. And every time, he would get a bigger and stronger spin. After a few times he's done it almost completely right, he recklessly tried to do it and face planted. This made him a bit more careful about his moves, and he remembered that concentration is needed for almost anything. But, only a few hours have passed, and Alastor learned this taijutsu maneuver. His blue shirt was soaked in sweat, and he layed on the ground again. This time, he didn't wanted to get up. He was perfectly fine laying in the shade of a high tree and smiling to the sun.

~~Memory 5~~
’The dexterity of the lion is enough to outmatch any prey; their ambidextrousAlastor and other physical properties make them the most fierce fighters. Few animals are faster than the lion, fewer still are stronger, but none is more capable than the lion.’

Alastor shut the book in a satisfied fashion. He had been reading about lions all morning. Reading...Something he was trying out. It was one of those days where he woke up remembering his mother; reading old mission reports he had found stashed in the closet and reading about lions–the animal that his mother was nicknamed after-were two ways he typically coped with the thought of the loss. 

Alastor allowed the text he had just read to run through his mind for a few moments… the dexterity of the lion was a key to its physical dominance. He tapped his lips with the index finger; A force of habit when reading and turning a page. He seldom picked up on the annoying tick. Meanwhile his right hand slowly caressed the book, which was now closed and meeting his gaze. 

’I need to work on MY dexterity. But how does one increase their dexterity?’

Alastor returned the book to the packed shelf from which it came; he was slightly surprised there still stood a vacancy despite the volume of material occupying the surrounding space.

As he walked, his mind worked hard trying to give birth to an idea in order to achieve better dexterity. It wasn’t until he passed by a fellow shinobi who was carrying a large basket of smoke bombs that he came up with an idea. Had Alastor’s mind not been too busy utilizing this information for the task at hand, he would have found the sight rather odd. 

’I bet juggling would greatly improve my dexterity.’

Alastor made his way to one of the various training rooms before seeking weight balls. He started with only two balls, worried that diving right into intense juggling would waste more time than working his way up. He tossed the balls simultaneously and caught them with the opposite hand each time. 

This was not too difficult; however, Alastor was carrying out the task with little speed. He slowly accelerated, which led to some struggle keeping the balls nearby on the tosses. He worked his momentum into an unorthodox method by tossing one ball twice for each one toss of the other. He would commit to one side for several sets before switching to match. He was slowly gaining confidence and tried not to think about how it would work with even three balls.

Alastor was tossing one ball up while passing the other back and forth at a lower height, and catching the ball with the hand that threw it. He was switching balls rather frequently. His pace was steady with moderate speed and he decided he was ready for a third ball. 

He eyed the two balls in his left hand with weary eyes before tossing them into the air and throwing the ball with his right hand. He caught the first two just fine but had managed to toss the third ball away from himself. 

After retrieving the ball, he attempted several more times before managing to at least bump the third ball out of his hand due to the first or second ball blocking it’s nest. Alastor frowned before telling himself he was going to get serious. 

It took about an hour for Alastor to keep three balls in the air at a time. He was outlining an oval with his mind while trying his best to trace it using the trajectory of the balls. He had discovered that keeping only one ball in a hand at a time was more realistic for juggling than catching two at a time and repeating a toss. He would worry about catching at the end of his dribbling session later.

For now Alastor worked hard just to keep the balls afloat. He was pacing steadily in a small area cluttered with his footwork while focusing on the imaginary oval. He was slowly increasing the pace and could feel beads of seat roll down his cheeks. This was intense.

After another hour or so, Alastor had managed to juggle the three spheres with significantly less difficulty. He found that the key was to relax and simply keep his hands moving. His pacing had stopped and he rotated the three balls rather smoothly-until he tried to reverse the direction. 

After picking up the balls, Alastor tried again. He repeated the process and followed a quick step-by-step process he had formed on the spot. He worked the three balls up and kept them traveling to the left before focusing on an oval and eventually keeping his feet still. He managed to catch all three by clasping his hands together to wedge the third ball in between. He shifted the ball into one of his hands before grabbing a fourth.

This time, it took Alastor about an hour to successfully keep all four balls in the air. He was sweating rather profusely due to the high level of concentration and the weightless squats he seemed to be participating in. He steadied his breathing while trying to grasp some sort of relaxation. He failed. 

The balls were everywhere, Alastor struggles to keep any from falling. He was doing various leg workouts just trying to catch every ball. He ranged from squads to lunges to leaps. 

’Why is this so difficult?! 

…At least I know I’m improving.’

A smirk forced its way into Alastor’s poker face while he forced himself to keep the balls within a more comfortable diameter. He worked hard to get the balls into an oval trajectory and finally found the ability to keep still while doing it. His arms were aching now and his breaths were short and rapid. He struggled to keep his eyes open, fighting the powerful grip of sweat that tried to pull them closed. 

After a little while keeping four balls rotating, Alastor managed to steady his breathing and calm down. He juggled for about ten minutes before trying to switch directions. To Alastor’s surprise, this came slightly easier than the three balls. He had already broken the barrier that was the opposite direction and so he had an easier time with the four balls. 

After a couple drops, Alastor could manage juggling towards the left. He did so for a while before catching the balls in his arms. He sighed dramatically while his stomach rumbled. Not only had Alastor learned to juggle, he also learned he was hungry. After returning the weighted balls to their home, Alastor was on his way to a restaurant...any restaurant. His stomach demanded it!
