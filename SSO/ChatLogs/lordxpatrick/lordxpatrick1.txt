<br><font color=yellow>*Herakuru(Dillion13) was one of this best Hyyuga in his clan, he was alway's training on his most famous Jyuuken Gentle fist stlye, one day he was hitting a log "Huff, Huff" Herakuru would say as he would begin to get dazed from all the training that he does, but he does not give it he keep's hitting it more and more until, 'SNAP!" The log had broken in half this had shown how strong Herakuru had become in the day's back then he could not even leave a mark on a log. Falling down he had begin to close his eye's falling off into the sleep. Thinking about the Main branch and the side branch of the Hyuuga clan.

He opened his eye's to find out that it was night, he was worried tha the missed his meeting. He had heard some rumbuling in the bushes he had looked around and claped his hand's together. 'Byukugan!" Herakuru had said. He looked around and had seen somoenes Charka. He then got into his Juuyken Gentle fist style.

The stance he had been training on all his life, well not all but most of the time. He used this stance in all of his fight's it would be able to take away you're use of Charka if it hit you. Herakuru threw a Paper bomb into the bushes where he had seen the man's Charka.

It had exlpoded and Herakuru watched as the man jumped up into the air. He was very weird looking, the man landed on the ground right infront of Herakuru, he did not waste any time the man tryed to hit him right in the face, but with his Gentle fist style it was a easy thing to dodge it.

He moved right under the attack hitting the man in the stomach trying to stop his Charka flow, hitting he Herakuru kept on going he would not stop he would hit him on the arm and the shoulder, then doing a 360 spin he come's back around and hit's the man with his palm.

Making him go flying. This was so eas for Herakuru but then he was caught off guard getting hit in the face he flew back, Herakuru was very injured and he was not able to move as fast as he could before, he knew now that this guy was a heavy hitter. Herakuru waited until the man had come closer.

Then putting one of his hand's down close to hit shoe's and the other one high up he then would get into his new found move stance, a Green circle would apprear right around him and Herakuru would begin to hit the man "2 hand's 4 hand's, 6 hand's, 8, hand's 16 hand's, 24 hand's, 32 hand's, Ahh!! 64 hand's!" Herakuru would say as he would hit the man with his palm making him go flying. The man was out cold or maybe even dead. Herakuru had realized tha this was just a test. To test his Gentle fist style.*

"Rat, Ox, Ram, Monkey, Horse. Fuuton, Air Bullet!"

He opened his mouth, sending out a large bullet into the sky.*

<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: Push myself up with a jutsu.
<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: Avoid a humongous Fire Ball.
<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: And send these Air Bullets down on my opponent.

<br><font color=green>*Seithin Gringu(Jack Lyzerg) says: ( The scope of the attack is altered by controlling the volume of chakra that is mustered. The released flames will engulf their target, and leave a crater on the ground's surface.  )
<br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Rahie) Standing up on the wall near the outsides of the Hokage Mansion  he'd begin to remove remove his cloak, as toss it behind him off onto the roof, as he'd begin to remove his hand as he'd keep that in his hands as he'd look down at the cloaked man. "An Uchiha clan memeber huh? I thought you guys no longer exsisted? but for a ninja that skilled in the art of fireball jutsu, and the third level of sharingan you're more than the average criminal aren't you?".*

<br><font color=yellow>*Seithin Gringu(Jack Lyzerg) chuckles. "Hahah, about time you came and fought me face to face....Now, let's get this over with! Come at me bro!!" He would says as he began doing handseals.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) He was casually walking up to the seen, hoping to find Lord Hokage. "Hopefully he'll stay true to his word!" Alastor thought, as a large smile crossed his face. He saw a series of people in the distance, wondering what was going on. "Hmm...might want to check that out," he said as quickened his pace, a seriouse look now crossing his face.

When he arrived on the scene, his first thought was there was a fight going on. He saw the blackened ground, and Lord Hokage facing a man whom Alastor had never seen before. "What the hell..." He mumbled to himself, back up a few steps and preparing his guard.*

<br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Rahie) "I've always wondered what it's like to fight an Uchiha Clan Memeber, and just for this occasion i've been saving this technique". He'd spread his legs apart as he'd clapse his hands together as he ran down the wall he was standing on, perfectly commiting his chakra to his feet, as he'd ran down weaving a barrage of hand seals in matter of a few seconds focusing his chakra. Then after landing to the ground, he burst off in a agile speed with his arms dangling behind him as he'd ran foward toward Seithin, as he reached into his back weapon pouch, as he commenced with flicking out 5 shuriken toward Seithin Gringe.*

<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Rahie) says: (Yeah im the second)
<br><font color=yellow>*Seithin Gringu(Jack Lyzerg) smirks as he makes three handseals. "Edo Tensai!" He exclaims as he slams the ground. All of a sudden a large coffin would appear. It would take the shuriken being thrown at Seithin. They would embed into it. As he continues to run, a girl with white hair would suddenly launch out of the Coffin. This girl "Rose" Would swing her rather large sword, aimed directly at the Hokage's throat. Since he was running straight towards it he would have an -extremely- hard time avoiding the quick moving dead girl.*
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (oh shit)

<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Rahie) says: (This negro has Sharingan, and the Edo Tensai goddamnit)
<br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Rahie) As he ran moving foward he found it surprising that an Uchiha clan member could raise the dead with the Edo Tensai Jutsu "Impossible!". With his attempt at dodging the sword's attack he'd  stop in his tracks sliding against the tyrain of the ground, as he'd do a slight jump back getting hopefully getting away just in a split second of time to avoid the strike with the sword, as he'd then attempt to do a roundhouse kick to use his longest weapon against her trying to kick Rose into the her chest trying to send her chest, before she had enough time for her next swing, as he'd try kicking her through her coffin into the cloaked Uchiha man.*

<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Rahie) says: (This was  a set up -_-)
<br><font color=yellow>*Seithin Gringu(Jack Lyzerg) smirks as the idiot attempts to use the same jutsu against him. He forces his chakra into the attack. He puts the last 25% of chakra he is willing to put in. The two attacks would cause a huge explosion. As this happens the Edo'ed Girl "Rose" Would run from around the back of the Hokage. She would then Send a huge blow directly at the Hokage from behind. She would aim directly for his neck hoping to cut his head clean from his body.*
<br><font color=green>*Rose(SusanMarkington) says: You called me master? Would you like me to destroy this fool?

<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: Shit. Just. Got. Real.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Hi there!
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: Hmm? Hello.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Are you a Kumogakure shinobi?
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: Yes, I am.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Oo! Would you like to train with me!?
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: I need a training partner.
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: What sort of training...?
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Just a simple spar.
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: Sure, why not.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Okay! Let's go!
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: This a good spot?
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: Sure, sure.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: I'll take the first move!
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: Sure.
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) smiles cheerily as she makes several handseals. The air around Kirsten begins to get a bit moist. It suddenly congeals into several clones of her. Each clone is an exact replica. There are about twenty clones of Kirsten running around the area. They are half-clones and therefore do not have mass, but anyone who hadn't touched one would swear they were genuine.

As the twenty clones run at the male, they all pull out kunai and leap at him. Kirsten is among the seven clones that hang back from the initial charge. As they make the other clones make their charge she pulls out three smoke bombs. She tosses one up into the air and it lands somewhere behind Alastor, she takes another and throws it directly at the ground in front of her and she tosses the third one to the ground in front of Alastor.

Kirsten makes three handseals and dissappears into the smoke.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) He smiles, noting that this should be a fun fight. He tilts his head to the side slightly, wondering what exactly this shinobi was hoping to accomplish. "Tricking me...?" he mumbled to himself, as he smiled. He formed five quick hand seals, as the smokes bombs went off.

In one swift motion, he pulled out and equipped a kunai into his left hand. He was alert, listening to his surroundings, trying to pick out where his opponent had gone. He smiled once more, a plan in his head.

In one more motion, he threw the kunai into the ground in front of his right foot, following the downward motion to crouch. He slammed his hands against the ground, as electricity would surge through it. It was not enough to hurt badly, but it would be a nice shock, that should easily defeate all the fake clones coming towards him.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( The electricty is running along the top of the ground right? )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Mhm.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) smiles to herself as her clones are easily dissipated. At this point her clones didn't even matter. "Shinjuu...Zanshu!" She says to herself as her hands shoot up from under the ground. The smoke would obscure her opponents vision giving him to warning as to the coming attack. Her hands would reach for his legs, if successfully grabbing the crouching boy, she'd pulls his body underground up to his neck.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) He saw more smoke, as the clones were destroyed. "Heh, now to find the real one," he thought to himself, as he felt something tug onto his leg. "Heh, idiot," he thought to himself, as he was dragged under the ground, concealed now and trapped up to his neck. "You win," He yelled out, smiling slyly.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) is standing over the male, she pulls her scythe from her back and stares at him with a blank expression. "I am sorry..." She says as she swings the scythe around her body once and then spins as she swings it like a golf club, the scythe is aimed at taking the boy's head clean off his body.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) He saw the girl standing over him, and smiled. As he heard the words, his smile faded into a frown. The chakra he had been channeling into the ground had never faded, though. He had been pulled in while the jutsu was activated, and had been continuing to use it since. He had not suspected this girl would try to kill him, but he was not going to show any mercy either now.

 "NO!" he screamed out, as he sent about twenty percent of his chakra through the ground around him in an eletric current, which would destroy most of the rock around him, freeing himself. If the girl did not move, she would be eletricuted, too.*
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Nice to have a jashinist.)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( how many times can you use Earth Flash? )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (No idea. I'll ask.)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (use the verb)
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (OH now it shows.)
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Wasn't showing before xD)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (its supposed to be 2-3)
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Mmkay.)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: (Trin )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (?)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( What does taht mean exactly? )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (what?)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( I never did understand that )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( 2-3 )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (^.)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( So 2 or 3 ? )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (I mean, before it drains all my chakra?)
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Oor what?)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (3 is like pushing your limit and draining your chakra)
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (And if you have the chakra perk?)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (1 more use)
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Mmkay.)
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (So 3-4.)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (use it again)
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Thank ya.)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (k)
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) groans as the boy destroys the ground beneath him with a surge of chakra. She leaps upwards into the air and while doing so whips out two kunai and throws them straight at the boy's head. If successful, they would embed themselves straight into his skull.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( 4got to post it )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Nice.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) As he was now free, he frowned. "This, is not going to happen," he said as he saw the kunai began to fly towards him. "BYE!" he shouted, as he attempted to jump over to the right, hopefully dodging the kunai, before trying to run off in the direction of Kumogakure. His thoughts were racing, as he wondered why this person would try to kill him, a lowly genin.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) smirks as the boy begins to run towards the village. She makes two handseals, as she does so she begins to run after him. She leaps upwards and lands on the ground. As she does so the earth would ripple beneath him, causing him to slow down because his footing would be uneasy. Then all of a sudden rocks would raise from the ground originating from beneath, behind, and to the side of him in a straight line. They would come up with enough force to break any bone in his body in the places where he was made contact with.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) "Damn, almost out of chakra!" he screamed inside of his head, as he turned back towards the enemy. "Can't run!" he shouted, as his footing became loose, and rocks began to shoot up. He knew he had only two uses, max, left of his technique, but he could not be bothered with that now.

He formed five hand seals, as the rocks began to shoot up. "JIBASHI!" he yelled, as he reared back and slammed his right hand hard against the ground that was moving in front of him, shooting towards the spikes that were rising towards him. 

The electricity left a small 'slice' in the earth as it went, but would continue after the spikes. It would continue on until it met under the girl, as he hoped he could incapacitate her with the shock. "Heh, raiton beats doton," he said slyly, as he pulled out a kunai, panting heavily.*
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Your chakra would be low, too. J/s.)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( mhm ofc )
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) is caught by the raiton arcing through the ground. Kirsten is panting heavily but she doesn't drop to the ground. "Huff, huff....Heh, but you can't possibly have enough chakra at this point to continue on..." She says as she holds her scythe at a ready stance. Kirsten suddenly rushes forwards. 

She brings her scythe up and spins her body once, Kirsten then swings it over her body as she brings it towards the boy's midsection attempting to cause him to drop to the ground bleeding out.*
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Oh damn sorry my thing didn't autoscroll just saw you posted.)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( lol kay. )
<br><font color=yellow>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) He saw the scyth coming towards him, as he knew what he had to do. "HA!!" he shouted, as he threw the kunai at the girl's torse, as he fell onto his back. He performed five hand signs, and if uninterrupted he would then pull out his last kunai into his right hand, as he landed on his back. His face was covered in sweat, his body was burning in pain. His breathing was heavy, and he was scared for his life. "I WILL NOT DIE!" he screamed, as he awaited the next blows.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( kay. Typing )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Mmkay. Take your time.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) leaps to the side, avoiding the kunai, Kirsten would then spin her body around, getting closer to Alastor, she then swings her scythe directly for his throat as he begins to do the string of handseals, stopping his jutsu in its tracks.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) He didn't know what to do. He saw the scyth coming down towards his neck, so he did the one thing he thought he could. He would sweep his body in a whirlwind like motion, attempting to grab ahold of and twist the leg of the girl with his own leg as he withdrew a kunai.

He would once more attempt to form the five hand seals fast, as his body would have been twisted out of the way of the scyth when he grabbed ahold of the girl.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( wait. So you used my body to spin around, and turned away from me to do the handseals? )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (I basically grabbed your leg between my legs and twisted it to knock you over, and my torso went to the side with it.)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( So we'd end up laying down right? )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Mhm.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) isn't about to let the boy catch her. Kirsten leaps upwards and pulls her scythe back. "Die." She says dully as she brings the scythe down through the air. She would swing it with an immense amount of speed. The close quarters would cause this to be an extremely hard to dodge attack, since the weapon is quite long.*
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Where would the scyth be hitting me? Torso?)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( From shoulder to waist. Like..Itd cut into you )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Mmkay.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) He finished the hand signs. But now she was upon him. As the scyth went into his flesh, he would let out a scream of pain. At the same time, he would slam his right hand onto the scyth as it entered his shoulder, sending a huge shockwave straight through it and into the person holding it, the girl. If it hit her, it would most likely knock her unconsious, due to the immsense amount of eletricty entering her body at once.

If the girl let go of the scyth, he would take it out of his shoulder, attempting to slam the pole into her torso, before spinning the scyth around.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( That was Jibashi u used? )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Mhm. My last use, I'm drained of chakra now.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) Kirsten lets go of the scythe as the boy puts his hand on it. "Not about to let that happen again!" She exclaims as the raiton chakra surges through. She is in the process of letting go as the raiton chakra hits. She is caught slightly, it simply causes her arms to go numb and her vision to blur for a moment. "Damn..." She grunts as the boy takes the scythe and hits her with it. She is down to a small amount of usuable chakra at this point. "Grr, one more jutsu I have.." She says as she gets up from the ground and stares him down. 

"Huff, huff...." She pants as she stares at the boy holding her scythe. "You're goin- *cough* You're going to pay." She says rather angrily. She pulls a single kunai out of her pouch and a single smoke bomb. Kirsten suddenly begins running at Alastor. She gets about 5 feet away from him and throws her last smokebomb at the ground. It would go off, obscuring his vision. She suddenly throws the Kunai directly at him from his vulnerable position. 

Kirsten then does four final handseals before dissappearing totally into the smoke.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) He knows he doesn't have much time. "Not again!" he shouted, as he used the scyth to help him stablize himself. He used what little stamina he had left to hop into the tree by him, away from the smoke. "Probably underground..." he thought to himself as he leaned against the tree, the scythe still in his right hand.*
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Shit didn't mean to hit enter.)
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (WHatever.)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ) What about the kunai? )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Didn't see that line. Retyping.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) He was tired, he was delerious, and sweat was dripping in his eyes. The kunai came flying at him, and landed itself into his left shoulder. "ARGH!" he screamed, as he left it in there. He didn't have the strength to move it. 

He knew his only chance was to get to higher ground, but he would never make it to the nearby tree. He barley was able to keep body up at this point, at the point of passing out. But he smiled. He admired this girls style, and knew she could help him, and he could help her.

"I like your style. Maybe we could work as an alliance, instead of trying to kill each other! We could be a great assest to one another!" he said, as he awaited a reply, vulernable.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( HMMMMM Quite a conundrum...I need another kill....But I could -really- use you...Hmmmmm )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (xD)
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (You should ttly use me.)
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Wouldn't be hard to get a kill with a team ;)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( im kinda back and forth gotta do stuff )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (xD)
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) stares at the male. "Had you been stronger...You could have helped..." She says as she makes her final approach. She pulls out her final Kunai and holds it at the ready. "Prepare..." She says as she runs around behind him within the smoke. She is to his right when she throws the Kunai at him. Just as she finishes she runs towards where she knows he is. Kirsten leaps up into the air and lands in front of him, out of the smoke. She lands with her palms on the ground. 

All of a sudden, in a surge of chakra, a large rock formation would appear up under him. It would shoot up and be aimed at his throat. The rock wouldn't be very sharp, but it would be strong enough to break his trachea, killing him almost instantly.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) dies.*
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (xD)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( lol aww )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( nothing dramatic or anything? )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Nothing I could do.)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( shucks )
