<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dark(LordxPatrick) Suddenly, Dark would form the rat seal as they moved with the convoy. "Shadow Possession." He thought, as his shadow would split into two part. One would shoot for Iza's shadow, the other Marrisa's, as he jumped to his left. He doubted a trading convoy would be much bother.* - Thu Oct 22 07:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dark(LordxPatrick) was hit by the wind bullets, taking them unexpectedly. He was thrown across the ground, and passed out.* - Thu Oct 22 07:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mokutsu(LordxPatrick) He walked to the executiosn grounds...Not a word escaping his mouth. His face showed a man who was defeated. A boy of only fifteen years of age...Yet his face showed the pain of a thousand lives. As he marched towards the grounds where he would remain as an example long after his life had ended...He began to think back. As he reached the tree, he took a deep breath and looked to the spot his body would remain.

Mokutsu felt it was his throat suddenly became more dry that it had ever been before. Moments before, he felt the urge to burst into tears. "You are a...Shinobi..." He mentally reminded himself. It was the only thing that kept him from breaking down. As he was tied to the rotten husk-of-a-tree...Mokutsu closed his eyes. A single second passed, but he saw every moment wortth remembering. Oddly enough, Marrisa was in nearly every one. The few she was not in were simply his earliest memories...Before the day his parents were gone forever.

He could now recall the moment he had given up hope. The time, not long ago, he had been ready to throw away what he considered a worthless life. A time when he was FREE to choose, FREE to LIVE! Mokutsu remembered it was Marrisa whom had saved him from throwing it all away. He didn't want to believe it...He wanted to believe he had simply fell unconsious. But there was no more running. The one woman whom he had grown to care for...The one -person- whom he felt such strong feelings towards...Had saved him.

Mokutsu silenty opened his eyes and watched as Tetsumi's voice cracked the words at him. They physically stung; As if he was being whipped. It was harder now to hold back the tears...But Mokutsu somehow managed. The whole time Mokutsu had purposely avoided eye-contact with Marrisa or even in her general direction. As Tetsumi fell silent...Mokutsu spoke his final words.

"Why? That is a question I have asked myself. It's better this way, Tetsumi. At least this way..I can't harm the one person in this world that I have ever truely loved. The kind of love that drives you to do crazy things...Just to protect her. The things you do just to avoid hurting her at ANY cost: Even your own life. I love you..." With that, he looked towards Marrisa. He attempted to carve her image into his brain for a moment, then closed his eyes. 

All he envisioned was her face...Her smile...The way she had spoken so kindly to him. A smile creeped over his lips. He knew this was the end for him. He had accepted that. He drowned out everything else...No sounds nor other stimulus could reach him. 

He did not feel as the sand slowly encased his body. As the once pale skin would become covered the black, blood-caked sand. The tears Mokutsu had fought back now flowed freely...But he felt them not. They were not tears of sorrow. They were tears of happiness. He was so happy that he could die remembering the one woman he loved...His only regret that he never found out if she loved him back.

As the Sand crawled towards his neck, Son Goku began to speak. It was a somber voice. A voice Mokutsu had not ever heard from the beast. "You were different." was all he said. That was the moment when the sand coffin, now having fully encased Mokutsu, condensed. Before Mokutsu noticed, it was over. No pain was felt; A final gift from Tetsumi. 

He found himself in a darkness that surrounded. He had no idea where he was...But it was calming. "I'll wait for her." He said, nodding to himself. He decided to sit upon the darkness at his feet, as ripples pooled away from where he sat as if the darkness was solid-water. "As long as it takes...I'll wait." He said to himself.* - Thu Oct 22 08:56:19 2015
