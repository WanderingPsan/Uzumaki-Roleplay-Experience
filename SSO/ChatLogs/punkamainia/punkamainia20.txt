<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) entered the training grounds, wdeciding that he was going to go watch Anguo train for a while. He usually found it a good place to relax and wind down, and that's ahat he would do. While he watched them form the rings of fire, he would sit on the dusty floor, "Is it alright with you if I watch?"* - Sun Oct 11 18:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) walked onto the turf of the training field, being comprised of dust, sand, dirt, and all other types of earthen materials. Moving towards the middle kf the area, he'd sigh. Ever since coming here, all he had done was doma little bit of trainng, and mingle with some of the villages. There was barely any action, and he was seldom let out the village. He decided to take it to himself to start his own training. He hadn't been potent nor familiar enough with his Scorch-natured abilities to start creating and learning new jutsu. Therefore, he had to settle on the chakra natures that he was already familiar with: Katon and Fuuton. Ryomen had recently learned a new technique for his Fuuton element, and he wanted to train it in order to get better with it.* - Sun Oct 11 21:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) cracked his knuckles. He closed his eyes, meditating for several seconds. Envisioning his chakra, the young shinobi thought of it moving and flowing smoothly through his chakra system, passing through his Tenketsu points with ease. With a deep inhale and strong exhale, he felt that he was ready to start his training. Ryomen opened his eyes, an imaginary target being placed right in front of him. He'd squint his eyes, attempting to focus on his target before thinking of his moves. Without any warning or intimation, he took off with speed towards his target. In the midst of this, he withdrew his tanto from its hilt. In one striking motion, he was able to deal a substantial amount of damage to his imaginary target. * - Sun Oct 11 21:26:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) made his way towards Sunagakure. As he was almost there, he heard scrambles in his radio, thought the voices were -very- faint. To him, it seemed surprising, because he thought Konoha bad been demolished. The fact that people were still on the radio made him perk up. He'd hear a passer y speaking on the matter as well.

"Have you heard?"
"Heard what?"
"The rumours about Konoha being on the rise again. Apparently, some shinobi from Kumogakure took it upon themselves to reestablish the village, thougb I'm not too sure if it's true."
"Probably not, Konoha's a wasteland after the attack from the giant monster."

Ryomen was a little ticked off at first, hearing the men slander his "home" village. However, he wanted to see if the rumours were true. He stood in front of the big gap allowing for entry, looking through the see business life and dome-esque building. The village he was born and spent part of his life in can wait, but it was time to see if the village where he spent most of his childhood had been revitalized.* - Wed Oct 14 04:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) traveled along the lesser traveled roads to avoid suspicion about his movement and whereabouts. These areas were tricky and dangerous, and he had to maneuver them himself. He was lucky in the sense that he did have maps, thanks to the old library of Konoha, and spare ones laying around in Genjigakure. He could travel to Sunagakure and Konohagakure thrice to and back, if he needed to. This was provided that he was safe along the way. He wanted to take a visit to both villages, provided that they both bad significance to him. The boy had memories of the sandy village, but they were scarce and bare, barely able to be remembered detail for detail.

Either way, all he wanted to do was see what the hype was all about, before traveling back to Sunagakure and maybe milking them for some resources. What about Genjigakure? What about Edge? Where would he fit in all this? Ryomen didn't know. All he did know, however, was that be needed to get out of that boring, lifeless, and rape-fueld "village." He did owe Edge something, but this mattered more to Ryomen. He was determined to see what his old second home was like now, no matter who occupied it. This was going to be a blast.* - Wed Oct 14 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) could be seen walking along the path, seemingly making his way towards Konohagakure.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) shrugged, "Soul-searching, clue-hunting, whatever ya' wanna call it, but something like that--yes. An open mind is just something that doesn't come easy to me. I'm way to receptive and reactive to my environment to have an open and clear mind. Being a monk wouldn't just fit for me." He the. turned to face Nigen, arching his brow, "You've dont it before? If I may ask, how did that turn out? Good to know, so I can have an heads-up in case of anything."* - Thu Oct 15 22:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: If you're trying to find yourself, then listening to anothers story wouldn't help much would it? I'd assume that everyone goes through different journeys to get to find themselves.   - Thu Oct 15 22:45:20 2015

These, people, I can't even remember. I heard some people had relocated, but...wow.> He kept approaching, a nostalgic smile on his face as he revisited his first home. His body had already began to reacclimate to the weather, which had been one that was long lost to him. He finally arrived near the center of the village, smiling. "Um, hello," the boy said kind of nervous. He was expecting to get a negative reaction, since he was rather new and unseen around the village.* - Fri Oct 16 01:30:52 2015
