<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) separated himself from the others. He had decided to remain in the space of the public square. However, he didn't want to cause any harm to anyone incase what he were going to do would cause harm to others. Setting his hammer off to the side, Ikarus would let Varys stand on his own via digging the mallet straight into the pavement. It would end up creating a small dent, allowing the mallet to stand straight rather than falling over on either side. Standing next to his primary weapon, he closed his eyes, imagining his chakra network. Ikarus envisioned the chakra calmly and smoothly flowing through each tenketsu point.

Then with a sudden force, he'd stir this chakra up, the calm and smooth flow changing pace and rapidly bursting with speed and haste. This was similar to a warm up, allowing him to get his juices and chakra flowing rapidly. This was in order to jump right into performing jutsu so that he could perform them at his peak ability, even if they were low-leveled jutsu and he had no mastery with them. While Ikarus performed a miniature meditation to get his juices bursting, he tried to think of a jutus that he would work on. <I assume I can start working on my water techniques. Technically, they -do- need work.>

He'd open his eyes, looking up into the sky as he poised his index and thumb over his chin, thinking of something. <Alright, I guess I can do that. I need to focus more on the power and potential of my techniques.> The ninja raised his hands, stringing together his fingers to form a small number of hand seals. He'd stir up his chakra once more, projecting it right in front of him so that it would end up being an invisible figure made of chakra. Upon executing the final hand seal, Ikarus exerted force upon his chakra, and it would suddenly manifest, the chakra culminating into an exact replica of himself--a clone.

Ikarus would point at the clone, "Over there." After pointing at it, he'd point to a spot several feet in front of him, commanding the clone to move over to where he directed it. "Perfect," he nodded. He set his eyes on the clone, taking a slight breath as he began to string together yet another set of small hand seals. For an elementalist, Ikarus had seemed to perform his hand seals rather slow, since he never really took up the time to pracitce his hand seal proficiency skills. While performing the seals, a stream of chakra accumulated in his chest, clumping up into a thick ball. It took on a more liquid nature, bellowing up his throat and into the back of his mouth.

By the end of performing the string of hand seals, the ball of liquid-esque chakra had been firm in his mouth, ready to release whenever he commanded it to. He executed the final seal, and the liquid ball of chakra took on the nature of water. It transitioned from a light blue, nearly transparent essence into a thin clear liquid that when collapsed on each other, appeared blue in nature--which was all due to the nature of water. The water was forced from his mouth, and was sent streaming towards the clone at a slow, yet steady pace. The clone stood still, taking the brunt of the damage nonchalantly. Nevertheless, the clone still survived, damage able to be spared on the replica before it dissipated.

Ikarus took this time to prepare the same jutsu, hoping to get more of an effect. Most likely, however, he was probably not going to get the desired effect. Sighing, he'd yet perform another set of hand seals. It was the exact same set of seals, however, the boy ran through the signs a little bit more faster. It demonstrated that he was becoming more proficient with his hand seals, as well as more familiar with the technique he never really bothered practicing. The chakra would once more well up in his system, the stream of constant chakra beginning to liquefy and condense.

Then Ikarus performed the final and seal. Chakra came rushing up and out of his throat, spewing rather quickly at the clone. It was a very weak stream of water, although it was obvious that it would be enough to dispose of the clone. The water splashed harshly against the clone, sending it crashing back onto the pavement with a harsh force. Upon collision with the clone, it would break into several rocks and pebbles before dissipating. Ikarus panted a little, due ot his little experience with the technique. However, he did end up breathing normally again, finishing his little training session. He pickd up his mallet from the ground, realigning it on his back as he rejoined the crowd in the square.* - Fri Sep 18 21:54:20 2015
