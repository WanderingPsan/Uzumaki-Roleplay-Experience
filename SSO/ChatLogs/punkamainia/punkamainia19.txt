<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Where's Edge? - Sun Sep 27 07:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) had arched his brow, there had gone the teeth-gritting and what looked like held in rage. Ikarus picked up on it each and every time Suitengu had done. What was worse was that it happened whenever he laid sights on the hammer-donning shinobi. Once he had seen this happen, his suspiscions and defenses had been raised once more. With the sudden attack, Ikarus would be almost be caught off-guard. Thanks to the sensing granted by the Rinnegan, however, he was able to notice the flare in chakra prior to the use of the technice, along with the quick weaving of hand seals. Those two combined allowed the boy to dodge before the jutsu was able to even come close to him. He kicked off the ground, running sideways, but also heading toward him full-on.

<That was close. Didn't think the eyesight would help in that.> While he took the time to dodge and react, he withdrew his hammer with quick speed, attempting to deliver a hard swing that would deliver some hard damage to Suitengu, hopefully sending him flying off to the side, and breaking the shadow jutsu. "There's no need for this. Even if you aren't a good person, you don't have to try and attack or kill people for that. I'm not your enemy. I haven't done anything to you."* - Sun Sep 27 07:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) || He hadn't even noticed it, but one of the branches of the shadows as successfully lunged itself into the midsection of his thigh, retreating back quickly into its own shadow. Blood began to pour out from his wound, staining his blue pants to form some mix that would take on a darker shade of purple. <Shit. He hit me. Why now, why here, of all times and of all places!? Pacifism has never really worked out in my favor, has it? Look where it's gotten me--nowhere. Sunagakure tried to stay passive and peaceful, and it's in a terriible spot.> He lamented.

Before he could land a successful attack, he was stopped by the shadows. He would become overwhelmed by a higher force, one that would render him useless, but in the hands of the son of one of the most powerful people that had Ikarus had ever encountered. As Suitengu would swing his hand, Ikarus would seemingly mimic, his mallet being tossed off to the side. He couldn't help but to struggle and attempt to break the grasp of Suitengu and his shadow. However, it would seemingly not work enough.

"Look, I know you're going to kill me. But wait, why? I haven't done anything, and I'm not trying to do anything to kill you. Think about what will happen when others find out that I'm missing. Edge will know, members of Kirigakure will know, it won't help. Whatever revenge you're exacting on me, I know it's not meant for me, save it for someone else, please." Ikarus was actually begging for his life. He wasn't expecting it to end so soon, he wanted--he needed more time.* - Sun Sep 27 08:32:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) decided to step off the grass and back onto the pavement. Ryomen would make his way past the others, heading into the mansion.* - Sun Sep 27 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) stared on. His gaze had been set on the trees that lined the forest-esque area in front of him. He would sigh. As he imagined the forest, flashbacks of his past riddled him. He remembered the days where he would fight in the minor, micro-scale wars that was never needed in the first place. He lost some comrades and teammates during those days, but those were the old days. He had grown a lot since then. He sighed, sitting down amidst the trees. He would sit in a crossed leg position, closing his eyes as he began to meditate for some time. He was hoping to warm himself up via meditation before he officially started to train towards his goal.* - Mon Sep 28 01:22:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) "Alright, I know I can do this. All I really need to do is try to combine my elemental chakras, and then I'll be set. Though I don't think this will take a long time." Ryomen got ut of his cross-legged pose, placing his hands on the grass as he pushed himself to stand on the luscious forest floor. Eyes shut close, he honed out of his surroundings, attempting to retreat into an "inner" version of himself. Once he did this, he'd start. He imagined his pool of chakra once more, along with the chakra flowing steadily through his tenketsu points. Some of the chakra would be withdrawn from his reserves, being pooled out and gathered in near his chest area. The boy was able to easily feel the chakra gathering and accumulating.* - Mon Sep 28 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) Before long, the chakra that had accumulated would cease to gather. Ryomen had felt as if he had gathered enough chakra in chest, enough to attempt to combine his two elemental natures into one. His eyes still closed, he would attempt to muster up what control he had to divide the miniature clump of chakra in two. It would take some seconds, but he managed to get it done. He honed in on one part of the chakra, attempting to manipulate and reform the chakra so that it fit what he moulded. With success, the chakra was manipulated over a timespan of several seconds. The blue essence would, in turn, become a mix of orange, red, and yellow hues that would resemble the color of fire. The chakra heated up, and while it was burning bright and hot in his body, it would be drowned out by the darkness. The heat, along with the burns that should have come with it, didn't even affect him at all. All he felt was the chakra moulding under his command.* - Mon Sep 28 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) After achieving his goal with one portion of the chakra, the shinobi moved onto the next portion. He began to hone in on the remaining essence as to do to it what he did to the first half. At this point in the process, he was completely attuned to with his physical and spiritual energies. He was barely able to hear anything outside of his focus. He couldn't hear the birds that were chirping in some trees a few yards from him; the fox that just sneaked past him for some food; nor did he even recognize the slight wind that had blew on him, and past him. His focus and goal was to achieve isolating and combining his katon and fuuton elemental natures to form something he wouldn't expect.* - Mon Sep 28 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) Back to the topic at hand--the second half of the chakra. It began to form and reshape itself under Ryomen's manipulation. The light blue essence would fade into something different. It took on the properties of wind---the light blue became a rather transparent, nearly invisible hue. Since it took on these properties, the nearly-solid mass would become a mass of wind, circulating around an invisible nucleus. It resembled wind if it were to be fired in gusts, while at the same time resembling nearly invisible blades of wind. Like the fire, he wasn't able to feel the wind causing pressure and damage in his body--since it wasn't. His body had grown accustomed to the feel, and as such never really felt anything as a side-effect of forming these things. He only felt the mass of wind in his body, the fire floating across from it, all together in one little pool gathered in his chest.* - Mon Sep 28 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) Once he had finished his manipulation of both halves of chakra, it was finally time for him to attempt to bring the once-same-halves-turned-different together again in hopes of creating something new. With a steady control and pace, the boy would move the two masses of chakra towards each other. Naturally, it should have been easy to perform, since the fire-natured essence should easily amplify itself tenfold by absobing the wind-natured essence. However, this didn't work out as how he would have expected it to. The masses combined, albeit harshly. While it was easy for him to master his elements, he didn't have much experience is his mastery of control.* - Mon Sep 28 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) As a result, when the two elements combined, they crashed into each other harshly, creating a force that would cause the fire-natured chakra to absorb the wind-natured chakra, making it deadly and lethal. This huge mass of chakra was uncontrollable, causing it to implode on itself. Ryomen never took into account that the two halves of the chakra should be in equality, and that they should harmonize with each other in order for it work properly and effectively. Upon imploding upon itself, the amplified fire-natured chakra would disperse and scatter, reverting back to the normal plain blue state of chakra that would deposit itself back into his reserves.* - Mon Sep 28 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) However, as a side effect, Ryomen did feel both of the effects and the after-effects. He felt the uneven chakra colliding with each other; the sudden absorption of the wind-natured mass into the fire-natured chakra; the growing and enlargement of the single mass; and then finally the implosion of itself, followed by the dispersal. In tandem, it would actually cause some harm to Ryomen. He was doing something he had never done before, without aid nor practice. He was bound to feel the effects of the failure. While it didn't cause much damage, he did flinch in reaction, grunting, "Rgh!" The pain was akin to being slighty burned, however from the inside. * - Mon Sep 28 02:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) Luckily, it wouldn't harm him much or impede his systems in any way shape or form, except maybe disturb and alter his chakra flow temporarily. After all this finally happened, his chakra system would be rendered inable to perform or do something like this until a certain time had passed. He was able to tell when he tried to withdraw some chakra once more, but failed. Ryomen seemed fine with this, however, since he had done enough in one sitting. He figured that he'd give his body and chakra system some time to rest, recuperate, and recover. Once it would happen, then nhe'd return to trying to create a fusion of elements. He returned back to his surroundings, walking away from the area and back towards the mansion.* - Mon Sep 28 02:15:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) In the midst of the secluded forest, in the midst of this dusty match, was the landmark: a giant tree with leaves as vivid green, or a bit greener, as the grass that lined the forest floor surrounding the patch. The tree was never really given a name, but Ryomen had always chosen to call the tree "Kodokushi." In Japanese folklore/events, this related to the phenomenon when someone, usually an elder, would die and their body would go long undiscovered. In his mind, this very much applied to the tree since it was something that was yet to be really "discovered." In the case that the tree went on like this, the tree would eventually die alone, and it would go lonog undiscovered.* - Tue Sep 29 02:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) Ryomen appreciated this tree to a great length, and thus, he always used the tree as a focal point too getting in touch with his spiritual energy. There was a unique quality about the tree that allowed him to focus better. He didn't know what it was, but it was something that he went along with, since it just  "worked." Approachng the tree, the shinobi lightly ran his fingers over the bark of the tree, getting another feel for it. He felt as if he wanted to harmonize with it, sympathize with it, and empathize with it. He felt some connection, one that was unexplainable, but existed. He attempted to "connect" with it, only to end up sighing in slight disgust that he wasn't able to emotionally harmonize with it.* - Tue Sep 29 02:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) This time, Ryomen had decided to change up the scenery. When he began his training this time, he surrounded himself on a large patch of a dust-dirt-sand mix. The area that he was actually training in was one of Konoha's lesser known landmarks. It was never really given a formal name, however the boy had seemed to resonate with this area. Surrounding this large area of sand and other minerals was nothing but all luscious green grass and verdant trees--their leaves sparked with verdant green, amber yellow-orangish, as well as scarlet red. The trees had this quality to them, they varied in color in Konohagakure, no matter what time of the year.* - Tue Sep 29 02:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) Nevertheless, Ryomen had wasted a little too much time than he would have expected. He performed the same action everytime he meditated or trained in the area, and each time it would never work. The Konohagakure shinobi lowered himself to the sand, gently thudding with the floor as to not cause up a stir of dust. He lined his back against the base of the tree, correcting his slightly off spinal posture. One of the keys to meditation was actually have a straight back, as to allow the chakra to flow steadily and much easier. At the same time, it would ease his breathing, allowing him to slowly but gradually head into his meditation/training.* - Tue Sep 29 02:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) The boy shut his eyes closed. He took in deep breaths, holding for a few seconds before slowly exhaling. This action was performed several times, letting his body ease into the training, as well as calming his chakra as it flowed through his tenketsu point. After a certain period of time had passed, he had attuned his body to completely focusing on the object at hand: combining the two chakra natures of katon and fuuton. He ridded himself of other surrounding sounds: low sounds of people rushing through the nearby pathways, fast and busy business, as well as the local chatter. One of the problems with the area was that it was close to the streets, which could sometimes be a problem. However, Ryomen had gotten used to it.* - Tue Sep 29 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) He retreated into his "inner self," akin to what he had done a couple days prior. He took a deep breath, imagining his chakra system and his reservoirs. He'd think of withdrawinig chakra from his system, extracting it so that it accumulated within the confinements of his chest. One average-sized mass of chakra had accumulated, creating a thick clump of chakra that was ready to be manipulated to the boy's will. He would attempt what he had tried to do before: separating the mass of chakra evenly; isolating each half; turning one half into katon-natured chakra; turning the other half into fuuton-natured chakra; then finally combining the two so that they would harmonize and create something new.* - Tue Sep 29 02:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) This is exactly what he would do. With the exertion of minute force and control, the boy attempted to separate the one mass of chakra into two even halves. It would take some time, as he would have to do it perfectly, or else it would fail to work as properly planned. After several seconds of attempts and trials, the boy was able to separate the one mass of chakra, forming two equal halves of the same essence. <Perfect. Now all I have to do it isolate each one, and then transform them into their respective natures. Shouldn't be too hard. I should be able to do this.>* - Tue Sep 29 03:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) Honing in on one half of the essence, the boy exerted some pressure on it. As he did so, he thought of his katon-natured aspect taking over the mass of chakra. In theory, he thought it would work--in which it did. The essence would suddenly erupt into a burning ball orange, yellow, and red flames, fuming around each other. After being successful with that, the boy switched gears, focusing on the second half of the chakra. Upon doing so, he imagined the chakra mutating into a form of fuuton, going from the typical hue of light blue towards the clear and nearly transparent chakra. Like the katon-natured chakra, he was successful.* - Tue Sep 29 03:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) The second half of the chakra became blades and gusts of wind funneling around each other, as if there were some central nucleus that bound the wind together by force. <Okay. That part was easy. Here comes the hard part: combining them.> At this point, Ryomen had completely devoted his whole attention and focus into doing this. He wasn't sure if this was going to work, but he planned on it. <All I really need to do it take the two natures, combine them, and make them harmonize with each other--not consume each other.> However, he learned that it was easier said than done. Combining two chakra natures was never that easy, especially when one chakra nature dominated over the other. It was going to be a difficult task, and Ryomen was wholy devoted to completing it.* - Tue Sep 29 03:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) With two separate chakra natures sitting in one pool, Ryomen attempted to slowly but gradually bring the masses together into one. He wasn't sure if it was going to work like it did the first time--in which it didn't. In theory, it worked. Though in reality, it didn't seem so. As the fire-natured chakra came close to the wind-natured chakra, he could feel them beginning to funnel into each other. It seemed as if they were beginning to harmonize with each other. The feeling felt wholesome and complete. It was like his attempts were paying off. The fire-natured chakra and wind-natured essence would blend together nearly perfectly, but with enough efficiency for it to pass. He was able to tell that it had worked because it was a new feeling he had felt.* - Tue Sep 29 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia)  || The fire had not absorbed the wind to become something amplified, and neither did the wind completely blow out the flames to extinguish it. They had combined and created a new element. However, Ryomen's training wasn't even over yet. While he was able to form and create the new kekkei genkai, he had to be able to utilize it so that the chakra could effectively and efficiently be created within his body and used successfully outside of it. The scorching chakra had been burning very hot inside of his body. He felt the lit mass, basically because it was a new feeling in his body. It became too much for him, and as a response, he forced himself to upchuck the scorching chakra.* - Wed Sep 30 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) From the pool of chakra that had clumped within his chest, the scorching mass of energy had been sent funneling up his throat with intense heat and pressure. Once the chakra reached the back of his throat, he opened his mouth, making way for the scorching fire to eject itself before he really harmed himself. Within moments, the a small-sized fire had been released vigorously. Very bright flames released in violence, consisting of a mix of hues of several colors: red, orange, yellow, and even some white. It looked akin to Fire Release: Great Fireball Jutsu when the jutsu is used in the manner of a flamethrower. However, what Ryomen had done was on a much, inexperienced scale.* - Wed Sep 30 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) After performing such an act like he did, he slumped over a little, letting himself catch his breath as he tried to recover. If one happened to be watching from a different point of view, it appeared as if Ryomen had been the human incarnation of a dragon--as if he was literally exhuming flames from his mouth. While this happened to be true, that the flames were ejcted in a violent manner, the amount of pain that been caused in the process was an unnecessary one. He panted, trying to recover after having gone through that unpleasant experience. The teenage shinobi only felt as if he had been dealt a hefty amount of damage to the insides of his throat and mouth. The two areas had been particularly dried, as if he was completely lacking water.* - Wed Sep 30 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) It was ironic, especially seing as how he had gone chugged through a couple bottles of water before going off to train. Chugging water usually aided in calming his thougts and nerves. He scrambled around his pockets, looking for his emergency watter bottle before he began scratching at his throat because of how dry it became. Upon finding it, he twisted open the cap, and chugged down all the water, holding it in  his mouth for a few seconds before gulping several times to let the water down his throat. All he needed was something to get him salivating again. He didn't think that it would be potent enough to evaporate all the water and saliva in his throat and mouth. <Nevver again am I gonna try it like that. I need a different way. I need a new way of doing this so that it doesn't hurt me in the long run."* - Wed Sep 30 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) Just as immediately as he had said this, he had thought this, he came up with a new idea. Here, the boy decided that channeling the chakra through his palms would possib ly be much easier and safe, considering that he thought he'd rather save himself from a saliva-less throat. After several minutes of just sitting at landmark tree, Ryomen would straighten his body posture once more. He had seemed to align himself in the same manner that he was in before he was disturbed by the scorching flames. Within seconds of correcting his posture, the shinobi lifted his hands so that it hovered slightly above his legs in front of him. His arm went so high as to show that his hands would reach upper-chest level of his body.* - Wed Sep 30 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia)  || A brief pause in his training had taken precedence, but Ryomen was finally finished with his uncalled for hiatus. He was finally to return to strempting to combine his two elements of katon and fuuton into one element: Scorch, or Shakuton Release. Last time he remembered, he was able to get the two of his chakra natures to combine and fuse harmoniously to create the kekkei genkai in bis chakra system. However, the young boy had to work on getting the advanced essence out externally, via his hands, or mouth or whatnot. It wasn't particularly hard, but it wasn't on the easy side of the scale either. It would take slme hard work and dedication, but be believed he could do it if he focused and concentrated enough.

Ryomen had returned to the unknown landmark of one of Konoha's largest, bountiful, and beautiful trees. Like before, the shinibi sat at the base of the trunk, sitting cross-legged as he started his meditation. He closed his eyes, inhaling deep breaths, holding it, then exhaling the breath. Performing this multiple times, Ryomen slowly put himself in the zone of training and meditation. He imagined his chakra system, as well as the pool of chakra where it all originated. Multiple times, he would attempt to slow and hasten his chakra, so that he could demonstrate his extensive control if need be. As a response to his manipulations, the chakra would flow accordingly: speeding and hastening up through the relevant tenketsu points.

As per the first couple attempts as combining his two opposing chakra natures, Ryomen would  start off with this training. He withdrew a fair portion of chakra from his reservoir, allowing it to pool in his chest. After garnering a good amount of the essence, he would continue on to the next step of the training: separating one mass of chakra into two even halves. If it was hard the first time, and less difficult the second time, Ryomen expected it to be much easier this time around. With a slow pace and much needed effort, the shinobi imagined the one whole essence splitting right down the middle, dividing into two separate and even halves. 

He moved onto the next part of combining the elemental natures: forcing the two separate halves to take on their own different natures of katon and fuuton. As stated before, Ryomen knew this was a difficult task, especially since he was lacking in proper chakra control--even for someone who had been practicimts to make the kekkei genkai. Control was the type of thing that he would pick up, learn, and master as he attempted these acts. The young shinobi kept his calm and cool throughut this entire process. While he did feel a slight toll on his body and mind, it was much less than when he first started attempting this. He had already came a very long way, and there was no stopping him now. 

He was only a little more ways to go before finishing--and he knew it. He honed in one half of the chakra, putting most of his focus there in the moment. With some thought and manipulation, Ryomen was able to turn the lifeless essence into one that immediately erupted into flames. The chakra boiled hot on his body, but he only barely felt it; his body had been accustomed to this through years of training. After that portion was successful, Ryomen turned most of his attention to the second remaining half of chakra. Like the katon-natured chakra, all he had to do was manipulate the chakra so that his secondary element of fuuton took precedence over his primary of katon.

With a proper attention and focus, the chakra transitioned from a state of the blue essence to a controlled fit of wind being confined to a sphere. <Alright, all I really need to do is focus and bring the two elements together to form scorch. It shouldn't be hard. You can do this, just focus and believe.> With enough motivation and willpower, Ryomen had started the hardest part of the training--at least it was hard to him. The two opposing chakra natures slowly made their way towards each other, with Ryomen's care for balance of course. He had to be delicate in the sense that the two natures would harmonize in synchrony with each other, rather than the katon nature consuming the wind nature, or the wind nature completely extinguishing the fire.

This period of time had seemed especially slow for Ryomen, mainly due to the fact that this part in the training had been a slow part. Performing it too hastily would most likely result in unfortunate and unlikely results, which was the opposite of what he wanted, especially when he was so close to achieving nis goal. Several seconds became a few minutes, and with tender, love, and care, Ryomen nad successfully combined the two elemental natures to create Shakuton. <Alright, Ryo, you can do this. Don't lose focus. Now all you need to do is apply it externally, and then it will have worked.>  The shinobi's training wasn't done--it was never finished. Just because he was able to form a pool of shakuton-natured chakra didn't mean that he was ready to use it in battle, much less use it at all. There was more to do.

His focus and concentration still on the essence of the shakuton-natured chakra, he began to manipulate the pool so that he could form different shapes of different sizes, lengths, etc. While he could not achieve this task efficiently and properly, he was still able to manipulate the chakra to a certain extent. He took in a deep breath, letting his body acclimate to the foreign feel of this new chakra that had been formed and took place within his body. He spread the chakra thin, allowing it to flow over back into his chakra system and around his body. With each second of enduring pain, he would feel slight tingling and stinging sensations, the shakuton chakra boiling in his body, which became more and more durable to it as time passed on. 

This was the same technique that Ryomen did to gain a firm mastery over his fire-natured element and techniques. It was the same methods that his now-deaceased parents had used to master their kekkek genkai, as well as their basic chakra natures. After moving the glob of chakra around his whole chakra system a few times, he eventually gained a good amount of understanding on how to manipulate it effieciently. With care and consideration however, he guided the chakra up through through his chest, and through the tenketsu points that led into his arm. The essence steadily flowed onto his hands, where he let it sit for several moments.

With a sudden burst of confidence, Ryomen attempted to let the chakra seep through his system and through his pores. Opening his eyes, the boy would let it materialize, manifesting in something he had never seen before: a chakra that visibly took on a motley of colors such as red, orange, yellow, and white. It was the colors of a beautiful sunset--something that brought the day to the close. This is what Ryomen exactly thought of, this was his tool to exact revenge on his parents' deaths. As he thought of this, he stood up, the sunset chakra radiating a heat never before felt. It was much hotter than your typical strong katon technique, perhaps enough to deal a great amount of damage.

Ryomen's enemies had to watch out, he was coming for them. He turned around, sending his flaming fists into the landmark tree behind him. His hand would burn right through some of the wood before the chakra dissipated. Surrounding the burn/damage to the tree was a portion of the trunk that had suddenly thinned, becoming much harder and stiff than the other parts of the trunk. Little did Ryomwn know the true potential of Shakuton: the element that can evaporate water.* - Sat Oct  3 00:18:46 2015

He skidded to a halt, getting ready to evacuate from the village when he encountered a a gigantic beast, spanning multiple stories. "What in the..." While Ryomen would attempt to do something, he couldn't. He would not be able to take on the best all on his own. He stood under the arching gate of the village, gawking at something he had never seen before. Without notice, he looked forward to the tsunami of sand approaching hom with ferocity. He looked left and right, the tsunami spanning the length of the whole village, towering high over it. He couldn't do anything but stand there, or try to counter it. The boy performed a plethora of seals, attempting to mitigate the damage dealt to him from the wave.

After gathering enough chakra, the boy released it all around him in an explosion of wind. He let the wind breeze all around him, letting particles of sand of the tsunami spread to make the power less intensive. Of course it wouldn't be much, but he wanted to survive. Then the Tsunami hit. It crashed into the wind around him, the sand particles shifting over, but still being powerful enough. It crashed into him, overwhelming him. He was pushed to the ground, the wave passing over him. Once it was over him, he screamed in agony, all the pain and pressure making him yelp. Luckily, be did survive. Maybe it was luck, or maybe it was the skill of his jutsu to successfully mitigate the intensity. He looked up, barely able to do so, watching the monster rage on. He panted heavily, holding onto life barely.* - Sun Oct  4 00:21:45 2015

Rolling up his pants legs was a struggle as well, revealing more injuries as well. It was a miracle he even survived; he should be dead. "I was overwhelmed by a sand tsunami during the attack. It was much taller than the village itself. I don't know how I survived."* - Sun Oct  4 04:07:53 2015

The aching and hurting began to recede, leaving Ryomen more able and fit to respond and react. He coughed a little more, though it was a dry cough.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) would stand up, the bandages wrapped around his body. He faced away from Edge, moving to pick up his clothes and put them on. He held his sheathed tanto firmly within his grasp, before slipping it on as well. He turned around, facing Pandora with curious eyes. Taking in her appearance, he turned to face Edge, smiling and holding out his hand. "I guess I'm a part of the group now."* - Sun Oct  4 04:32:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) looked at Pandora, her sand-esque skin blocking much of her appearance. However, he did notice the Konoha insignia on the headband she put away. "So we're doing that, huh?" He looked down on the Konoha headband he possessed, stripping it from his being. He looked at the symbol, sighing as he thought of his now-dead relatives. His parents had been long gone before its obliteration, but now his whole family was gone. He felt terrible, but he wanted to exact revenge. How could someone like him get revenge on a monster like that though? With haste, he wrapped the cloth part of the headband around the metallic part, covering the sign, before slipping it into his empty backpocket.* - Sun Oct  4 05:15:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) had finally left the hospital after being treated and bandaged. He scoped around the village a little, deciding to find a training area. Upon finally encountering one, he stood on the sandand dirt. He imagined at the large sand monster that he had encountered a few days prior. However, in his imagination, he thought the monster to be much smaller and weaker in comparison to the real one. He kept his eyes focusd on it, his blood boiling at the sight of it. He had to react, his chakra system flaring up. He squinted his eyes, grit his teeth, and cracked his knuckles as if he were getting ready to kill it easily and effortlessly. Taking in a deep breath, he began.

His raised his hands, withdrawing a portion of his chakra from his reserves. Once his hands had been around chest-level, he performed a small set of hand seals, signifying one of the same set of seals for a versatile fuuton technique. The chakra slowly leaked out into the environment, accumulating around his body until it had reached its pinnacle. Moments later, the boy finished the small set of seals before executing the jutsu to the best of his ability. The chakra surrounding him had been directed at the imaginary bijuu, manifesting into several powerful gusts of wind that would blow at the monster.

"Take that creep! he exclaimed, hoping the bijuu would feel the intensity and effects. In his mind, the monster woukd have been swaying left and right, being controlled by the powerful gusts. Even then, it would stumble, and allowed itself to be blown back yards. Finally, Ryomen moved onto the next phase of attacks.* - Sun Oct  4 08:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) dashed further closer towards the distracted monster. The wind still raged on, blowing uncontrollably. Before it ceases, the shinobi threw his hands up once more, beginning a second set of hand seals sure to nearly finish bis adversary. While he performed these actions, he took in a deep breath, inhaling as much air as his lungs could support. On the side, he drew some more chakra from his reservoirs, letting it pool and mix with the chakra located near his chest. As it mixed, Ryomen let the chakra naturally take its course, infusing it with its potential to spontaneously erupt and burst into flames. After executing the final hand seal, he let the garnered chakra flow out of his chest area and up his throat. It settled at the back of his mouth.

He felt the winds beginning to cease, which was when he knew that he needed to act quickly. Opening his mouth, the chakra was immediately ejected, coming in contact with the mixed air in the environment. In response, the infused chakra suddenly lit up, becoming a mix of red, yellow, and orange flames that formed a large sphere. The accumulated flames raged on forward, consuming Ryomen's gusts of wind to augment its lethality and intensity. The sphere of hot flames grew both hotter and bigger, which meant that it moved at a slower pace. The temperature began to rise several degrees, plumes of smoke trailing in the fireball's wake. The dust and sand were scorched, and so was the monster--once it was hit.

The fireball completely consumed and overwhelmed the one-tailed creature, burning it to crisps. It didn't seem to five up. Once the fireball had passed and exinguished, this monster progressed towards Ryomen, black scorch marks surrounding its sandy body. "How can it still move?" he asked himself, ready to launch a other attack. He reached back to grab the hilt of his blade, withdrawing it quickly for the metal-on-metal crashing sound to be heard. In one motion, Ryomen zoomed forward, his slow, but above-average speed prevailing. His protruded his tanto outwards from his body, moving right past the beast for the tanto to dig in and slice whatever it would slce--which was its sandy arm.

The arm fell to the ground, and instead of blood, bone, and flesh ripping iff, sand did. He turned around, arching his brow, as he continued. He skid on his heels, turning to speed right behind the monster. Once he got close enough, be jammed the tanto right through the back of its skull, rendering its movement ceased, as well as its life. The whole thing turned to sand, particles dropping to the floor as a lifeless body would. That's when Ryomen had snapped back into reality, the pile of sand ceasing to exist. He looked around, and the spot where the fireball would have extingushed had been a small pile of ash, with a bits and pieces of scorched potato sacks located here and there. Perhaps it hit a training dummy he didn't even know existed.* - Sun Oct  4 09:22:46 2015
