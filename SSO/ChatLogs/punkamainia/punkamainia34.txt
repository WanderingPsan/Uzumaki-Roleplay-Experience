<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) would nod, smiling as he began to lead the Kazekage towards a designated spot.* - Wed Nov 25 18:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: Alright, ready? - Wed Nov 25 18:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) smirked, his eyes transitioning from the dignified Kazekage to an imaginary target standing right in front of him. The only time the boy ever used the technique was during private training, when he was mastering the technique. Otherwise, no had ever seen it being used--at least by him. "It's my signature technique as of right now. Something I came across when leaening about my family's kekkei genkai and clan techniques. I've seen my father use it once, and that was it. I tried to replicate it to the best of my ability, though I think I may have surpassed my father in skill and mastery though."

Ryomen inhaled a deep breath, spreading his hands out wide to both of his sides. Chakra began flowed through his body at an accelerated pace, gathering at the center of both of his palms before completely surrounding them. It laced through his fingers, the light blue essence changing shape rapidly and transitioning between colors. The chakra in his left hand slowly faded out, becoming rather clear in color. It was clear that this chakra here took on the nature of fuuton. On the other hand--his right--, the blue hues darkened into a passionate display between red, orange, and yellow. The accumulated chakra took on the nature of katon, producing a heat of light intensity.

As these processes bappened simultaneously, Ryomen brought both of his hands together with a hard clasp. His hands and fingers moved around to weave five hand seals. The clear wind-natured chakra and the colorful fire-natured chakra were evenly balanced out as they mixed together during the formation of the seals. The chakras mixed, and so did the colors, to form flames that varied from a pinkish-red to sunset orange. By the formarion of the final seal, Ryomen had utilized the best of his control to make sure the chakra was evenly distributed throughout and ready to fire--which it was.

The boy suddenly shot his palms outwards, the chakra surrounding his hands leaving as a clump of scorching heat. It manisfested itself as a large bullet of scorching flames, the shape and size akin to that of the Fireball Technique, though a bit smaller and much more compact. The bullet shot forth with speed, moving at a very fast rate (13 tiles per turn). The intensity of the heat it produced was intense, definitely outmatching the highest temperatures in Sunagakure. It increased the degrees by several numbers, and if any poor creature were to get in the way of the scorching bullet--they would be completely obliterated and incnerated with no remains lefr behind.

The bullet crashed right into the hardened walls of Sunagakure, most likely burning through several layers and leaving scorching marks. After that, the flames would have dissipated, leaving behind a trail of sand that was completely dry and steaming, as the same with the portion of the wall that it crashed into. The water in the air would have evaporated as a result. Ryomen panted a little, taking out a canteen of water and deinking some of it. "Doesn't require much, but it can leave one parched," he said, turning towards the Kazekage, "You like that?"* - Wed Nov 25 18:42:33 2015

He'd take a deep breath, transitioning his view from Rymei to Aza, and back. "Aza, just play it smart. We could win this, together." He'd take a deep breath, exhaling as if he were relieving some sort of stress. He would then continue, lifting his finger to point towards Rymei, "I remember you. Rymei...right? You're the chick with sword skills beyond that of a samurai, and the raping skills of a Kumogakure ninja, eh?" He'd poke fun, having seen her from both perspectives before.* - Wed Nov 25 20:47:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) took notice of the apparent change in Rymei's eye color. The boy arched his brow, never having seen such an ocular jutsu such as that one. It was pretty interesting to say the least. He watched as the woman progressed forwards, forming a hand seal to cause a weird change to take place. The boy would look around, taking notice of the feathers that began to reign down on the field, accumulating in the sandy pathway. <This is odd. How can something...a Genjutsu. Good thing we did who lessons with Katsune on this. I just have to get far enough, whil Aza goes all in.> Ryomen would begin to inch backwards, starting to feel the sleepy effects of the genjutsu.

He felt more sleepy and more sleepy as he progressed backwards. At the last minute, he would begin to droop over, suddenly falling backwards, and hitting the pavement with a harsh thud. As he fell back, he would happen to stumble out of the jutsu's range. He sat up, watching as the field of feathers was suddenly gone. The boy rubbed his head, standing back up. "Ouch," he said spoke to himself. He looked on to see Rymei and Aza engaging in battle. He smirked, taking this as the perfect opportunity. Aza was a formidable distraction, and as his friend went all out--then Ryomen could as well.

He held his hands out in front of him, clear wind-natured chakra accumulating in his left hand and a fiery fire-natured chakra gathering in his eigbt. It pooled there for some time, before the boy went to action quickly. His hands came up together, the two chakra mixing together and evenly distributing as they accumulated further. Ryomen waved through five hand seals with haste, moving traversing the terrain with ease. He hoped the woman's view was blocked by Azal so then he could surprise her with his new technique. He crossed behnd Aza from afar, stretching his hands out so the chakra that gathered was quickly shot out.

Intense flames were produced, manisfesting into a large, compact ball of scorching flames. It was comparable to a mastered Fireball Technique, but this bullet was a little smaller, and as a result more compact. It moved at blinding speeds, and would do incinerating damage if any part of it touched Rymei.* - Wed Nov 25 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) || Could only watch as the interchanging of fists and swords ensued between Aza and Rymei. He crossed his fingers hoping that his steaming bullet would ram into their adversary, but it didn't. Instead, the scorching ball of flames missed, Aza was pierced through by Rymei's sword, and Aza was being dragged through the dust by the worthy opponent. However, Ryomen still thought he had the advantage with his maybe superior long-ranged jutsu. As the kenjutsu specialist 'edged' forward, Ryomen would dash backwards diagnonally, his hands weaving through several seals once more. Be conjured chakra in chest, letting it accumulate before summoning it forth.

Within moments, chakra exuded from his mouth, suddenly igniting into a ball of raging flames that fueled on towards Rymei. It had produced a hear of lesser intensity and potential than his last jutsu, but it was just as fast and merciless. With Rymei being near a close distance, he was hoping the jutsu would catch her off-guard and send some massive damage her way. Of course, he had to do it with Aza's arm still locked on her. Ryomen feared for his life, and it wouldn't make sense for both of them to die instead of one. Deep down, he still hoped Aza had a fighting chance. He had not noticed Marrisa yet, but hopefully she would help in due time.* - Wed Nov 25 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) || In the midst of him performing his hand seals, Rymei would have seemed to done something to him. His hands locked mid-formation, his eyes froze. A single twitch from his index finger caused it to move a bit, but then that was it. He was completely frozen. <What the hell is this?> His eyes were locked onto Rymei as she darted towards him. Aza was most likely down for the count, Edge seeming to suddenly appear from behind and pierce him with something. <Edge was here the whole time? Holy shit. Yeah, we're done for. Mom. Dad. I'm probably coming for you. Best get ready. Mayhem's a brewing.>

Rymei swiped her sword horizontally across the upper half of Ryomen's half, causing his head split open and guts spill out. He was dead for sure, unless something or someone were to intervene.* - Wed Nov 25 23:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) || Could only watch as Rymei approached hastily. His vision was fixed on the girl, who would become his death bringer. His brown hues gazed over the blade, watching as she would begin her slicing cut. He wanted to close his eyes, and not expect the slice, but he was frozen by the genjutsu. Then the horizontal slice pulled through. The edge of Rymei's blade, Acostumbrar, would seem to dig right into his skin with ease. This was akin to a hot knife running through butter, or a heated spoon through ice cream. Ryomen had some pretty durable skin, but compared to the metal on the sword and Rymei's strength--it made quick light work of him.

It went through skin, and sliced through bone. Blood immediately gushed out from his ears and the area surrounding it. His skull cracked open with ease, Rymei making one quick sweeping motion with the sharpened blade. Of course, it seemed as if nothing happened, but Ryomen suddenly went limp. His eyes were at once fiery with passion, but now they were empty and devoid. His pupils only reflected the light that entered: Rymei's blade  entering one side of his skull and passing through the other side. Blood splattered on the grainy sand, staining it red. Of course, the upper half of his skull would slide off once Rymei grabbed him.

In cnsequence, this revealed the brains and gore that lied with in. Without any force pushing against it, the part of his brain that was detached would slip off and plop on the ground, brain matter splattering along with the ground. Of course, some would end up getting on Rymei herself. Otherwise, the bottom half stayed in place, being attached to the spinal cord that ran vertically along his back. Good thing that was still in place, right? The physics of his body would react to anyway that Rymei moved him around, and the way Marrisa's wind technique sliced him--if she had in fact used it.

"Mom? Dad?" Ryomen saw his parents in some distance far away, seeming to walk along their own road. The whole battle, everyone from Marrisa, to Edge, to Rymei, to Aza--everyone and everything was gone. All that was there was the pavement, and his parents walking. Ryomen tried to catch up to them, but they seemed to get farther and farther. Suddenly, they stopped, and Ryomen's surroundings lit aflame, scorching heat rising from the ground next to the pavement, and everywhere behind him. His parents stopped, turning towards him, the flames in their eyes as he was brought towards them. Thus, they walked together--where all shinobi went: Hell.* - Thu Nov 26 00:22:11 2015

Of course, the upper half of his skull would slide off once Rymei grabbed him.

In cnsequence, this revealed the brains and gore that lied with in. Without any force pushing against it, the part of his brain that was detached would slip off and plop on the ground, brain matter splattering along with the ground. Of course, some would end up getting on Rymei herself. Otherwise, the bottom half stayed in place, being attached to the spinal cord that ran vertically along his back. Good thing that was still in place, right? The physics of his body would react to anyway that Rymei moved him around, and the way Marrisa's wind technique sliced him--if she had in fact used it.

"Mom? Dad?" Ryomen saw his parents in some distance far away, seeming to walk along their own road. The whole battle, everyone from Marrisa, to Edge, to Rymei, to Aza--everyone and everything was gone. All that was there was the pavement, and his parents walking. Ryomen tried to catch up to them, but they seemed to get farther and farther. Suddenly, they stopped, and Ryomen's surroundings lit aflame, scorching heat rising from the ground next to the pavement, and everywhere behind him. His parents stopped, turning towards him, the flames in their eyes as he was brought towards them. Thus, they walked together--where all shinobi went: Hell.* - Thu Nov 26 00:23:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Taku(Punkamainia) simply lied in his stroller. It seemed that Taku was at peace. He embraced the heat, he wasn't confused about existence, but rather just existing and living in the moment. The sounds of nearby crying was met by his ears, his head instinctively turning towards the source of the sound--his sister. The little boy yawned, the light sound escaping his mouth as he used his sister's excuse for her liquid as his own excuse to go to sleep. He didn't bother with her tears and crying, that was his perfect bed time. There was obviously something weong with this child, he didn't cry much, nor did he make much sounds nor want much. Most of the resources typically went to his sister anyway.

His eyes caught the glimpse of his father, and he smiled as a result. The offset of the crying cast him out of the sleep mood, and his the sight of his father made him rather ecstatic. He reached his arms out, his fingers extending and retracting. It was clear that he wanted to be lifted up. Yeah, he was a baby like that.* - Tue Dec  8 05:12:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Taku(Punkamainia) was lifted up by Sanoke, glee filling his eyes. He saw one of the only few faces he had ever seen in his short life, and that was all he needed. His lovely father was at the center of his world right now, and he was given that attention he so desperately wanted and needed. He watched Sanoke look up to the sky in contemplation, but Taku couldn't even guess to what his father was thinking, especially since the baby himself hadn't even developed self-conscious thought himself yet. His milky eyes stared right into Sanoke's where he could see the reflection of himself in his pupils.

Then, right as everything seemed all calm and cool, some drool came rolling right out of the baby's mouth, rolling straight off his tongue and slowly hanging and drooping from his lower lip. Within moments, it had accumulated enough that it had completely detached from the saliva in his mouth, a huge glob heading straight for Sanoke depending on the position where he was held at.* - Tue Dec  8 05:34:30 2015

Sanoke could turn all he want and try to put him close to his sister, but Taku couldn't understand the gibberish language Sanoke spoke. A yawn, once again, escape the baby's mouth, and before long, he would begin to drift to sleep in Sanoke's arms.* - Tue Dec  8 05:41:20 2015
