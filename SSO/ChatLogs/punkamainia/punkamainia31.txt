<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) watched Toudou maneuver the chakrams with expert proficiency. The boy hesistantly took a step forward, fearing Toudou's skill with the weapon. The young boy inhaled deeply, his one hesitant step turning into a sudden burst of speed. If it was possible, he would attempt to maneuver himself past Toudou and deliver an elbow aimed for his lower back.* - Tue Nov 17 00:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) || Toudou could actually keep up with him. Ryomen hadn't sparred much, and typically relied on his speed to dance around attacks and what not, never had he used it to initiate close combat. This was one of the times where he shouldn't have done that. His attack was easily intercepted by the chakram, and he could barely keep up with the follow-up attack his adversary delivered. The sudden attack would indeed slam right into Ryomen, but it seemed as if it was vain--as if his good friend was holding back. The mitigated kick would barely hurt him, though it did do some damage. Ryomen stumbled back, gritting his teeth.

"You have quite the skill with hand-to-hand combat. Are you holding back? It seems so. Don't hold back, I need to learn to fight properly" He'd jump right into forming a few seals, conjuring chakra. After easily going through the motions, that chakra would emit in the form of several bullets of wind, being ejected straight towards his opponent.* - Tue Nov 17 00:32:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I'm ah, gonna go find something to do then. - Tue Nov 17 00:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: He started out like that previously, I got next on winner. - Tue Nov 17 00:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) smirked, he got Toudou to use ninjutsu. The boy never knew who was better in the range of ninjutsu, but he felt as if he had a good grasp. Once the bullets were sent flying, Toudou's fireball was sent in response to the wind. Ryomen, luckily, did have a response to the fireball: a fireball of his own. Once Toudou had counteracted with his fire-styled technique, the boy knew his wind jutsu wouldn't make it. Before the fireball could make it halfway towards him, Ryomen used what speed he had to dash out of the way, his burst of speed coming in handy at the moment.

Of course, Ryomen wasn't able to wholly avoid the technique. His left leg was caught at the edge of the fireball, dealing some burns to his foot. He grunted in pain, but he was able to bare it for the meanwhile. While evading the technique, Ryomen had taken to performing a different set of hand seals, conjuring up chakra from his chest. Once the hand seals were performed, chakra spewed from the boy's mouth, taking on nature of a sphere of burning fire. It raged towards Toudou, Ryomen hoping he could deal some damage.* - Tue Nov 17 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) arched his brow. "Holy..." For a second, he could only gawk as Toudou moved with impressive speed, channeling chakra into his chakrams to produce the whirling flames that combatted the fire from his jutsu. While he was lucky that the fire jutsu could slow it down severely, he still had to get out the way. Ryomen darted out of the way once more, this times being able to avoid the flames that were lashing in his direction. Evading another one of his techniques, the boy brought up more chakra, blazing through the same set of seals once more.

Ryomen emitted the chakra once more, which ignited in flames upon being released into the atmosphere. The flames were moulded into yet another fireball, being sent forward towards his adversary with incredible speed. Could Toudou counter his technique once more?* - Tue Nov 17 01:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) || <Those chakrams. The first time he did that technique, he did it through his mouth. The second time, it was through those chakrams. How can I even disarm them from him? He's much more adept at close-ranged combat than me. I won't be able to...> Ryomen sighed, the fireballs clashing. He had nothing to do but avoid the stronger fireball once more. The adrenaline he felt from the battle began to wear out, and he felt the pain from the earlier kick, along with the burn. "Tch." He'd base most of the strength in his right leg, using it to boost around the fireball and straight towards Toudou. More chakra was summoned, and more hand seals were weaved.

Perhaps it may have been a bad idea to get closer, but Ryomen's goal was to catch the man off-guard with a surprise attack. The hand seals were different, meaning a different technique was coming into play. Once Ryomen had gotten close enough, chakra materialized around him in the form of spheres constructed of wind. They were sent towards Toudou with sudden speed. Once they were fired, he kicked off the ground, dashing back. He began to pant.* - Tue Nov 17 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) || The wind collided with the fire, which proved fatal for Ryomen. He didn't expect Toudou to perform a jutsu without hand seals, which was really what caught him off-guard. The boy knew he was outmatched in almost every aspect, so there was no point in him having to continue fighting like that. Otherwise, he would have wasted his stamina and chakra too easily. As the strengthened whirling flames fueled on, Ryomen could barely escape it. He dove out of it's path, everywhere below his shins being caught in the whirlwind of flames. He screamed in pain, his bullet dive turning into a roll across the sandy earth, putting out what fire that caught on his clothing.

His skin was burned, and he had taken some major damage to his legs. He panted, breathing heavily. He grunted in paid, trying to get up but being unable to. He would end up falling once more, landing on his flat on his ass. You could see his fair skin being majorly burned in some parts, and unscathed in others. He sat down, raising his hands in defeat. "You've won, Toudou. I can't keep up anymore."* - Tue Nov 17 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Yo - Tue Nov 17 01:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: Oh great. - Tue Nov 17 01:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) gulped. All that usage of fire jutsu made him seem rather parched. "I guess. I mean, there's definitely more where that came from, but I can't reveal my signature techniques yet," he smirked. His heavy breathing began to slow, as he dragged himself over to the wall, propping himself up against it. He'd grit his teeth, feeling the burning sensation, "So those chakrams, quite special they are."* - Tue Nov 17 01:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Signature techniques, huh? - Tue Nov 17 01:59:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I like your ...poncho. - Tue Nov 17 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: Yeah. Signature techniques. You'll have to wait to see 'em, I'd never use them in a spar. - Tue Nov 17 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: It's the mane of a lion! - Tue Nov 17 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: What's a signature technique. - Tue Nov 17 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: Kinda hard to explain' - Tue Nov 17 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Try? - Tue Nov 17 02:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: I guess, you can say it's that one technique that sets you apartmfrom others. - Tue Nov 17 02:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Oh. - Tue Nov 17 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Does your sword set on fire? - Tue Nov 17 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: No. - Tue Nov 17 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Does it set on ice? Hahaha, "set on ice". - Tue Nov 17 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: ... - Tue Nov 17 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: No...just, no. - Tue Nov 17 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: That would be cool. - Tue Nov 17 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: I wish I could do that. - Tue Nov 17 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: So were you guys fighting before. - Tue Nov 17 02:06:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: I have yet to even start using my sword. - Tue Nov 17 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Whaaat. It's probably got to do with your signature techniques. - Tue Nov 17 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: Nah. - Tue Nov 17 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: It's probably something to do with fire or something then. - Tue Nov 17 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Everyone uses fire here. - Tue Nov 17 02:10:59 2015
