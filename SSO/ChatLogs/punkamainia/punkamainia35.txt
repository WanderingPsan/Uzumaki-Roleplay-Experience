<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Taku(Punkamainia) turns over to look at the turtle, a smirk appearing on bis face. All silent, be'd simply nod, bending down to feel the turtle's shell. He'd the nod, and follw behind the animal to his father's location.* - Fri Dec 11 22:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Taku(Punkamainia) simply stood as he could only watch his two parents go at it. He lacked the skills he needed to keep up with them. His eyes, barely trained for matches like these, could only struggle. He suddenly stopped, looking to his father as he smiled and nodded. Taku had seemed to grow quiet as a child, and never really talked much. He had liked to kept to himself, but when he was with his family, that introvertiveness was gone. "Hey," was all he said, glee filling his face as watched them fight.* - Fri Dec 11 23:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Taku(Punkamainia) || Sanoke and Mirai had engaged in an intense battle in the desert. Taku had gotten used to the intense heat, especially since he was born into it. He could only sit in the sand and come up with imaginitive moves that both of his parents were using. Their attacks were too fast for his eyes to keep up with. By the time he could fully understand what happened, so much other things would have happened that he would have had to process. It wasn't that he just couldn't comprehend their moves--he was just too slow in reaction time for their pace.

He sighed, squinting his eyes in attempt of getting a better view. The boy could only try so hard. He had to exert a lot of force, essentially straining himself to just even get a better glance, or view, at his parents fighting. Unknowingly and subconsciously, Taku had sent a burst of chakra straight to his already milky white eyes. Right then, he felt an immediate change in his vision. He felt the chakra transforming eyes, additionally causing a change in his optical nerves as to allow him to better perceive sight and those around him. He felt his veins increase in their diameter, essentially exerting so much force that it bulged against his skin, revealing itself.

His milky white eyes took on an insignificant change in color, going from milky white to pure white. It seemed the vessels around his pupils would seem rather stressed as well, showing a little bit. Taku suddenly screamed,"Agh!" due to the initial burning sensation scaring him. His vision had completely changed. The world around him had changed. Sanoke and Mirai, looked rather different to him. He could see their chakra pathways, the blue essence flowing through their systems. He noticed the fluctuations in their chakra, especially in his mother's when she used the vacuum palm. He looked around in the desert, and could see animals and small critters in the near distance.

Taku was scared at first, but then he remember learning about his change in hid eyesight. It was his clan's ocular doujutsu known as Byakugan, and he had unlocked its mysterious powers. He looked at his parents, confused and wondering what to do.* - Fri Dec 11 23:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Taku(Punkamainia) looked at his mother with an unfamiliar gaze. He knew it was her, but he looked at her with different eyes...literally. He was getting used to what he was seeing, and he knew it would take a while for him to adjust. He stood up from the sand, struggling a little. He then looked at his mother, his white eyes staring back at her, "Mother?"* - Sat Dec 12 00:14:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Taku(Punkamainia) wasn't really sure how he should feel. It was a very new sensation, and it would take some getting used to. His eyes gazed over his father's figure, watching as the chakra circulated throughout his body. He then noticed the concentration of chakra in his eyes, representing the Rinnegan, which caused him to arch his brow. He then lolked over to his mother, watching her chakra system, along with the concentrarion of chakra emitted from the Byakugan. Taku took a deep breath, listening to all that Mirai had said, "Training? What type of training?"* - Sat Dec 12 01:00:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Activate your Byakugan. - Sat Dec 12 14:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Taku(Punkamainia) nodded in response to his mother. He locked eyes with her, his pearly whites taking in her image crystal clear. With an exertion of force, plus a burst of chakra towards his eyes, his clan's doujutsu would activate. Veins would protrude near his temple area, pressing hard against his skin. His milky eyes were converted into more of a lavendar color, revealing his Byakugan. There was a change in his vision, as a sort of x-ray view came into place. He could see objects all around, through the walls, and also see his mother's chakra flowing through her system. "Okay."* - Sat Dec 12 14:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Taku(Punkamainia) kept his eyes trained on his mother. He watched her every move, from the activation of her ocular doujutsu, to fluctuations in her chakra. He was taking in all the details that she taught him. "Palm strikes? Internal damage? Tenketsu? That all sounds awesome, but it sounds dangerous as well. I remember learning in one of daddy's books that internal damage isn't good." Taku would raise one of his hands, turning over to look right at his palms. He could see his chakra running through it, circulating all the way to his fingertips. He'd then place his palm back on the table, returning his gaze back to his mother to let her continue her lesson.* - Sat Dec 12 15:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Taku(Punkamainia) nodded. The boy took mental notes. <64 Tenketsu points should be the cutoff, only for leaving opponents stunned and possibly and knocked out. Anything over for lethal blows and killing.> At the mention of his sister, Taku, turned his head to look at her, watching her in her idle stae. It would be cool, that if she were present, she could be learning too. The thought of her as his sparring body made him rather intrigued, and wanting to train more. Taku then turned to look back at his mother, with her typical palm stance in place. He went up to stand by her, watching how she formed the stance, and taking in everything she posed.

He then moved off a bit further, positining himself so that he was still within a close proximity to his mother. Taku took a deep breath, beginning to position his small and fragile body in a unique way. First, he tried to mimic his mother's stance. He lowered his body a little closer to the ground, and stretched his palm out directly in front of him. He copied her exact movements and positioning to the best of his ability, trying to get the stance down. However, it wasn't as comfortable to him as it was Mirai.

Taku exhaled, changing the stance around further to better suit his needs. He lowered his body closer to the ground so that he had a firm footing and balance. Afterwards, he brought his arms a little closer to his body, bending it so that it could serve as a guard as well. His palm faced away from him andntoward his mother, perpendicular to the ground. His other arm would be brought back, perpendicular to the positining of his own body and parallel to the orientation of the ground. As a result, his palm would be flat, facing the ceiling. Experimenting a little bit would eventually cause him to find the perfect stance for him. A little tweaking here and there, and he was finally comfortable with what he had.* - Sat Dec 12 16:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Taku(Punkamainia) took note of her mother's striking, which followed the explanation of 100% accuracy when attacking the tenketsu points. Taku had to be fast, precise, and accurate with his strikes, or else they wouldn't have counteracted the use of the stance and fighting style. As Mirai started to thrust and strike the open air, Taku would follow in response. His palms would quickly jut out from their original spots, going one at a time. He looked at his mother's chakra flow, taking note of her tenketsu points. He'd imagine as if he were attempting to strike her points. <Be swoft and fluid, remember that Taku.> He had to encourage himself, or else his efforts would be futile. Children like him, especially, at his age, could lose focus easily.

Taku had to try and keep his attention span, for the sake of making himself and his family proud, as well as improving his fighting skills. He took his time with the palm strikes, moving at a slow and steady pace. Every once in a while, he would speed up the flow of his attack, and then slow down, then start all over again.* - Sat Dec 12 16:48:09 2015
