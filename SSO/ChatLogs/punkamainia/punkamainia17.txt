<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: No lethal attacks, worth killing someone. - Tue Sep 22 21:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I might burn you. - Tue Sep 22 21:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: You may begin. - Tue Sep 22 21:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: It's fine. - Tue Sep 22 21:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: And alright. - Tue Sep 22 21:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) cracked his knuckles, standing around as he waited for Kohaku to come with her attack, or move, or whatever. He'd get in a stance, and within a moment's notice--the girl was gone. <Shit.> Ikarus noticed the girl, but only barely. His reflexes, while being top-notch for someone at his skill rank, weren't able to constantly keep up with the fast punch that was delivered to his face. The boy stumbled back, taking the punch head on. He oriented his line of sight back on the woman. While the punch had worked, it hadn't been as effective as it should be. Over his career, he had built up a good amount of endurance to physical attacks. Nevertheless, it was still a good punch that both caught him off-guard, and still delivered some damage.

Ikarus was ready to bounce back. He raised his hands, performing a very small set of hand seals, thought at a normal rate. While doing this, he gathered chakra in his chest, letting it accumulate until he had gathered a good amount. After executing the final seal, the chakra began to flow up his throat form his chest, and into his mouth. This same stream of chakra would begin to take on a liquid form, becoming like water. The boy's mouth puffed up, before he let loose. A good amount of water was sent spewing on the grass around him, and in front of him, towards Kohaku. This would create some puddles around him.

He awaited her next move.* - Tue Sep 22 22:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) took notice to the girl performing a set of hand seals. <So she's been taught by Kenshin, and she has some long-ranged techniques. Hrm, effective.> As the girl performed her hand seals, Ikarus took it to himself to withdraw his hammer, dashing backwards at the same time as to gain space between the adversaries. Upon landing in his spot, the hammer had connected with the ground with enough force, causing a little crater to indent on the ground. Immediately dropping the hammer, the boy channeled chakra all over the skin and clothing of his body, performing a set of seals simultaneously. At this point, the fireball would have already been launched, making its way towards him with speed.

Luckily, he escaped--but only barely. Ikarus had been gone from the battlefield, invisible to plain sight. It would seem as if the fireball had gobbled him up into non-existance. If not, then the mask of the village's natural mist, on top of the steam caused by the water-fire clash would serve as an effective smokescreen--but only temporarily. There was no sign of Ikarus, nor his hammer, anywhere. There were still puddles of water on the grassy floor, however.* - Tue Sep 22 22:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) really had no plan from here on out. At this point in the spar, he had been attempting to wing it. This was one of his downfalls: while he was able to formulate plans, he wasn't the best at carrying them all the way through, especially when met with a stong opposition. <I don't want to waste too much chakra, I guess I the only way I can go is up.> He internally sighed, shaking his head to himself. He traveled underground, moving right before Kohaku stood. <Boy, I really gotta train more. I'm too weak for this.> With his hammer still in hand, he began to point it upwards. Without notice, he suddenly shot up, emerging from the ground with attempts of catching Kohaku off-guard. His plan was to deliver a strong uppercut with the hammer capable of sending the girl flying upwards.* - Tue Sep 22 22:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) began emerging from the ground. However, due to his jutsu's ability of allowing him to detect signatures and presences in the area due to magnetic field distortions, Ikarus was able to sense that Kohaku had side-stepped his attack. This immediately caused him to retract his hammer, placing it on his back as he awaited what fate had met him. As his head began to peak form the ground, he eyes caught sight of the fireball beginning to form. Ikarus had already built momentum coming out of the earth, and he couldn't have forced that momentum to reverse. One of the only ways to stop him from getting some serious damage was to counter. His counter was using the suiton jutsu he had previously used prior to emerging into the ground. 

The shinobi's body began to fully emerge, Ikarus performing the same set of hand seals, albeit a little faster. The chakra had gathered once more in his chest, fluidly gathering as it began to take on those liquid properties once more. Within moments, the fireball was closer, and Ikarus had eexecuted the final seal of the technique. TThe liquid chakra had transformed into pure water, gushing up and out of his mouth with a strong force. The boy had aimed the source of water right at the fireball in attempts to mitigate its size and damage that it would do once it hit Ikarus. The stream of water collided harshly with the fireball, doing as mentioned: mitigating its size. Thanks to its property of being superior to fire, it was able to decrease the size, but not by much. As a side effect, more steam had been produced.

The smaller fireball had collided into Ikarus, who had been dealt several minor burns, as well as parts and pieces of his clothing being burnt to bits and shreds. <She got me there. She's stronge than I thought. I underestimate people way too much. This is what I get.> Upon landing, he landed on one foot an one knee, bolstering himself up to stand firmly. He puffed a little, and the minor burns could be seen on his skin. They stung, but it seemed as if the water had really helped. The fireball dealt a good amount of damage, but not enough to render his body physcially incapable of still fighting on. "Nice one," he complimented towards Kohaku.* - Tue Sep 22 23:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) moved to resume position in front of the girl. He'd nod, confirming. He didn't want to give up until he was ready. He knew she had the upper advantage, but he was unrelinquishing. "Let's keep going."* - Tue Sep 22 23:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hi. - Tue Sep 22 23:17:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Heh, cute. - Tue Sep 22 23:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) had just decided to stick to his feet for now, wanting to avoid the fireball if possible. Ikarus was wanting to get this spar over with quickly as well but he was fine with dragging it on if need be. The boy was slow enough as it is. As the fireball came fuming through, Ikarus dashed towards his left side, raising his hands yet to perform another set of the same hand seals. He was able to dodge the fireball, but at the price of some winces and stings. The same routine was performed, and without a doubt, water was sent splashing once more, lining the grassy floor instead of being shot at his adversary. If people were to notice, there would be several puddles and lines of water already that surrounded the bttle field.* - Tue Sep 22 23:21:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) was getting ready to go all out at this point. Whether or not Kohaku and followed suit with another attack, Ikarus was pertinent in going forward with his next attack. Another set of hand seals were in place, right as Kohaku began her attack. He didn't go quite as fast, but he was able to charge enough chakra for the technique to work. At the same time, as soon as Kohaku had made it to the ninja, he would have been a single hand seal away from settling the technique. He looked up, watching as the fireballs were sent volleying towards him. As soon as they all collided upon him, a spark of electricity had emerged from his hands. 

Suddenly, all the puddles and streams of water around him would electrocute with lightning, including the stream around himself which he had used to form with the previous water technique. He had been bombarded with the fireballs, being dealt major damage and inflicted burns. He yelled in pain from all the burns and fire, falling to the ground in screaming agony. However, he was hoping that his water and lightning combo would work, dealign a good amount of damage to Kohaku. He'd simply lie on the ground, sparking electricity everywhere--which did begin to die down.* - Tue Sep 22 23:40:09 2015
