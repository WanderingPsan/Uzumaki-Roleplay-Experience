He was never really involved in it, since his pacifism led him to stay away from it. Sitting slightly upright, but stretching his legs out a bit, he'd place the hammer between his legs as he sat. "This war is getting out of control." He began  to think about some of those that had died, especially those close to him.* - Sat Sep 19 16:07:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Do they make up his abilities, or is he strong enough without them. - Sat Sep 19 18:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: He's strong enough without them. - Sat Sep 19 18:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Even more troublesome. - Sat Sep 19 18:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Though, if we take out the masks, we may even the playing field just for a bit. - Sat Sep 19 18:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: As for how he operates the masks and how they themselves operate, I have no idea. - Sat Sep 19 18:04:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: The summon is like this crane or bird thing. - Sat Sep 19 18:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: The masks Zetsumo uses to aid him in battle, Jin. - Sat Sep 19 18:05:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: These threads are used to control the masks? - Sat Sep 19 18:06:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Or are they meant to be kept secret? - Sat Sep 19 18:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Had he gotten caught in his genjutsu and his focus dispersed, would the masked be rendered useless? - Sat Sep 19 18:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: That's the theory Tethys came up with, Koeki. - Sat Sep 19 18:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: The contents were a variety of Tethys' techniques. - Sat Sep 19 18:09:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: When I remember seeing him, I don't recall any threads being used to control them. This is somehing different than puppetry, I believe. - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015
