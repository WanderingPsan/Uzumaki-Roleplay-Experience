<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. Lets go then - Sun Sep 20 09:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Probably get my ass whooped, but I haven't fought in a while, and we're in the middle of war, so I need all the training I can get. - Sun Sep 20 09:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Would you like the first move? - Sun Sep 20 09:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Alright then, I guess. - Sun Sep 20 09:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) cleared his throat. He locked eyes with Lera, bowing as he acknowledge their alliance throughout the spar. "So, what's your name?" He asked, beginning to take steps forward as he bursted with a slow speed he had. The hammer on his back had seemed to barely hinder his movement, seeming as if he went at a normal pace. He reached one of his hands backwards, bursting chakra into it. Within moments, his hand would connect with the base of the hammer, thrusting chakra into it. The chakra flowed up the handle and into the large metallic part, where a light blue essence would begin to coat it.* - Sun Sep 20 09:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) took notice to the use of the woman's hands, beginning to use the powerful wind technique that was sure to send him flying backwards several feet. Ikarus raised hands, having to remove them from this hammer, in order to form a cross over his face. The jutsu was unexpected, and as thus--caught him a bit off guard. He was blown back several feet, before standing up. It seemed that he was able to withstand the brunt off the damage. <She can use long-ranged attacks. That is't necessarily good for me, however.> He dusted himself off, before charging more chakra into the mallet. He charged forth once more, the hammer being fully charged, though still glowing that light blue aura. "No response? Alright then. You can call me Ikarus."* - Sun Sep 20 09:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) came to a sudden halt. Within a moment, there was only Lera. The next moment--there were four of her. <This like Fujitora's technique. Shadow Clones? But is it shadow clones? Only one way to find out, before I'm roasted.> He looked all around him, taking notice to the clones that stood in front of him, blocking his path to the real Lera. He took notice to the hand seals, knowing he had to get out quickly. While one of the clones were in the midst of hand seals, the boy sprinted to the one on his left side--Lera's right. In less than a moment, his hammer had been drawn, and an attempted smash had been in place. If he were successful, the hammer would come down upon the girl's head, a powerful force of chakra being release at the same time. A small crater would be left in its place form the built up chakra.* - Sun Sep 20 10:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) || His mallet made contact with one of the clones, completely obliterating it before it puffed into non-existance. The small crater was left behind, Ikarus standing in the middle of it. As of the moment, his complete focus was on the clones and getting rid of them, because then they would pose a problem. He turned his head to notice spheres of wind being shot at him. With some success, he was able to use his hammer in conjunction with his reflexes to dodge the vacuum spheres. However, he was attacked by some of them, dissipating upon making contact with his skin--ripping through pieces of his clothing in response.

He sighed, wincing in pain a little as he felt the damage sting harshly. "Nice technqique ya got there." Placing the hammer back on his back, he began to well up chakra in his system, letting it flow into a stream that became kind of like a liquid. Raising his hands, he began to form a few hand seals, going through them at a normal pace. Within moments, he'd execute the final hand seal. The chakra that welled up in his chest would begin to rise, heading up through his throat in a stream. It was forced form his mouth, and as the chakra would spat out, it became clear wate, taking on that blue hue due to water doing that when in thick quantities.

The weak stream of water would be spat towards the two clones, attempting to splash them water that would most likely not even do much to hurt them. However, the grass would be wetted, leaving splashes of water here and there. It seemed as if the boy did nothing, however.* - Sun Sep 20 10:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: My name is Lera, by the way. - Sun Sep 20 10:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) was getting ready to perform another set of hand seals, before Lera would raise her hand to stop the match. "Alright, if you say so. I was ready to keep going, though it did seem like you were winning." He'd walk closer to the girl, smiling, "Nice to meet you Lera. I'm Ikarus." <So this is the girl with the four elements? I've only seen Fuuton, so far. Waiting to see the others.>* - Sun Sep 20 10:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm still practicing with those Clones, using them takes more chakra than I'd like to admit. - Sun Sep 20 10:46:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Hmmm. - Sun Sep 20 15:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: We have a multitude of boats prepped for evacuation. - Sun Sep 20 15:32:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So you're thinking that we should flee in the end? - Sun Sep 20 15:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: We take what forces we have go to SUna put an end to this edge guy  use it resources to by time and then  when the moment is right we but an end to this big bad zetusmo guy who ever he is. - Sun Sep 20 15:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: That sounds like a bad plan. - Sun Sep 20 15:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: It's a terrible plan. - Sun Sep 20 15:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I'll explain why I believe the plan is bad. First off, we don't know of Edge's location, nor his forces strength or size.  Second, we are currently in war with Zetsumo's forces who is allied with Ame. They are positioned around the village, as far as I recall.  - Sun Sep 20 15:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Well, Edge is more powerful than you think, Flexus. - Sun Sep 20 15:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Doesnt this place have like an ecaoe tunnel or something? - Sun Sep 20 15:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: As of right now, we need a secret place to go to. - Sun Sep 20 15:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Suna is not that place. Our presence and activity there will alert Zetsumo, plus I think the adjustment from a place like Kirigakure to Sunagakure is the worst, especially with resources being sapped constantly. - Sun Sep 20 15:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: ...Is this where I laugh? - Sun Sep 20 15:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: The moment we send a large force out to locate and deal with Edge, they will spot and attack.  Then there's the problem of war fatalities. We are already pressed with our forces. We don't have enough strength to split between Zetsumo and Edge. - Sun Sep 20 15:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'm just curious. - Sun Sep 20 15:38:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Wasn't this the course of action -I- Reccomended, Several weeks ago? - Sun Sep 20 15:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I have no idea. - Sun Sep 20 15:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Well, if you did recommend this several weeks ago, I don't think Lord Tethy was dead then. - Sun Sep 20 15:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I just know that in our curent situation, it's best to deal with what's before us first.  Also, what advantage would we gain from dealing with Edge? - Sun Sep 20 15:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You gain no advantage, Honestly, Edge is better left alone. - Sun Sep 20 15:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Edge only wished to Unite Sunagakure. - Sun Sep 20 15:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: That rests our case. - Sun Sep 20 15:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: However, if we were to say contact Edge and have him join us, I'm sure that would give us an advantage in some form. - Sun Sep 20 15:41:26 2015
