<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Lets goooo. - Sun Nov  1 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) would head towards the training field with Trilliam.* - Sun Nov  1 23:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) would simply nod. All Ryomen really needed to do was perform one jutsu until he could reach his final mastery level. He had learned the jutdu earlier that day, and had began mastering it as soon as he could. He'd face Trilliam, his gaze set on the boy. Seals were performed rather quickly, thanks to the shinobi's training his hand seal speed. While the seals were being performed, chakra in his chest slowly built up, gathering and accumulating rather quickly. The execution of the final hand seal would initiate the technique, springing it into action. The chakra welled in his chest took on the features and characteristics of Katon.

The Katon-based chakra was sent billowing up his throat, a good amount being conjured. Ryomen took in a deep breath, beginning to exhale once he finished. As he exhaled, the stream of chakra spewed out, heading right in Trilliam's direction. As soon as the chakra came in contact with the gases in the environment, it lit aflame. Ryomen was literally spewing fire from his mouth. Facing the stream fire, it would look like a bullet, but it was in fact a stream. After learning it, Ryomen reseached more on the technique in one of the smaller libraries, where he learned it was a good combaination technique.

As he spewed fire, he thought of the combination technique. It worked in excellence with some Doton-based techniques, and naturally with Fuuton-based techniques. This, like many other Katon techniques, was versatile, and had many uses. Some of them happened to serve as offense, defense, and as well as in combination. In all honesty, Ryomen was kind of happy that Kilm taught him this technique.* - Sun Nov  1 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) arched his brow. It seemed Trilliam wanted to turn this into a spar of some sorts, especially since he used one of his main combos. Ryomen wasn't too sure of sparring, since he all he wanted to do was perform jutsu. As the earthen balls were shot, collided with the stream of fire, and sent in both directions, Ryomen could do nothing but dodge. He would slide towards his right side, the balls of earth shooting right past him. He watched the dome form over the clone and Trilliam himself.

Ryomen would only continue to fire the same jutsu over and over, simply wanting to build his mastery with it. Forming only one hand seal, "Tiger," he'd launch the jutsu once more, firing yet another bullet stream of fire in the general vicinity of Trilliam's done and the surrounding clones. The heat intensified, the temperature in the area rising each and every time he used a fire jutsu. A bead of sweat trailed down the side of his face.


* - Mon Nov  2 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) smirked. Trilliam wanted anae, then he had one. With his new technique, and some of his other ones, he knew hencpuld easily counter some of his adversary's jutsu. The Doton-covered shuriken were launched by one of the clones. "Tch." He performed a single hand seal, zooming completely off course, and around towards the dome. The chakra welled up in his system, the boy keeping the Tiger seal for better control. Once he was ready, then the chakra would come up from his throat once more, permeating the air and catching fire. A bullet stream was sent directly towards the solid dome.

Ryomen hoped to use his heat to melt some of the rocks in the dome and create an opening. If successful, some of the fire would permeate through, filling the dome and creatng uncomfortable, hot conditions inside. If either successful or unsuccessful, the fire would also serve as some splash damage, rebounding off the dome and reflecting some fire onto the clones around the outside of the dome to burn them.* - Mon Nov  2 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Tell me which coruse of action went through because that decieds what justus i used - Mon Nov  2 01:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) had just been dancing around the field--what he usually did. He was unlucky in that all of his attacks were dodged. If anything, he was only lucky in that his fire effecitvely pieces the earthen dome, the flames filling the inside. However, he was suddenly caught off guard, being pulled down into the earth suddenly. His foot, along with the rest of his body up to his neck, was covered in Trilliam's chakra. This would effecitvely cause him to slip into the ground without warning. The feeling being weird, seeing that it was his first time succumbing to the jutsu, he'd just be rooted in place, waiting for Trilliam's next move.

Ryomen rolled his eyes, it did seem annoying to be trapped in the jutsu, as when seen on other peoples' faces. He'd simply sigh, staring out in tHe open, "Alright you won Trilliam. You won the unofficial, spontaneous spar."* - Mon Nov  2 01:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) dug himself out of the ground, quickly retorting at Trilliam's response. "I expected you to shoot back at my technique, not stand there and take it. That's why I wanted you to master a jutsu as well, so we can train the potency of the jutsu against each other. I thought that was implicitly understood, but I guess that's my fault." He'd smile as the compliment, "Running around? Oh, it's something that I do a lot, always got to stay on your toes, I guess." He'd laugh, complimenting himself as as well. The sudden turn in Trilliam's mood bothered him, causing him to arch his brow,  "Trilliam, don't down yourself like that. It's not just about learning jutsu, it's also about practicing your capabilites with them, and making do with what you have. I don't think I'm getting Hassan's approval anytime soon, actually. If anything, you have everyone else's approval, and I don't. People are willing to teach you so much, whereas I have to work to even think of something for myself."* - Mon Nov  2 01:34:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: I was thrilled, but I declined it because I want to train my other elements as well. - Mon Nov  2 01:38:08 2015
