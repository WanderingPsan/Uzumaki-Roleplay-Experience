<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I wish to find a means to obtain peace. - Sun Oct 18 07:30:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I am looking for the same thing. What have you learned from traveling? - Sun Oct 18 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I've learned that not everyone has the same mindset.  - Sun Oct 18 07:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's going to be a difficult thing to achieve, but I believe it's possible. - Sun Oct 18 07:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: ...Should I stop letting people know I'm a murderer who enjoys spilling guts? - Sun Oct 18 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: There are alot of evil people....The world is based around fighting and killing. I mean, as much as I want peace, I've killed and even vowed to kill certain men. Is it evil to kill?---In your opinion? - Sun Oct 18 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: omit - Sun Oct 18 07:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't believe in murder. All lives are valuable. I understand that people feel the need that they must kill, but my journey is to change the way people think. Too many people view themselves as tools, which is a reason why we fight for our lives. - Sun Oct 18 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Is murdering and killing the same thing? - Sun Oct 18 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So to answer your question, I don't believe it to be 'evil' as evil is a relative word. There's no good or evil, just those with an open mind and those who refuse to think in a new way. - Sun Oct 18 07:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Taking the life of an individual is all the same. I've yet to take a life, and I hope that I don't have to. I've been told that such a day will happen, but I really wish one won't arise. - Sun Oct 18 07:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I can't agree with you there. We both are looking for peace in the world though...I don't see it happening without certain people dying. - Sun Oct 18 07:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I am willing to die in order to achieve peace..But I'm not here to die  without a fight. You will find a man one day that cannot be changed, and is destined to be killed or continue killing. - Sun Oct 18 07:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You will realize at that point, this world can't be so innocent....It will never be so innocent. - Sun Oct 18 07:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I know, but you'll never know unless you try. - Sun Oct 18 07:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Everything that I've been taught as been towards promoting the message of peace.  - Sun Oct 18 07:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, we take two paths towards the same goal. Maybe we will achieve it together, through different means. There are many ways to take down a beast. - Sun Oct 18 07:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Perhaps.. - Sun Oct 18 07:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: What is your image of peace? What defines it for you? - Sun Oct 18 07:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: When good men do not die needlessly... - Sun Oct 18 07:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I guess mine is from personal experiences. But my brother was murdered in cold blood and so was my closest friend. - Sun Oct 18 07:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And those men who killed him are the men I have vowed to kill. They are everyting that is wrong with the ninja world. We have a few like that in the village and I wish to change them for the better...From my experience, it's more probable that I'll have to kill them. - Sun Oct 18 07:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see. So your 'peace' is one where your loved ones don't die through the actions of other men? - Sun Oct 18 07:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I guess if you want to put it that way. I don't like to see people suffer and I do not like antagonism. When I see it, I want to kill it. If you let it grow, it becomes harder to kill...Kind of sick but it's true. - Sun Oct 18 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Yo. - Sun Oct 18 07:46:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: One more word implying that and I'm ripping your nuts off with my hand. - Sun Oct 18 07:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Ah, a path of revenge..Revenge is akin to a flame. It burns anything and everything around you. However, lif used and directed properly, the flame can have pupose. - Sun Oct 18 07:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And I do have purpose. - Sun Oct 18 07:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'm sure you do, but it's the flame of revenge that should be directed to a positive outlook.  - Sun Oct 18 07:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: This is the only outlook I see. It's what I've lived. - Sun Oct 18 07:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You'll see others eventually.  My only advice to you about revenge is, don't let it swallow you up. - Sun Oct 18 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah, it almost did.... - Sun Oct 18 07:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: But I work towards the betterment of my village now. If I ever get to take my revenge upon those men, I will..But I have a job here and I can't throw it away to fight battles. - Sun Oct 18 07:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see. I suppose if I was brought up with a different point of view, I may have been the same.  To me, my ideal sense of peace is unity.  A world where everyone has reached a geniuine understanding of one and another, and are able to solve things through words and words a lone.  If I can even get an individual to see the world through such lens, it would make me happy. - Sun Oct 18 07:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I would be happy. - Sun Oct 18 07:59:08 2015
