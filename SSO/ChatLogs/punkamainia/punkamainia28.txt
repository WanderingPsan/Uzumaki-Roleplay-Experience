"Trilliam, sorry to rain on your parade, but don't you think that combo of yours is overused?" He'd take in a deep breath, performing a small set of hand seals as be walked backwards. Chakra gathered in his chest, taking on fuuton properties before splitting and making its way towards his mouth.

Upon the execution of the final seal, his mouth opened, releasing several bullets of condensed wind towards the earth bombs and mud river. He occasionally glanced towards Nina, while having to duck and dodge from a far range from the onslaught. His plan was to stop of the bombs, and dry up the river with what he could. In the meanwhile, he had to duck and dodge from a long-range.* - Sun Nov  1 01:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) took notice of the lightning ball that the clone shot out. He'd sigh. Didn't Trilliam see him just use a wind technique? Sense would have it that fuuton beat out lignting, usually. He raised his hands once more, getting ready to perform the same technique. He gathered chakra, split it, and blazed through the hand seals. Multiple bullets were fired in a cluster, clashing against the lightning technique. Most likely ripping through the lightning bullet with ease, they'd continue forwards towards the clone, perhaps disposing of both of them.

He'd only notice two Trilliams instead of three. Putting ip his guard, he would dash away--towards Nina. The boy glanced over to Nina, watching as how she was hit with the technique. Even though she was one of his enemies in this case, Ryomen grit his teeth, feeling sorry for the girl. Being near her, he would morally encourage her. "C'mon, get up! Let's take Trilliam down together, right?" He was attempting to forge a temporary alliance. Clearly, Trilliam seemed stronger than both of them at the point; he looked like he could go strong for a long time. Ryomen knew he couldn't. He waited around for the girl, also on the lookout for his other adversary.* - Sun Nov  1 01:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) smiled. Giving Nina the moral strength she needed was actually perfect. She went to go handle the clones, and that seemed enough for him, to secure their alliance. However, he couldn't make sure of it, since she never said anything verbally. He'd look and notice another clone gone. This meant two Trilliams were above, and two below. Nina had entrapped one of the clones into a taijutsu battle most likely, leaving the other one, which sent rocks flying towards the shinobi. "Brace yourself Nina!" Ryomen kept on the move, dancing around. While doing so, he began his formation of more seals, chakra already accumulating. The accumulated chakra would be expended, releasing outwards from him at a wide range (6x6).

Within moments, the last hand seal was performed. The wind quickly picked up, gusting in several different directions at a powerful force and speed. This should have been enough to defer the rocks away from him, and hopefully throw the clones around. Unluckily, it may have disturbed Nina's tornado that surrounded her.* - Sun Nov  1 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) apparently, his wind techniques had no efect, since at this point all the clones had been underground, dodging his technique. On the bright side, he had avoided the rocks. On the downside, one of the clones emerged from underground, trapping Nina and probably ending her side of the fight. "Hmph," was all he said. With a sudden swiftness, he darted straight towards Nina, withdrawing his tanto. He'd lightly skip over her head, attempting an effective striking dash on the clone. If successful, the tanto would go straight through the clone, causing it to disperse. Upon landing, he'd turn around and slide back, watching for what happened next.* - Sun Nov  1 02:51:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) smirked, seeing the dome form from below him. He thought of an idea, and thought that it might be able to work. While the dome started to form, he performed some hand seals, leaking chakra in the immediate vicinity around him. The wind began to pick up, except it was raising into the air. Ryomen finished the hand seals, and then jumped as high as he could. With luck and skill, he let the wind carry him high into the air, possibly letting him rise above the dome's range. After the upwind, he'd land on the dome with a slight thud, panting. However, he did get an adrenaline rush from the ride. "Not that easy, Trilliam."* - Sun Nov  1 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Right. - Sun Nov  1 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) smiled. He had a good spar, and be went as many rounds he was supposed to go, according to the mission. If not, then he went more. He'd float down using the same jutsu he used to get up there, softening his landing. "Can I come with you Trill?" he'd ask. He wanted to know about the situation as well and wanted to help.* - Sun Nov  1 03:17:32 2015

He snickered, "He can't possibly survive that, can he?" He was surprised that Tribus hadn't been yet taken down. If the process could be made quicker, Ryomen wanted to help out as well. He'd raise his hands, chakra flaring in his system. Some would accumulate, building up in his chest. It would only be preparation, as no seals were performed yet. He waited. If anything, his attack would be an after attack.* - Sun Nov  1 05:57:07 2015

Ryomen performed the hand seals he needed, the chakra he accumulated being expended outwards towards Shin's circle and fire. Upon the last hand seal, the chakra suddenly condensing in the form of a strong gust of wind. If successful, the wind would magnify the wind, causing it to rage and uproar.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) smirked. He was happy to be by Hassan's side, fighting in an actual situation. If anything, he was going to stay by the leader's side. When techniques were used in conjunction, it was usually best that they came from the same direction, so that they didn't create conflict with each other. As Hassan performed the hand seals, Ryomen began to do the same. There was only one real katon technique he knew, and it usually complimented most fuuton-styled techniques. Chakra gathered in his chest, fueling with a katon-based essence. It accumulated rather quickly, and was sent up the back of the boy's throat.

The last seal was formed, and the chakra was sent billowing out from his mouth. Upon contact with the air, the chakra would light up, forming a huge ball of flames that was sent right into the wind that Hassan conjured up. With success, the fireball would most likely enhance in size and potency. It would burn through inmates, literally scorching them as it headed towards the ring leader--Tribus. "One of the reasons why I couldn't solely focus on Fuuton, Sir Hassan. I live for these type of things."* - Sun Nov  1 07:52:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) watched the Kazekage take off with speed and haste, enveloped in a armor of wind of some sorts. <Hrm, that's interesting.> Ryomen took note. An elemental armor could be beneficial in battle. He'd listen to his orders, nodding in response. He'd look back towards Ai's clones, now knowing that he was capable of performing Katon-based techniques. In that case, he could back off his katon techniques, and switch over to his fuuton. If he thought right, and Ai had performed the same jutsu, Ryomen could follow up, and if Hassan were to utilize wind, he could add as well. There many possibilities, and Ryomen only thought of one.

He caught himself off guard, deep in thought when he should have been in battle. The boy gathered bis chakrs, his hands shaping into various seals over a short time period. He'd smirk, his chakra ready to materialize at any second. It was only on Ai's command that he would release the technique.* - Sun Nov  1 13:36:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Anyone else interested in swords? - Sun Nov  1 18:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) took off towards the training field in the south.* - Sun Nov  1 18:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) opened the scroll that Kilm had given him. He had a new katana strapped on his side. It actually felt weird to carry around, but he would probably get used to it. He took some of his things off, putting it to the side as he focused on learning the technique. Of course, bis belongings would still be in visible sight, but out of his practice range. The shinobi read through the scroll, reading up on the specifics of the technique before getting down to business. He'd examine the hand seals, scrutinizng every word and diagram that Kilm had put in the scroll. Ryomen wss dedicated to learning this new technique. He needed some new jutsu in his arsenal.

After reading through, Ryomen would begin concentration. He envisioned his chakra system, imagining the chakra flow through at a stabilized rate. The boy would take a deep breath, going through the seals very slowly so that he could master the formation. In this case, there was only one seal he was required to perform: the "Tiger" seal. With a quick and simple formation, that seal was formed, and Ryomen would begin to compartmentalize some of the chakra from his system into his chest. The chakra was left sitting. When time came, Ryomen would attempt to conjure it forth. It was charged with a katon-esque essence, but the boy wasn't sure if the technique would work or not.* - Sun Nov  1 19:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) || The flames he attempted to exhale were exhausted immediately. He hadn't expected to fail as fast. He was well-versed in elemental-styled techniques, and he could learn them very quickly. He wasn't sure why this case was different. Ryomen went all the way back to the beginning, reading and re-reading the scroll Kilm gave him. He was doing everythng that he was told to do, but he wasn't sure why it wasn't working. Maybe he needed some determination and willpower, maybe he just needed Kilm and that annoying raccoon by his side for a step-by-step walkthrough. He couldn't give up, he had to keep going.

Ryomen raised his hands ince more, simply manipulating them to form one seal, "Tiger." Before and during the quickly-performed seal formation, the boy set apart a good amount of chakra that he planned on using. The chakra accumulated in his lungs and chest region, building up until there was a sufficient number of the essence. Upon command, the chakra would come flowing up from his chest towards the back of his throat. Ryomen kept the Tiger seal formed, so he channeled the best of his control. The chakra funneled into his mouth, forcing him to open it from the excess amount that was conjured. The chakra would pour out.* - Sun Nov  1 19:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) || Chakra came speakng from the boy's mouth. Once it met contact with the aerobic gases in the environment, it lit aflame. Intead of a stream of chakra flowing out, a stream of fire spewed. It was directed at the wall in front of him. It splashed onto the wall, dispersing and scattering along the wall to other parts. Essentially, it would burn the hardened walls, leaving some burned and scorch marks here and there. After performing the jutsu, Ryomen smiled, knowing well that he was now fully capable of performing the jutsu in battle. All he really had to do now was focus on training the technique. He rolled up the scroll, placing it in his small bag. He took all of his other belongings as well and left.* - Sun Nov  1 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) comes back to the makn village area. "Finished learning it, Kilm. Thanks a bunch."* - Sun Nov  1 19:52:32 2015
