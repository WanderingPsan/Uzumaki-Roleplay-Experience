<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) made his way into the area.* - Thu Sep 03 19:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) looked towards Yan, gently scratching his own head before replying, "Yeah, I've been handling stuff at home for a while now."* - Thu Sep 03 19:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) had made his way towards the village gates, finding Yan and Dravae, the latter picking himself up from the sandy ground. "What happened to you?"* - Fri Sep 04 19:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) shrugged his shoulders slightly, though smiling. "It would be awesome if you come. We just have to hunt some of the creatures killing some villagers."* - Fri Sep 04 19:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) began to make his way out into the desert with his team.* - Fri Sep 04 19:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) would finally stop in his tracks, hoping the others would stop with him. He looked around the sandy desert, hoping to see any signs or trails of the "creatures" that were taking the villagers. He saw nothing in the immediate vicinity, but upon closer inspection, he'd see a few small figures heading towards the group at a rapid pace. He'd point towards them, arching his brow, "Those might be the creatures...or they may not be. They're approaching rapidly."* - Fri Sep 04 19:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) looked over to Tetsumi, the cork to his iron gourd popping off as iron sand flowed  out of it steadily, it had seemed that he noticed the charging figures as well. He glanced quickly back to the speeding creatures as they got closer, then right back at Dravae, listening to what he had said. "That's useful information, but there's one problem--those," the ninja had said, raising his hand to point towards the five figures heading right towards them. Three of them seemed to be moving at a faster rate, while the other two had also seemed to be charging steadily from behind, large in size and slow in pace. Over time, their shaodw-like figures came more into view, and the three creatures were head, seemed jaguar-esque.

They were small, but fast and seemed to pack a steady punch. They were sandy in color, their genes adapted to the environment of the desert for them to camouflage readily. The set of two, larger animals  became clearer also. Lagging farther behind, but much larger and brute, were the gorillas. They were a shade of brown, more noticeable than the jaguars, but they still had a tone that made them more adjusted to the desert. As they approached steadfast, Ikarus began charging up his chakra, letting it flow steadily in his body. He was ready for their next move--whatever it was.* - Fri Sep 04 20:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) || The bugs began to burrow into the fur of the gorillas, thought it would probably take a little more to stop them. They still advanced from afar. Tetsumi spread his iron sand over the ground, a portion of the desert becoming a different color as the jaguar approached. However, they faced another situation, the fact that Dravae has posed 3 insect clones to stop each and every one of the jaguars that lunged towards the group. It appeared they were smarter than that. Using their momentum, all three of the jaguars quickly lunged into the air, dashing over part of the field and making their way quickly towards the three ninja. They hoped to pounce on their prey and send them hard into the ground.

Ikarus was ready, he took withdrew his hammer, cocking it far back as the jaguar got closer mid-air. With one hard and clean swipe, he'd ram the mallet into the creature's ribcage, sending it far into the air, but backwards at the same time. It would be sent flying backwards, leaving the field of iron sand (unless Tetsumi brought it back in), and land harshly on the desert floor, sliding backwards towards the gorilla. Hopefully, he'd have done enough damage to leave it stunned in the meanwhile. He looked towards the others, watching carefully if they needed help. They probably didn't, but he made sure.* - Fri Sep 04 21:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) || The jaguars that lept for Tetsumi and Dravae had been handled just as easily as Ikarus', if not, then easier. While their jaguars were easily taken care of, the gorillas had finally gotten close enough to the iron sand field. Before even stepping on it, they used their power to jump high into the air. Of course, their power wasn't as  efficient, seeing as how the bugs were making quick work of them. However, they went high above the ninja, and would attempt to slam onto thr ground between Ikarus, Tetsumi, and Dravae. It wasn't mean to be a direct hit, but enough force to scatter the iron sand field with heavy weight, and blow the ninjas back. 

Ikarus, barely expecting it, was able to dash a few yards away before being slightly blown back on his feet, sliding. The ninja placed his mallet back on his back. Now that they were in their vicinity, he was hoping to leave the gorillas up to Tetsumi and Dravae to make quick work of them--assuming they had handled their jaguars. In the meanwhile, he dashed towards the jaguar he had blown away, deciding to jump into the air, and turn so that hiis back was facing the creature. With light work, he'd land on the jaguar, the mallet on his backside slamming onto the monster's head and crushing its skull, killing it. As he much as he didn't want to do it, he had to for the sake of the villagers.
* - Fri Sep 04 22:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) || Dravae's bugs would finally take effect. After landing, the gorillas would suddenly freeze in place. A lot of their life force had been drained via the bugs, along with the paralytic poison tkaing place. Frozen in place, the spikes of iron sand would slamed directly into the chest of the gorilla between Ikarus and Tetsumi, delivering a lethal blow that would send it falling forwards onto the field of iron sand. The spikes would push further into its body, the killing blow being dealt to that gorilla. Near Tetsumi, the clumps of desert sand and iron sand had been sent flying high into the air, a little crater being crated as particles of iron sand rolled into its epicenter. Some would fall upon the paralyzed gorilla that fell in due to Dravae's inhuman strength. Since it was sand, it wouldn't do much damage to the paralyzed gorilla. 

However, it was up to Ikarus and Tetusmi to handle the rest as Dravae decided to step back. Ikarus, standing near the crushed jaguar, looked towards Dravae, then Tetsumi, as he crushed one of the gorillas into nothing but bones, organs, blood, and thousands of bits of fur. While this happened Ikarus headed towards the paralyzed one in the crater, usig his leg strength to launch him up high into the air above the trapped gorilla. He'd withdraw his mallet, raising it high into the air above him. Once he got as high as his speed and momentum had let him, he began to fall. With this, he'd gain more speed and momentum, as he began to fall with haste. Once he got close to the gorilla, the ninja would slam his hammer down harshly, letting it tear through the creature's flesh and bones.

The momentum of the speed and sheer force would rip the creature apart, crushing bones and demolishing organs. A crater was left in the remains of the gorilla. Ikarus then emerged, climbing back up onto the field of iron sand. He had some blood splattered on his clothes, as well as the whole heavy part of his mallet was covered in blood. He'd stick his foot out, twisting it and turning it so that it dug into the field of iron sand, and made a whole down into the normal desert sand. He stuck his mallet in there, letting it sit for a little bit as the blood would creep onto the sand and off his mallet. There were still some stains here and there, but that got rid of most of the hard work of cleaning it. "Didn't want to bloody your sand further. Might be hard to clean as it is, right?"* - Fri Sep 04 23:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) turned towards Yan, "A corpse?"* - Sat Sep 05 02:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) would take a couple steps back, letting Dravae and Maxwell do their thing.* - Sat Sep 05 15:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) had decided to step away from the escalating fight. This was nothing he wanted any involvement in, due to his pacifist nature. There was no way to stop this fight using his actions, so there was no point for him to try anyway. He was pretty sure he'd die doing so.* - Sun Sep 06 18:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Chiyari-sama, we can't let Tethys die here.. - Sun Sep 06 19:02:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: It is...Very, but this man who they target..At one point wanted to kill your mother , he killed many.. - Sun Sep 06 20:26:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Tre sanders) whispers: Stay in the mansion or hidden tunnel witht the REAL me.. - Sun Sep 06 20:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) joined up with the other attacking forces, that being the other Sunagakure ninja, and the Kumogakure ninja. Upon entering the wall, he noticed that there were attacks and blasts immediately coming for the group. He raised his hands, stringing together a small set of hand seals, stirring the chakra in his body as well. As he did this, he'd dash backwards a step, hopping onto the wall and then using it as a boost. He pounced on the wall, boosting farther back than what he wuld be able to normally traverse on ground. As far as he was, he was hopefully able to dodge the brunt of the damage. As the explosion raged on, he'd keep his hands locked into the final seal, in case he needed to use the jutsu. Luckily, there were ninja in front of him that would cushion him, basically being used a body shields so he wasn't dealt damage. He dropped the seal, not needing to use the jutsu in that case.* - Sun Sep 06 23:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) had just been standing back, dazing in and out of battle. With his pacifist nature, he only stood around behind some of the troops that decided to protect his weak ass. He looked around, watching death and destruction occur left and right. Ninja were being killed, heads were being severed, all things that he hated about war. He was only brought here for one reason, rather, force here for one reason: to fight. He was going to have to get scathed, though he hoped not badly. It was probably too late to hop in the fight, but he was going to hope and save at least some ninja. He finally moved, taking a step forward. He'd walk between some of the ninja protecting him, nodding his head slightly to let them know he was entering battle.

He'd look at some of the Amegakure ninja, along with some of the Konohagakure ninja fighting the other groups of Sunagakure, Kirigakure, and Kumogakure ninja. All the boy needed to do was perform hand seals, since had been stirring chakra since the beginning of the fight. This was what he did. He performed a short set of seals, letting the chakra well up in his chest before gathering in his mouth. It swished around, before suddenly reaching capacity and spewing out towards the Amegakure and Konohagakure shinobi. Instead of spewing out chakra, a weak, yet far-reaching wave would extend out from his mouth and accumulate on the ground. Luckily, he had some help by his side. Some of the Sunagakure ninja would use their stronger water techniques to aid the boy, increasing the amount of water that spread to the enemies' feet.* - Mon Sep 07 02:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) || The ninja retreated. Ikarus had left the battle as soon as it began. The water ont he ground scattered and dispersed, merely becoming puddles as he looked over to some of the others, those others including the Raikage and Tetsumi. He wondered what he was staring at, only quickly he would grow to learn that ti wasn't a what--but a whom--that he was staring at. He looked at the weak frame of the girl, arching his brow, she was barely noticeable, yet she looked at them as if she knew them. He did some examining of her, before the face came to mind. <Woah, is that...?>* - Mon Sep 07 03:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) looked towards Dravae, responding, "Yeah, I'm all ready. What's on the agenda, 'Black Bug?'"* - Mon Sep 07 14:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) nodded, "I agree, we can find the lab, labs if there's more. I think we might just need some more people, in case we need more hands or if we need to split up. Chiyari will be back in no time, so I think we don't need to worry much about him. Him and Lord Raikage can discuss what we do with the village of Konoha. I don't really know if rebuilding is necessary, but I'd say we leave it for now." He paused, adjusting his throat.  After hearing Dravae's final sentence, he arched his brow, pretending that he didn't kknow about his eye. "My left eye? What's...wrong with it?" Of course, Ikarus had already knew what had happened, thanks tot he existance of mirrors. He didn't know how it came to be, but that it just happened. It hadn't impeded his fighting or thinking...at least not yet, so he usually left it alone. <It's clarly visible in the left eye, now. Probably not until long before it becomes fully visible in my right."* - Mon Sep 07 15:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) shook his head, his eyebrows still arched as he responded, "I'm pretty sure I didn't get whacked. I mean, I knew that the rings were barely visible, I'd thought they'd go away for now. It's not really doing anything to me right now though, so it's fine."* - Mon Sep 07 15:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) simply nodded, "Of course," He'd watch as Dravae did what he did, interrogating insects of all sorts.* - Mon Sep 07 15:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) stuffed his hands in his pockets. Once they arrived, they were greeted by torn and tattered clothing, as well as the horrendous and pungent smell of rotting bodies, feces, etc. It was a terrible sight, and the smell was probably the worst thing that he's smelled in a while--possibly worst smell ever. He sighed, closing his eyes momentarily and shaking his head in disgust and defiance of the act. "'Tis a shame what people do nowadays. I have a small hope that there are people still alive here, do you guys think there are?"* - Mon Sep 07 16:07:28 2015
