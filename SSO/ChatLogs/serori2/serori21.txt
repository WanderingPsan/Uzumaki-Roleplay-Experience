<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jay(Serori2) was wandering around Suna in search of his next gram before immediately becomning enthralled by the random stench of marijuana in the area. Coming to the realization that some stoners or growers were nearby, his Byakugan would immediately activate in response. 

<Maybe they'll give me a hit?> he pondered while following the smoke. When Jay suddenly wound on the doorstep, unable to help himself, he'd barge inside in search of his medication. 

<I'll search the whole house for a dab!> he thought. * - Wed Nov 11 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jay(Serori2) cringed with practical ectasy at the sight of the blunt cherrying. He imagined the fat hit the woman took filling up his lungs. 

"I'm sorry. I just couldn't help myself." Jay said while raising his head in an attempt to be respectful, though his eyes continuing to beam directly at the blunt with anticipation.* - Wed Nov 11 01:02:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jay(Serori2) was apparently manhandeled by Yan before being thrust somewhere outside his home. Falling into the rough sand, he'd stare at Yan with a bit of shock. 

"I'm sorry..." he apologized. "Did I do something wrong?"* - Wed Nov 11 01:17:13 2015

"How about you show me around town, y'know? We could maybe talk a little more over some lunch? My treat." he said, attempting to bait her. * - Wed Nov 11 01:36:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jay(Serori2) took a deep breath before proceeding to get down onto both his knees. Attempting to be humble, he'd practically bow his head down to the ground. 

"I'm very desperate and I was told to find you." he told her again. "Mizora-sama, what must I do to prove I am worthy in your eyes?" * - Wed Nov 11 01:53:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jay(Serori2) closed his eyes for a brief moment as the veins lateral to his eyes suddenly bulged, indicating the activation of his doujutsu. With the all-penetrating eye of the Byakugan, Jay would attempt to determine the nature of the man's jutsu. He attempted to directly look at the man's elemental chakra natures as well as the contents of his gourd. * - Wed Nov 11 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jay(Serori2) opened his eyes while his face reflected moderate shock. Jay's Byakugan had disected the natures of the man's impressive ninjutsu in a moment and identified Jiki's chakra. 

"It's Iron Sand" Jay guessed with a tremble in his voice. "In your gourd, right?" he asked for comfirmation. * - Wed Nov 11 02:37:26 2015

"Yeah, my eye technique allows me to see over a wide range and through things. I can see the Kazekage over past this wall!" Jay explained of his ninja ability. * - Wed Nov 11 03:04:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jay(Serori2) entered the ramen shop bearing wide, gleeful grin before releasing a relaxed sigh. "My home away from home!" he declared. implying the foreign village he hailed from. Jay grabbed one of the chairs before sliding it out from a table. 
"C'mon sit." he told her before pulling out another chair for himself. Sitting down, he'd flash the chef a peace sign as a means to order two bowls. * - Wed Nov 11 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jay(Serori2) says: So... Tell me about yourself? What do you do?  - Wed Nov 11 03:20:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jay(Serori2) leaned back in his chair a bit, wobbling in place on the back legs. 

"A taijutsu student you say...?" he asked, his curiosity peaked. 
"I've actually been looking for a teacher. Though while I specialize heavily in Taijutsu, I do not have any issue with relying on previous skills." he continued. 

Jay shifted his weight in his chair, suddenly planting all four legs down as he intended to be a bit more serious as their conversation deepened. "Ever since my village was destroyed, I've just been wandering in search of a place to call home. I'd also like to find a teacher so that I may become a shinobi myself." * - Wed Nov 11 03:41:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jay(Serori2) says: I truly do want a teacher, but what you are asking if unthinkable.  - Wed Nov 11 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jay(Serori2) says: Of course, everybody has parents. - Wed Nov 11 04:07:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jay(Serori2) says: My mom was annoying. She would never admit she was wrong, and complained about everything. My dad wasn't much better, he just always let my mom walk all over him... But they were both my parents. So I loved them a lot anyways, despite their faults. - Wed Nov 11 04:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) says: o-oh? - Wed Nov 11 04:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jay(Serori2) began to tear up a bit as discussed his parent's deaths. "I've always been such a hopeless person... I wasn't even able to save my own parents." he confessed. 

"I must become strong, because it is even more painful to be weak... That is my ninja way!"* - Wed Nov 11 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jay(Serori2) says: Anyways... What about your parents?  - Wed Nov 11 04:23:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jay(Serori2) accepted the menu in hand from Momura in exchange for a slight nod of approval. Placing it before himself, he'd open it tovbrowse through. 
"Grilled chicken.. chicken strips.. miso soup.. egg rolls.." he read off the menu to himself. "Could you give us a moment please, 'Momura'?" he attempted to ask politely. "We'll be ready to order in jutst a moment, we just need some more time to look through the menu." he'd tell the waitress, attempting to briefly dismiss her. 

"What did you wan't by the way?" he asked, sliding the menu over the table to Paine for her to look at. * - Wed Nov 11 04:53:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jay(Serori2) clapped in an attempt to get Momura's attention. "Where are our drinks at?" he asked. "It does not take this long to make watermelon tea. I will talk to your managers!" * - Wed Nov 11 05:10:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jay(Serori2) smiled very genuinely at Momura as she sat the tray of beverages at the table. He appreciated her service. "Thank you." he said politely before taking one of the glasses and proceededing to quickly gulp it down. One by one he finished off the water cups before ultimately arriving at the watermelon tea. Jay decided to sip the tea as he awaited for Momura to refill his waters. * - Wed Nov 11 05:31:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jay(Serori2) covertly performed the seal of confronation under the table as he began to focus his water natured chakra over the course of the dinner. He wasn't drinking all that water for nothing, and he hoped to use it to later better his jutsu. Looking over at Paine's water cup, he'd smile. "Are you going to finish that?" he'd ask. * - Wed Nov 11 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-Alright. - Wed Nov 11 05:40:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Huey(LolrZ) says: Go and check. - Wed Nov 11 05:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jay(Serori2) began to casually snack away at the large amount of food in gluttonous manner. His goal was to consume it as quickly as possible, having eaten very little in his past couple days as an immigrant in the village. It also wasn't everyday that Jay got to ete at a resteraunt either. 

"Have as much as you like." Jay invited Paine, gesturing broadly to the generous assortment of food layed out before them. * - Wed Nov 11 05:50:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jay(Serori2) pushed his chair back with a grunt as he stood up and moved to confront Huey alongside Momura. 

"Is there gonna be a problem?" he asked. "These people are working hard, its not cool of you to disrespect them like this."* - Wed Nov 11 05:56:16 2015

"Thank you. Thank you very much." He said to Momura, breathing heavily with shock as he continued to watch the technique play out against Huey with his Byakugan. <I'm lucky Momura managed to come between me and the technique...>* - Wed Nov 11 06:33:48 2015

Jay ultimately ended up carrying the multiple boxes in a pile, intending to feast on the rest later. Walking back over towards Huey, he'd grab the latter before hoisting him up over his shoulder. 

Clasping his hands together, Jay would perform the jutsu he'd been gathering chakra for previously. <Hiding in MistTechnique> he thought silently as the atmosphere began to thicken with water, turning everybody's vision white. Navigating his way through the cloud with his Byakugan, he'd make his exit. * - Wed Nov 11 06:48:19 2015
