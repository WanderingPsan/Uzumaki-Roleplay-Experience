<br><font color=yellow>*Jizai(GarryOak69) sat his ass on te ground of the random placed he had awoken, not a building or person in sight, plus he was freaking nude, what the fuck? "Stupid grass, makin' my balls itch n' stuff." he seemed grouchy.* - Thu Oct 15 22:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jizai(GarryOak69) had awoken again, this time infront of a large wall, such a lovely place... not. Jizai seemed groggy and annoyed so he simply took the time to assess himself into the area, cause you now, he'd been poffing around while unconcious, it wasn't a pleasant thing. "So, bright orange walls, trees, grass, dirt.. I'm next to a gigantic target. . ." he spoke rather sarcastically as he knew nothing of where he was, and it irritated him, with a painful mind, nothing but blurs, he was going to need a good way to explain himself if people confronted him, but at the same time he wanted to make himself stronger, so fuck it.

Jizai spun around and walked towards a tree, he proceeded to punch, kick and use jutsu against the tree, a lovely way to fight, and he just needed the training to fuck with others, and fight well, since he was rather dull and bland right now, but it'd come back to him, he was sure of it.* - Fri Oct 16 15:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jizai(GarryOak69) with a steady pace going he continued his training, with each punch he planed on focusing his strength ito it and even placing a smile on his face as he thought ot and practiced new combos, what else was there to do really? A sudden surge of adreneline came as he steadied his fist and leapt forwards, kicking the tree and then hopping back, but he wasn't done, when he hopped back, only one leg supported him as he started to spin. With the sudden spin, a twisting of his waist and a forward momentum brought from the surge of chakra from his singular foot, sent the entire leg in a quick round-house to slam against the tree, that was going to leave a bruise.

Jizai smiled as he felt the pain in his leg "Pain is weakness leaving the body." he said as he took a second to breathe, then continue the training.* - Fri Oct 16 15:13:29 2015
