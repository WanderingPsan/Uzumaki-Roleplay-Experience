<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ricky(Lordlol45) ||Asteroth nodded along.

She gives them a map and coordinates that depict the general surrounding area. "This man is an old collegue of mine. I enlisted his help to look over an ancient artifact that's currently within my possession. However, rather than do reliable research, he took off and ran to his own village. I want you infiltrate and kill him. Then retrieve my relic."

Simple instructions. 

A hand motions for the duo to head off.

"But be careful. There may be traps laying about." The location of the village is depicted as west of Amegakure. The 'Bush' village was relative small, but seemed sufficiently covered with troops.

* - Sun Nov  1 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ricky(Lordlol45) ||Ricky remains stationed near the northern district of the village. He's within a science lab, which strangely is placed inside a palace.

With a metal tool, he prods against the blacken gem, eying it curiously.

"I wonder. . . Where did this item spawn from."* - Sun Nov  1 01:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ricky(Lordlol45) ||
It seemed that tact or stealth wasn't exactly the strong suit of the shinobi from Amegakure.

"A mist! . . I know we're close to Kirigakure, but this isn't natural. . ."
"Back up! We need more men to the gate!"
". . Y'know, this could just be a diversion."

The low-leveled grunts all chattered among themselves as they cautiously moved to squell the potential threat. Given enough time, additional troops from the nearby outbursts stormed, in effort to bolster the ensemble of guards at the gate. They were all armed with scrolls, each one filled with an assortment of deadly supplies to aid in the protection of the small, budding village.

"Oi. . . Ready. Aim. . . Fire!"

And just like that, a series of explosive bombs are sent flying forward from the scroll, each one covered with a cluster of basic explosive tags. Given the nature, the usually meager effects of an explosive note are amplified, making them nothing to be trifled with. All in all, twelve are thrown at random-- and combust upon entering the mist. 

On impact, the explosive nature kickstarts an unruly gust, momentarily dissipating the Mist. Although, the artificial weather condition could easily be replenished if the caster so wish.* - Sun Nov  1 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ricky(Lordlol45) ||Ichiro had worked intelligently.

Due to the strange secretion, the towering brute finds himself readily able to defend against the explosive effects of the Explosive-Tag Mines! The firey release would burn against the spider-like defenses, but to no avail. It cracked and was singed -- marring it with blacken streak,s but in the end the defensive technique had prevailed!

"Keep up the fire!"

Of course, just as the assemble of twenty warriors had prepared to launch another world, incame the massive quantity of water -- a hogshead even. It roared like an enraged lion, before the psuedo-tsunami washed away at the gates. The bulk of the men prove to possess less than adequate athletic ability. In no time, eleven of the men are washed away, their bodies harshly slamming onto the floor.

The other eight? While they had been forced to evacuate, were still conscious. They shook their head, each grabbintg a Tanto and readying for battle. Of course, given the rowdy assault -- the village doesn't take long to be on alert.

More and more troops are being gathered and preparing to tackle the threat.

What would the trio do?* - Sun Nov  1 02:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ricky(Lordlol45) says: Yes - Sun Nov  1 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ricky(Lordlol45) ||The tactic was working well -- even if they probably hadn't thought it through.

Easily, the ANBU Agent is able to pierce through a number of the continued resistance. But at last, re-inforcement had been arriving. About thirty-more guards, some coming from the north, others moving in from the east.

"I think they've come for Lord Ricky!" 

It's hard not to laugh at a menacing Necromancer named -Ricky-.

"We have to stop them!" Kunai are launched in abundance, filling the area and likely making it difficult for Zero to actually defend against. In addition to this, quite a few of the fellow guardsmen would swipe their hands through the air, prompting a series of generic, dark energy bolts to go flying towards the enemy as well.

As for Ichiro, he goes un-noticed -- as does Nigen. Albeit, from the looks of things, they likely hadn't a clue where the target was. The target being. . . Ricky and the Huevo Gem. Towards the north, for those with good enough sensory, they'd notice a golden barrier of Holy Energy erected, blocking off any entry. Odd. . . How 'Priestesses' were in cahoots with a clear Necromancer.
* - Sun Nov  1 03:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ricky(Lordlol45) ||
Nigen begins to wreck havoc. 

The electrical bolts slam against many of the warrior's frame, whittling down their forces. Some convulse and collapse, gaining seizure-like symptons, while others only partially succumb to the strength of the dark energy bolts.

However, while the blows had done some good , they'd also serve to be a detriment. Now Nigen's location had been more or less discovered. The village's sensory unit was hard at work, and while the flying sorcerer was acknowledged as a Necromacer, it was clear from his actions that he wasn't a friendly face.

Zero's blows also do well -- but given that they're from scrub-like Suiton clones, the damage is neligible. All in all, about ten of the warriors are killed, leaving the immediately resistance at a less than stellar numbering of 20. Meanwhile, a few stray kunai and bolts manage to hit their mark, destroying two of the clones.

Bush Village: 22 in immediate area.
Priests to the North: 20 in total
Chilling with RIcky: 30

As for Ichiro, the powerful, yet clumsy warrior trips off one of the traps meant to deter trespassers. Poisonous smog immediately kicks upward, and once ingested, serve to be a clear detriment to the warrior's efforts. Overall, he'd find his physical capabilty reduced. (You'd have 60% reflex, 70% speed, and 65% Strength at your disposal.)

In ten turns, the effects heighten.* - Sun Nov  1 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ricky(Lordlol45) ||Ichiro's search makes one thing clear.

The man they seek isn't anywhere near the south. Thus, it becomes obvious that they must make it through the Holy Barrier.* - Sun Nov  1 04:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ricky(Lordlol45) ||
In fact, pretty much all of the opposing forces had been wiped out thanks to the massive waves!

Given Nigen's consistent release of Dark Bolts, those that remained were annhilated, severely limiting the amount of troops Ricky held in his command.

However, the barrier remained in full force, and now the Priests were on higher alert. And Lord knows. . . Priests/Priestesses certainly enjoyed combating a Necromancer.

What would the trio move to do?* - Sun Nov  1 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ricky(Lordlol45) ||From the northern building, several figures come rushing out. They're adorned in white cloth, and seem to possess strange, baige staves.

From the edge of the city, more troops are storming -- yet they remain blocked off by the Holy Barrier. Clearly, this is where the true mission objective had been. Could the trio succeed and break through?

The priority, of course, being in the retrieval of the gem. Of course, there was a picture of the gem conveniently in the scroll, makingi t obvious what they had to obtain.* - Sun Nov  1 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ricky(Lordlol45) ||The barrier cracks slightly as the assortment of attacks launch against it's form. However, just as quickly as the cracks had been spawned, they heal right on up. A whole is opened from the mid-point, briefly allowing the remaining grunts to sent or fling their projectiles in conjunction with the Priestesses' own dastardly strikes.

The onslaught is overwhelming as the group despperately seeks to force the Amegakure shinobi into a retreat.* - Sun Nov  1 04:55:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||In the group's approach, they;d fiond that things were mildly different.'

For example, at the entrance, there would be no opposition -- as any opponents had been dealt with in a previous meeting. Instead, the bulk of the village's protection seemed to be geared towards the north, where most of the forces laid about. The barrier, spawned of Holy Energy, is still fully in effect.

It's transluscent, able to be seen through like glass. Although, there was the coloration of yellow ona nything that was seen through it. On top of this, there were now two pillars constructed towards the west and east - no doubt to strengthen said barricade of ethereal nature. Of course, the group  of Ichiro and Mizumi would be more than capable of taking notice of the horde of men that remained behind.

All in all, fifteen of the forces were Priestess, while the other thirty-five were Necromancers, each with different areaso f expertise. Some excelled in close-ranged combat, others were support and had to be protected. Nevertheless, they were all seemingly prepared to fight to the deeath if the situation lead to it. "You all shall not pass! In just a few moments, Lord Roth's experiment will reach completion!"* - Tue Nov  3 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Ugh.. - Tue Nov  3 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You could have woken me up. - Tue Nov  3 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||This time, the warriors actually had a sensor.

Indeed, while they weren't the best in town, they could casually detect the usage of ninjutsu. As the Shadow Clone is spawned, the Priests are triggered. Without a moment's notice, much like their Necromancer counterparts, a flick of the gaze is all that's required. 

Immediately, lightning like plasma erupted from the western pillar. It manifests, roaring before at last, the energy source is shot ahead. THe lightning rushes along the ground, aiming to electrocute all of those who dare to step foot onto the 'Sacred Lands.' Notably, it took a trio of the Priests to manage. And while this wasn't exactly efficient, it was something to be wary of nonetheless.

(Does about 25 nin damage. Against nindef)

Meanwhile, the crowd behind the Barrier is gathering in formations, preparing to be capable of dealing with the threat as best as possible. Obviously, Nigen's presence isn't exactly unnoticed either.* - Tue Nov  3 04:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||Alright. Things went a bit more smooth this time around.

Thankfully, Mizumi was intelligent. Simultaneously, a mist sweeps over the area. Seconds later, there comes two gigantic spheres of fiery destruction. Waves resonated from their form, and before long the two constructions fly, slamming and aiming to pulverize the western pillar. Indeed, this is far from a natural phenonenon. The flames seem condensed, like a majestic comment, and on impact, the stored chakra is unleashed, dazzling the area.

Naturally, this means some of the mist is evaporated, but enough is still covered to keep the sensors in a frenzy.

Due to this, the pillar's defense is compromised, forcing the structure to wobble. At once, pretty much all of the priests head towards the east, prepared to relocate, more or lessi gnoring Ichiro for now. His punch, however, doesn't go unrewarded. It prompts a decent dent to form, yet the eastern pillar is far from collapsing. 

Due to all of the chaos, the barrier is flickering like a weak light. ". . No! Are they actually getting through?" Given that mizumi was the main distraction, the incoming priests all swipe through hte air, sending generic bolts of Holy Energy! They attack at random, hoping to hit their mark.* - Tue Nov  3 05:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||
More and more, as Ichiro's fists continuously collided against the pillar, it's infrastructure is greatly being compromised. WHile it may have been intelligent to keep the pressure up at both different pillars, in the end. . . intereference or not, the western portion was still crumbling under it's own weight.

The duo's continuous assault eventually weakens the two towers enough that the barrier is slowly deactivating.

In conjunction, Nigen's lazy antics are somewhat effectively, keeping the bulk of the inexpierenced Priests at bay. At last, the two towers reach their breaking point, thus unleashing a thunderous roar. Lightning cackles about their form menancing, and it spreads, covering a wide radius -- enough to compromise anyone that's within the area. For a time, the energy continued to boil over, gaining a stark incline in terms of lethality. . Before finally. . 

It all explodes.

In one fell swoop, the barrier along with all of the Holy Power that had been being pooled together combusts, covering the area in a beautiful, yet deadly spectrum of light. It's blinding, making any and all visage impossible. The floor shook, as if a low leveled Earthquake was naturrally occurinng. And of course, as it setled? A massive crater was left in it's wake. All of the warriors in the area had been vaporized. . . as light magic was super deadly to Necromancer.

Dozens of bodies lifelessly onto the ground and finally a clear path was available. Had they gotten out of the range? Likely. What would the trio do now?

For reference, two buildings remained.* - Tue Nov  3 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||And so they're safe.

Regardless, the two buildings remain. The treasure -- or gem rather -- still has yet to be recovered. Into which will the trio go?

The northern building or eastern? Ones that may or may not be booby trapped.* - Tue Nov  3 06:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: ... - Tue Nov  3 07:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||And suddenly, Mizumi had gone all leeroy Jenkins again.

The wave is easily spawned and more or less eclipses the size and height of the building. Crashing, the adjacent wall is completely crushed by the onslaught of water, which inevitably floods the building. A large chunk of the interior is sent into chaos, with all of the furniture either being left in rubble, or wet beyond usability.

Sadly, this made finding the potential gem far more difficult.

As a hint, however, this was just a decoy housing area. Not a single rare tool was to be found. Instead, more traps are set off. Immediately, a layer of purplish smog manifests, and as the vision is obscured, sharpened weapons pierces through the skies, aiming to impale the fools that approached. It was wide-spread, easily covering a 6x 6 radius, specialized tags were attached.

Of course, assuming that was dealt with, only one last warrior was left.* - Tue Nov  3 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||And finally, they had reached the promise land.

The North building? Oddly wasn't booby-trapped in the least. Instead, the interior were pure white, with glass towels. Various trinkets and gadgets were layered out, typically on tables, with heated tubes or boiling water in abundance. This was very much like a stereotypical lab.

Contrary to the outside appearance, the building is pretty spacious. Not a soul is on the inside, and there apparently is a cellar. For the most part, the trio would find nothing of note, at least not in the first floor. If the drawers were searched, a magic message could be discovered. As it's released, a Hologram of the Demonly 'Roth' spawns, conveying his thoughts and taunts -- He had previously escaped just mere minutes before the barrier's destruction. After all, the sadist had no intent on battling all of the forces on his own.

". . .Ah. So you came for your precious gem. Shame. . .Good thing I made my escape with it long before you bastards could even get close. Tell that bitch Asteroth to get bent. She'll never see this gem. Well. . . Not until I'm plunging it through her heart to take that witch's soul."

Of course, if the group searched thoroughly, they would find some of Roth's claim to be nothing more than shit-talk. In his haste, he hadn't been able to get the specialized Huevo Jewel from the cellar. Thus, if they searched the basement hard enough, it'd be located in a secret compartmant in the ground.* - Tue Nov  3 07:54:01 2015
