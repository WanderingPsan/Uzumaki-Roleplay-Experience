"Indeed, I am foreign. I wasn't exactly raised in these barbaric countries. . ." Asteroth retorts with a bored sigh, her eyes lazily scanning the arena.

"So. . How goes Kirigakure? Last I checked, this place had a very bad infestations of snakes. ."* - Sun Nov 22 22:31:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Good, get out. - Sun Nov 22 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) perked a brow.

"I'll decline. I'll speak with the Mizukage."* - Sun Nov 22 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: I apologies, he's currently not available. You should probably return-- never. - Sun Nov 22 22:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) turns her gaze back to Kokoru, disregarding Kana.

"So tell me. You are a salemen?"* - Sun Nov 22 22:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) says: I - Sun Nov 22 22:41:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) gives a rare chuckle.

She steps ahead, ruffling Kokuro's head. "Adorable. . . And I see. You never know, though. . Kids in these type of places tend to be very adult. I like that you aren't though. What is your name?" Asteroth asks gently, although the usual stern-ness in her voice remained apparent.

This woman had no chill.* - Sun Nov 22 22:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Don't come crying to me when she lowkey root sealed you. - Sun Nov 22 22:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) had no need to place any seals or curses onto the boy. . .! At least not in public.

Despite the constantly serious persona that the woman sported, she manages to spar a brief smirk. "Ah, you're cute as a button, you know? In case you didn't hear when that grumpy lady to your right asked. . . I'm Asteroth. My cousin and bodyguard to the right name is Asgoth," She says introducing both of them.

The woman began to crouch so that she was at face-level with the youthful shinobi. A hand moved to straight out the dress along the way, as it seemed to ride up whenever she performed too many movements.

"So, tell me. . What is there for a tourist to do in town? I'm pretty bored.  It took me three days of traveling to get here."* - Sun Nov 22 22:49:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) feigns being dis-heartened.

She kind of liked Kokuru being cheerful, mainly due to it being her acts that spawned the emotion. "Oh? Mmm, I'm more of a shopping or spa-ing type. . But I also this doesn't sound like a bad time."

She gives a glance to the child's neck, taking note of the headband.

"So, would a big strong, and busy shinobi like you have time to show me around? Doesn't have to be immediately?" A delicate digit moved to playfully prod Kokoru in the belly.* - Sun Nov 22 23:13:29 2015

"I suppose. Asgoth, what do you want to do? Loiter around here and people watch?" She says, gesturing to the bench.* - Sun Nov 22 23:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Of course.. - Sun Nov 22 23:22:52 2015

"Pleasure to meet your acquaintance, Lord Mizukage. . . I assume your village follows the typically cautious customs. I need your permission to stay here?"* - Sun Nov 22 23:47:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) gives a glance.

"I can see why. . .Some of your shinobi are unnecesarily hostile. I merely came here for a change in scenery, and to see how the village looks. It's beautiful so far-- if not a bit dull," the woman retorts with a flat tone.* - Sun Nov 22 23:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) exhales.

She snaps a fingers, beckoning Baylea ahead. "As you wish," Asteroth speaks plainly. She casually strolls on out of the village without a second thought. * - Sun Nov 22 23:54:27 2015

"Perhaps." Then she's off.* - Sun Nov 22 23:55:18 2015

She takes a seat and conjures up a bat. A message is written and sent on off.

"Wonder what that old fart is up to. . "* - Mon Nov 23 00:01:16 2015

And what luck. . .

Somewhere in this forest, there seemed to be a poor soul wandering about alone. Asteroth slithered through the area like a snake, a warm smile being worn on her face due to the realization.

The grass shifted omniously, and the wind even swayed. For a moment, the Necromancer debates on whether or not to just begin conjuring her beasts. But that would be no fun. With a slink, she slips into view, still wearing that beautiful, warm smile.

"My. A camper? I thought people no longer even bothered hanging out in the forest. Especially in times as dangerous as this. . " Asteroth remarks with an increasingly more slick grin. A finger rose, tapping her chin thoughtfully, and in her other hand was an apparrent walking cane or staff.* - Mon Nov 23 00:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||
For reference, Hanae would notice something strange about both of their energies.

For one, Asteroth strangely had no signal being released from her body, as the mana that swirled inside was always kept tethered or underwraps. Meanwhile, Baylea clearly lacked any sense of life force, making it pretty difficult to trace or decipher just what this traveling duo was.

The smirk from before develops into a coy, almost mischeviosu smile. Asteroth steps forward, but doesn't quite seem threatening. Nonsense, she seemed to be a simple lady, a model even -- and judging by her power chakra levels, a non-fighter. "Passing through? And I might I ask where? Y'know. . Kirigakure seems to have taken an isolationist stance. I just got the boot myself."

A forced pout is brought to life. Why was she making small talk?* - Mon Nov 23 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) tilted her head. 

The smile slowly is receding, give way to a deadpan facial expression. Asteroth's heart raced, as she knew now. . . That she was prepared to take a great risk! 

. . . Yet doesn't quite act on her desire just yet.

Hanae's sensory ability would certainly begin to pick up on some spiritual activity. Indeed, no longer was Asteroth's might complete and utterly kept under wraps as the dark energies inside her body proceeded to boil and churn. The level of potency was on a steady, alarming rise, but wasn't quite concentrated enough to become tangile.

The woman's gaze is unwavering, akin to a snake simply gawking at a mouse lingering in the road. It held a calmness. . . An eery calmness, despite the lack of animosity evident, the fact of the matter was thus-- this blonde had less than admirable plans. 

Her energy wreaked of malicious intent. So sinister that the plants around her frame nearly withered away in recoil to the disgusting foul, invvisible miasma of darkness that rushed from her form. 

"That's rude. . . Didn't your mother teach you how to talk to a lady?" Another step forward is taken, and the walking cane is lifted forward.* - Mon Nov 23 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: ... - Mon Nov 23 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) whispers: Shall I attack? - Mon Nov 23 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) narrowed her gaze.

She seemed to be flip-flopping in terms of facial expression. After some thought, Asteroth just wore a tooth-eating grin. "Pity. I also like my men to know so manners. . . Hrm. . . I suppose, it won't be so bad. . " she hums, after going over her thoughts.

It was time to cease being so passive. 

Asteroth had a calling, and Hanae could very well be the the first stepping down to achieving or fulfill that calling. "You're coming with me. Understood?" A glance is given to Baylea, suggesting that she be on stand bind should Hanae not be compliant.* - Mon Nov 23 01:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||
"Adorable. . . I will be blunt. I have a new technique I wish to practice. . Likewise, I require men. Fine mine. . such as yourself. However, the purpose? That much will remain a mystery to you. . "

She says with a coy smile, her energies continuing to flare and gain power. 

The sensation was chilling to those with higher level sensory, almost as if she was no longer possessing the aura or soul of a human. . Nay, Asteroth's spiritual nectar had transcended basic humanity, perhaps developing into something new all together. Something far more sickly and sinister.

"Now. . You can come willingly. . Or, you can make this fun and resist. Baylea, you know the drill. . ." With that, the sorceress proceeds with her chants, speaking magical incantations for reasons unknown.* - Mon Nov 23 01:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) whispers: Even if she complies, detain her. - Mon Nov 23 01:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) doesn't move a muscle as no attacks were geared towards her.

By then, Hanae had pretty sealed their fate, considering Asteroth finished charging up her attack. However. . . The Necromanceress doesn't jump into the fray just yet. Baylea was going to wint his battle, or suffer the consequences.

"Don't fail me now. . "* - Mon Nov 23 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) thinks: I must win for master. - Mon Nov 23 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) thinks: Fire..Is nothing. - Mon Nov 23 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) grew bored on the entire battle.

"Really? Are you struggling with someone as weak as this?"

No time wasted, the mana produced before is immediately put to use. It floods and rips open a portal within the space-time continuum. The targeted area glows a bright illumination, temporarily blinding those that looked towards the area!

Before long, the released mana combusts, sending a shockwave along the water. And as itcleared? A giant monstrosity stood in wait. It was perhaps Asteroth's most powerful summonings, and luckily enough, there was already a pool of water ahead.

Green skin, giant shell, and humanoid-like appendages. One could easily confused this for a turtle. . But no, this was a Kappa! One of the Kings mind you! Easily rivaling the size of a building, the water recoils, sending a gigantic wave onto the surface along the area. "I'll give you a chance to surrender now.  .  Or, you may just have to meet the underlings."* - Mon Nov 23 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||

That wasn't enough. Asteroth shook her head.

"Kappa. Detain this man, using the water and render him unconscious," she'd demand. At her behest, the giant Demon does just that. Without another moment wasted, water flows from it's maw, and wraps around Hanae's body in the event she hadn't moved to avoid.

The prison of liquid remained in place, hoping to block out air long enough so that the male was rendered unconscious. Assuming success, Hanae's defeated frame is tossed onto the grass, while a look of disgust falls over Baylea.

"I thought you were better. At least make yourself useful and drag his body along. We need to find a place to camp so I can test out this new spell."* - Mon Nov 23 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||
It knocked her out because she couldn't breath, by the by.* - Mon Nov 23 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||
Finally, the first of her prey had been delivered. Given that they were so far away from her usual base of operation, the woman had to settle with bunking at a local Inn.

Yep. . . Here she'd delve into the dark arts and perhaps use the most sinister technique on the entire continent. This was oddly an original creation of her's, mind you.

"I'll be wiith you in a little. Make sure you keep this one restrained. Don't let her wake up nor form any hand seals. . .Understand?" The commands are dished towards Baylea, the ghoul she'd certainly expect to heed her commands. After all, Asteroth pretty much held the entity's life right in her hands. It would take a mere thought to end the entity's existence permanently.

That settled, the beautiful sorceress shuffles on off, pushing through the gate and heading to the market place. Due to a certain benefactor, she was pretty wealthy and could purchase every item or tool needed for the processes that were to come. Ignoring the strange looks, Asteroth eventually begins to strut back to her Inn room, carrying an assortment of items or tools..

Chains, whips, scented candles, matches, paint, ink. . . The whole sha-bang. 

They're carried along in a cart, up until the Necromanceress finally ,makes her return. Had Baylea done her damn job, Hanae would still be held in bondage. 

"Ah. . . This is going to be fun, you know? I want to wait until she's woken up, though. .  In the meantime, I'll chain her up and right the ritual along the floor. Sit tight, Asgoth. I'm sure even if you are a zombie, you can gain some enjoyment from the spectacle that's about to be had," the lass instructs while wearing a crazed, devious grin. Her hand wraps around several cans of paint, and casually she begins to spray elaborate symbols along the floor.

They are several rings spawned, each one intersecting to form a singular region, where all of the different points could meet. After wasting several minutes fixing up the flooring, Asteroth moves to set scented candles along each section of the wall. Two for each.

The lights in the room are dimmed, prompting the Zealot to step ahead. 

"Man. . If only there was a church open. This would be a grand display, one that could turn even a non-believer into the a devout follower! Sadly, Miss Asgoth, only you and this fine gentlemen here will be able to witness the glory of Jashin's might. . . " the woman says fanatically, a twinkle evident in her eyes. 

"It's funny. Just a few short months ago, I was just a town gal, living under my wealthy parents. . . And simply practically magic as a hobby. But I knew. . . Once I first encountered this grand diety, I had a higher calling. From the second one of his endearing creatures graced my eyes, I knew that. . . there was something greater out there. And thus, my devotion had began, and for a time I endured great strife for His sake! . . .Then it happened. It occured to me as if in a dream, the ritual in which I could use myself as a focal point to spread His love. . His -GRACE!"

Asteroth declared with a maniacal grin. It wasn't often that she ever got to display not only her admiration of Jashin and his demonic minions, but her envy. . . She tended to keep her true feelings under a tight binding, as to not turn off anyone or deem herself a threat. As the religious entity roared, mana flooded from her form, each of her body being coated with a dark orchid tint of plasma energy. 

It was hard to control, nearly impossible even!

But by the grace of God, the woman managed, while keeping her staffed raised in the air like Moses. In a latin-like dialect, the sorceress chanted out a lengthy incantation, easily stretching on for about eight minutes. And as it passed, the dark mana from her core grew more potent and wild, enough to brew up storm-like conditions even as they remained within the safety of in doors. It doesn't take long for her spiritual might to drift over, running along the glyph or symbols spawned before.

The glyph was like a highway, with the end point naturally being Hanae's body. Like a parasite, every ounce of might that seeped from Asteroth's body before hand would latch around the target's helpless form! Forcibly, it's absorbed through the woman's (Hanae's) pores, and runs along the chakra pathway. 

And by now. . . the helpless damsel likely was awakening.

The sensation was unlike anything she'd ever feel as it was a different type of abuse. Not one meant to target the body or the mind. . . But an assault meant to devestate the spirit specifically. It was akin to having your soul chopped into one-thousand miniture pieces while simultaneously being whipped and scorched with flames. At times, Hanae likely would wish for death, but alas. . . Death was a luxury that she'd no longer be able to afford.

As the energy continued to make way through her chakra circuits, and eventually her soul, all of the mana condensed. This was a complex process that aimed to fuse Demon Energy from the Jashinist Realm --  along side Asteroth's own Necromancer might -- together with Hanae's fragile spirit.

Each second of the procedure was one that stripped her humanity further. In time, the woman's very psyche would find itself being morphed as Asteroth's strange mixture of energy went to perverse her mind's consciousness. For shame, the girl would increasingly find herself losing the ability to care for another soul, or anything really. All that was going to matter now was Asteroth's word -- as it was law.

Of course, all hope had not yet been lost. The magic that had been casted took a time to complete it's fusion. Dark 'flames' clung to Hanae's soul, but steadily worked on making a 'perfect solution.' 

"Praise be to Jashin. . . I would hope that you thank me. It isn't often that someone is blessed with additional power -- from a diety no less! How do you feel?"* - Mon Nov 23 04:07:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) was pleasantly startled. She had anticipated begging and pleading, even cries of anguish. But to her surprise, it seemed that Hanae was tickled pink by the torturous feelings.

As Hanae endured the process, she'd take notice of immediate physical changes. Her pupils had been darkened, nearly pitch black, and the scheleras also gained a shade of gray.

Her skin likely took a slightly blue coloration, and her teeth sharpened partially. It was uncertain how much further these physical changes would go, but as they progressed, so would Hanae's path towards darkness.  "So. . .I believe you are my thrall now, correct?"* - Mon Nov 23 04:46:17 2015

Baylea was being intelligent by feeding Asteroth's ego for sure. "Hrm. .  Patience. I want to continue looking for a good spot to take up my residence.

"You shouldn't roam around these parts alone. There are crazy men and witches out here looking to steal  children, you know. . " With that, the woman shuffles off onward to Konoha.* - Wed Nov 25 19:28:38 2015

A kappa slinks on by. The turtle-esque creature grabs ahold of one of the numerous bodies, and carts it away to the Necromanceress Queen!

Meanwhile, she's chanting, buildingu p the necessary chi to summon a Gulab -- which was basically a giant slime demon. Why? To serve as protection and to store the body. She continues to look on towards the distance with a wicked grin.

"How many precious bodies shall I obtain today. . ?"* - Wed Nov 25 23:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) rubs her hands together deviously as she continued to observe the chaos that roamed just below. Thousands of fresh bodies just sat around, as if for the taking.

"Mmm. . I wonder, of all of these carcasses, which one will be prominent enough to add onto my collection. Hrm. . . Should I even stay this close to this village? Certainly, they'll be suspicious or on high alert. . "

She was practically eating popcorn, and grew giddy at the notion of having such a vast supply to choose from. But alas, the creepy witch had to wait for a more. . . opportune time.* - Thu Nov 26 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) yawns.

She arrives a caravan, clearly pulling along a body bag. It's tossed on over to Baylea's frame. 'Carry it. We're going to bring it on with the rest."* - Thu Nov 26 22:31:40 2015

Once inside her home, she beelines right to the basement.

The door is cracked open eerily, allowing the cold temperatures of the room to creep up. It's chilling for a reason, as to keep her gathering of bodies as well-kept and composed as possible.

After brief period of searching around, the Necromancer eventually pulls up a 5'0 body. It's feminine, and seems to be the carcass of an adult, Konoha-born shinobi. The body is slammed onto the floor for Baylea to feast on.* - Fri Nov 27 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Ohh? - Fri Nov 27 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Soo..good.. - Fri Nov 27 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) seemed numb to the gorey display.

"Put some clothes on, woman. It's unbefitting of a lady."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) boredly could be seen walking south of the shopping district. She had been turning towards the west, each step confident and regal. 

"--Hrm? What is it?" Asteroth replies sharply, as if she other things to be doing.THe blonde twisted, narrowing her gaze onto Abraxas.* - Sat Nov 28 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) rolled her eyes at the response.

"Have a backbone," Asteroth retorted with a sly smirk. She found Abraxas' rebuttal to be both repulsive, and amusing given how submissive or spineless he had been in the initial exchange.

"The heck is wrong with you anyway? . . She asks cautiously..." * - Sat Nov 28 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) wore a placid expression throughout Menma's explanation. She didn't seem at all phased. Routinely, her arms rose, folding among one another.

"Tough.You could just . . .Not owe the favors," Asteroth replied with an irritated huff. 

"The name is 'Asteroth', if you must know," she says, while giving a glance to Menma. There's a five second stare, but no words are traded. Her gaze falls right back onto Abraxas.* - Sat Nov 28 03:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) took note of Menma's sheepish nature. "Huh. . ." She's able to hold back a devious grin, but doesn't speak, as it was hard to juggle two conversations at once.

Dull eyes continued to rest on Abraxas, finding his terrible dilemma to be pathetic, unattractive even. "Pity. Regardless. ..  I hadn't a clue Konoha experienced this much activity. YOu are a shinobi here, correct?"* - Sat Nov 28 03:58:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) seemed to be walking back, this time leaving the flower shop.

She gives Abraxas a mean-mug for even associating with those two hoodlums. "So. . .Friends of your's?"* - Sat Nov 28 04:13:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: And made the deal that I'd owe him if he helped her. - Sat Nov 28 04:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Sat Nov 28 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Oh.. - Sat Nov 28 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: So just a random favor. - Sat Nov 28 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: You're an idiot if you follow through with it. - Sat Nov 28 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: I have no right to refuse what he asks apparently. - Sat Nov 28 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: He said he'd find me if I did. - Sat Nov 28 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: . . Bah. You're so submissive. - Sat Nov 28 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: It's unattractive, you know. - Sat Nov 28 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . .I didn't use to be. - Sat Nov 28 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: But, shit happens. . . - Sat Nov 28 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: And how did you -use- to be? - Sat Nov 28 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Stuck up, stubborn, self contained. - Sat Nov 28 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: But that lead me to be banned from most villages and hated. - Sat Nov 28 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) exhales.

She ponders on continuing the conservation. "And what changed that?"* - Sat Nov 28 04:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Threats, Attacks, Prison, Being Hated. - Sat Nov 28 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: ...So what. .? don't be such a wuss. - Sat Nov 28 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Sat Nov 28 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: I dunno. . . - Sat Nov 28 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'm unsure why I changed. - Sat Nov 28 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Depression set in I guess. - Sat Nov 28 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) held dull eyes.

"Please. . . Change the topic. It's so pathetic, my soul is hurting."* - Sat Nov 28 04:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: What will you do now? - Sat Nov 28 04:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) scoffed at the reply.

"I'm sure you as macho as you need to be when the going gets tough. . " Asteroth says with a snide tone, clearly mocking Abraxas's rebuttal. Right after, a sly chuckle manages to escape her voice box.

She was clearly tickled pink by the apparent lie.* - Sat Nov 28 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) continued to chortle.

Her senses flared for a moment, taken note of the build of up chakra that typically came with the application of handseals.

"-- What's with the handseals? Are you going to show off your cool ninjutsu to sway my opinion?" Asteroth replied sarcastically, obnoxiously batting her eyelashes. * - Sat Nov 28 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's facial features shifted for a moment. It was a surprised expression! Nay, she was clearly impressed, and dazzled by the display. Her eyes were widened for just a moment, and a fanactical grin was sported just for the moment-- But all the same, Asteroth regained composure.

"Mmm. . . Impressive, I must say. Honestly. . " 

She took a careful stride forward, and moved around in circles, eying every inch of Abraxas and the crystal technique. * - Sat Nov 28 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) wasn't trying anything!

She eventually moves full circle, coming near face-to-face with Abraxas. A hand rises in effort to stroke Abraxas' chin, as she thoughtfully gazed forward.

"Tell me. With a skill of that calibar. Why do you fear Sado? That must be the only reason. . . You must fear him. No way you'd allow him to bully you so easily."* - Sat Nov 28 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's eyes had been moving in a frenzy, taking in every feature of Abraxas's face.

Using the grip, she aimed to nudge the boy's head upward, so that their eyes could meet. Naturally, Asteroth remained poised, unphased by the jittery nature of her 'captive.' She also remained ludicrously close, so much that her breath cascaded off of the Kurina's flesh. It was almost as she had been willing to get intimate.

"Oh really? But even then. . .That's just goes to show, what you can do now is the tip of the iceberg. Reall. . . I'd like to see more." The sorceress released her grip, stepping back. Her gaze remained stern, but also seemed somewhat lustful.* - Sat Nov 28 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) wore a coy grin as Abraxas's typically male-response is given.

She had him right where she wanted. "I know I am," asteroth replied arrogantly, clearly self conscious, and quite proud of her own nearly flawless appearances. Obviously, this was a woman that constantly worked to keep up her looks. 

Her skin was fair and soft, blemish free. The dress worn was form-fitting, leaving very little to the imaginatino, but also keeping her decent.

"Adorable. . . Let's go somewhere more open so you can demonstrate." (Grab)* - Sat Nov 28 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) does so.

She turns, moving towards the west. Her hips swayed, giving her a model-like thrut. Given the short distance, it wasn't going to be a long walk. In about ten minutes, she arrives at the local pond and takes a seat, allowing her feet to dip in and dangle within the water.

"Demonstrate the rest of your abilities of course. Y'know, I can sense a great amount of potential in you. I do love to see a man with power," Asteroth admins. Her arms were folded all the same, both eyes trained onto Abraxas as he stood along the edge of the bridge.* - Sat Nov 28 06:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) pouts. She seemed unimpressed all of a sudden.

"Oh. . .So that technique is literally the only one you can do? Pity. . And here I was, thinking you were about to dazzle me. I may have even offered to make you stronger -- Or to help you get stronger, I mean," the sorceress proclaimed, stumbling over her words.

She promptly stood up, and positioned towards the exit.

Of course, no actual movement to it had been attempted.* - Sat Nov 28 07:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) grinned to herself, finding the clear discontent from Abraxas to be endearing, or entertaining in ways.

Still, she kept her arms folded, while listening to the Crystal Release Elemenentalist speak. "Really then? So there is more . . ." Asteroth replied with low hum. She takes a quick step forward, her speed so swift that a gale of wind flushed through the area. Her hair and clothes fluttered, but oddly was held right into place.

Two hands clutch onto Abraxas' collar, bringing him close, their faces lined up. --And just before a potential kiss could be laid, Asteroth's mouth spreads, showing a pleased grin.

"I think I like you. You and I should grow more acquainted with one another sooner or later." She'd lean back, giving Abraxas some personal space -- after all, it wasn't often that a spooky witch was practically smothering you.* - Sat Nov 28 07:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) rolled her eyes at what was deemed cheesy dialogue.

Her hands release themselves. "Well of course the ability influences me. Who would want someone that was nothing? In anycase, I'll be going home for now. . . " She begins again with the model-like strut, but stops just before being out of view.

"--But we should speak again sometime. Maybe over tea." 

With that, Asteroth waltz off to get some shut eye.* - Sat Nov 28 07:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) stares calmly.

"Can I help you, kid?"* - Sun Nov 29 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods.

She smirks, finding the nerve-wrecked mannerisms to be amusing -- but only due to her own arrogance. Always observant, Asteroth can easily feel the other male creeping up behind her. "That I did. I suppose. . It is no issue. What brings you to Konoh--" Stopping short, the blonde manuevers, keeping Tengoku in peripheral vision.

"DON'T SNEAK UP BEHIND ME LIKE THAT! Freaking creep. . ."* - Sun Nov 29 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Sun Nov 29 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: They are all flirting with her too much. - Sun Nov 29 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I should end them now. - Sun Nov 29 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) thinks: Is he....mimicking me..? - Sun Nov 29 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) gives an incredulous and disgustedgaze to Tengoku.

"Well don't sneak up on me like that again, you creep!" the woman said with a shriek. .  She takes a moment or two to recompose her demeanor.

"I wasn't aware Konohagakure had so many shinobi around. . . Good to see. Still, there is no new leader? What a pity."* - Sun Nov 29 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Tch. - Sun Nov 29 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Sun Nov 29 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Sun Nov 29 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shook her head. A hand pressed against Tengoku'schest, hoping to push him away, while moving on back.

"Heaven no. . . I would never. Still, it would be nice to see Konoha actually not be a dump--" Her eyes flick onto Menma, a brow raising at the aggresion. But rather than be alarmed,  she wore a sly smirk, charmed at how defensive the young lad had been over nothing.* - Sun Nov 29 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Hmph. - Sun Nov 29 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: She doesn't even realize I'm here. - Sun Nov 29 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Wynokx) says: Or do you want to fight me? I mean you have a sword out and all.... - Sun Nov 29 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: I'm asking nicely... - Sun Nov 29 02:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Just walk away. - Sun Nov 29 02:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Wynokx) says: No! I'm a Genin of the Hidden Leaf Village! - Sun Nov 29 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Wynokx) says: I should be able to hug anyone I want and be friends with anyone! - Sun Nov 29 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: That's a lie...isn't it? - Sun Nov 29 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: If you're a genin of this Village.. - Sun Nov 29 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Wynokx) says: What's a li- - Sun Nov 29 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Why did you just enter this village? - Sun Nov 29 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Wynokx) says: I was on a mission. Had a delivery. - Sun Nov 29 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: That's a lie. - Sun Nov 29 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: There's no current leader. - Sun Nov 29 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Wynokx) says: So? It was an old mission. - Sun Nov 29 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: No one would've given a mission out. - Sun Nov 29 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Who are you? - Sun Nov 29 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Wynokx) says: I am.... - Sun Nov 29 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: If you lied about that, how can we trust you? - Sun Nov 29 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: How do we know you're who you say? - Sun Nov 29 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Wynokx) says: Because I'm cool! - Sun Nov 29 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Wynokx) says: And not a liar! - Sun Nov 29 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Wynokx) says: I lied to protect you! - Sun Nov 29 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Lying to protect is usually lying to protect your personal interest. - Sun Nov 29 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) flicks her view inbetween Menma and Tengoku.

"Are neither of you. . . shinobi of the village?"* - Sun Nov 29 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Hm? - Sun Nov 29 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Abraxas, how are you? - Sun Nov 29 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Tired. - Sun Nov 29 03:13:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: A tattoo is even less reliable. - Sun Nov 29 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) looks clearly confused.

"What's with that guy? And. . I've just been here and there. This village needs some life breath into it. . " Asteroth says to Abraxas.* - Sun Nov 29 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Meh. - Sun Nov 29 03:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: This might start getting out of hand. - Sun Nov 29 03:38:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Don't you have a village to run? - Sun Nov 29 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Yeah, aren't you supposed to be there? - Sun Nov 29 03:49:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) looked on with a blank expression.

"The hell is going on -- Oh. . I remember you. The guy that kicked me out your village. . ."* - Sun Nov 29 04:05:20 2015
