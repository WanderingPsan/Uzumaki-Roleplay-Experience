Nevertheless, Zero had to be tended to. A string of assignments are given. "Meet up with one of my royal guards -- Yes I have those now. I want you to aid in their set up of traps along the border. . . That way we can catch those that move in restricted areas."

She pauses, as if in debate of whether or not to give Zero the next assignment.

"On top of this. .. I suppose, I'll have you escort one of our local miners to the mines. It's just west of this village. .. Should be a day's travel. They'll be stationed at the gate waiting for you, so finish the first mission first. Then head to that." 

Two standard missions.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||Quickly, Asteroth begins with her daily training sequence.

Before anything can be done, the zealot -- and yes, she was one. . . even if she oft suppressed her fanatical urges -- would descend into a kneel. In the safety of her own home, a detailed statue of her lord and saviour, Jashin, stood tall above all else. Her eyes shut briefly, giving her the time to engage in a lengthy period of prayer. 

It was a deliberately thorough sequence. Before long, Asteroth would have bene completed with the period of devotion. Now? It was time to develop her magic further, to uncover or obtain a greater bond with the beings that sat around in the realm of Jashin. Given enough time, a new set of documents had been delivered, having been sent by the Huevo De Diablo personally. The information was from a sect of Jashinist -- giving details about an ew summoner creature.

Shingo.

Humanoid, and bat-like entities. They could casually transform into Orcs for hand to hand combat, or into bats for speedy travels. Both of these outcomes were advantagous, considering Asteroth often required a creature for flight. With eager eyes, the Necromancer delved into the dusty scroll, her eyes observantly taken in the words and instructions. After taking her staff and wrapping delicate digits around the structure, she closes her eyes. A thick viel or covering of darkk magic inevitably begins to pour out, so much that cracks run along the ground from the forceful and condensed nature.

The floor shook, and given that this was the second story, the roof of the preceding floor quivered as well. It spawned some caution from the help or servants that were almost always in Asteroth's mansion. But of course, none ever dare to step into the room to observe -- lest they have a death wish. That being said, with both eyes closed, the Necromancer is more able to get intune with the natural energies of the universe or world. Her dark magic courses through every energy circuit that existed within the spiritual plane -- and from that, it assaults the space itself.

THere's immediate disruption, forcing distortation and giving the appearance of a large scale of heatwaves running over the area. But it wasn't that, rather. . . It was the space-time contiuum literally being torn asundered. With this, Asteroth's energy can leak in, and forms a union -- or at least tries too -- with a specific creature that rested within the different realm.

Her heart fluttered or palpitated during the sequence. Being within Jashin's land, even if just in thought, left the sorceress in a state of awe, covered in goosebumps. It felt surreal, but right all the same. Nevertheless, the task given wasn't an easy one, despite Asteroth's natural experience as a n accomplished summoner by now. For the next half hour, her mind searched until the imagery of a six-foot, hideous Orc with small bat-wings along it's back came into being. Most would be repulsed, but Asteroth. . . She appeared enarmored, starstruck even.

Cue a few moments of chanting incantations. 

The dark energy combusts finally, releasing a storm of residual plasma power. As it settles, there's the summoning creature that had been so coveted. She rests easy now,. her back against the wooden flooring, and just a smidget of sweat covering her form. 

Before Asteroth could call it quits, she finally goes to practice her resurrecting abilities once more. After all, the beginning stage needed to be mastered if she ever sought to master or refine the ability to an entirely new level. Thus, the Amegakure Queen shuffles off to her secrat lair, bwahahaha! It's freezing, as to help preserve bodies. Of course, there are many carcasses from well-known individuals. But most seem to be from those that lack any significance.

It was from one of these that the woman would practice her art/

With staff in hand, the strange woman goes about several more, loud and foreign chants. These being the incantations required to cast a series of spells. After the lengthy yell, her hand is cladded with the signature, purplish ray of energy. From this, the glowing palm presses against the body's form. Each ray of energy moves along the once inactive chakra pathway, revitalizing and eventually pooling together at the epic centre  -- the stomach. From this, Asteroth now held a degree of unity with the carcass.

From this, she's enabled to rip apart the distinction between this world and hte next -- momentarily bringing back the lost soul. As it stood, however. . .The body was rapidly deteroriating, it's flesh turning into simple dust. It was only a matter of minutes before the deed had been done much to Asteroth's chargin.

Three more test subjects are applied with the skill -- but all eventually die out given enough time.* - Fri Oct 30 03:21:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Very well then. - Sat Oct 31 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If you destroy buildings you get extra points. - Sat Oct 31 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: Good..good..Ignore her. Become one with your thirst for battle! - Sat Oct 31 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) looks to the masked man.

"Hrm?"* - Sat Oct 31 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Pass. I'm watchingm y calorie intake. - Sat Oct 31 01:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: ........... - Sat Oct 31 01:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's hand moves to repel the approach.

"Please. I don't want any," Asteroth says with mild irritation.* - Sat Oct 31 01:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) rebuffs Zero's attempt at giving food again. She hadn't believed it to be poisoned -- it was just  that she honestly was watching her food intake.

"--Shut your mouth and focused on the battle! Ichiro. . . Don't let this scrub show you up! I know you're far more poweerful than this!" the Queen barked, hoping to urge Ichiro to fight with a greater sense of urgency.

She hated to see Nigen win.* - Sat Oct 31 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: The only way to fight is with bloodlust.~ - Sat Oct 31 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) raises her staff, her mouth opening.

But no words escape. Prematurely, she ceases with the actions, as she goes against the initial idea of ending the battle prematurely.

". .I'll give them a few moments more," Asteroth mumbled to herself.* - Sat Oct 31 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shook her head.

She's seen enough. A hand waves through the skies, gesturing for the bout tocome to an end. "I've seen a enough! Good battle, towards the both of you. Moreso to Ichiro -- As for Sado. . . A battle is also striking offensively. Surely, Ichiro proved unable to get past your defenses, but you never gave an offensive effort. Thus, the match goes to him," she declares in a regal manner.

"That said. I'll see who I'll add as my personal guards in the coming days," Asteroth continues. Of course, she has two assistants come to give the two women their reward for the 'bout. That being said,the blonde turns towards the north and begins to walk off.* - Sat Oct 31 01:53:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Were you actually trying to kill me? - Sat Oct 31 02:02:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Oh? The one I gave you? - Sun Nov  1 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Yes. - Sun Nov  1 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Here give me another one. - Sun Nov  1 00:41:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Hrm? Let me see what you can do with it later. - Sun Nov  1 00:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: ........ - Sun Nov  1 00:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: If it's significant, I'll be willing to share more. - Sun Nov  1 00:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Really.. - Sun Nov  1 00:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) kept her arms folded, while retaining the usual scowl.

Just -being- around Nigen was enough to invoke a subtle amount of contempt for her fellow Necromancer.  Of course, the approaching Huevo Del Diablo escorts couldn't quite be ignored. In no time, it seemed over four dozen warriors -- low leveled as they may be - - make their approach.

With a brow risen, Asteroth moves ahead, using her staff as a walking cane. Upon standing front and center, she gives a wave.

". . .Oi. What brings such. . . a large gathering of men to my kingdom?" For now, she doesn't really acknowledge the relic that denoted Sin as a Huevo Rep.* - Sun Nov  1 00:49:04 2015
