<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's face is deadpanned.

She's pretty ticked on the inside, yet knows better than to let her rage get the best of her. . . At least in public. Those scenarios tended to have unpleasant outcomes.

"That isn't funny, you know. . .Where is the runt?"* - Wed Oct 14 23:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) blinks.

Her face scrunches up for just a moment, and her flesh gains a red coloration. This wasn't am expression of being flustered. . . Nope, it was rage. Childish? Perhaps. But anyone who knew Asteroth knew how easily offended or annoyed she got when discussing or hearing particular topics.

Her hair begins to rise on cue, but before the flow of energy can get out of hand, she manages to suppress her strength once more. A hand clutches at Nigen's color. . . Thankfully, she has enough self control to not aim to  inflict pain, as it could end badly.

". . .Not. . . Funny. Stop. It," the blonde demands, teeth clenched.* - Wed Oct 14 23:11:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's mouth twitched into a frown.

She abruptly allows her grip of Nigen's color to be relinquished. "Tch. . . You piss me off. And yes, it would be horrible to be married to someone like you, hmph," the blonde stated with a grunt. Her arms are folded, and she stomps off to the opposite end of the plaza, leaning against the fence and looking onto the area.* - Wed Oct 14 23:22:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||Amegakure had been through quite a bit of changes.

And the most notable? A constant shift in leadership. Months prior, a strange man had routine exploited his wealth, buying out the small village. But. . .As things would have it, having complete control of a village in itself wasn't as entertaining.

Thus, it was Asteroth's time. Given complete control, she walks around as if she owns the place. At all times, there are guards surrounding her form, and a few attendants. 

On this occasion, the dainty woman doesn't even walk. Rather, she's perched on a lavishly crafted platform, carried by built or muscular men. Likewise, the blonde is literally being fanned along the way. After some time, they're upon the public plaza, clearly en route to her private quarters. "Mm. . ? What's happening here?" Both eyes fall onto Lanzi and Elon.* - Thu Oct 15 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) narrows her gaze.

". . .My name, if you must know, is Asteroth. I am the new 'leader' of the village. The title 'Kage'. . . honestly doesn't fit. I suppose the new 'Queen' suffices?" She says, her features softening a tad. 

With a slight rotation, the woman's gaze falls onto Elon. "I see. Well presumably, this gent here is the 'package.' I thank you for returning this male in safe condition. Your services likely are no longer needed," the blonde -- and a tadbit bossy -- female states. Her hand swished through the air, giving a dismissive wave.* - Thu Oct 15 20:32:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) continued to murmur under her breath. For sensory, they could detect a large gathering of energy being pooled along her very form. By now? It was more than ready to be utilized. . . However, she just stares on with those stern, hazel eyes. Would the 'council' member actually try to make this scene escalate further?

Asteroth certainly hoped now.* - Fri Oct 16 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) blinks.

She looks ahead, a brow fidgeting in irritation. "On a side note. . Mr. Council member. You're. . Fucking. . .Fired!" Asteroth declares, clearly butthurt over how much of a pain Xon was being up to this point.* - Fri Oct 16 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) rolled her eyes.

"Funny. I do believe I run the show. . . All 'officials' answer to me," she replies snidely, still clearly sour over Xon's previous, ill manners. Arms folded, she snaps her fingers, calling for her personal carriage. 

"So you'dbest learn. . .  And treat me as the Queen that I am. In the meantime, 'trade agreements' are fine and all, but nothing will be final. Not until I review it, Hmph," the teen stated, as she set snuggly on the carriage.* - Fri Oct 16 20:12:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) narrows her gaze.

Her body is fueled with rage -- Not at Gojiro, but rather a certain 'priest' that dared to spread such foolish rumors. With a reddened face, she shook her head. "No, boy. . . -- However. . ." Cue a moment to breath and exhale. With the release of wind or oxygen, Asteroth seems to steadily be calming down.

"I am the new leader. You recall. . . the speech about money, yes? Well I am behind it all. I'm surprised you're unaware, you're looking at the new Queen of Amegakure. Mmm. . I suppose 'Rain Queen' suffices?"* - Fri Oct 16 22:14:11 2015

"What a barbaric way of thinking. Leadership is not a position that should be chosen best on strength or intimidation. It is all about your state of mind, and charisma," Asteroth states with a scoff. She wore a look of disgust, perhaps making it appear as if she's offended -- and the woman certainly was.

". . And I certainly don't look like a 'normal' woman. In anycase. . . Yes, I am the leader. I suppose you're not just a traveler passing through, no?"* - Fri Oct 16 22:20:09 2015

"On a side note. The curses that you do know, I intend for you to write up documents. I'll be dabbling in them on my own time.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) grunts. She's -- in the meantime -- writing down on a sheet of paper, as if ordering various different items. It sucked not to be a sergeant, however.

"You all can still remain busy. I want the both of you to patrol the borders, and make sure that our citizens are remaining civil. Likewise, I want you to travel to a neighboring village -- northeast of here. Pick up some supplies. It should take twelve hours to travel on foot, so be prepared," she demands, fully in belief that she was a -Queen-. . . While these other two were simple underlings.

Two missions. 

She gives a dismissive handwaves, as if telling them to get to it.* - Sat Oct 17 21:48:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hello, Asteroth-sama. - Sat Oct 17 22:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) blinks. She gives a dull stare, as her hands continue to move, scribbling a series of letters.

"Evening. What brings you here?"* - Sat Oct 17 22:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) gives a glance to the surrounding area.

Briefly, she smirks -- but it fades as soon as it comes. "It's decent. I hate the infrastructure, however."* - Sat Oct 17 22:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shrugs. She remains leaning against the fence.

"There's a lot of money in the vault. I want to redo the entire village. And make this a sanctuary for knowledge. Hopefully, this. . . discourages any violence, or attention from neighboring countries."* - Sat Oct 17 22:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) rolled her eyes.

"Please. You're probably the type that gets off on punishment. In any case. . . Where the heck have you been in all this time? -- Not that I was worried, just curious," Asteroth retorts. She never once lifts her gaze from the sheet, mind you.* - Sat Oct 17 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's brow noticeably perks upon the mention of money. . .

She liked money.

At last, Asteroth's gaze shifts upward, meeting Index's. "I didn't ask -what- you were doing. Although, the fact that you were working on your skill is swell.. . I asked -where- you were. As for the money, yes. This will do me well. . .Where the hell are you even getting this money from?" The sorceress questions, her eyes conveying her curiosity and intrigue.* - Sat Oct 17 22:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's brow fidgeted -- Index would likely register that as a look of annoyance.

"You're being very cryptic. . It annoys me, sure enough. Although, I have no reason to care, I suppose," Asteroth replies, it isn't she was doing anything illegal or shady.

At least not openly.

"How much money do you expect to be brought in?"* - Sat Oct 17 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Huh. - Sat Oct 17 22:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: What're you talking about? - Sat Oct 17 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Don't worry about it. - Sat Oct 17 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: I feel like I should stab him. - Sat Oct 17 22:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Several hundred times. - Sat Oct 17 23:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) smacks Susumo on the side of the head.

"Mind you ow--"

Then her 'hams' are smacked. Whatever that was. Probably buttocks. Instantly, Asteroth's face goes red -- for once due to embarressment. Immediately, her energy flares, briefly revealing dark magic. It's a thick aura, enough to form a gust of wind, and send her clothes and hair fluttering.

On cue, a right hand is dished forward, aiming to punch Bernadotte right on the jaw. "What.  . Did. I . . Tell you about doing that!? I'm this close to having you killed. . ."* - Sat Oct 17 23:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Perv. - Sat Oct 17 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) says: Heh. - Sat Oct 17 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) says: Anyway. - Sat Oct 17 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) says: I have business to attend to - Sat Oct 17 23:22:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: .... - Sat Oct 17 23:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: I wonder how it felt-- - Sat Oct 17 23:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: That's perverted. - Sat Oct 17 23:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||A hand latches onto Bernodotte's arm.

"You may leave. But send over a scroll with the information I require. I expect you to make bi-weekly trips here as well. Understood?"  She's giving a serpent-like gaze, and never once taking the time to blink. After giving the unwavering gaze, she relinquishes her grip, and exhales.

The idiot had an easy time working Asteroth up, from the looks of things.

"Anywho. Millions? That sounds great. . . Estimation of -when- I'll have it?"* - Sat Oct 17 23:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) says: ... - Sat Oct 17 23:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) says: What scroll? - Sat Oct 17 23:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: . . . - Sat Oct 17 23:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) says: What are you talking about? - Sat Oct 17 23:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I really hate you sometime. - Sat Oct 17 23:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Get out of my face. I'll talk to you later. - Sat Oct 17 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: Completely forgot our entire conversation. - Sat Oct 17 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mm.. - Sat Oct 17 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) motions Bern off. His presence was becoming irritating now.

The self proclaimed 'Queen' shifts attention back to Index. "Fantastic. In the mean time, make yourself at home. This village isn't as lively as the ones you've been around in the past month or two. In the meantime, I'll need to go tend to my stupid nephew, and prepare for a business trip."* - Sat Oct 17 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I'm not stupid.. - Sat Oct 17 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) simpered.

"Good. You should go to my home then, prepare a meal. Meanwhile, I'll have to provide some tutelage for this one here. I prefer to teach this baffoon in private."

Baffoon was a term of endearment, at least in Asteroth's dictionary. "Of course. I don't need you to wait up on me this instant. I'll send you letter should you be required."* - Sat Oct 17 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) points off towards  the west.

Her house is logically the largest. A hand presses against Susumu's back shortly after, prompting him to lead the way.

As for Xon, he can turn in his mission completion to NPC Secretary.* - Sat Oct 17 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Any second now.. - Sat Oct 17 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||Shortly after, she arrives at the local training rgrounds. It's south of the main village area, and devoid of any true citizens or interence. Thus, Asteroth is more than capable of actually unwinding.

Had Susumu the ability to sense, he'd able to read one thing clearly -- the woman almost constantly kept her dark energies under wraps. That way, no one would be capable of identifying her nature as a true necromancer, and a practitioner of the dark arts.

There's a thin, yet transluscent aura spawning, as her souled poured out the vast quantities of dark energy.  "Right. . .I'm going to teach you a single dark magic spell. Understand? However, first. . .I want to gauge your combative ability. Hand to hand combat isn't particularly my forte. . . Hell, I can't do well in one on ones. However. . . That's not to say I'm completely useless. Prepare youself, and we'll begin."

She draws a staff, which serves as the focal point for the woman's magic casting. As it's held, the level of her magic grows more unruly, and more unstable -- yet also far more powerful.* - Sun Oct 18 00:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) rolled her eyes, finding the entire battle plan silly.

"Inheriting Shinobi skills? Sickening. . . Makes me debate on really calling you one of my kin," Asteroth replies with a shrug. 

From this, her hand flickers, allowing the large ensemble of dark matter to be dished forward. With ease, they take shaping, into the form of spheres -- five in specific. Each of which indiscriminantly fly forward, piercing through the assortment of different clones.

Of course, as they're struck, more and more dopplegangers are being duplicated. Yet the question remained. . .  Would Susumu truly be struck?* - Sun Oct 18 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||It was unfortunate.

Susumu didn't quite have the capacity needed to perform the two different techniques in complete session. And while the clones continued to move about, Asteroh's ears keened in, picking up on the most subtle of movements.

Although, the screams make it far too easy to tell just where he had been.

Wasting no time, dark magic builds up again, granting the woman the opportunity to properly build up her chi. By the second, her level of potency in terms of magic casting was growing far more dangerous, and refined. At once, using the staff to focus her energies, the elderly Necromancer unleashed another ray of destructive might. Although on this occasion. . . It was meant not to attack, but to serve as a defensive barrier.

Speedily, Asteroth's might seeped through the skies, in the form of several spheres. In the event that Susumu had failed to to evade their range, the plasma energy was quick to spread, encasing the male within a transulecent barrier. Perhaps, considering's it's ethereal nature, it would disallow other m agical properties to seep through -- at least not without breaking the barrier.

"Dark Prison. Another nifty spell that I've picked up. . . Although, I focus far too much on manipulating life and death. So my magic has suffered."* - Sun Oct 18 00:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||The attack would have missed, just as Asteroth was back peddling -- she tended to keep her distance, considering the lack of actual combat skill.

Yet all the same, her mouth broke off into chants. The Curse of Paralysis, an irritating move. . . Yet not quite something Asteroth couldn't deal with. Each second that went by was met with another build up of chakra -- or magic now.

It wasn't going to be long. "Is this all the kid can do? It's unfortunate. . .  He has much to learn. . ." Patient, she stood around, still easily capable of building up more than enough power for the next act.* - Sun Oct 18 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||Breaking the curse would have been too easy.

No, she had to made sure this kid knew where their relationship stood.

At last, the build up of energy comes to an abrupt end. All the particles converge into one area, quite literally ripping up a portal to another world -- The world of lord and savior. . Jashin. Sadly, at this day and age, Asteroth lacked the skill, strength, and general intelligence to conjure the head honcho. Yet. . . One of the underlings would certainly suffice.]

As the energy combusts, a plume of smoke briefly is developed, and as it clears, the monstrosity known as the Kappa King lingers around. It's magnificient, and gigantic -- easily rivalling a common building in terms of sheer mass. Beady eyes glance downward, staring to the male.

And before long, one it's appendages slashes forward, aiming to slam against Susumu and pin him to the ground. "Evening. . .I would like for you to become acquainted to my ace summoning. King Kappa. . . Leader of the Kappas that linger within the Realm of God. Second only to the Queen. You should give, I've seen what you can offer so far, and I'm not impressed."* - Sun Oct 18 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||And that's all she wrote.

On cue, the Kappa keeps the boy pinned to the ground, much to Asteroth's delight. Due to the intereference, there isn't a doubt in her mind that she's now free to move at her leisure.

Casually, she prances on over, looking to the defeated, less experienced Necromancer. "Oi. In any case. . I am willing to teach you a single move to give you a legitimate offensive option. Luckily for you, it requires no incanations -- assuming you can gain enough skill. Understand? You've seen it before, Idub it the 'Dark Spear' technique," Asteroth notes. SHe gestures for the Kappa King to step back, giving Susumu more than enough room to breath and operate.* - Sun Oct 18 01:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Alright.. - Sun Oct 18 01:50:30 2015

"Right then. . . This is a basic dark magic spell -- something I feel everyone should have in their repetoire. I'll guide you through this, step by step. So get into a meditative stance," she demands, using the hilt of her staff to wack Susumu on the side.

Impatiently, Asteroth looked ahead, hoping that the young Necromancer followed her lead. 

"This is a pure and basic dark magic spell. Thus, you have to be able to manipulate your dark energy specifically. Focus on forming a viel of magic around your form, and maintain it. It isn't to be unruly, it's to flow like an elegant stream, inspite of it's chaotic nature. You understand me?" The instructions were easier said than done, but Asteroth had nothing but faith that Susumu would be able to do as he was told.

"If need be, even use incantations to help focus. Get this done quickly, as I have other things to do for the day. Once I can teach you this skill, I'm heading off to do some independent training, and speak with the Huevo," the 'Aunt' declared, her voice somewhat snide and demanding. What a horrible attitude to sport. As Susumu presumably went to work, she takes a seat on the grass, possessive eyes being trained onto the teen's form.* - Sun Oct 18 02:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) meditated through this all.

As Susumu worked so hard, building up and maintaining the energy requried to go about and performing the basic Dark spell -- Dark Spear. . . Asteroth was hard at work, practicing the processes needed to refine and master her own abilities.

The ones in question? Was again with the summoning spell.

Repeatily, dark magic or mana flowed into the skies, attacking the very fabric of space and time itself. Ripples could be seen manfiesting along the air waves, eventually forcing open partial portals to different worlds. Thankfully, there were no sensors around, and thus not a soul would be capable of picking up on the change in the surroundings.

The last thing she wanted as to be outted as a Necromancer to the world. That would put a giant hamper on the woman's secret agendas, and overall plans. Even if they were going to take years to complete, or years to even begin. . .  Being incognito was key. With a yawn, she opens her eyes, glancing ahead as Susumu seemingly had innate talent in the spells application. "Good. . Good. It seems talent doesn't only run through my blood. What's next is simple. . I want you to manipulate the flow of your energy, dividing it into five."

"Once that is done. . Work on manipulating each of the seperate spears. . sharpening it's edges. If you can get that done, the rest will be a cinch, as it's merely sending the attack forward to pierce your opponent. It's like controlling regular Kunai -- if you're aware of what that is. A shinobi weapons."

Demonstrating personally, chakra comes from out of nowhere, and is formulated into projectiles. They move with swiftness, piercing right through a tree with ease.* - Sun Oct 18 02:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) looks ahead as the poorly formed spears move. They barely pierce through the trees.

". . .I take the comment back. You're too lazy. Keep at it. Focus, and block off all world distractions, understand?" Asteroth instructs, this time providing her utmost attention to Susumu and his own development.* - Sun Oct 18 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) yawns.

She stands up, and begins to shuffle off.

"I have a village to go run now. You take that skill, and master it. -- But don't go around spamming it," She notes, having heard of Susumu's previous exploits back in the shinobi villages.

Meaning. . . the act of using his Curse Paralysis again and again. She was honestly shocked that he hadn't been murdered yet, for being a Necromancer. "-- Oh. One last thing. Which god do you worship?"* - Sun Oct 18 03:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: . . . - Sun Oct 18 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Answer me. Do you not worship any? - Sun Oct 18 03:38:01 2015
