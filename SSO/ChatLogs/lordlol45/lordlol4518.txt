<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Did Akira leave Suna yet? - Sun Nov 29 07:06:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: You mentioned 'mansion.' So I made the assumption. - Sun Nov 29 07:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Well me and Z are trying to make this village not so shitty so I guess you an call us Hokage - Sun Nov 29 07:12:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Shall we go master? - Sun Nov 29 07:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) looks over to the young gal.

"Y'know. Vandalism is bad. . " Asteroth notes.* - Sun Nov 29 07:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Masterrr.. - Sun Nov 29 07:25:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ishi(Prince122) says: Is this a joke? - Sun Nov 29 07:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: I was hungry, and he wanted to play. - Sun Nov 29 07:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: He wouldn't stop screaming and calling me sexy and beautiful. - Sun Nov 29 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: He said he really wanted me to pleasure him.. - Sun Nov 29 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: So I did, as you can see. - Sun Nov 29 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Towards the end he started spazzing out.. - Sun Nov 29 07:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) followed Baylea from the village's square to her home. She kept herself pre-occupied along the way, keeping an eye on her nails, as if checking from dirt that could have gotten stuck underneath there. Before long, the two had reached the basement, where Asteroth's personal ghoul could easily display the gruesome scene.

Akira's body laid there limp, covered in bloood, and partially eaten.

"Mmm, beautiful. But sloppy. . .Did anyone see you move off with him? Also, how did you get him to stay put during the torture?"* - Sun Nov 29 07:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Tied him. - Sun Nov 29 07:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: I was going to get a cheese grader. - Sun Nov 29 07:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: And rip his skin off.. - Sun Nov 29 07:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: But he couldn't handle much. - Sun Nov 29 07:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: And you did, earlier. - Sun Nov 29 07:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: I walked past you. - Sun Nov 29 07:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: And he allowed himself to be died up? - Sun Nov 29 07:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: I knocked him out. - Sun Nov 29 07:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: After making him throat up and cough up blood with a punch. - Sun Nov 29 07:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: My. . A weakling. - Sun Nov 29 07:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Eyes taste good. - Sun Nov 29 07:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) rubs her chins, before resting a hand onto Baylea's head.

"Although, this pleases me. Lord Jashin will bless you for this deed."* - Sun Nov 29 07:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: R-Really? - Sun Nov 29 07:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: I plan to get more toys. - Sun Nov 29 07:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: And do the same - Sun Nov 29 07:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: -- Be careful. We don't need to inspire the attention of the village. - Sun Nov 29 07:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Invoke* - Sun Nov 29 07:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: I know. - Sun Nov 29 07:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I'll better be able to spread Jashin's will if we keep things. . . Civil. - Sun Nov 29 07:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: i'm on the prowl for powerful shinobi, however. - Sun Nov 29 07:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: I see. - Sun Nov 29 07:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: If you find any. . Bring them to rather than mindlessly kill. - Sun Nov 29 07:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Oh. - Sun Nov 29 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Alright. - Sun Nov 29 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: The 'Hokage' in particularly is a point of interest. - Sun Nov 29 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: If I can control them. Then I can control the village, no? - Sun Nov 29 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Yes. - Sun Nov 29 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Is this all? - Sun Nov 29 07:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Yes. - Sun Nov 29 08:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: What should we do with the mizukage? - Sun Nov 29 08:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Hrm? Save it for another meal. - Sun Nov 29 08:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Alright. - Sun Nov 29 08:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gan Ning(Ellthestrange) says: Asteroth just activated Dark Bringer: This character has amplified prowess with their Dark Arts, making them double in effectiveness against a heroic/good-natured opponent.  A Tier 1 perk. - Sun Nov 29 08:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hey.. - Sun Nov 29 22:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Do you happen to know where.. - Sun Nov 29 22:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ignores.

She turns and waltz on home.* - Sun Nov 29 22:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: The leader of this village is? - Sun Nov 29 22:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: ... - Sun Nov 29 22:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: H-..hey.. - Sun Nov 29 22:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) would have continued, up until the fence had been reached.

"Don't know."* - Sun Nov 29 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: ... - Sun Nov 29 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Oh well.. - Sun Nov 29 22:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: Tch..damn whore didn't even reply to my message.. - Sun Nov 29 22:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shrugs.

"Not my issue."

With that, the blonde continued in stride, moving beyond the gate and entering her home. She had business to attend to, after all.* - Sun Nov 29 22:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: MM. . - Sun Nov 29 22:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Eh? - Sun Nov 29 22:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: So we meet again? - Sun Nov 29 22:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You shouldn't stand in the middle of the walkway, someone might bump into you. - Sun Nov 29 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Hrm? Hello. . What happened? This village feels emptier. - Sun Nov 29 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: W-Well.. - Sun Nov 29 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: A lady named...Kana...a-attacked with her people earlier. - Sun Nov 29 22:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: Maybe they're sl-- - Sun Nov 29 22:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: . . .And why would she do that? - Sun Nov 29 22:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: I'm...not s-sure. - Sun Nov 29 22:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Pity. . Whatever. Not my problem, it'll be something for the 'Hokage' to deal with. - Sun Nov 29 22:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Anyone of relevance that got hurt? - Sun Nov 29 22:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: U-Uh...That girl that c-called you 'Master'... - Sun Nov 29 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: She got hit b-by this dragon made of w-water....And got her lower half ripped o-off before being dragged away... - Sun Nov 29 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Oh. That's all? - Sun Nov 29 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) thinks: Stop stuttering Dammnit! - Sun Nov 29 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) thinks: Take a deep breath.. - Sun Nov 29 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) thinks: Focus... - Sun Nov 29 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Y-Yes Ma'am. - Sun Nov 29 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) thinks: You did it again! - Sun Nov 29 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) twisted her lips with partial discomfort. 

"Hng. It's like there's an otherworldly entity that gets joy on shitting on my life. It's hard to find good servants. . ." Asteroth complains, as if more hurt that she lost a good minion, rather than feeling sympathy over Baylea's demise. It was just a ghoul, after all..* - Sun Nov 29 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) wrinkles her nose.

"I don't, I'm skeptical. People tend not to be as trustworthy as they proclaim. Tell me, what can you even do?"* - Sun Nov 29 22:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) scratches her head. She's clearly on the fence.

"Can I see a demonstration? Anyone can realistically use a sword or even practice elemental techniques -- But are you good?" That's all the sorceress wanted to know. She looked on with a scrutinizing gaze, eyes narrowed.* - Sun Nov 29 23:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) folded her arms, observing as Menma went to demonstrate his above-average swordsoman ship.

Her sensory ability, while faint, could vividly pick up the dense flow of chakra that emanated from his form. It was claerly manipulated, transformed into the dangerous element of Raiton, the light illuminating and just partially gathering Asteroth's attention.

Each slash was enough to effortlessly cut through the wood like butter. But what more, her senses flickered, taking note of the miasma of hatred that flowed from the young Uchiha's form. It clumped heavily, damn near becoming palable or tangible. But rather than being unsettled, Asteroth's hair stood up on the back of her neck, and smile being forced right onto her features.

"Mmm. You aren't too bad, I think you can actually become great. . . Against my better judgement, I'll consider you. I suppose your first payment will be a meal?" She did recall that Menma often battled hunger-- or so he says.* - Sun Nov 29 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: I wonder. . Would this mke him easier to manipulate or would his hatred make him resistant? - Sun Nov 29 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nodded then.

"Good. Allow us to go to a restaurant, I'd suppose. . " She's step off, moving beyond Menma seamlessly. Each step is one of confident, her hips swaying subtly from left to right, as if the woman was walking along the runway. Just above her bomb was a compact wooden stick -- the significance not particularly apparent. That said, Asteroth continued up until a local restaurant had been reached.

"What do you want. . .?. . ."* - Mon Nov 30 00:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) before taking a seat, she takes out a handkerchief, and wipes down the table and chair. It's good to be mindful of germs.

Surprisingly, there are still people that are willing to live in Konoha -- namely, one of the store's employees. She calls on over, and makes a modest menu.

"Vegetable ramen for me. Get the boy Miso -- and a side of something sweet. Maybe dumplings or doughtnuts?" Asteroth replied sharply, seeming to demand rather than ask. Her eyes settle onto Mena once more. 

"Right. What inspired you to stay in Konoha again?"* - Mon Nov 30 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||
The uncomfortable manner in which Menma simply sat pleased Asteroth greatly, as it made her feel as if she were still in power.

"Alright. . . Then you shall work for me. I don't recall your name, but regardless. . .You'll find that being a subordinate of mine will greatly benefit your own goals. Tell me, from what Ican gather -- all you desire is power? That's a noble and logical end-goal. Although, if you'd want me help to achieve this, I'll just need a little trust."* - Mon Nov 30 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Alright then. We can train together soon. - Mon Nov 30 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: T-Thanks A-Asteroth-sama.. - Mon Nov 30 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I may have a few remedies.. - Mon Nov 30 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: To help draw out latent power. - Mon Nov 30 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: That is, if you can trust me. - Mon Nov 30 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Latent...power.... - Mon Nov 30 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov 30 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: So close..~ - Mon Nov 30 07:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: ??? - Mon Nov 30 09:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) kept her arms folded, with a subtle -- almost not even there -- scowl. She stared, saying nothing for several moments. At Asteroth'sside was a staff, that seemed to be retractable, and tied to her side.

"No. Just stopping by. What have you done for Konoha anywho? Not a whole lot has been getting done from what I've observed."* - Mon Nov 30 09:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) drifts her visage to the roof. Her cranium does a long, deliberate examination of the area, before almost serpently-like eyes set back onto the curved Hokage. Not once did Asteroth's facial expression change -- she seemed to be habitually serious.

"Funny. You sure are taking the role of politician accurately. . Always with the excuses," the sorceress said, almost toying.

"If you don't have anyone. . Find people."* - Mon Nov 30 09:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) was a bitch. But she seemed to be a bit more. . . snappy towards Rias for whatever reason.

Her brows jolted up, with a subtle scoff. There's a cutesy tone to her words by now, and they seem civil -- superificially so. "Ah. I'm sure things really are easier said than done. . .Mmm. Soo tell me, Konoha has proven to be a bore. Once you can get a decent foundation, do yo uhave any events planned? I do enjoy some entertainment. . "* - Mon Nov 30 10:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||Of course, the good for nothing thrall only -half- did her job.

Asteroth remained by the gate, legs folded over one another, and a neatly dusted chair leaning against the wall. Konoha, in all of its chaotic's nature, seemed to lack proper guards, making the sequence possible. The wind swayed elegantly, forcing her golden locks to fluttered to the right in recoil. It was a surreal scene, almost synthetic really -- very much like like a scene you would observe in common animation or fiction.

Despite the drafty nature of the village, Asteroth's clothes never once seemed bothered. Only the bottom moved really, and the motions made it appear as if her decency was going to be compromised, as if prepared to flash undies and the likes -- naturally this never comes to fruition.  . .Seriously, you'd think she wasconmtrolling this all with her mind.

Before long, Zenaki and Hanae's visage was made apparent. ". . Oh. A friend of Hanae's? What brings you to this village." All of the sorceress' attention is directted solely to  medic. She was the only one awake, after all.* - Mon Nov 30 11:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) held onto her walking stick.

She gives a glance to Zenaki -- a brow twitching in aggitation. ". . .Hey. . .Don't you hear me talking to you bi--. . . I mean, lovely woman. . " Asteroth retorted with some clear aggitation. She'd await a response, while uttering some incantations. .. * - Mon Nov 30 11:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||
And it was already over.

By now, the night had settled in, meaning most citizens were already asleep. "Gintee!' The final word of the incantation is blurted out, this time with a screeched. At once, Asteroth's mana -- that had was previously undetectable -- was now blaring full force. A dark, purplish cloud of energy rushed from her form, targeting the very fabric of space and time. It distorted the wind, and prompted a strong gale to sweep throughout the area.

As the gale settles, each layer of dark, dastardly mana that had spawned the symptons combusted. A light overcomes the area, and as it clears? There stood a towering beast. . .

The Gulab Jamun. A slimey, tentacle-bearing monstrosity. Syrup solution oozed from it's form. . . and with a subtle step, it moves forward. ". . .Pretend like you don't hear me now, woman. . "* - Mon Nov 30 12:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's mouth twisted into a nasty scowl.

She didn't like Zenaki's lack of response. . .Nor the clear defiance. "Oi. . . Hanae didn't tell me her friends were such bitches. Give me your babies, you're coming with me. Of course, you can just resist, and things just get a lot worse for all of us. . " Asteroth said with very clear displeasure.

Of course, the aura that came from Zenaki's form was unsettling as could be. If anything, this just lowered what little conscience the Necromanceress possessed -- thiswasn't a good person, why did it matter?

". . .Make it quick."* - Mon Nov 30 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||

Wrong answer.

Without another question, the tentacle beast acts right on Asteroth's command. She gives a gesture of the hand, prompting the demonic creature to whip it's exceptionally fast tentacles forward. You guessed it, two of each were beelining right towards the babies to snatch them up.

Assuming success, the children were now within the Gulab's slimey mits.

Following up, only in the event of acheving the goals, the creature lunged forward, intent on opening it's maw and swallowing up Zenaki. If she was unable to evade, the woman was subsequently held in captivity within the gelatin's jelly-like belly. 

Meanwhile, Asteroth just looked on with a perked brow. "Mmm. . ."

* - Mon Nov 30 12:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) |||
Resistance was futile.

With an agile leap, Asteroth was ontop of the beast, riding it like a trusty stead. Into the night the foursome goes. It doesn't take long for the creature to burrow underground, and reach the Necromancer's base of operations.

Unfortunately. . being her house.

It's a relatively cozy place, although there's an omnious aura that lingers within the spooky home. With another gesture, Asteroth motions the slime creature forward -- pushingi t right into her basement. The crying babies are kept on the upper levels.* - Mon Nov 30 12:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||
Once within the safety of her basement, Asteroth delivers yet another order.

Essentially, the Gulab was ordered to vomit Zenaki out. And so it does.

With some manipulation of it's gelatin form, the dainty medic is spat out, causing her body to rush through the air and slam against the floor. Naturally, being ingested by a slime creature left her body. . . less than sanitary. Thick, gooey residue clung to her body, the consistency not much like syrup.

It was as if she hopped into a giant tub of sticky, muscus-filled saliva. Not to mention it reaked of a horror stench. Boredly, the necromancer just looked ahead, arms folded.

"Right. .. Are you going to cooperate now?"* - Mon Nov 30 12:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) narrowed her gaze.

"Woman. . Open your fucking mouth, before I open it for you. . ." the Necromancer warns, her tone absolutely oozing with venom. It's clear that Asteroth possessed the power to make good on her threats.* - Mon Nov 30 13:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's brow twitched.

Zenaki was -really- being irritating. . So much that there was some murderous intent sprawling out from the beauty's form. But alas, Hanae had spoken kindly of the medic --certainly she had some skills worth while, no?

The basement was cold to the touch, it was like she kept this as an underground cellar to maintain a vast storage of ice cream. Along the walls were various tables, with strange body bags layered ontop. Clearly, the woman had worked on less than normal experiments or hobbies on her down time.

Still, wordlessly, Asteroth turned,going into her drawer. Initially, the sounds of clanking metals could be heard. Unsurprisingly, this leads to the reveal of various metal tools -- steel chains, pliers. . .and nails. "Right then. . . You're going to tell me precisely of your skillset. Next, you're going to get onto your knees and place your hands into the air so that I can bind you. Understood?"

The tone, while passive, also was clearly demanding. She wasn't going to take no for an answer. . * - Mon Nov 30 13:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) wrinkles her nose.

"I'm adding more minions to my ensemble. . I have big plans. Of course, it'll be hard if i keep having to deal with hard-headed whores such as yourself. . . Now do as I say. . " the chains are slung aroun in a circular fashion.

As reference, the Gulab is still alive and well, right behind Asteroth.* - Mon Nov 30 13:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's narrows.

"I ask the questions here. Do as I say, and explain your skill in detail . ."* - Mon Nov 30 13:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Unfortunate. I like to ask questions. Can you answer my question please? I woould like to know more about my new boss. - Mon Nov 30 13:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) sighs.

She wasn't going to take any of this -- as it painted the picture that Zenaki had any say. The tentacle creature from before shoots out it's appendages, aiming to hold the weakling in place. Assuming success? Asteroth was on the move.

First the ankles were targetted, with chains being used to tether the woman to the ground. . .  

". . .Bah, don't worry. . .I have theraputical skills. . . I'll iron out your insurbordinance completely given enough time. . . " Cryptic words. Asteroth spoke confidently too, as if she had some secret method to work out any of Zenaki's willingness to resist. 

Did the Necromancer get the job done to this point?* - Mon Nov 30 13:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) exhales.

"You ask a lot of damn questions. . .I can see how the two of you could be deemed friends. Hanae claims you hold medical skill-- the skill of which I do not know. For your sake, it better be good. Or I'll just kill you," Asteroth retorts with a shrug.

And so it seemed, Zenaki was effortlessly chained.

The Necromancer moved now, lighting candles and placing them at eight different points of the room. THe distance between the points seem to be evenly measured, and hold the same distance. Once the scented candles are in place, the dark magic practitioner manuevers, painting or placing ink-based glyphs along the ground. . .

Each of the symbols are clearly being charged with some energy source as the Necromanceress prepared for yet another possession.* - Mon Nov 30 13:59:40 2015

Everything was going as according to plans.

A geneticist right within her mitts? And what more, not a soul knew that Zenaki was actually chained up within Asteroth's basement. In no time, the preparations had been completed, leaving the beaut of a woman completely vulnerable. Asteroth stood at the front, holding a bible right infront of her face. "I suppose then. . .I will bless you as well with the highest honor of Jashin. Indeed, just a small portion of my own strength, along with 'His' will be melded into your own!"

A wick grin sprung to life, alongside a dastardly aura.

The strength was more than enough to send the room spiralling with unruly air currents. "You shall be born again!" Without further ado, Asteroth was chanting, her lips repeatily uttering odd, foreign incantations. The dialogue was straight out of a cheap, japanese horror.

It doesn't take long for the dark energies from the symbol to legitimately leak out, each inch communing along the epic center that wasZenaki. The dark mana seeped beyond her pores, and targetted the woman's very soul. Slowly, the outburst of ethereal of was literally melding with Zenaki's veyr being, eliminating what little humanity she possessed. 

The process was perhaps the worse type of torture, as it gave the impression that her spirit was literally being dragged through the sun. It burned. . Oh god did it -burn-, given that the sequence to corrupt a soul was a very deliberate and thorough process. For close to half an hour, the Necromancer worked, before deeming enough time spent.

In the end, Zenaki's flesh was tinted a shade of blue. In addition, her pupils gained a pitch of blackness, and of course. . . She was now enthralled, assuming her own weak spirit didn't aid in resistance. 

". . .In anycase. Was that the full detail of your skillset? If so. . .I'm content, but I'll want to keep you here. Although, you'll need to gain a different look. . "* - Mon Nov 30 16:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) watched the extravaganza with pleasant eyes.

It was like a motion picture movie, all for her own private enjoyment. The icing on the cake? Zenaki's cool and stoic demeanor had been essentially stripped from her person. She was now a groveling fool, clearly aiming to appease her new master as the mind control settles in.

Asteroth's small hands are held forward, secrating additional mana to manipulate the energy that had been essentially planted within the medic's spirit. For now and forever -- unless a priestess could cleanse her soul in time. At the flexing of her mind controlling ability, Zenaki would again feel an uncomfortable, burning sensation lingering from within. The pain certainly would do well to help deter any insubordination -- if there was any still available.

"Ah. . .Good. So this was a success. A medic and genjutsu practitioner, this'll be swell. So tell me, what else of note should you explain to me? I don't want anyone finding you in Konoha . . If you have any radios, any seals, let it be known now."* - Mon Nov 30 23:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) tilted her head with mild intrigue.

"Oi. I have money, so that's good. Tell me, what is the extent that your 'geneticist' prowess have gone? Have you performed any significant experiments? If so, I have some carcasses that may be of intrigue to you," the Necromanceress explains.* - Mon Nov 30 23:46:46 2015

Given that the mind control processes had essentially been handled, Asteroth turns and proceeds off. "Wait here. And be prepared to explain those seals on your body in complete detail," the blonde demanded.

With a model-like gait, she'd exit the house, making rounds to the local shops --to get 'beauty enhancing tools.' Things like dye, make up, eyeline, and so forth. To get away with actually holding a presumably prominent member of Sunagakure hostage, Zenaki's entire look would have to be changed, as to avoid people recognizing her.

In no time, the blonde would return, sporting each of the items, along with different clothes. Asteroth returns to the basement. . . "Alright. Now. . Which color hair do you prefer. . ?"* - Tue Dec  1 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shook her head.

"Red it is! I do like the color red. ."

A hand snatches through the skies, grasping at Zenaki's collar. The woman is essentially dragged off to the bathroom, her head pushed forward into the sink.

THe dye is casually being applied, running over every inch of the medic's hair follicles. It'd burn, but certainly the pain wasn't going to be overwhelming. Slowly, the white tint that Zenaki usually sported was being washed away, and drenched in red. ASteroth gave a glance out of the door, content now that the babies were shutting their damn traps.

"Alright. . Hrm. . How else am I going to change your look?" the sorceress asks, taking steps back to take a seat. "Wash out the dye."* - Tue Dec  1 00:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) looks on, pleased with the change of color. 

"Good. Now. . Sit still." With that, the woman proceeds to apply make-up onto the medics form, holding to obscure her usual look and to ensure that no one would recognize her.

"Alright. Change your clothes, then we can finally step out. Isuppose to do what you do, you'll need a lab of sorts, yes?"* - Tue Dec  1 01:08:41 2015

Dust and cob-webs was in abundance, clinging onto the walls and roofs.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) had been walking ahead, using her magical staff as a walking cane.

Almostl ike second nature, the second Zenaki stepped onto the scene, Asteroth ad been made aware. Solely due to the authorative link that the Necromancer now sported over the red-head, Asteroth is enabled to detect an approach on pure instict.

A smile crept onto her face, creepy and oozing with sinister intent.

Pleasantly, the magic caster finally proceeded to speak. "Ah, good evening, my pet. How goes your stay in Konoha~". . Yes, a bit more chipper than usual. But this is how the sorceress viewed all of her pets-- with affection. And given that Zenaki was now being transformed into a half demon, the change in demeanor was to be expected.* - Wed Dec  2 08:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) snickered, finding the response amusing in itself.

"Endearing-- Tell me. Have you been keepin up with your children? Although it's not ontop of my agenda, I do believe it's better if we keep them alive, rather than dead. . After all, you spent nine long months lugging those lesser beings around. . . " A glance is given, eying Zenaki's own flabby phyisque that certainly persisted from the pregnancy.

As usual, the superficial, would-be Lich Queen, found this as a source of pleasure. "It certainly shows. . .I suppose. . . Not everyone is fortunate to retain their looks for ever. . .Unlike me. . ." After relishing in her own beauty, the blond paces forward, resting a hand onto the red-hair's chin, bringing the effective slave to eye-level. The topic switches back, returning to the children."

"Besides. . .They may have a higher calling," Asteroth said cryptically. A hand rose, covering her mouth as she sheepishly chuckled at her own insider joke.

Oh, the plans she had for the kids.

"I believe, Lord Jashin may have a higher calling for them. . ." There's a subtle flare in her eyes, as it dilating at the possibilities. With the end of the comment, the Necromanceress' mana levels briefly fluxuate from the excitement. The thickness, and intensity was enough to force a physical manifestion of purple or orchid energy, not much unlike plasma. And it stunk. . .A rancid, sinister 'stench' flushed from it's form, likely to make even the most faint of sensors nauseous.

"What do you think of that. . Dear?"* - Wed Dec  2 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||
The glare doesn't even phase Asteroth.

In fact, it -amuses- her! Greatly in fact. . . After all, Zenaki was an essential thrall, what power could she have to overcome the increasingly more powerful Necromancer. 

"Well aren't you as cute as a button. . . Do you really feel that you have a choice in the matter? Look at yourself. . Your skin is shifting, and your soul is literally being transformed. . . 'Into what?' you may ask. . .Well, into a demon, hun. -MY- Demon, no less. . .  Soon, you'll be begging to do the smallest task to gain my affection or approval. . "

Another glint in her eyes appear, and just like the last, her mana flares.

It induces the control that had been previously implanted within Zenaki's spirit. At once, she could feel her soul being overheated, or incinerated even-- Solely as punishment so that Asteroth could put the pet in her place. In addition, manipulation of the mind is put into effect, easily stripping Zenaki of her will, and of course making her susceptible to agreement.

"Now then. . . Let's try this again. Will you be aiding me in performing Jashin's work onto your children?" She says with a sly grin while turning about face. With a provocative strut, the beaut begins off, snapping her fingers to beckon Zenaki forward, as if the woman was more of a shitzu than an actual human.

"Come. To the house."* - Wed Dec  2 08:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) continued with her strides, though stops once she was down the block from her home.

". . .There's this nagging feeling. I can feel some resistance. . . And well, while it's fun to watch my prey fight, it's also irritating. What I seek is control, understood? So respond next time with a 'Yes Mistress'. . .Or something of the like. -- Instead, do it now," Asteroth demands, her tone calm and as eloquent as could be.* - Wed Dec  2 09:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods.

It wasn't long until they had reached the doors. With a gloved hand, Asteroth pushes through, with Zenaki no doubt following shortly after. There's an arrogant smirk to her features, as the demeaning title is uttered.

"That feeling in your body. . .In time, you'll learn to just accept it. Perhaps, you'll even love the sensation-- the dark energy that runs through your blood. Now then. . . Let's go see about these kids. . ." Where were they?* - Wed Dec  2 09:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) folded her arms once she had actually managed to enter the room.

She goes, leaning against the table, the grin from before being evaporated. "Ah. . .There goes --" Asteroth is awestruck, mostly at how shameless Zenaki could be.

For a moment, the modestly endowed woman looks on, envy apparent -- considering how unnaturally large and perky Zenaki's mammaries seemed to be. It was this moment, the typically stoic and in-control woman loses her cool, red-flushing ove her face. She's both angry, envious and disgusted. . . It wasn' right for a woman to be so shameless!

"--Get some regular food, heathen! And keep yourself covered, I didn't ask for you to show off. . . !" The witch declared with a scowl. * - Wed Dec  2 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: to amsterdam yes :p - Wed Dec  2 09:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) averted her gaze.

For a moment, her fist clenched, and the burning sensation from before was begin ning to make itself evident within Zenaki's body-- But alas, the medic spoke sensibly.

The children needed their nutrition. Yet, a point still had to be made.

"Watch your town, wench. I'll give you a single warning. . .Regardless, yes. Continue to nurse your children. In time, I'd want to begin running tests on them once they're of age. Y'see. . .I am not fully human -- I'm merely have human. It's for this reason that I possess my abilities. The question remains, could my own strength be implanted into infants? What if I could make them into Necromancers. . .In my image."

The idea was certainly appealing.* - Wed Dec  2 10:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nodded.

She no longer wore the jovial or amused expression from before. Asteroth slowly regressed back into her stern, stuck-up and bitchy persona. "Precisely. I'm not of your. . ilk. . . Unfortunately, I can't fully be of an entirely different race yet. I hail from the Huevo, assuming you know the organization. It's where I learned the basics of my ability. . Tell me, does my power intrigue you?"

The mage said, taking a step forward-- seemingly unphased by Zenaki's jugs shamessly being out in the breast feeding. Odd, given how easily flustered she was before.
* - Wed Dec  2 10:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) rolled her eyes.

"Trust me, no one has powers like my kind. . .Regardless, yes. That is the plan. Do you oppose?" the Necromancer questioned with a toothy grin. Clearly, this was in reference to the children.* - Wed Dec  2 10:26:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) goes to clench at Zenaki's collar. She pushes, likely thrusting the woman into the closet behind!

A mean scowl is worn. "I'm not afraid of some red-headed bimbo! I just don't trust your ability. I doubt some whore like you is as good as she says. . "* - Wed Dec  2 11:36:19 2015

Cue painful application of the curse.

"Shut your mouth."* - Wed Dec  2 11:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) simpers.

She goes to take a seat on her mattress and files her nails. "You're sorry. . .?" Asteroth says, gesturing for a continuation. . * - Wed Dec  2 11:47:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) awakens after a long night of slumber.

Thankfully, Zenaki had apparently remained by her side. "Evening."* - Wed Dec  2 22:00:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) stretches, while working out the rust.

A finger flicks the red-head on the forward. "I greeted you, maggot. . ." That said, Asteroth turned to get herself together. Y'know, usual things like brushing teeth and taking shower. As she goes, the door is knocked out.

Wordlessly, she gestures for Zenaki to go get it -- though not after ensuring that she wasn't recognize-able from Sunagakure.* - Wed Dec  2 22:13:45 2015

Given the two's lengthy chat, Asteroth is capable of doing her daily business. The shower head is shut off, and in three minutes time, the woman exits. She sports an eerily similar dress, and a toweling is wrapped around the top of her hair.

It was odd, even without make-up, she appeared nearly the same, a testiment to how much effort was put into taking care of her own appearance.

"Oh. . .Mm, Menma. I suppose you and my cousin have already become acquainted?"* - Wed Dec  2 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Good. What brings you here? Didn't anticipate you being so eager to work. - Wed Dec  2 22:46:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I need a person to show it off on. - Wed Dec  2 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods.

She gives a thoughtful glance to Zenaki, then to Menma. "Right. What do you think about being used for a test or two? Nothing too significant.."* - Wed Dec  2 23:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shrugs.

"What kind, Claud?" Her vision averts back to the medic.* - Wed Dec  2 23:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Hrm? It doesn't have to be that significant, you know. - Wed Dec  2 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: But it's your choice, I'd suppose. - Wed Dec  2 23:05:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) folded her arms.

She rolled her eyes. . .Zenaki made things look -too easy.-  Naturally, she never expected some random wench to be capable of altering DNA all willy-nilly, hence why the woman refused to put herself at risk.

And before long, the process was done. She granted a glance over to Menma, who was clearly in pain. ". . .I don't think it worked. Did it? . . .If not, well, I knew you were all talk. How the hell did you even expect to change his DNA while in somee random  ass room. . ."* - Wed Dec  2 23:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) thinks: Might just.... Concentrate on my poisons... And more jutsu's... Mmmhh..  - Wed Dec  2 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) glared. She wasn't taking none of that shit.

A hand swats through the air, smacking the back of Zenaki's head in protest. "Shut your mouth! You failed. . . Regardless, failure or not, you still have that task to complete. I expect it done successfully by the end of the week or else. Understood? Even then. . .You'll work night and day to perfect  your craft. Don't even think about anything else!"

A glance falls onto Menma after.

"How bad does it hurt? CAn you still function?"* - Wed Dec  2 23:53:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Do something to entertainment before I go to bury myself in my studies. - Thu Dec  3 00:12:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) snaps her fingers, inducing a change.

Zenaki would find herself compelled to follow. And off the trio went. 

"Where to?"* - Thu Dec  3 00:16:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: ... - Thu Dec  3 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) grunted.

She again releases a small surge of energy, beckoning Zenaki forward. "I'd suppose, yes. You both can do it as I read my novel. Come, Claudette," the Necromancer demanded. She takes a seat onto the cloth, waiting for the two to do as they were told.

A book is produced from nowhere, and her eyes fall onto the contents.* - Thu Dec  3 00:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) watches as Zenaki suddenly KOs.

"So fucking useless. . ." the Necromancer complains. SHe's contemplating on whether or not to simply get rid of the dead weight. . . But there's a nagging feeling on the inside that proclaims Zenaki may in fact grow useful someday.

Eerily, it was as if Menma was Index rebirthed. Her foot is taken in hand, and the sole is kneaded in circular fashions. For now, Asteroth was silent, but it's clear that such an act puts her at ease.

She hums, allowing the gentle work on Menma to work it's wonders, alleviating much of the stress in her body. "Shingogakure? I don't think I've heard of it. I'd like to see it someday. . .Is the village still functioning?" Asteroth questioned with a devious smirk. A village plagued with death?
