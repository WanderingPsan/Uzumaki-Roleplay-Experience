<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) grins. Cypher was learning quickly. She affectionately rubs his chin -- her hand gloved of course. Before long, Asteroth takes a seat.

"Right. Let's cut to the chase. What did you see?"* - Thu Oct  8 19:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) wore a flat expression.

Inside, she was bubbling with joy. Kirigakure seemed to be a nice new destination to go after. Who knows, maybe she'd find a body or two that was of use.

"Pity. . . I wanted to go there for vacation. Seems that isn't an option now. Outside of the destruction. . . there is nothing else of note?"* - Thu Oct  8 19:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mmm. . . Swell. Good work then. How goes your training? - Thu Oct  8 19:22:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: . . . - Thu Oct  8 19:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: That's a broad category. - Thu Oct  8 19:28:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Hrm. .. Sunagakure would be a good place to start. - Thu Oct  8 19:29:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I'm sure their economy is suffering. - Thu Oct  8 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: P-Probably, B-But I heard t-they w-were attacked recently. - Thu Oct  8 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: And? - Thu Oct  8 19:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Villages always get attacked. - Thu Oct  8 19:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: I-It seemed to rattle them m-more than usual is all. - Thu Oct  8 19:38:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods.

"Nonsense. . . Your information is youthful. I'd hate to have to go on a vacation and find dead bodies all around. As for Sunagakure. . . send them a letter asking for entry. It's that simple. . . even if the village apparently is ran by baboons, you should still be able to convince them in that manner. . " 

She looks around, seeing as they were in a restaurant. Again, Cypher is put in the hot seat.* - Thu Oct  8 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) raised a brow as he ordered another expensive meal.

She leans in, with dull eyes. "Kumogakure is boring me. . . I'm thinking I might want to go back to Konoha. The village is in a rut. . . I take it they could do for a leader that isn't a shinobi. Y'know, a smart gal like me that knows what she doing. What I lack in brawn, I make up for in strength," Asteroth says dryly.* - Thu Oct  8 20:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods. She agreed with the sentiment. Of course, it was obvious that cypher had some sort of affection for the blonde -- which was understandable from Asteroth perspective. She believed herself to be absolutely stunning.

"It is nice to have you on board. . . In anycase. . . This is just talk. I don't have the resources to do it. . ." She says with a frown.* - Thu Oct  8 20:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mm. . Eh. Takes a lot of money. My family has cut me off as well.. - Thu Oct  8 20:30:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: On another note. Have you formed any bonds in this village? - Thu Oct  8 20:42:01 2015

Little did Caillou know. . . 

The entire thing was just a ruse. She needed to be able to clear the square of significant individuals so that the bodiies buried underneath the rubble could taken without resistance. Wasting no time, she sneaks off into a secluded area, and proceeds to build up dark chi. . . 

Cautiously, she does the process, knowing that there may or may not be a priest or two in the neighboring lands. As the build up of power goes on, there's eventually some incanations being muttered. On two seperate occasions, a space-time breakage is performed, conjuring two mystical beasts. One? A creation known as Gulab while the other was a simple Kappa. 

Discreetly, they move about the rubble, closing in the area instructed.* - Sat Oct 10 01:05:16 2015

"Because things are dirty. You know how many people have sat in this chair? I don't their germs. . . " the dainty woman stated honestly. She was a neat-freak, often to obsessive levels. No chances were going to be taken.

My body will not be tainted," the Necromancer notes, while still casually eating her cake with delight. It occurs to her that she failed to examine the dish for poison.

"In anycase. .. What is your opinion of the village's current state? Times seem to be rough for Kumogakure."* - Sat Oct 10 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) blinks.

She sighs, pitying the boy.  "I suppose I can grant you a single hug. . . As an apology. I'll have to be leaving a bit early to get some rest. It's been a pleasure, however. . ." the domineering woman stated with some sterness, although there's an apologetic aspect to her tone as well. 

The cake is only half eaten,.

Once standing, Asteroth waits for the young, bald-headed shinobi to arise in order to come in for a hug.* - Sat Oct 10 01:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) allows herself to be pulled in for a hug.

She doesn't truthfully hug back, but this is close enough, right? "It's been a pleasure, Caillou. And certainly. . . But these are topics that can be discussed next time, no?" A twirl is done, forcing her beautiful, golden locks to flutter in the air. 

Assuming no interruption, she begins with a confident strut towards the exit.* - Sat Oct 10 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||
Finally. . . things were about to heat up.

For months, she scoured the land, hoping to find a suitable, fresh body to practice her magic in. No doubt, even as she held a guise as a helpless damsel in distress, Asteroth's rate of growth was becoming astonishing. In no time, she'd reach the outskirts of Kumogakure, where two of her demonic minions had gone to place the bodies previously stolen by the mansion.

In the Necromancer's approach, a sly grin begins to develop.

"Ah. . Such a beautiful body. . .He wasn't my first candidate. . .But this will have to do.  Let's get this show on the road!" the beauty yelled out with a wicked chortle. Her wooden staff is already in hand, and is being flooded with a particularly potent or vast amount of dark chi. It was this quanity that remained necessary considering the next course of action -- a sequence that would quite literally go against the laws of nature.

Such perversion of the natural order was frowned upon. . . but it's forbiddened nature just made Asteroth desire to do such even further. As the build up of dark mana is charging, the woman begins to utter odd, foreign incantations to beckon the flow of energy to her will. After some time, about a minute at the least, she deems the build or ritual significant.

Dark purple energy rushed along the floor, forming two circular symbols they intersect. In the middle, Kojiro's body remained limp, and thus vulnerable to the chaotic energy. With a model-like strut, Asteroth stands over the recently deceased and kneels over. A single, mana-cladded hand presses against the center of his chest, right where the heart would be. Upon contact, it presses down, inserting several jolts of unruly, evil energies into the male's frame.

As it travels, it eventually runs along the now inert chakra pathway, before pulling around at the stomach. 

From this, a bond is connected, allowing the woman to literally reach through the boundaries between life or death. A ghastly, and lavender-colored claw of dark energy was now surging through limbo, seeking out the soul of this poor gentlemen. Indeed, Kojiro had simply been reflecting on his past decisions, up until he was ready to enter the purelands -- But. . . It was too late.

". .I guess it can't be--" The fading soul muttered to himself in pity, his comment being cut short, as the technique runs it's course. Ruthlessly, the soul is dragged back through space, and forced back into the body. But now, there was a twist to it. Rathe than being the old Kojiro, his chakra was completely and utterly absent. Likewise, the dark energies had mutated his spirit, making him into a simple pawn. . . A tool to be used at Asteroth's expense!* - Sat Oct 10 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Kojiro(Parris111) says: I apologize lol - Sat Oct 10 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) wore a grin. The book that she used for studies is finally set away, pocketed at her side.

It isn't long before Kojiro's body is morphing, and gaining the hardening shell about his frame. Arms folded, Asteroth hummed, gleefully as the Ghoul finally comes to 'life!' 

". . .What is this? Your rebirth, my boy. . . My goodness. . . So this is what true joy feels like. I can finally understand the happiness that comes with being a 'mother' for the first time. . . " the Necromancer stated with a coy grin. She circles around Koijro, examining hs decaying form. Upon moving in a complete revolution, she stops ahead again.

"You know who I am, correct?"* - Sat Oct 10 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's lip twitched.

The movements are natural, a byproduct of her overwhelming joy. . . A smile forms, and yes it's genuine. Asteroth wasn't lying, this was the first time in well. . . forever that she felt true joy. Like a mother producing an actual child, there was a bond with the magnifient ghoul known as Kojiro.

She'd pace back and forth. . . Then the script is flipped. The pleasant facial expressions are done away with, and replaced with the usual scowl and authorative persona.

". . .Right. Let's cut to the chase," the Necromancer stated bluntly. 

"I am your master, your creator. I made you for one reason, to serve as muscle for me. I want you to do my bidding, and in exchange, I'll feed you creatures for your nurishment. Mind you. . . even with the 'bait' or perks, you are very much not in the driver's seat. If you cross me, or even think about doing something boneheaded, I will end you. It takes nothing but a thought. . . a snap of the finger even," she warns. Dark energy creeps around her finger tips, and goes to manipulate the energies coursing through Kojiro's frame.

Indeed, the ghoul could feel his life fading -- but it doesn't quite. AFter demonstrating her true might, Asteroth allows the manipulation of her energies to cease.* - Sat Oct 10 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) grinned broadly. She was estatic, enough to actually release a chuckle.

If you knew the type of woman that she was -- one that took no nonsense, nor anytime to goof up -- you could tell that her current state was rare indeed. Constantly, Asteroth's apparent emotions went through transformations as the two sensations battled one another on the inside.

She was- happy -, particularly at the submissiveness of the creature. But on top of this, she remained wary, knowing that men were like animals, they had to be kept in check or else they acted out. "Mmm. . .Good then. For now, you will remain in the outskirts of Kumogakure. But I intend to take Konohagakure in a few days -- that's the two villages on each end of this plain. For now. . . show me any ability you may have," the young Necromancer demands, eager to see if Kojiro was already powerful, or if he'd require additional upgrades.* - Sat Oct 10 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) looked on with narrowed eyes.

"Inadequate. Yet. . . Your weakness is a byproduct of -my- weakness. Thus, your existence will continue. Be grateful of my mercy. . . as this is your second chance to gain significance in this world. Your last life was cut pitifully short," Asteroth notes, murmuring to herself afterwards with irritation.

"Hng. . . Lord Jashin will not be pleased with my work thus far. . . Regardless, this is the best I can do. What is your name? -- Wait, you don't even remember. Whatever, allow us to begin off towards Konoha, we'll scavenge you some clothes there to hide your. . . less than desireable figure."

She summons a bird from nowhere after a few incanations and proceeds to right a letter. For a moment, Asteroth pauses, geesturing Kojiro closer so that he could carry her like a princess towards the village hidden in the leaves.

Meanwhile, the bird is sent off.* - Sat Oct 10 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) allows herself to be lifted.

Onward to Konoha! Yip, yip.* - Sat Oct 10 05:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Kojiro(Parris111) thinks: Good thing I'm not picking cotton. - Sat Oct 10 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) gives a glance to the apparent Konohagakure shinobi.

"Oh. . . There's still people that stay here?"* - Sat Oct 10 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Kojiro(Parris111) says: -- - Sat Oct 10 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: . . . - Sat Oct 10 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Come again? - Sat Oct 10 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Azure(LordxPatrick) says: Deaf...? - Sat Oct 10 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) scratches her nose.

She's clearly not amused. There's half a mind to sick Kojiro on him. . . But, the newly crafted warrior likely wasn't ready. In addition to this, Asteroth would -never- engage in direct combat.

"How rude. Yami, carry us in, I have someone I wish to meet."* - Sat Oct 10 05:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) looked around at the damaged village.

"I need a pass to enter ruins?"* - Sat Oct 10 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Get out of my way.. - Sat Oct 10 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Azure(LordxPatrick) says: I'm good. - Sat Oct 10 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) whispers: . .. Kill him. - Sat Oct 10 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) whispers: NOW. - Sat Oct 10 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) remained on the back, arms folded and a scowl apparent. This guy was a pain. . .

"What an asshole. . " she murmured to herself. That said, she makes no actual moves and is mindful of being out of the way. Her mouth continues to move as she muttered some strange chants. Both eyes are on the battle.* - Sat Oct 10 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) just continues to mutter to herself. Of course, if there was anyone with sensing, they could tell that she was building up energy. Dark magic was boiling on the inside, wrecking with the thick, unpleasant scent of malice. Thankfully, she wasn't about to interfere just yet.* - Sat Oct 10 05:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: How powerful is he. .? - Sat Oct 10 05:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: Should I interfere? No. . .Neither can defeat the other. - Sat Oct 10 05:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: The difference is, however. . . - Sat Oct 10 05:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: One is an undying ghoul ..  The other is a mere man. He cannot be outlasted. - Sat Oct 10 05:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) frowns. An armadillo. . .? 

Those were no fun. Considering she had already spent several turns in advance chanting and building up dark energy, the Necromancer is in great condition to use her spell. "Release!" A dark plume of smoke manifests, much like in the sequence in which Azure had summoned his own spawn. 

As it clears, there was now a Demon right from the realm of Jashin. It's reminiscient of a common, anime-esque tentacle beasts. .. Mainly because it had tentacles -- a lot of them. It's skin was somewhat translucent, and slime ran around it's flesh. 

As the armadillo comes rolling forward, two tendrils speed ahead, gaining spikes in order to impale the creature and force an early disperse.* - Sat Oct 10 05:48:35 2015
