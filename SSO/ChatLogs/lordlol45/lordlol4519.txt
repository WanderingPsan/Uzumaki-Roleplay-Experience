<br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) narrowed her gaze suspiciously.

"Yes. . . He was killed by the Gezo. But had I not known any better, I'd say you were him. Of course, that's impossible," Asteroth replies with a slight grunt.

She was still thoroughly enjoying the massage, even as time went on. "--That's enough. I want to go see it. Like now." A hand presses against the ground, allowing herself to be propelled forward. Clearly, Asteroth was more than a little eager.* - Thu Dec  3 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods. The resemblance was uncanny.

"This is freaky. . " Asteroth muttered to herself. In no time, she was up on her feet and walking off. "I can pay for a caravan, you just have to give directions." Clearly, the woman had no problem with spending money, as she had come upon a large sum of money. Oddly, this was from Index himself.

Shame the two could never meet.

"Let's go."* - Thu Dec  3 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||

Devestation! Craters and broken wood decorated the ground. There was hardly a structure left uncompromise, and the scent of death still practically clung onto the atmosphere.

"My goodness. . .How could I not heard of this. Come, lets look around -- with you leading the way."

A hand pressed against the Uchiha's back, practically nudging him forward. Assuming he moved, Asteroth was swift to follow behind as to avoid putting herself at risk. Many of the bodies seemed to be merely the carcasses of fodder! What Asteroth desired was a new champion. Was that so hard to ask for?* - Thu Dec  3 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nodded along. She didn't antici0pate anyone being there herself -- but that wasn't the point. Eagerly, Asteroth continued behind Menma, her eyes moving in a swivel to take note of any points of interest. 

Naturally, the place was just a giant mess. There was no true sense of direction, and it wasn't as if she could also the local inhabitants for help . . As most were dead. Then the idea donned upon her.

"So. Take me the grave sites of your friends? I'm sure coming here is hard for you. But I'm sure you'd like to revisit to pay your deceased friends a visit. Maybe it can put you at ease. . " Despite the sincerity in her voice, there was clearly an amount of eagerness in her voice. She seemed a bit -too- willing to go visit.* - Thu Dec  3 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) licked her lips.

The conglomerate of negative emotions practically formed a translucent, tangible aura from Menma's body. Even if the Uchiha had nothing, the spooky witch could essentially smell his angst. And really, it was like heaven to her. Such an impressionable, and potentially powerful young man didn't often come to her door steps.

For a second, she smiled while returning to Menma's rear. In the end, the jovial expression faded away. 

Once again, Asteroth's delicate fingers press onto the child's shoulder. "I can tell, you're quite. . unsettled by this. Tell me, if I wanted to go dig into the graves and obtain their bodies -- would you be upset? I don't have any intent on violating. Just. . . They may be intriguing for research value."* - Thu Dec  3 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) tilted her head. She couldn't help but to fell. . . misguided.

"You're giving me mixed signals here. In any case, I'd like to dig them up in the name of science. That won't be a problem, will it? We'll be taking them back to Konoha and handling their corpses. Their bodies will be up to examination by Zenaki -- who knows, perhaps with these she can perfect her craft," Asteroth replies. 

She looks down and groans, as the notion of digging through the dirt was unappealing. In addition, she couldn't exactly use her demon summonings without looking like some evil deviant..* - Thu Dec  3 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shrugs.

She goes, finding a seat in the shade. "Indeed. Although. . Tell me, if I could figure out how to make you stronger from these bodies, wouldn't you be more inclined to keep them? Your friends would naturally be overjoyed if they found out they had been the root of one of your power boosts. . ." She speaks gently, figuring that the notion of power could butter Menma up to being more agreeable.

Despite the sinister intent, Asteroth spoke with an air of sincerity as the words elegantly danced off her lips.* - Thu Dec  3 04:36:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) clenches her fist, manipulating Zenaki's brain again.

"Tell me the truth! Did you bring the children around to tip your friends off? And what was the response?!"* - Fri Dec  4 23:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) narrowed her gaze, a nasty scowl being worn.

Her teeth clenched, showing off her fangs. Blood pressure was risden, given a red coloration of the skin. Asteroth was absolutely. . . positively, LIVID!

"And that's all you said? You made no mention of the spell casted upon you?" All the same, the sorceress still utilized her curse sealing to pry information from Zenaki's form.* - Fri Dec  4 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) huffs.

The change in pigmentation of her skin was still clear evident. . .But slowly, the flow of blood began to subside. The necromancer takes several casual steps forward, one hand on her hip. Both of those serpent eyes remained glued to Zenaki, indiscriminate and scrutinizing. . . But also forgiving.

A hand falls onto the girl's chin, stroking gently. 

"Very good. Arise. How goes the project I've assigned?"* - Fri Dec  4 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) folded her arms, clearly displeased for one reason or another. 

". . .Well you had better finished on time. What evenare you working on? By any chance. If need be, you can even obtain live test subjects to tamper with. . Since you have no worth unless your methods are perfected," Asteroth replies sharply.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) facepalms.

"I got you access to the hospital for a reason. You don't run experiments in a little room. . . How can someone so dense be capable of manipulating genes?" the Necromancer quips rudely. She was so overbearing..* - Sat Dec  5 00:33:42 2015

"Evening. How goes the recovery. . ?"* - Sat Dec  5 00:53:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) folded her arms.

She looked on curiously to Menma. "Where have you been? I've rarely seen you in the last few days? I may even have a job for you to accomplish, but it requires that you become a traveler for a while."* - Sat Dec  5 01:00:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) perked a brow.

"A DNA exchange? If what you desire is my DNA, then I will oblige. As for Menma. . .My job is simple. First, you'll merely be scouting. What I seek is the following. .. Powerful men -- or women I suppose-- and by that, I mean physically powerful and dominant. Any that are discovered, mark them down. But do not approach. Simply note their location," she barks out, giving very simple orders.

Eventually, the woman continues onward after glance to ensure that everyone was on the same page.

"And secondly, keep an eye out for shinobi that seem power hungry. Not too much to ask for. . No?"* - Sat Dec  5 01:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: It's.. More like Instead of I try to uhm.. Do stuff with DNA with my child I will make those pills. We can test them with shinobi of this village .. Maybe that's a way that I can prove myself. - Sat Dec  5 01:16:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) walked in shortly after Zenaki had began with her preparation.

As usual, Asteroth wore a look that suggested she was bored or had nothing better to do. Once in the area, she ensures that the wall is dusted off, and promptly leans against it. 

"What were you going to do again? With the herbs? From the little I paid attention too. . You claimed it was going to be. . steroids basically? To aid in the natural growth of the body. Well, of course that would make it un-natural by definition. . " The sorceress declared. A hand falls over to Menma. 

"In the meantime, he can run errands if need be. To gather herbs and such."* - Sat Dec  5 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: wait* - Sat Dec  5 02:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nodded as Zenaki went about, explaining her procedures.

"Good. This is what I expected to see. . " As usual, the Necromancer stepped forward, affectionately stroking the cheek of the woman she deemed a pet. . As that was Zenaki's new life.

"Keep working. Later, I suppose I may give you a break to serve me in tandem with Menma. I do love to be pampered after all. . " She says gently. With that, Asteroth is seated back onto the mattress, idly observing the medic as she did her thing. A book is occasionally glanced, no doubt being the woman's usual articles of darkness!* - Sat Dec  5 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: If you're going to sleep, do it within the safety of your home. - Sat Dec  5 03:26:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: This day, I mean. - Sun Dec  6 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Uhm.. Studying and taking a small break from these crying children.  - Sun Dec  6 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: That's all? Do you cook? - Sun Dec  6 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I... Can cook yes.. - Sun Dec  6 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mmm. No, I don't trust your cooking. Let's grab a bite. . - Sun Dec  6 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: U-Uhm.. Alright then..  - Sun Dec  6 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) casually dusts off the chair before taking a seat.

"Make an order. Better be good," the witch said with a sly smile. Yes, she was putting Zenak right back into the hot seat. The menu is ordered, containing an assortment of delicate meals.

What would Zenaki choose?* - Sun Dec  6 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) listened intently as Zenaki made the orders for the two of them.'

Boredly, Asteroth leaned forward, giving a glance to her effective slave. "You're quite dull. . Mmm, I seek to learn more of my playthings so that I fcan better manipulate them. Give me your story -- tell me of your childhood and general life,"  the blonde stated flatly.

A glance is given to the waiter who then shuffled off to complete the orders.* - Sun Dec  6 00:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) taps her fingers along the furniture iddly as Zenaki gave her life story. It was vague in many places -- and somewhat unappealing. But alas, there had been some interesting tidmits of info, the likes of which incited a grin to manifest on Asteroth's maw.

"You claim your family to be deceased? Why? And yes, your children are adorable. I very much look forward to seeing how they turn once you're enabled to use your genetic experiments to enhance their chakra network with my own dark energies," the witch stated snidely, as if to spite the red-haired medic. 

"--Oh and be forthcoming. Or else I'll make your insides hurt again."

Of course, this was all whispered. Since saying such in public wasn't exactly the smartest thing to do. Regardless, in the next extent, heaps of plates had been delivered, each one releasing a pleasant aroma. "Mmm. My friend here will cover your tab."* - Sun Dec  6 01:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) frowns.

Such a juicy story, but it lacked completion. Her hands fidgeted, in preparation to smack Zenaki for the displeasure -- but she stays her hand just once.

"Pity. And that's all there is to your persona? I expected as much. . You seem to be a pretty straight forward person. In any case, explain more. What life goals did you have in the past? Which current ones do you possess now?"

She looks down, gathering up chopsticks in hand and using it to fish up an assortment of treats. Each delicate dish is stuffed into her mouth, albeit in a regal, tamed fashion. She ate like a person who was specifically trained to possess high-leveled etiquette. No movement were rashed or rude, and her posture remained erect and unwavering.

Still, after taking some chomps, the woman's gaze falls back onto Zenaki, a sly taunting smile being worn all the same. Clearly, Asteroth possessed some ulterior motives to this.* - Sun Dec  6 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) paused as she gluttonously ate.

She pauses abruptly, however, at the secondary comment. Just as Asteroth had anticipated, the transformation left along the woman's soul had made her grown attach to the caster --

Slyly, the grin from before marches further along her face, progressing until teeth were actual present.

"Adorable. It's good that you've began to accept this role. Perhaps in the beginning, I may have seemed cruel. . Yes? But as you can see, this has been for the best. You're becoming more agreeable. . and within time. . " She leansin, whispering just a tad.

"You will be able to access another source of power. Let me know when you feel as if one portion of your soul has finished merging. I'd like to see the fruit of my labor.."* - Sun Dec  6 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) continued to chow.

Eventually, as Claudette speaks, Asteroth visibly perks up. 

"Alrigt. Isuppose then, let us see what you can do. Come, let's head to ap rivate area to show off your new skills." Most of the food had been left unattended too, and the bill is left on the table. 

As they're standing, Asteroth essentially commands Claudette to carry her off.* - Sun Dec  6 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Oh.. - Sun Dec  6 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Finally awake? - Sun Dec  6 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: H-Huh.. Uhm.. Mhm...  I-I am sorry I fell asleep.. - Sun Dec  6 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: It is fine. - Sun Dec  6 07:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) looks Claudette up and down.

"So. . I don't believe you've yet to follow transform, even if you claim it. The rate is different based on the person. .  Still, have you developed any qualities of the Shingo? In your human form that is.."* - Sun Dec  6 07:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) flicks on the nose.

"Of course not. . "* - Sun Dec  6 07:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: If you could, you'd have shown me. I wonder how large you'll be able to grow in bat form. - Sun Dec  6 07:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: You'd better.. - Sun Dec  6 08:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Mhm... - Sun Dec  6 08:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: What's on the agenda today? I've completed my studying. - Sun Dec  6 08:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: On the agenda... Uhm..  - Sun Dec  6 08:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: I.. Still have to practice some of my jutsu's and work on poisons...  - Sun Dec  6 08:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: --Oh. I knew you made pills. - Sun Dec  6 08:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: But poisons too? - Sun Dec  6 08:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: What is in the works? - Sun Dec  6 08:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: At the moment I can paralyze people completely. Maybe even.. Uh kill them.. But I know I have to work on that aswell.  - Sun Dec  6 08:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: . .  - Sun Dec  6 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: That sounds like boasting. - Sun Dec  6 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Last time you bragged, you turned out not to be as good as you claimed. - Sun Dec  6 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Do you want me to show you? - Sun Dec  6 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Yes. - Sun Dec  6 08:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: And have an antidote ready as well. - Sun Dec  6 08:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) swats at Claudette's arm.

"Not me, you imbecile!" Asteroth screeched, in obvious protest to the gesture. She took a defensive step back, narrowing a nasty gaze onto the red-head's form. 

"Use it on yourself. I'll provide you with the antidote. . In fact, just give me the darn thing. I'll poison and cure you. . " The witch demands.* - Sun Dec  6 08:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: volunteered* - Sun Dec  6 08:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) simpered at Claudette's foolish assumptions.

"That was incredibly stupid. . Why would I want to leave myself paralyzed by you? I don't trust you that much, dear. . ." Asteroth replies with an exasperated sigh. Once the needle and syringe are delivered, the female wastes no time. 

The item is taken and jabbed ahead, hopefullly impaling Zenaki right in the ribs, somewhat painfully. The poison is pumped, entering her blood streams as previously intended. Patiently. . Asteroth looks for this to take effect. "Alright. . Let's see how long this would go.."* - Sun Dec  6 08:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||

Astonishing.

With immense surprise, Asteroth gasped, observing as the poison rapidly spreaded through the victim's body and essentially rendered Claudette completely incapable of moving. Pleased, the dainty creature looked down over the victim of the pathogen, a massive, clown-like simper being worn. She licked her lips, watching Claudette like a finely cooked meal.

"Well this is interesting... How helpless you are.  How does that even make you feel? -- Oh wait. . You can't talk back to me. . "

The antidote, also beintg held in a syringe, is stabbed forward again. It painfully breaks through Claudette's skin, and releases the alleviating agents to combat the drugs or poisons.* - Sun Dec  6 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's teeth were on full display.

"Amusing. Come, I'm tired of being here. Let's go outside and check what the general populace is doing. Perhaps Konoha finally have some shinobi worth mentioning or speaking too."

She's gesture for Zen-Zen to get onto her feet. Oncei n place, Asteroth leaps, wrapping her arms around the slave's neck, and legs around her waist. "Yip. . . Yip." A hand swats the side of the Quantified Demon's waistline, suggesting she'd get moving.* - Sun Dec  6 08:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .... - Sun Dec  6 08:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) comes through, riding along  the woman's back.

A glance falls over the two to the right -- Nigen and Yuriko. Asteroth stared with a dull gaze, instantly being disgusted due to the close proximity of the heathen, Mr. Shizan.

"Let's go. I'm feeling sick of here," the blonde stated with a whisper.* - Sun Dec  6 08:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .... - Sun Dec  6 09:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hey, Asturwrath, right? - Sun Dec  6 09:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Asturwrath? - Sun Dec  6 09:00:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Sun Dec  6 09:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I guess she didn't want to speak. - Sun Dec  6 09:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Anyway, stay out of trouble. - Sun Dec  6 09:02:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Well. A bit bored. - Sun Dec  6 09:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: But well. - Sun Dec  6 09:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Tch. Boredom seems to be the theme here lately. - Sun Dec  6 09:06:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Tch. - Sun Dec  6 09:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: That it does. - Sun Dec  6 09:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: You have any suggestions on how to accomplish such? - Sun Dec  6 09:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: And, I prefer tea at anytime, but if you want to keep avoiding me, that's fine. I only killed the Mizukage to protect you, no big deal. - Sun Dec  6 09:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Avoiding you? I've rarely seen you. - Sun Dec  6 09:12:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) was not giant! 

She was 5'5 at best, and slimly built despite generous proportions and curves. "Odd question. I suppose you did this often, when you last lived in Konoha, of courswe. . " Asteroth said boredly. Konoha's entire environment was bringing down her spirits as the village was just that ghostly. 

She'd take a seat, while flipping through clothes, looking for the most modest swim suit one could get.* - Sun Dec  6 10:29:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: I didn'r pack it with me. So we have to stop at the shop so I can get one. - Sun Dec  6 10:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Of course. - Sun Dec  6 10:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: To the shops then. - Sun Dec  6 10:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) doesn't allow her hand to be taken.

She follows behind Claudette and lazily leans against the wall once the red-haired woman had reached the clothing shop.

"Make it quick."* - Sun Dec  6 10:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: A-Ah... is this one good enough or.. Another one..  - Sun Dec  6 10:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) dragged along a one piece. It was elastic in nature, and sure to be a tight fit.

Those traits acknowledged, the swim suit was certain to keep Asteroth decent, as she was a lady that prided herself on being viewed a well-mannered, modest member of society. The area is examined. . and after a brief period of silence, the Necromanceress nods, a smile forming.

"This place has a homely charm to it. Yes, it'll be adequate."* - Sun Dec  6 11:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's brow twitches.

"I hate your silent responses so much sometimes! Answer with a damn word," Asteroth says in her bitchiest tone of voice. Once that had gotten off her chest, the beaut moves behind a tree, removing her finely crafted dress. It takes no time for the swimsuit to be slipped on.

The outfit is a simple one-pieced uniformed. It hugs her voluptous form, almost tauntingly. Her proportionate hips were well on display, as was the woman's shapely bum and ample bosum. Naturally, Asteroth gained pride in showing off her figure -- but the woman's face made it appear as if she hadn't even given a thought to the matter.

Casually, she waltz ahead, and dips a foot into the pool. It's cool, not quite 'cold.'

"Mmm. Anyway you can make this hotter?"* - Sun Dec  6 11:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) looked on with scrutiny to Claudette's presumably skimpy uniform.

Her eyes rolled in disapproval. "My goodness. . Why not just get in naked? Women should show some modesty. . .You know this. I'll allow it just for this evening, but next time I expect something more respectable."

Her tone oozed with venom, but also a hint of envy. Along all of her talking, Asteroth couldn't help but to look over Claudette's form, and instantly make certain comparisons. Mostly in terms of sheer measurement-- people often believed 'bigger' was better. And certainly, the mind-controlled slave was more maturely built, perhaps due to the hormones produced by pregnancy. A hand moved to flick former Sunagakure medic, before she'd subsequently head forward.

One leg dips in, and as the temperature is gotten used to, the next comes. Before long, Asteroth finds the rest of her body sinking into the depths of the relatively small pond, her body easily adjusting to the almost chilling temperatures. Given the small size, there wasn't too much space to move around, but it's deep to eaesily engulf the bulk of the Necromancer's body. Alraedy, the water rises ot her neck.* - Sun Dec  6 11:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: leafes* - Sun Dec  6 11:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) was overreacting, simply due to being a hilarious prudish individual. Or well, a prude to the outside world.

She sinks in, releasing a satisfied grunt due to the chilling effects of the liquids. A fleeting glance comes towards Zenaki's general direction. 

"My goodness. . .You came out here just to sit on a towel?" The magic caster stated with a scoff. She find the entire notion to be silly. If you come to a pool, you enjoy yourself. Not sit around doing nothing..* - Sun Dec  6 12:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||

Aggitation from Asteroth is apparent. She had come here for a reason, yet Zenaki was intent on killing the vibe.

Seconds tick on, and after a short period of omnious whisper, the witch performs a single wave of a hand. In no time, her dark magic flares, seeping into the air particles as usual. Given her mastery of summoning techniques by now. . . Asteroth casually rips open a portal, prompting a minor explosion.

-- This all occuring below the surface, conveniently away from plain view.

Once the chaotic release had settled, a single Kappa had been spawned, leaping from the water. It's form is grotesque, and human-like, with a massive, dense turtle shell on it's back. It leaps, aiming to tackle Claudette and pin her onto the floor. Assuming success-- and she'd likely fall victim to it -- slobber trails from the demon's mouth.

In no time, the girl is being dragged by the collar forcibly into the depths of the water. The creature spared no words. . .just tribal and simple grunts.* - Sun Dec  6 12:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) seemed oddly calmed, even as Menma waltz'd in right after.

". . Is this like some mutated Frog. . ?" Yes, she feigns innocence.* - Sun Dec  6 12:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) simply leans against the edge of the pond, her arms resting along the wet grass. Gradually, her eyes were shutting, and quaint smile coming to life even as Claudette is being pulled and perhaps harrassed by the demonic creature.

"Hrm? This looks like nature taking it's course to me. . I suppose it's god's will? The thing knows not to bother me, so perhaps I'm right. . " Asteroth replies nonchalantly in reference to the Uchiha.

The Kappa meanwhile continues to pull the medic underwater, stripping her of any oxygen. It's meaty, perverted hands grab at inappropriate locations, and occasionally presses it's pelvis region into her side. Luckily for her, she remained fully cloth. In the meantime, Asteroth simply hums an old child nursery.

"But do what you will."* - Sun Dec  6 12:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||

To the contrary. There was no intent on actual drowning or even blocking off oxygen long enough to induce unconsciousness. This was simply a means to teach Zenaki a lesson -- be more entertaining, or bad things were going to occur. Once Claudette's facial color took a turn for the worse, Asteroth gives mental instructions to force the Kappa to bring her upward.

She's brough to the surface of the water, and held to the edge of the pond in order to give her leverage. In the end, she had been shamelessly groped, and her bathing suit partially dis-shoveled -- although nothing inappropriate was revealed.

". . .Wow. . You had fun with your date? Excuse me Mr. T--"

In no time, the Kappa did as was told mentally. It leaps from the water ways and flees off to the left. Once out of view, it disperses harmlessly back to the Realm of Jashin. "My. . Not even that ugly monster would stay with you after a one night stand? Geez. . .You need to work on your people's skill. . "* - Sun Dec  6 13:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) giggled, finding immense pleasure in Claudette's dishoveled demeanor. The coughing and hacking, it was essentially music to the woman's ears.

"It's a sign by God. Obey and you shouldn't much trouble, dear. . "

The comment is genuine sounding, filled with kindness. But of course, Asteroth was just being slyly taunting.* - Sun Dec  6 13:22:08 2015

"Indeed. Always the chance -- and you must always be ready."* - Sun Dec  6 15:19:02 2015

She looked ahead with dull eyes as Menma finally grew a pair in leapt in.

"Took you long enough. . What's with body language?" Asteroth says, looking the nervous boy up and down. As usual, it both amuses her, and makes her pity the Uchiha. A hand pushes through the water, aiming to splash Menma right in the face.

"Don't tell me. . You've never been in a pool with another woman? Pitiful.."* - Sun Dec  6 16:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) tilted her head with mild confusion.

She'd lean in, squinting due to disbelief before eventually shrugging and leaning against the railing of the pond. "Shame. You should get used to being around women. . .  Particularly me, it's not like I bite. . Well . . .Not much. And not too roughly,"  Asteroth stated dully. 

With a yawn, her gaze falls onto the water, granting a reflection.* - Sun Dec  6 16:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shrugs.

"I don't particularly swim. But I am a fan of the numerous spas or hot springs that this continent tend to possess. For now, however. . .This pond will have t do. Why do you ask?" she speaks in the same authoritive, yet uncaring fashion as always.

Asteroth's eyes hardly ever flick over to Menma, instead opting to stay on the water's reflection to admire her own good looks -- well in her opinion.* - Sun Dec  6 16:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's eyes flick to the side.

"Don't get too comfortable," the notorious grompy woman declared as she saw Menma scooting on over.

"As for what else I do? Mmm, shopping is enjoyable. As is going out to cool places or restaurants. You know, luxurous things."* - Sun Dec  6 17:21:55 2015

She pushes off the grass, using it as leverage to reach the surface. For the occasion, Asteroth wore a simple one-pieced bikini. It was raven black, and hugged her form. WHile still retaining modesty, the outfit was certain to show off the woman's feminine features. 

She wasn't exactly 'Rias'-tier in terms of endowment, yet Asteroth was still physically blessed in her own right. Buyouancy was a natural occurence, and her frame remained well proportioned, like that of a fitness model.

It doesn't take long for a towel to be wrapped around her form, and soon after the sorceress shuffles off to go study and nap. "Take care, and don't be unproductive. If Konoha has nothing to offer today, go travel."* - Sun Dec  6 19:51:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . . - Mon Dec  7 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Asteroth. - Mon Dec  7 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Oh... your still here - Mon Dec  7 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Evening. - Mon Dec  7 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: What happened to us having tea? - Mon Dec  7 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: I waited. - Mon Dec  7 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: We can now. - Mon Dec  7 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Let's go then. - Mon Dec  7 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: Lady Rias? - Mon Dec  7 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Come. Lead. - Mon Dec  7 02:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) follwed casually behind Abraxas. It takes no time to reach the area. Once the ramen shop had been reached, she produces a handkerchief, and wipes along the top of the chair.

Quickly, the blonde moves to take a seat.

"Vegetable Ramen. Add some hot sauce to it too.."* - Mon Dec  7 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shrugged lazily.

"Not a whole lot. I give the Kage credit for taking charge, but the village has still be exceptionally dull. . " Asteroth admits. 

Clink! The silver-colored, glass bowl presses against the table, the steam rising from the container. She gives a whiff of the scent, smiling.

"Yes. I've began making new friends. Joyous. . yes?"* - Mon Dec  7 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) looked on peculiarly.

"Oh. . The young one? I believe I saw him indeed, with pink hair. How annoying could a man be to make you risk being deemed a murderer and village traitor?" Asteroth replies whimsically. Ah, good ol' death, it sent pleasant chills along her body.

Quickly, the noodles from the ramen are rolled on up, allowing for deliberately slow paced chews. She was in no rush.

THe hot sauce didn't seem to effect her.* - Mon Dec  7 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||

She nods with a simper. A hand moves, gently rubbing Abraxas chin.

"Of course not, why would you suggest that? Don't be so. . . self conscious. And yes, I recall the death of the Mizukage, but this would be different." For a moment, she turns back around, chewing and devouring more of the meal.

"Order me a drink. And can you descrrbe the annoying person?"* - Mon Dec  7 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shrugs, seemingly indifferent.

"Doesn't matter, you're paying for everything. But yes, you have a murderous side? What was the man even doing to enrage you? I am -very- curious about knowing such," Asteroth said with a gentle smile, her pearly whites glimmering under the store's illumination.

By now, upward to half of the bowl's contents had been dealt with.

She brings a napkin up, wiping away some of the liquid. "Also, besides that. . You've merely been lounging around?"* - Mon Dec  7 03:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) wrinkles her nose, choosing her words carefully from this point and onward.

"No particularly reason. Just appealing that you have a more. . Hrm, macho side? Assuming you have it in check," the sorceress declared, her wording slow and carefully chosen.

She'd move, taking a sip of the sake, and feeling very little effects given the alcholic beverage. "And that would explain why it's so difficult to see you. Always traveling. Here i thought you were fond of me," continued the blonde with a faint and feigned pout.* - Mon Dec  7 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) rolled her eyes.

"So cheesy! In anycase, I suppose you may be right. My friends can be possessive, you may be in danger for trying to take me from them. . " By now, the bowl of ramen aws devoured and the sake finished.

She'd rise with a hiccup.

"You aren't as boring as I thought. For now, we'll cut this short, okay?"* - Mon Dec  7 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) exhales.

She leans forward. "It's fine. I have to get to my studies, however."

A hand pressed against Abraxas's chin to hold him still. Briefly, her lips perked, giving a swift peck to the male's cheek. Once done, Asteroth turned and moved off with a sultry gait to reach her home.* - Mon Dec  7 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) was gone on that note!

Swoosh! Time for more mindless reading.* - Mon Dec  7 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Ah..mmm... Hello..  - Mon Dec  7 22:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) wandered around the streets of Konoha, bored out of her mind.

Until a familiar presence could be sensed. Quickly, Asteroth turns, wearing a calmed grin. "Evening. How are you?"* - Mon Dec  7 22:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) folded her arms.

"Good. Did you enjoy yourself the other day? And I look forward to seeing your pr--" He turns, stopping short at the arrival of Abraxas. 

No one can know my secret. . . (Arrow voice)* - Mon Dec  7 22:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . . - Mon Dec  7 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Weirdddd~ - Mon Dec  7 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) gives a nod, with a smile -- one that could be fake or not.

"Of course! I just have to study! See you soon," the woman replies gently, her tone whimisical, and subtly seductive. A hand waves Abraxas off, and once the shinobi had strolled away, Asteroth continued with her cryptic conversation.* - Mon Dec  7 22:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: .. - Mon Dec  7 22:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) whispers: Your abilities. Have they sprout4ed? - Mon Dec  7 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) whispers: Talk is cheap. - Mon Dec  7 22:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) whispers: I uh.... Think they did, Mistress... We.. Can look if my.. Abilities got.. Uh better..? - Mon Dec  7 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Of course. - Mon Dec  7 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: To a private area.  - Mon Dec  7 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Your house?  - Mon Dec  7 22:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Or..  - Mon Dec  7 22:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Another place? - Mon Dec  7 22:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: That works. - Mon Dec  7 22:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: So... Uhm...  - Mon Dec  7 22:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) moves to take a seat on her mattress.

An expectant gaze falls onto Zenaki. "Come. . . Show me your ability. You should be able to temporarily utilize your demonic powers for your own purposes. Onthis occasion, I fused your soul with a Shingo -- I expect that you'll enjoy this one."* - Mon Dec  7 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) groans obnoxiously. She was in a good mood today, and yet now Claudette was doing her damned best to shift that.

"God damn it! Are you that dense?!"

Immediately, an aura of dark mana buzzed onto her form by hugging tightly onto Asteroth's skin. Each inch was covered in that sickly substance, the strength of which forced the air waves to pulsate irregularly. 

"You focus on manipulating your energy. Dig deep and control the dark energies that have been imbued within you. Once activated, the transformation should be induced. . ."* - Mon Dec  7 22:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's sensory ability flared. The scent or aroma from the dark, demonic energies that remained hidden underneath Claudette's soul was pleasantly greeted. The Necromanceress' mood suddenly became chipper at the sight of the mana seeped from the medic's pores.

In addition came the sudden physical transformations.

Like old fabric, Claudette's flesh was being ripped apart, developing openings required for additional appendages -- her bat wings. They thrusted out of seemingly nowhere, each one covered in darken fur.  

Asteroth gleamed, smiling from ear to ear. The physical transformations was pleasant, especially with the elongated, canine fangs that now protruded from the woman's fragile form. "Ah. . Beautiful! Before. . You were pretty average, now. . I can't help but feel the need to pet you!" Anyone who knew Asteroth could validate -- that's how she viewed all of her demonic summonings, as mere pets.

And with Claudette effectively being half demon in this state, the sorceress couldn't help but to feel enarmored or captivated. The magic castor sprung off the bed, and moved closer, her eyes practically shaped in the form of hearts. "Can you fly??"* - Mon Dec  7 23:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: smart* - Mon Dec  7 23:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shook her head.

"Of course not. . ~" The dreaded '~'. Yes, she spoke a lot more gently while Claudette remained in the endearing form.

"That would draw too much attention. You can just as easily revert to your normal form, understand? Cease the flow of dark mana and you should be fine. Still, I wonder. . .Can you develop your strength further. . ?" the Necromanceress pondered, as her ability to transform individuals into Demons was still relatively new.* - Mon Dec  7 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I'm so pleased, right now.. - Mon Dec  7 23:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: I-I'm glad you are... - Mon Dec  7 23:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Good. Let's go stroll around town as per usual./ - Mon Dec  7 23:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Ah... mm.... Alright. - Mon Dec  7 23:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alex(Ninask115) says: Oh my, hello guys. - Mon Dec  7 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) finally shook off her daze.

An easily miss-able scowl is still worn, as the girl seemed to be in a constant state of aggitation. The woman's cerulean gaze falls onto Asin.

"Who is this guy, Claud?"* - Mon Dec  7 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: .. Uh.. Some random guy.  - Mon Dec  7 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: That I talked with earlier. - Mon Dec  7 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asin(Thanatoz) says: Pretty much - Mon Dec  7 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alex(Ninask115) says: Oh my. - Mon Dec  7 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods.

Her tone, even if it hadn't been intended, had an air of pompousness to it-- somewhat oozing with hostility. That same stern gaze falls onto Alex and Mitsunara briefly.

"Not a whole lot. The village has been dull as of late," the female offers briefly as a response. From there, she again falls silent for a moment, before finally addressing Asin.

"And what's your name. 'Random Dude'?"* - Tue Dec  8 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alex(Ninask115) says: .... - Tue Dec  8 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) huffs.

After a period of silence, the woman speaks. "Asteroth. What brings you to my -- Our. . village," she'd reply casually, arms still folded. In the case of Mitsunara, as she sensed, it'd be abundantly clear that Asteroth in particularly had no energy to share or even be detected. The reason being? She usually kept her energy reservoirs in check, bottled up to avoid being hassled.

On the flipside, the mage probably would catch wind of the strange presence from the traveler for obvious reasons.

"If you came here for a good time, you may  be having trouble, Mr. Asin. But stay as long as you'd like."* - Tue Dec  8 00:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alex(Ninask115) says: You're a realy good fighter, huh? - Tue Dec  8 00:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Well, I'd like to think so.. - Tue Dec  8 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks: ...Oooh. - Tue Dec  8 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks: Kinky. - Tue Dec  8 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods.

"Indeed. Not many fights occur here. . But if you were looking for one, some shinobi may oblige you," the woman said to Mitsunara. Her attention soon shifted back to Asin, who seemed particularly interested in finding some fun around Konohagakure.

"No clue. A lot of the inhabitants are lames. Claudette and I tend to enjoy going out to one of the natural pools and enjoying the water. In addition. . the restaurants here aren't -entirely- shitty. . So there's that," Asteroth continued with a sigh. Her tone lacked enthusiasm, making it hard to tell if what she spoke was true or nothing.

-- Then Claudette decided to move, again without telling her.

The mage's flicks a gaze onto Claudette.

"The hell are you going? If you go somewhere, you tell me. . " the blonde blurted, her tone snide and controlling. Who did this woman think she was? Just up and leaving like that..* - Tue Dec  8 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) huffs. 

She seems hot and bothered for some reason, and takes a moment to gain some calmness. After deliberating on a decision for a minute or two, Asteroth gives a dismissive handwave. "Five minutes. Hurry back," says the dominator, with a demanding tone.

Her cranium turns, allowing Mitsunara to be back into view.

"Mmm. . I don't particularly know you. I don't often mingle with strangers. I'll consider it, I suppose. . ." She shrugs while speaking in an entitled tone. Asteroth's nostrils flaring upon getting another whiff of the pleasant aura of mana seconds after, though she makes no mention of the energy otherwise.

"Vacation from where. . ? If I may ask."

A glance to Alex is given. "And you're super quiet.."* - Tue Dec  8 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) thinks: Sunagakure huh... - Tue Dec  8 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) thinks: I wonder how everybody is right now... - Tue Dec  8 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) whispers: Punsh me Sensei!~ - Tue Dec  8 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) whispers: I want to be punished!~ - Tue Dec  8 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) bites down on her lip at the mention of Suna.

That place pissed her off. "Suna. . .Ah, decent place. Irritating people, however.  I can see why you'd want to--"

She turns, looking on with a risen brow. "Sensei..? . . My, you are quite the little butterfly, Claudette.."* - Tue Dec  8 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: And no need to be sorry. . Simply found it weird that you were silently observing for so long. <@Alex> - Tue Dec  8 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alex(Ninask115) says: I'm not very vocal, I suppose... - Tue Dec  8 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) thinks: I really wanna head back just to check up on everyone.  - Tue Dec  8 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) whispers: I'rd you punish me now. Then to suffer worst later. - Tue Dec  8 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Hey Hanae.. - Tue Dec  8 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) whispers: Hey what's wrong with you. Aren't you gonna punish me senpai? - Tue Dec  8 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Shut your mouth, Yoshima.  - Tue Dec  8 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) whispers: Okay, Mistress!~ - Tue Dec  8 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: ...... - Tue Dec  8 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asin(Thanatoz) thinks: Strange.. - Tue Dec  8 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) thinks: Makes me think of my little dolls times. - Tue Dec  8 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) thinks: I want to kill someone today.  - Tue Dec  8 00:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) scratches her head. Things were becoming a bit too crowded.

"Indeed. In anycase, I don't think there are many people here who may be willing to fight you. Unfortunate, mhm." A glance shifts over to the arriving Hanae. .. Geez, it seems everyone was popping out of the woodworks.* - Tue Dec  8 00:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alex(Ninask115) says: S-So.... - Tue Dec  8 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: A-Asteroth.. Is it alright if I go with Yoshima and Hanae to the hospital?  - Tue Dec  8 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks: Man.. - Tue Dec  8 00:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks: That guy is pussy-whipped. - Tue Dec  8 00:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks: Hah! - Tue Dec  8 00:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) thinks: Why does Hanue gotta come..  - Tue Dec  8 00:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) thinks: I want Mistress and I alone time! No fair, That Hanae joins. - Tue Dec  8 00:54:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) thinks: -omit- - Tue Dec  8 00:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: To the hospital? If Hanae will have you. - Tue Dec  8 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: ...Anyway. You also said the resturants aren't too bad, neh? How about I go buy us some dinner and your favorite one, and we talk..? You seem.. interesting; and it seems theo thers here have their own plans to attend to. - Tue Dec  8 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: If you leave, be sure to alert me. - Tue Dec  8 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Besides, I'd rather my trip here not have been a total waste of time. I've got a few more weeks before I have to go home, and I'd rather not waste them. - Tue Dec  8 00:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Oh I'm sure she can help me. And I need to help Yoshi out aswell.  - Tue Dec  8 00:56:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mmm.. - Tue Dec  8 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I'd suppose. If you're buying. - Tue Dec  8 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: So her name is Asteroth? - Tue Dec  8 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: Is she my... - Tue Dec  8 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: But of course. I am the visitor here, after all. - Tue Dec  8 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) whispers: MISTRESS TOO? - Tue Dec  8 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) whispers: I have two? - Tue Dec  8 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: What's with this kid. .? - Tue Dec  8 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alex(Ninask115) says: O-Oh. Can I go with....? - Tue Dec  8 01:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) hums.

She looks towards Hanae. ". . The hell? Do you know this woman?" Asteroth replies with bewilderness. Naturally, she flexed her capabilities for just a moment, allowing some dark mana to be detected.

All to ensure that Hanae would speak truthfully.* - Tue Dec  8 01:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Hanae~ Come come~  - Tue Dec  8 01:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) flicks a gaze to Alex.

She ponders for a moment. ". . And why do you want to go? You don't even know us. . " She'd ask dryly. 

Regardless, a hand gestures for Mitsunara to lead. Asteroth makes no direct attempt to stop the kunoichi from falling, as she had no concern. It was just some punk rookie, right?* - Tue Dec  8 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Kid.... - Tue Dec  8 01:12:32 2015
