<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) sighed. Her mind flashed over to dreams -- or rather nightmares -- surrounded about the dire lack of progress. By now, the woman, now the undisputed Queen of Amegakure, had expected to be well on her way to forming an individual faction. One independent of the Huevo, and of course fitted to enacting the dastardly plan that roamed her mind. This, of course, being based around the worship of Jashin, spread of his influence, and eventual release. The desire breached borderline obsession.

Of course, being merely obsessed would get the Necromancer nowhere. No, that strong desire that lingered inside her body had to be used towards productivity. And this would begin with the refinement of her own skill, and empowerment of her forces. On this occasion, -she- would be doing grunt work, oddly enough. Mostly in the refinement of her armory and gathering of resources so that the army could be much better equipped to tackle threats. The attack from the Kaguya Baen is a fine example.

Eagerly, she skips off, reaching an isolated point -- just near the riverside. It was here that she remained in her evident. The waterways flowed elegantly, an d practically called for the woman to take a dip, and embrace the lovable sensations of the liquids. Of course, she doesn't stop by the meadow, and instead opts to head towards the secret armory hidden underneath the ground. And boy, it's a freaking mess.

Starting off with the tireless training, she again calls upon a familiar face-- Shingo. With the staff firmly in hand, the Necromancer is more than capable of actually manipulatingo or controlling the energies freely. With little difficulty, the power is siphoned forward, before subsequently ripping throguh the skies -- as it normally does for summonings. The space-time technique is induced,  releasing a massive explosion of dark matter. From it, two Orc-like creatures stand, which immediately manuever to enter bat form. they fly upward, reaching theh igh places that Asteroth could never dream of breaching.

In response to this, more and more energy flows, this time for a Dark Magic spell. Given her inexperienced, relatively small incantations are produced, enough to form solid constructs of energetic might. With a swift step forward, she uses the psuedo-barrier as a prison or platform. Thus, now with the trio of Demons being summoned, the woman is easily enabled to tidy up the armoy area and placesthings on the proper shelfing. Habitually, chakra is fueled from her body, enough to keep each of the otherworldly creatures tethered to this land seemingly indefinitely. 

Minutes progress into hours. And after two, the deed was completed thoroughly, not an item out of fight. Now that the area had been thoroughly tidied, Asteroth turns about face, hips sway as she makes her approach. The river side is still as beautiful as before, captivating the woman's attention and prompting her to take a seat.

What more, the sounds that came from the natural surroundes soothing and granted additional focus. With the Staff in hand, Kagura proceeded with the arduous training session, intent on refining both her  bokujutsu  and the strength of her nature release -- Suiton. The young adult was swift to enter a battle stance, both hands wrapped along the hilt of the mighty wooden weapon. Her legs crouch, tensing just a tad and readying her for the endless repetition. Starting off, her hands or arms flicked up and down, making a slashing motion.

Each 'snap' was met with  a grunt, a battle cry even. Perhaps this was seen as useless to the outside world, but the yells or screams was like medicine to the spirit and spurred the fair skinned sorceress to put more effort. Adrenaline was certainly flowing. In addition, as the downward slashes came, she added torque, ensuring that the wrist and elbows were also subly moving to provide an addenum of momentum. As usual, doing such an exercise was lengthy, and she'd go on for a few hundreds reps.

Towards the second half of the training, as the Hoshigaki began switching up her motions or method of attacks, the woman adds another layer. Suiton release, or her psuedo-attempt at adding chakra flow onto the mix. Indeed, the woman had grand plans for the dark energy, techniques that would make her a threat on all fronts. But alas, before you could run, you had to crawl. Rather than making extravagant strikes, an uneasy layer of unholy might falls over the form.

It illuminates the general area before fizzling out. Throughout it's inception, Asteroth visibly struggles with retaining her train of thought or focus. She repeats the sequence, hoping to be better able to bind sdark mana with Staff strikes -- each time failing. After over an hour of training, it's called quitting time. After all, she was one that prided herself on fearsome hand to hand ability. Moreso than that, the process was really to help refine the woman's often shaking control over her own volatile energies.

After the seemingly endless training, Asteroth returns to her private chambers, where the refinement of the final and most potent technique was going to be performed. The art of resurrection. Tirelessly, she gathered dozens of bodies, all of which were assorted within her private chambers. Admittedly, the devious summoner was a bit. . .  eager to test her growth by now. It was this skill that was inevitably going to be her ticket to revolutionizing the world.

The first of many bodies are set onto a center, with a sealing glyph written onto the bottom. It's an extensive, elaborate, blackened circle with various other symbols written. At the epic centre, the body is settled onto the floor. She hums, unleashing a massive flow of dark chi, that likes of which run along the previously inscribed symbols -- much like a pathway or street. Without another second, all of the pouring energy converged, pooling together at one specific area.

It saturates through the skin, like lotion. It's illuminating, glowing and release purplish lights through the area. Beforel ong, however, each particle begins to map out the inert chakra pathways, and revitalizing or replenishing the chakra pools. All of Asteroth's dark energy subsequently guides downward, pooling together within the belly. Once all of the energy is inplace, she induces a particularly 'special' type of space-time technique, hence why being a summoenr was necessary to resurrecting the dead. 

Instead of targeting the realms of Demons, she instead seeks to pierce the gap between the living and dead. This poor soul's body is forcibly ripped from it's resting place. Of course, it can only retain memories obtained prior to it's death. As it's being pulled, the once ineert carcass proceeds to jirate around in recoil, seeming protesting against the forced resurrection. Before long, the convulsing comes to an abrupt end-- and the body's eyes shoot open. 

It stands, but sadly is of insignificance. As the time goes on, it's body deterioates, eventually being reduced to nothing more than a dried pile of flesh.* - Tue Nov 10 04:06:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hahahahahaha!~ - Tue Nov 10 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's face grows red with anger. 

But as time went on, it devolved into an incredulous gaze. Namely because. . . he mentioned 'Owari' of all people.

"Please. Get out of my sight. . . the woman is built like a pre-teen." She gives a dismissive handwave.* - Tue Nov 10 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Are you-..jealous?! - Tue Nov 10 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shrugs. In most cases, she'd care, but Nigen's example was ridiculous from her opinion.

"Nice girl, I suppose. Doesn't change that she's inferior to me in looks. Albeit. . . Most women are," Asteroth replies in a matter-of-fact tone. She's leaning against the wall, her tone neutral.

"If you're trying to egg me on, it won't work."* - Tue Nov 10 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) brings the staff upward and jabs Nigen on the chest.

"It's funny that my looks are constantly under scrutiny by a man that wears a mask almost constantly."* - Tue Nov 10 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) rolls her eyes.

"Funny. At the very least, I'm not like you. You have no room to speak. Your face is obviously hideous, hence why you hide behind a mask all day. Likewise, you have a cloak m eant to hide your figure," Asteroth retorts. Perhaps she would care more if she didn't assume the fellow Necromancer wasn't just a hideous heckler.* - Tue Nov 10 05:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: * Waves arms eerily* - Tue Nov 10 05:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's eyes dim.

"Quit with your delusional bullshit. Take your scroll and be gone. I've had enough of you for today," Asteroth retorts with disgust. Her face scrunched up, as if taking a whiff of a foul scent.* - Tue Nov 10 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Tue Nov 10 06:13:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||And so Asteroth's studies or work doesn't cease.

Even with the steady decline or her noble men's activity, the woman was hard at work. After all, in the grand scheme of things, all of the Queen's Goal hinged solely on her own work ethic. And ironically, this meant she'd need to completely and utterly master her skillset.

Mostly the skills that were based about manipulating Life and Death.

Already, she had grown proficient enough to make Ghouls. But what was superior to such? Undead Zombies. Even if the current crop that couild be created was . . .Well, it left much to be desired. Just that crappy variant of the true resurrection was enough to entice Asteroth to go further. It was like a gateway, a key needed to unlock her true greatness.

Thus, off the blonde moved, prepared to work eagerly in hopes of producing the needed effects. In her palace,  the blond bombshell is again tended to by many of the underlings. Bulters, Maids, and so forth. Each working overtime to appease 'her highness' before all was said and done.  She's pampered, fed grapes, given foot massages and so forth. With that being done, the woman proceeds towards the south, heading downstairs into a secret dungeon, where legions of body remained.

Naturally, they lacked life or vigor, and were natural prospects for practice. As per usual, Asteroth has a staff in hand to assist in channeling her own chakra. Or rather, dark magic. The naturally purple-tinted energy flowed violently, spawning a translucent aura about her body. She uses the heated nature to slam against the ground, and pry up a sealing formula meant to aid in the manipulation which was essentially going to 'summon' back the body's soul.

At once, after the glyphs had been thoroughly incinerated onto the ground, she proceeds with the release of energy into the atmosphere. Every ounce of magic runs along, illumin ating the area, and eventually converging around the body held at the center. It was a magnificient sight to behold. 

As the light flashed, Asteroth wore a gigantic grin. Her heart palpitated, filled with endearment as her work was being put forth to summon the ultimae 'pet' of all. A sentient being, one made of decaying flesh. . . A specimen that was literally undying!

Exercising perhaps the pinnacle of the summoning art, the chi attacked the space-time continuum. With ease, the fabric was more than capable of being ripped apart from limb by limb. The space begins to dissipate, quivering and visibly giving the appearance of wind being displaced. Vision was clearly distorted, as commonly done with the manipulation of empty space.

And what more? The spiritually charged spunk literally goes through the bridge between the living and death. By then, Asteroth's mana had already firmly moved through the emptied chakra pathway. As a direct result, there's an innate connection, allowing the Necromancer to easily be capable of searching and locating the soul. It formed a claw-shape construction, which desperately grasp at the ethereal object. "Ah.  . . What a beautiful thing that this world is. Go. . . Search out and bring this useless fool back into this world!"

It's pulled downward, and pulled on off into the carcass. It's eyes briefly flash purple, the illumination equally as intensed as the previous process. Once it's completed, the figure rises, its body and slow and skin flaky. It was like that body had been deprived of any liquid or moisturation for easily three months. "Hrm. . . Still not perfect. But progress is clear. I need to continue working on my technique. . . Soon, my skill be enough to raise my entire army. And my 'weakness' will be completely and utterly masked."

The flakiness seems to have an adverse effect, as the skin was literally being chippedo ff by the second. Albeit, by now, the effects was far slower than before, denoting a clear rise in skill. For the repeated processes, an entire ensemble of zombies are briefly brought to life. Their maximum time of existing being about an hour, given that neither were particularly powerful. "Alright. . .Get to work. . .  I need to have certain papers filed. And my  house needs to be swept."

And of course, due to her hold on each of the creatures, each of the Undead rushes to fulfill those task. They work wonderfully, making the typically tedious act go on without a problem. The dozens split up into four groups, each one intent on working on different subjects -- some being cleanliness, others being specific busy work. Neverhteless, in a timely fashion, all of Asteroth's chores are completed.

It leaves her exhausted. "Alright. . . Back to the square." The dainty woman drags her feet after hours of work, and proceeding to the local square. Her back leans against the neatly dusted fence, allowing her body to lean against it for support.* - Thu Nov 12 15:19:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Kida Rokujou. - Sun Nov 15 21:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Just a vagabond wandering around in search of a place to call home, and to gain fame. - Sun Nov 15 21:56:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) is wearing gloves. She doesn't take the risk of being infected with the germs of commoners.

A model-like strut is taken, and her left hand is dangled infront of Kida's form. "The pleasure is your's. . ." Cue waiting.

"And how did your wandering compel you to enter Amegakure? Have you heard anything of my Kingdom?"* - Sun Nov 15 21:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Don't touch her. - Sun Nov 15 22:09:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) looked. . . confused.

"Oi. I didn't give you my hand to shake it. It was to be kissed, you silly  vagabond. . " There's mild irritation available in Asteroth's voice. Queens didn't shake hands, they had visitors kiss their hands! . . Or in some cases, feet.

"In anycase. . .Do you intend to stay in Amegakure for an extended period of time?"* - Sun Nov 15 22:21:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Mind your business, Fickle-chan. - Sun Nov 15 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I keep telling you that my business is separate from yours unless he is here for you. - Sun Nov 15 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Which he might very well be. - Sun Nov 15 22:39:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That's not so bad.. - Sun Nov 15 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Oh. - Sun Nov 15 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: It's you. - Sun Nov 15 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I suppose this is fine. - Sun Nov 15 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) motions for Ichiro to remain put. She proceeds off, motioning Ryutaro forward.* - Sun Nov 15 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Right. What is it? - Sun Nov 15 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) kinda figured who this person was.

"Of course. Well. . .Save for your pal, Nigen. Mmm, I'll deal with him on my own later. What brings you here after all of this time?"* - Sun Nov 15 23:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) regally looked downward, a hand patting Ryutaro on the head.

"Of course you have. . You always do. Likewise, I too have been working admirably to further my own skillset. I have, however. . . Heard concerning news. Apparently you fled Sunagakure with some rogue? -- Don't get involved in a fool's crusade. . . " Asteroth stated with an air of authority.

"On a side note, tell me. What information have you to share?"* - Sun Nov 15 23:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) scrunches up her lips in thought.

"Mmm, I suppose. Why not, for old time's sake. And of course, I'm amazed that you were so easily able to return to Sunagakure. What more. . . To be part of the Kazekage's secret sect," Asteroth re-iterates, her tone of voice expressing her level of impression.

Indeed, Ryutaro -- otherwise known as Index -- had done well.* - Sun Nov 15 23:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods nonchalantly. 

She'd have moved, sitting onto the couch and gently setting her feet onto Ryutaro's lap. "I know. He's an amusing man. . . I intend to just let him continue with the expansion. It means nothing to me. After all, my goals remain the same -- and will not be effected in the least," Asteroth said in an a re-assured town of voice.

A hand moves to grab her cup of sake, yet none of the liquid is drank.

"In fact, I hope it brings life to some conflict."* - Sun Nov 15 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) narrowed her eyes briefly.

Even if Ryutaro had no lavacious intent, Asteroth remained suspicious that the teen shinobi had intent to woo or bed her. Regardless, there isn't any real resistance. After all, this was just a show. 

Her feet are exposed, and just like last time, the skin seemed to be as smooth as a newborn's. Flawlessly, the nails were trimmed low. "I see. I should make it a point to meet the Mizukage myself. -- What is the name of the 'Jounin' if I may ask?" She mulls over the fact that Kirigakure had a small army. Large or tiny, there Necromancer had no intent on making political or national enemies.

With a slight grunt due to the pleasant sensations from the masage, Asteroth nodded. "And yes, show me the gifts."* - Mon Nov 16 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) had taken a sip of sake all the while. She thoroughly enjoyed the taste --- and then Rutaro showed the gift.

In response, Asteroth's cheeks contract, sending the previously ingested sake right on out onto the floor. Her eyes were opened widely, her mouth held agape. Dollar signs had practically formed along the woman's pupils.

". . .All of this money!" A textbook gold-digger. It's clear that the Necromancer is practically enthralled at the sight of the vast wealth. "Where. . Did you get this all?"* - Mon Nov 16 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) exhales. It takes her a few moments to truthfully regain her composure.

"My goodness. . And yes, of course. I love it," Asteroth admits, this time in a much sweeter tone than usual. After all, it wasn't often that someone just randomly  gave you a fortune.

-- On impulse along, the Necromancer gestures for Ryutaro to cease. "Allow us to headback to the square. As a reward, I suppose I'll consider playing that game with you." But first, it was time to to check on the underlings.* - Mon Nov 16 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods.

"Do so."* - Mon Nov 16 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: The hell is that fool.. - Mon Nov 16 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Ah.. - Mon Nov 16 00:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It appears they're done. - Mon Nov 16 00:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods. She seems to be in a much more chipper mode.

"Nigen. I'll have more orders for you to put forth later."* - Mon Nov 16 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: That's a different girl from the one I met. - Mon Nov 16 00:56:19 2015

"Do not. . . think your ties to Nigen will grant you immunity. I know Nigen. . but I -don't- know you. ." Asteroth warns with animosity. She wasn't taking too kindly to the insults sure enough.* - Mon Nov 16 01:19:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||And thus she begins to chant, the dark mana on the inside quickly churning. Of course, Asteroth makes no moves, instead, she just continues to look ahead to Shiro who seemed intent on pushing her buttons.* - Mon Nov 16 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||As per usual, she wasn't really one to engage in close-ranged combat. Or hell, fighting in general. As a fighter, Asteroth was restricted solely to background scenes.

The kicks lands on her cranium, sending her small frame flying. It crashes into the ground, likely leaving bruises and fractures. Naturally, Asteroth was knocked out right then and there, perhaps a small leakage of blood flowing from a wound. Nothing too devestating.

And by then? She's hand enough. Wordlessly, after being patched up, Asteroth arises and begins to shuffle off. She has preparations made to transport her particularly more valued bodies, and with that, the Necromancer was off.

Amegakure was no longer worth the trouble.* - Mon Nov 16 01:58:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Why couldn't people be as nice, in my past life? - Wed Nov 18 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mmm .. . You with the mask. Have we met before? - Wed Nov 18 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Huh? - Wed Nov 18 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: No ma'am. - Wed Nov 18 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Ah. .  - Wed Nov 18 05:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: You seem eerily familiar is all. - Wed Nov 18 05:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Maybe you've gotten me mistaken. - Wed Nov 18 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: I would've remembered someone like you. - Wed Nov 18 05:23:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Maybe.. - Wed Nov 18 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: No. That is true, you would certainly remember someone like me. - Wed Nov 18 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: I wish I remembered... - Wed Nov 18 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: That simply means we've never met. - Wed Nov 18 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Well! We've met now! - Wed Nov 18 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: That's all that matters. - Wed Nov 18 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: But. I'm going to rest up for the night, ma'am. *turns to Hachirou* Thanks again friend. I need my sleep! - Wed Nov 18 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: Yeah, no problem. See ya. - Wed Nov 18 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mmm. . So, what is a person like you doing all the way out here? - Wed Nov 18 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) looks at her nails.

"I expected you to be wasting away like the rest of my kin. . "* - Wed Nov 18 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||As usual, Asteroth is sitting on a chair, a book firmly in her face.

For a moment, her eyes cant towards the side. "Oh, you're still here. . . Mm, I can see more and more of our kind are beginning to spread off from the Huevo."

She's blunt with her acknowledgement of Hachirou's true nature.* - Thu Nov 19 00:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) eyes turns back to the booklet. It seems to be a simple novel, although looks were decieving.

For the first few moments, the woman remained silent, her mouth forming shapes to mouth the words that were placed onto the sheets of paper. Clearly, she was quite engaged in what information could be detailed. After a few minutes of reading, her gaze falls back to Hachirou, curiosity evident.

"And what inspired the move? I'm sure you've been keeping busy."* - Thu Nov 19 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) rolled her eyes at the claim.

"Please. . You were really a shinobi?" She says with a scoff, finding the entire profession beneath her -- or anyone else who were of her ilk. "Regardless. . . Be careful of what you seek to do. Even if the Mizukage lacks strength, he has numbers," Asteroth warns, her tone akin to an overbearing mother.

How is it that despite just meeting the lad, she figured she already knew what was best?

"Or are you just that powerful?" An eye drifts to the giant ass Zanbatou, and from this she deduces Hachirou's main form of combat.* - Thu Nov 19 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) huffs at Hachirou's claim.

"I'd suppose that means you were a sneak. Shame, I was hoping that you would be powerful," Asteroth stated with a disappointed sign. The book is closed shut with a stud, and pocketed. 

With a strut, she approaches Hachirou and holds a gloved hand out. The back of the hand is being held to the Templar'.

"Asteroth."* - Thu Nov 19 01:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) internally groans.

"Do these people not know how to greet greatness-- Oh right . . I'm not the queen at the moment," the Necromancer pondered to herself with disgust.

Eventually, she shakes off the selfish thoughts and averts attention back to the task at hand. A brief shake of hands is given, and her mitts fall back by her side. "Right. How long do you intend to stick around? I was expecting to have all of this land to myself.."* - Thu Nov 19 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shook her head with an all-too-mischevious grin. 

She begins backing off and gaiting back to her previous spot. "Nope. That would draw too much attention. I simply came here to lay low. . " Her eyes peers to the west briefly.

"Although, I may move onto Kumogakure in a bit. Tell me, is that place crowded?"* - Thu Nov 19 01:17:13 2015
