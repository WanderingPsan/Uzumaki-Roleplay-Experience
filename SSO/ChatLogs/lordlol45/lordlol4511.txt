"My lord. And they did such in public?"* - Sat Oct 24 21:59:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Is that what they call it? - Sat Oct 24 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: . . .Indeed. What do you call it? - Sat Oct 24 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: More like non-hostile domination.. - Sat Oct 24 23:01:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) was more or less toying with him.

"Then be specific. You seem to know."* - Sat Oct 24 23:09:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) yawns.

"Give me a second. . " She drags her feet along the road and heads back to the office. A single scroll is produced, detailing a basic, yet nifty skill.

On the inside, that title was simple. 'Dark Spear.' "Is that good for you?"* - Sat Oct 24 23:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: For what reason. . ? - Sat Oct 24 23:13:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm? - Sat Oct 24 23:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: To learn how to summon? - Sat Oct 24 23:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Maybe.. - Sat Oct 24 23:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Oh yes..you should also give me a certificate of completing that mission. - Sat Oct 24 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: . . . Simply ask. Albeit, all my summons are locked to a particular realm. I recall your dislike of Jashin. - Sat Oct 24 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I may need to brag to other people about my accomplishments.. - Sat Oct 24 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Already done. - Sat Oct 24 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: If that isn't a problem. I'll teach you a basic skill. - Sat Oct 24 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Oh? - Sat Oct 24 23:15:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: What sort of basic skill? - Sat Oct 24 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shrugs.

She opts to go over her decent repetoire of skills. "Considering you just want to start off with the basics. . . I have two great low-leveled summons I can teach you. My favorite is the Furu-Utsubo," Asteroth notes in a whimisical tone. She clearly takes great pride in the creatures that can be produced, enough to force the woman's typically irked or stern facial expression to evaporate.

"It's a low-leveled demon that can nullify energy-based attacks."

With that, Asteroth proceeds with the incantations. Given enough time, dark matter floods into the atmosphere, ripping open a hole within the fabric of space and time. All of the flowing energy subsequently combusts, releasing a mushroom cloud-like shape of magical dark residue.

As it clears, there was a giant, grin jar. It has tendrils for appendages.

"THat or my Kappa. The rest of my summons tend to be high-leveled."* - Sat Oct 24 23:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||She grins, taking a seat and patting the summoning on the head.

Her smooth fingers moved against it's metallic flesh -- and oddly, the demon responded accordingly. It's body shook, and there were mewling sound effects. It was like the terrifying demon was a simple kitten.

"Of course. This is the lowest of the hierarchy. I can also summon Kappas -- the Boss Kappa as well, a giant tentacle-slime-monster. . . And I'm having several spell books ordered as we speak."

Her eyes narrow, falling back onto Nigen. "In addition to being able to resurrect the dead, this is all I can do. What do you wish to learn?"* - Sat Oct 24 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: -- Oh, and the Dark Prison spell. - Sat Oct 24 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Dark Prison sounds interesting.. - Sat Oct 24 23:43:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: There's a more advanced version that can be used to trap and impale. - Sat Oct 24 23:45:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shrugs.

She tosses a scroll ahead, describing the technique-- 'Dark Prison.' It was a simple, C-ranked barrier, but a nifty skill to have nonetheless. 

"As for a mission. Today is a bit of a slow day. So you'll have something easy. I've been given requests to start up a library. Sadly. . the village is a bit clustered."

Conveniently, a map is on hand. It's slammed against Nigen's chest. "Go to the fourth district. You have the pleasure of telling everyone that they have a week to get the fuck out of my block," she says with a smile. Along with the map, there's an official document, to ensure that people knew Nigen was legitimate.

"Good luck." Cue exitting.* - Sun Oct 25 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: On a side note. I will be expecting you to return the favor in the future. For now, however. My focus remains on resurrections. - Sun Oct 25 00:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Oh yeah.. - Sun Oct 25 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If they don't leave do..I own them? - Sun Oct 25 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: . . .What? I don't care what you do. If they refuse, then it's a crime. - Sun Oct 25 00:07:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods.

She finally finishes with her thought process.

"Right. Assignments. Today, there really isn't much to be done. The citizens of Amegakure tend to be needy. Likewise. . . there's still the matter of that beast roaming around. Thus, I'm putting you both on duty to help fortify the borders. We're seeking to build up watch towers, and placing the foundation for kunai launchers."

A simple, C-rank mission. One that could potentially evolve into B-ranked based on the circumstances.* - Sun Oct 25 00:47:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) rewards the duo for their job well done.  A glance falls onto Nigen.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) allows herself to be swept up as it was customary.

She weighed little, thus being transported wasn't going to be a difficult task in teh least. Given enough time, Asteroth -- alongside Index -- would have arrived in her cozy loft. Indeed, the size wasn't the most showy of the villages that lingered on the continent, but it was good enough. 

Towards the epic centre of the house was her living room. Fine, sleek and glassy furniture were in abundance. The table, centered towards the mid-point of the room, was glistening as the chandelier's light shone over the entire region. Just below was a comfy couch, where Asteroth is casually seated. At the inquiry, the Queen ponders before motioning Index forward.* - Sun Oct 25 14:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) remained stoic, giving thought on the proposal.

She was a weeaboo at heart -- somewhat. . . Given the japanese-themed summonings that had been granted from Lord Jashin. "Mmm. Sake, I suppose. How old are you again? I think there's an age limit on this sort of thing," Asteroth remarks, of courseh er voice lacks any seriousness.* - Sun Oct 25 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||She takes the glass and brings it to her nose.

A nice whiff is taken, allowing the scent or aroma to thoroughly run along her nostril. After some deliberation, Asteroth finally places the cleaned mug onto her lips, and allows the liquid to run down her mouth.

There was only a short sip, but just that sent a warm, fuzzy feeling running wild on the insides of her body. Although, that's not to be taken as proof that the Queen was a light weight -- believe me, Asteroth was more than capable of handling a little alcohol. "Mmm. . . Not bad. Do you drink often?"* - Sun Oct 25 14:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) seemed unphased. She had just asked the question out of curiosity simply.

"Hobbies. . .? You likely know them all. I enjoy reading my books. . . Mmm, researching obscure knowledge," she says inbetween sips. Her eyes avert upwards towards the cieling, her mind swirling.

"Mmm. And of course, I enjoy hot baths, spending time at the hotsprings. . Y'know, random girl stuff," Asteroth says with a shrug. She could go on and on, but had no intent on just blabbering the entiret ime.* - Sun Oct 25 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||"Perhaps I'll take you up on the offer," Asteroth replies.

With each sip of the sake, she grew somewhat more pleasant -- and less of a hard ass. Although, she's still very much conscious of what was going on.

"Things like lost ruins or cities. Secret 'magic' or 'jutsu.' Religion. . . Nerdy theories, legends. . folklore, the list goes on. The type of things that most people don't care about," Asteroth admits. "It's one of the reasons I'm constantly reading."* - Sun Oct 25 14:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shook her head.

"Of course not. It's why I read rather than look. Maybe someday I'll find something of interest. Could lead to a cool mission or assignment," she says offhandedly with a dismissive wave of the hand.

"The continent has very reach history. Much of which remains unexplored or untapped. It's one of the reasons I decided to come here, rather than staying in my cozy mansion back in the Land of Vegetables." After giving her brief explanation, the woman takes another gulp, emptying the small cup. The empty container is set onto the table.* - Sun Oct 25 15:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) raised a brow.

She didn't want Index to get any ideas, although the notion of having a human leg-rest was inviting. Clearly, she muses over the decision before lifting both of her tanned legs and settling it onto the teen's lap. 

"It was. . . Different from here. Much. . Much. . Different. In a way, better--- No, in facti t was definitely better than here," Asteroth remarks with a nod. Her views may be a bit skewed or bias, obviously, but generally there wasn't a doubt in the blonde's mind that this land was poorly ran.

"As the name suggests, farmland was in abundance, as were farmers. My family, however. . They were the best, and thus we rose to be financially powerful. Unlike these parts, we didn't typically depend on massive armies of shinobi to protect our lands. Buying mercenaries was pretty common. . Hrm. . . A lot more peaceful aswell." She goes on and on, practically muttering in an unintelligible fashion.* - Sun Oct 25 15:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's eyes narrowed at the blushing.

In response, as one hand held her cup, the other moved towards Index face. As it tranversed, the indexfinger is cocked back, only to spring forward and deliver a flick to the teen's nose. ". . .Don't get that look. . .! This isn't anything to be blushing about," she says with a somewhat nasty drawl. She didn;t want Index to get -any- ideas, even if there was minimal physical contact.

". . .But my favorite animal. I haven't given that a thought. . . I supppose an octopus? Or a squid."* - Sun Oct 25 15:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) defensively pulls her hand back, now settling both of the her mitts onto the container.

"Right. . .Keep that from happening again."

Cue more regal sips, pinkies pointed upward. "And yes. Squids or Octopuses-- Well. . Octopi. Another cool animal would be a wolf. Why does any of this interests you? It isn't often someone asks me of my favorite animal."* - Sun Oct 25 15:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shook her head fervently.

"I don't do sports. It's a sweaty, tiring endeavor. Sports are for men, not for Queens," Asteroth remarks, almost repulsed by the idea. "'Games' with family, however. Yes, board games. Words games. But never a sporting event. My, you're talking like you don't even know me. Do you think I'd put myself at risk of getting filthy?" The Necromancer replies.* - Sun Oct 25 15:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||"Dice games?" She repeats, taking another sip of her shot glass. It's nearly emptied a second time, prompting a light glazing of red to come over her face. Thankfully, Asteroth was no drunk and knew when to call it quits.

"I suppose you mean like gambling. I am always in the mood to take someone's Yen. . I suppose. And yes, sports are icky," she said in a blunt and matter-of-fact tone.* - Sun Oct 25 16:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shrugged at the suggestion.

"Perhaps someday. It poses little risk, however. Your money is essentially mine already. It would be like taking money from myself. . .But I suppose I can humor you," she replies, her back descending to lean against the other edge of the couch.

"--How much do you have on you by the way?"* - Sun Oct 25 16:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods.

"Fifteen thousand? Light. I expected you to have more. We can do a round or two. How is the game played?" Asteroth remarks. Her legs slide off of Index's lap, and her body lifts back up into a sitting position.* - Sun Oct 25 16:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) coughs.

"FIfteen. . . million? You must be pulling my leg. Don't tell me you've been holding out on me. . . And how does such a young man come about a such amount of money? It's hard to believe. . . and honestly I -can't- believe it," Asteroth retorts, an mischevious grin forming as her mind pondered on all that could be accomplished with the wealth.

". . As for the game, I'm willing to play. Be warned, I won't do a silly dare. "* - Sun Oct 25 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) scratches her head.

"You've confused me. Do a test round to show me the way this game is played."* - Sun Oct 25 17:25:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hm, I'd change eyes though. Maybe to foot, or neck or something for the sake of the game. Regardless: I'd list six Actions: Poke, Massage, Pinch, Rub, Kiss,  Or pluck. - Sun Oct 25 17:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: The order in which they're listed would be the corresponding action I have to complete, in which case the person who rolled needs to complete the task. If either party objects, they must accept the penalty. - Sun Oct 25 17:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: So..I'll roll first. - Sun Oct 25 17:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: If you accept the change of eye to Foot. It'd be to poke your foot. - Sun Oct 25 17:38:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I'll change my eye --- I see. 'Rub' or 'Kiss' were options. Don't get crazy, kid. I get the game. - Sun Oct 25 17:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: However. Where does the money come in? - Sun Oct 25 17:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That's why I included those actions. - Sun Oct 25 17:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: What If I got...Kiss your Head or something? - Sun Oct 25 17:40:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Therefore you'd say Penalty. - Sun Oct 25 17:40:41 2015

"Clever game. And beneficial as I can avoid doing something undesireable. We need to play sometime. . . But for now. . .I will take my rest. Understood?

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) --- She;'s had it.

A hand moves to swat Nigen right across the cheek. "Stop! All! The! BullShit!" Briefly, the Queen had lost her composure, before she exhaled. Eyes closed, the woman regains the typical calmness or stoicness that she typically displayed.

"I'll give two quick assignments, ranked. . . who knows. Y'know how things are. My butler apparently got tired of my shit, his name is Shonjo. Black hair, six-feet tall. Lean, muscular even. Basically. . . He ran off to start a rebellion group. Something about me not treating my servents or the Amegakure citizen well enough. . . First assignment. Find him. Second? Uh. . . Kill him, I suppose. Or bring him back, one or the other."

She spoke with a strange level of nonchalance, her hands gesturing them to do asthey please. It felt good being in power, especially when you weren't the most physically or spiritually imposing individual in the 'village.'* - Tue Oct 27 01:58:36 2015

This guy was impossible. ". . .Join them, 'Sado.' I don't think I can take being alone with you. As for his whereabouts, he's doing so outside the village. Near a small settlement, the 'Raddish Village'. . " She points in whatever direction that NPC village would be.* - Tue Oct 27 02:07:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods.

She cracks her knuckles, debating on what to do as 'punishment'. . .But then thinks against doing anything physical -- considering those that were returning. 

"Whatever. Carry this body to my morgue. As your punishment. . Hrm. I don't know, I'm actually a bit stumped. I'd want something that would really hit home with you," she admits, as she knew physical impairment wasn't going to do much help to anyone. Asteroth -did- need to have Index up and running.

Then the trio are arriving? She turns to face them.* - Tue Oct 27 03:41:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's brow twitches.

"You speak with. . a pecular level of igorance or stupidity," Asteroth stated, honestly having trouble in telling if Nigen was serious or not.

". . .Of course being paired with you. . . even by -rumor- is bad! My name isn't going to be muddied by dealing with the likes of you. You aren't good enough for me," She speaks bluntly with a partial look of disgust. What did this man even have to offer? He wasn't even rich anymore.* - Tue Oct 27 04:21:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) turns back, poking Yukio in the forehead with a stick. Moderate strength.

". . .You clearly have no experience. You aren't suppose to openly bribe me you boob -- Not that I'd consider it."

Then Yukio speaks again. With arms crossed, the Queen shifts her attention abck to the stranger. "Right. . . What do you want?" Her vision glazes on over to the earrings -- thatshe vaguely recognizes given her origin.

A stiff feeling moved through her stomach, not one of fear, but of disgust.* - Tue Oct 27 04:29:39 2015
