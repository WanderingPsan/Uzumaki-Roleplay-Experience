<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||After the long and arduous process of relocating to the village of Konohagakure. . . Asteroth at least began with the studying of her Huevo-spawned scrolls. For the weeks preceding, she had been entirely focused on refining or building up the skills she already possessed. As you'd know, this was mainly in the art of summoning or even dark magic spells -- the former being a lot more potent than the later.

Without another moment, she finds herself back into a familiar area, her old home. The scroll is unraveled, and thus reveals information for the latest Demon that would have to be summoned. A 'Fish' Yokai. . . Certainly not one of the sexiest specimens that could be conjured, but a useful one nonetheless. 

In general, the creature seemed to specialize in shape shifting ability, enough to avoid the detection of conventional sensors, and perhaps even a priest. Obviously, Asteroth could see the advantages of having such a creature beckoning to her will. Albeit, it would take more than just simple desire to have the newly conceptualized demon at her fingertips.

Hardwork was going to be needed -- as it was with everything.

She unravels the scroll and begins to scan over the general information, absorbing all of the details to the best of her ability. Generally, the sequence was just like the other summoning techniques. . .Whereas, the user had to pour out a large, concentrated release of energy to attack the space-time continuum itself. She naturally held a spiritual bond to one of the world's or universe's m ost fearsome dieties, Lord Jashin. And as such, the woman held the innate ability to tap into his realm by using this spiritual bond.

Going off of this, her strategy was very much the same as last. While uttering incantations that were described in the scroll, Asteroth's energy churned dangerously, flooding into the atmosphere. The staff in hand was the focal point and worked to amplify any magical works that the Necromanceress could conjure. 

Due to this, Asteroth's release seems to be particular potent. The air ways begin to quiver, the space itself being distorted and gaining the appearance as if some glass or a mass of heat spawned in the area. Her body shook and quaked in recoil as the muscles in her body seemed to twitch oddlhy, even if they weren't primarily being used for the task. 

For the next five minutes, the potency and general votality of the sorceress's dark mana was on a stark incline. The space's distortion grew in conjunction with the concentration and before long, all of the energy had combusted. A mushroom cloud of dark residue spawned onto the area, it's lumonisity intense, enough to briefly blot out the area in a blast of blinding light. Naturally, Asteroth's arm came to shield her eyes and forced the woman back in recoil.

As it fades, there wasn't a single entity in sight. Smoke rose from the air and flowed around the room, it spawned a faux-mist or fog, clodding or making vision somewhat obscured. "Hng! Why the hell are these new summons so difficult. . . to bring out. . Lord Jashin. . Please, give me strength," the zealot begged, anxious to achieve greater strength. Quickly, she'd fall onto a knee and begin with her daily prayers. 

For the next ten minutes, Asteroth relentlessly offered praised in the name of Jashin, and even found a body or two to sacrifice in his name. After refueling her ambition and presumably getting back within the diety's good grass, the devious woman is right back into the fray, pouring additional galloons onto the atmosphere. As things usually went, the necromanceress keeps up her work for about an hour until the twelvth's attempt.

As it were, the flow of dark mana combusted, releasing the usual glow. As it fades a simple, fish-sized demon existed, it's head twisting about in a confused manner. . . Asteroth was stunned, her mouth opened wide and right eye twitching with annoyance. Was -this- all that she had worked to accomplish? It seemed even -worse- than how the scroll had depicted. How in the world was an essential MAGIKARP going to be of use. . .

". . .Evening. . Senpai." The fish spoke sweetly despite it's demonic nature. The fins flapped helplessly, before the magic on the inside boiled to induce a spell. Quickly, the specimen was transforming into an entirely different shape, much to Asteroth's astonishment.

". . .How respect you are. . I suppose you are from that clan of Demons meant to be capable of shape shifting. I do wonder. . if there are higher leveled creatures in the hierarchy. That seems to be a trope, mainly for my first two C-ranked summonings," Asteroth murmured to herself. She's cut short, though, once the transformation was being performed.

A thick layer of mana formed over the fish Yokai's body, enough that it's body was completely covered in blinding chi. Slowly but surely, the body distorts before giving life to a plume of smoke. As it clears, the fish had transformed -- as in a physical transformation. One that wouldn't be dispersed when put under distress. Oddly enough, the transformation was made in Asteroth's imagery, having her stern facial features, clear/fair skin, and curved frame.

However. . . The Fish Yokai was a tadbit overzealous. It was as if Asteroth had a twin. . . If that twin was far more endowed. Her 'goods' shook with each step, comedically 'boing-ing' with lewdness. The sight admittedly forces the sorceress to get a tadb it flustered, red-cheeked even. Defensively, she's taking steps back, and brushing the fish away.

"That is enough! I can see your use. . .Albeit, I'll need to test this out. Go into town and see how many men or women alike that you can swoon. If this is a success, I'll consider utilizing your services on a more regular basis. Understood?"

"Yes Senpai!" Yes, the fish people were super obedient and proper. Immediately, the curvaceous transformation moved off to do the task. It's jiggly formed roamed about the town, and in about two hours flat, it had returned. Naturally, the most frequent offenders were men. All drunken and left wide open. 

The sorceress was more than a little please. Without any hesitation, the assortment of men were slaughtered and sacrificed in Jashin's name. with that training done, Asteroth moves back to the usual plaza.* - Fri Nov 20 19:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) had just arrived moment's prior to Eiyu.

Her back remained against the fence, which had a cloth layered ontop of it. Once spoken to, Asteroth's sight sets onto the duo, giving them both the ol' up and down.

"What is it?" She speaks sternly.* - Fri Nov 20 19:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Too busy staring at her tits. - Fri Nov 20 19:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) stares with slightly narrowed eyes.

She turns back ahead, and proceeds to read her book. ". . . You messed up your order for one. And who I am is of no concern to you. Just someone looking for some peace and quiet," Asteroth replies sharply. She wasn't in a good mood clearly. . Then again, when was she ever?* - Fri Nov 20 19:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) kept her eyes glued to the booklet ahead. She made a habit of reading for one reason or another.

"Don't be sorry, be careful," the sorceress rebutted in a somewhat whimisical fashion. Eiyu's apparent defeat or submission had done a bit to lift her spirits, if not just serve as brief entertainment. 

Regardless, she'd make no moves to stop the duo as they'd leave, but offered a single comment. "And if you're looking for someone, you might as well leave. Not many people come to these parts," Asteroth spoke concisely before falling silent. From there, she mouths some of the words on the booklet, it was like this piece of text held the secret to life!

And in ways, it did.* - Fri Nov 20 19:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) paused for a moment. At last, she looks up from her book and averts her gaze to Eri.

"Educated guess. People don't make a habit of traveling around ghost towns unless they're looking for someone or something."* - Fri Nov 20 19:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) rolled her eyes.

"Semantics," Asteroth replies. She'd promptly turn back to eying the booklet and mouthing the words. "What I meant by 'Ghost Town' is that this place isn't really on the world's radar. Not many people care too much about this village, which is why I like it here. Shame for that. . . 'Zeus' guy, however," she says while fighting back a smile -- this wasn't visible, however.* - Fri Nov 20 20:10:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) had remained civil. . Well, as civil as she could be.

At Eri's reply, there's a brief smile worn. She found the uncomfortable demeanor now sported by the child to be amusing. "I suppose everything happens for a reason, right? This could just be a blessing in disguise," the woman spoke somewhat cryptically. Although, it was hard to tell if she was alluding to anything, or if this was merely an attempt to find 'light in the darkness.'

For several moments, Asteroth again became lost in her readings, practically shutting the world off. Until Eiyu spoke up at last.

"My. . . thought you had left us for a second. Although I will disagree. . . Sometimes, death is a -very- good thing. For an assortment of reasons. On a side note. . . Tell me, what brings a Kumogakure -- shinobi I'd assume -- all the way out here." Finally, that damn book is shut. The two had mildly caught her interest.* - Fri Nov 20 20:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shook her head again.

"Then I regret to inform you, you won't be able to find anyone like that here. I've been here for quite a while," Asteroth says all too willingly. She looked on, in hopes of seeing a male with crushed spirits.

After sometime, whethr or not Eiyu reacted, she continues.

"Albeit, if that's what you seek, logic would you tell just to go to the Land of Wind. Blacksmithing is a rare trade, so they'd certainly have a few there," the blonde replies casually, her tone as flat as humanly possible.* - Fri Nov 20 20:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: He's really bad at this. - Fri Nov 20 20:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) perked a brow while wearing a sly smirk.

"Oh? Don't act like I've singled you out. You've hardly said a word to me. I'm simply not in a good mood this week," Asteroth replies somewhat honestly. She turns, giving Eiyu her undivided attention at last.

"Why do you care? I'm just a stranger, after all." A naturally snippy one at that. It was just in her nature.* - Fri Nov 20 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) wrinkled her nose, with partial annoyance.

"Do you? Mmm, I suppose that is reasonable. It's hard not to notice one as beautiful and charismatic as myself. . .," Asteroth replies with a drawl. You can tell just from the tone of her voice, she's quite confident. . . and is -very- serious. 

"Although, it's rude to look away as you speak to someone. I guess it can't be helped, most people nowadays lack proper manners or etiquette." Odd coming from someone as mean spirited as herself. After some thought, she pushes off the clothed fence, and approaches the duo.

For reference, Asteroth wore fine, silk clothing. The dress was primarily black,  with some blue being evident along the bottom edges. Likewise, she wore a red belt along her waist. Each one was form fitting, not leaving too much to the imagination, but also leaving the 'magician' decent. Lastly, there were gloves also being worn, to protect her flesh from the germs of the world.

"Regardless, the name is Asteroth. Who might you be?" the back of her hand is held forward to Eiyu.* - Fri Nov 20 21:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) seemed confused. . . Then offended!

Her hand retracts, a subtle frown forming onto her features. ". . .How rude. Didn't you have parents to teach you proper manners? Hmph. . " Her eyes trail off, falling onto Eri.

"And who are you?"Her hands fell to herside by this point.* - Fri Nov 20 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nodded.

"I see. . I suppose it's nice to meet you both," she says with a shrug. The woman moves back to her previous spot.

"Back to a previous subject. No blacksmith here. . .I take it you and your companion will be leaving?" Her question seemed to be delivered to Eiyu.* - Fri Nov 20 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Wanted to shake his hand but not mine. - Fri Nov 20 22:00:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: That way of thinking leaves you susceptible to being hurt. - Fri Nov 20 22:06:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: . . .Gah. You remind me of a priest. - Fri Nov 20 22:12:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I think Priests are fairly spot on in terms of their ideology, they aren't selfish like other people, and instead work to help. - Fri Nov 20 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But I haven't met a real Priest. - Fri Nov 20 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Well, Niza-Sama was one. - Fri Nov 20 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Yukio too, but I never met him. - Fri Nov 20 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) holds back the urge to facepalm.

". . .The latter is a 'priest'. . . Given his affiliation. The former, I don't believe. Niza. . previous Raikage, definitely not a priest. And simply put, they irritate me mainly due to their holier than thou attitude. . . And their unrealistic expectations of life. Just as you've detailed. . ." Asteroth said with a sigh. The imagery of Yukio flicks into her mind, this was a man she feared, mostly due to the earrings he sported.

"Murder. . Violence, Death. All bad things, I suppose. But these are facts of life. No matter how badly you wish for a world devoid of these factors to exist, it just takes a single rotten apple to spoil the bunch. Again, however. . . Your idelogy is cute, amusing even," the woman continued, her tone again obtaining a whimisical trait. Its clear from her speec pattern, she found Eiyu's entire notion to be ridiculous, and subtly ridiculed it.

But all the same, the lass does find his short-sighted views to be endearing in ways.* - Fri Nov 20 22:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...Wow, compliment the lady and then insult her two seconds later. - Fri Nov 20 22:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Bravo. - Fri Nov 20 22:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||

She had tilted her head with mild confusion. Why was this man getting so worked up? In no time, that confused expression faded as she's genuinely amused by Eiyu's hot blooded response.

". . .Hrm? It's called being a realist kid. Clearly, you're not as experienced in this world as you think. Go and encounter those damn priests that hang on some floating island. . The Tenroyu-- The name is a mouthful. Believe me, they aren't as you think. Each one is like I've said. . . Many even believe themselves to be superior to shinobi," Asteroth said with an exaggerated yawn. Rebuffing Eiyu's claims was child's play.

Her gaze falls onto Eri, pondering on whether or not to speak.

"Mmm. I've come from a lot of places. Most recently, Amegakure, I guess."* - Fri Nov 20 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Amegakure...that's good. - Fri Nov 20 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shrugs.

"I acknowledge I may not be perfect, although I'm damn close from my own opinion. Hell, I never even said the people idolize and myself were completely different. Even if they were, that was besides the point," she says with a shrugbefore falling silent.

On the inside, Asteroth remained tickled that Riyu had grown so disgruntled or animated over her words. 

Regardless, it seemed as if the conversation was winding down, prompting her to open up the book from before. More mindless reading. . go!* - Fri Nov 20 23:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: ..Hmph. .. -Oh, yeah.. Now would be fine, I can't stay here much longer... Duty calls.. - Fri Nov 20 23:10:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) looks over to the agent. 

She sports a bored expression in direct contrast to the Anbu's. "What is it?"* - Sat Nov 21 07:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shrugs. She seemed to be in the usually bad mood. 

"Well. Why do you ask? I figured you'd have left the village by now. . " Asteroth remarks gently, having recalled the Agent from a previous meeting.* - Sat Nov 21 07:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) rolled her eyes as the metal-cladded individual tried to make idle chit-chat. 

She turned away, once more opting to just stare placidly into the distance. "If that was some attempt at swooning me, you failed miserably. There isn't a lot going on in the village, and thus there isn't much to talk about," Asteroth replies in the stereotypically snippy tone of voice.* - Sat Nov 21 07:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) closes the book shut. It's pocketed shortly after.

"None of your business is what. . . " She turns, facing the Agent at last, her eyes scanning his metal-covered form. It was like watching a giant robot move about really.

"Now then. Who are you?"* - Sat Nov 21 07:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: . . Mm. - Sat Nov 21 08:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: You should know better than to ask such personal questions. What if this was a romantic novel? - Sat Nov 21 08:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Hmm? I should?.. Well, if It was a romantic novel.. Ehh.. I wouldn't know about romance anyway, I'd have left you alone. - Sat Nov 21 08:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||Asteroth resumed the rest of her training by practicing a more offensive technique. It wasn't often that she'd ever have the fortune to add such a destructive technique to her skillset -- and for someone that constantly had to remain still to use most of her skills, this was a welcomed addition.

At once, the woman retreats to her humble home, scroll in hand as per usual.

Things. . . Certainly had changed since her defection of Amegakure. No longer did the self-proclaimed 'Queen' have any lavish and spacious homes to call her on. That fact honestly enraged her, yet the blonde could persevere for a sole reason -- In the end, Jashin would bless her for enduring this level of strife.

But before she could even dare go on to preach his name and spread the influence of the religion,. Asteroth's task was simple. To accumulate additional power and knowledge. . . to form a network of comrades to aid in her end-goal.

Now at home, she'd settle onto a chair and leave thescroll onto the desk. By the furniture's side, the Necromanceress' tools of 'evil' were located. This being her magical staff, and that special gem she's yet to really gain proper use for. After some thought, the wooden object is grasped within her hand. Just the simple touch forced a warm, soothing feeling to invade her soul. The woman's magic instantly reacted, forcing her to feel a slight incline in terms of mana control. 

After relishing in that feeling once more, the boring task of reading began. Her eyes scanned the cursive writing, lips moving sublty as she mouthed the words. The view worn by the blonde is a bit more intense and focused than how she usually looks. This is due to the information was far more engaging than that simple book typically worn at the public square -- which admittedly was part romantic novel, and information in regards to breaking the bond beteween life and death. 

Eventually, she's reaching the end point of the entire scroll, which detail the specifics to transforming or controlling one's mana to actually produce that devestating stance. Last but not least, the incantations -- if necessary -- were also listed below. The language seemed to be of some ancient, latin-based dialect. "Interesting. . . Is this just the beginning of dark magic. . .? Mmm, I'd love to go further, but Curse Magic and Summoning seems to be my calling.."

Indeed, what Asteroth desired was control. Naturally, both of those subtypes in Necromancy fit the bill. "Alright. . .So the final process is to manipulate the shaping of my mana towards the end. Naturally, due to this being asuperior energy, shape manipulation is far more easy as opposed to chakra," she'd say with a gleam, it felt good to be superior to conventional shinobi. 

All of these instructions came after the first pre-requisite, and that was layering your dark mana along the floor in preparation. Trying it out, the beautiful blonde descended into a crouch and held the staff up overhead. Her incantations were uttered, loudly and proudly, each one going a long way t aiding in the manipulation of her own potent energies.

As the spell casting reaches it's end, the mana sent out before is ignited . . .! But alas, the large outpour of energy isn't exactly put to good use. Instead of forming into various lances jutting from the ground, the plasma energy fizzles up, rising through the air like unstable smoke. It behaves like this in more ways than one, forcing Asteroth to cough and gag due to the toxic nature of the gaseous state. Still. . . If at first you don't succeed, brush it all off and try again.

Cue another obssessive training session! The fragile specimen known as Asteroth grunted and yelled, each time growing frustrated due to the repeated failure. At times, she was like a child in all honesty. But regardless, practice made perfect. On the thirtieth attempt, Asteroth just narrowly gets the technique done properly, nmuch to her delight. 

The lass falls backwards, laying on her bed for a few moments and giving thanks to her deity for the support in the success. After an hour of downtime, she'd arise once more prepared to again continue with her work. Itr was time now. . to at last collect the body of Taka Shinjin, the former Hokage, and a man formerly known as 'Zeus.' 

Despite Konohagakure's level of turmoil, there still were some citizens layered about, so Asteroth couldn't exactly just run around digging up graves at her leisure. This is where the latest Yokai Summoning could come into play. The Fish Yokai! It's shapeshifting ability, and penchant to avoid detection by sensors was highly valued by Asteroth, even if the demonic summoning -did- lack any ability for combat.

Without a moment's notice, her staff flashed through the skies once more. Following the incantations several of those salmon-like creatures are conjured and each are given instructions. "Alright! I'm going to start using you maggots long term! I need each of you to take on non-assuming appearances. I don't care what yo uchoose, beautiful women, nerdy medics-- Do whatever! "

Despite her domineering attitude, each of the creatures were puddy in Asteroth's hand and obediently agree. "Y-Yes master! What is it that you require?" Each Fish Yokai declared in unison, as if they held a hivemind.

A picture is held up, completely in the magery of Shinjin Taka. Once that appearance was committed to memory, each of the Fish Yokai proceeded to transform into random citizens and head on out. Naturally, they'd remain on the outside until the sun had set so that the nefarious plotting could be done in peace.

Meanwhile, Asteroth continued with her trainign, this time in the middle of the darken forest. Her hand waved through the skies, allowing more energy to funnel and target the space-time continuum specifically. As the flow increases, so too does the distortion and without another moment wasted, the Sorceress' energy was now freely moving around in the realm of Jashin. It searched out, seeking the vegetation-based creatures known as 'Plant Yokai.'

Her eyes were shut for the duration of the search, but once discovered, she'd began chanting once more. All at once, about five of those aforementioned creatures are beckoned forth, and set along the forested area, in wait of prey. Mainly. . . poor humans that were on Asteroth's hit list. Many could pose as bushes, trees, flowers and even Venus Fly Traps. But as they meander about,the Demons are triggered capturing and killing many random souls.

Each of the carcasses end up being collected by your's truly on heyr way back to her tiny home, if you could even call it that. . .The living area was more like a ran down shack. And by then, one of the Fish Yokai finally return, with the carcass of Shinjin in tow. Asteroth eagerly goes to preserve the body and store it away, adding this to her vast collection.* - Sat Nov 21 22:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's attitude seemed to have taken a decline in comparison to yesterday, although she was still unhappy. Her body seemed to be near the statue this time, with a hand resting ontop of the construct's head. The other hand naturally held a book so that the studious entity could gorge herself on additional intellectual content. But what?

". . .You again. Do you not grow bored of this village. . .?"* - Sat Nov 21 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) scoffed while keeping attention solely onto her book. Her voice had a strand blend of snobbiness as well as carelessness when she spoke. "Really now? You claim it's great, but I can tell you're bored out of your mind. . . " Asteroth replied with a drawl.

She'd pause, again providing the utmost attention to that article or text, before speaking up once again.

"What'swith the mask?" Yes, the woman could see that the agent still wore that same, odd get-up via peripheral vision. "Who are you hiding from?"* - Sat Nov 21 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) seemed a bit skeptical.

For a moment, she's calmed, nodding along in agreement. "It is true. . . My appearance is freakishly good. It's almost unfair how someone can look so good, while the rest of the world is largely subpar," the superificial woman stated with a slight twinkle in her eyes. She nearly becomes lost in her own self-appreciation, before shaking back and pressing the issue.

"Remove the mask, then."* - Sat Nov 21 22:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) was still skeptical as can be. 

With the continued reluctance to comply, Asteroth visibly grows a bit aggitated. "C'mon. . . What do you take me for? I'm not that superficial. . I don't converse with people based on looks." 

But. . . Had this man truly been as hideous as he said, she'd probably find some excuse to walk away. Chatting with ugly people was almost as bad as chatting with poor or dirty people.* - Sat Nov 21 23:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) wasn't going to stop him. 

She shrugs and resumes reading her booklet to acquire a higher level of knowledge. "Farewell then."* - Sat Nov 21 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||

For weeks, Asteroth kept with the usual day-to-day activity. It was astonishing really, just how devoted this woman could be when it was somethingo f interst. Normally, she was practically alergic to anything involving manual labor, or hardwork. . . 

But this was different. At this point in time, she was pretty damn good when it came to summoning. The weakest point in the woman's game tended to be solely about her application of Dark Magic Spells. The latest to her repetoire? Being a non-lethal, yet still invalueable spell, the 'Dark Wave' technique.

Generally speaking, doing so simply beckoned for the user to take a thick mass of dark mana and spread it over a wide area. In this state, it lacked almost all offensive potential, but would be potent and solid enough to push back those that remained in it's path of destruction. In addition, despite the wide-spreaded nature of the 'spell', the energy consumption was trivial.

As usual, Asteroth moved to read the scroll while also holding her magic staff in hand to aid in the build up of power. In no time, an orchid-colored, thick miasma of mana poured with her body being the epic centre. Chanting or muttering like a voodoo priest, Asteroth prepared for the outpour of energy.

. . .!

Poof! Nothing happen. As the necromanceress aims to release the devestating blow, nothing short of a farting sound effect reverberates through the scenery. Cue brow twitching, and an overly dramatic temper! 

-- Cue another repetitive sequence of training religiously. For the next half week, this is all that was on Asteroth's agenda. Each passing use imparted a bit of the technique' true secrets or processes within her spirit. And finally, on the 100th attempt, there's a wide storm of dark energy! It's akin to oxygen being flung forward, instead on this case, the wind was purple like toxic gas. 

Having put down yet another technique mastery under her belt, she goes to rest. . .Feeling ready to tackle an entirely new realm of skills!* - Sat Nov 21 23:36:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||

Let's be honest. Asteroth wasn't here for her own enjoyment. Kumogakure was a shithole, a hell pit. . . A third world nation that just -refused- to die! But in it's turmoil, there existed many gems.

One being the carcass of a particular 'Queen.' She moved far and wide, before eventually settling at the cells. Prior to this, the woman had been searching along the usual graveyards, but there never seemed to be a body of interest. 

For the next day or so, Asteroth stalked the prisons from afar, eying to see just how many people could be seen going onto their shifts. More importantly, this was so that she could commit their appearances to memory. After several days of staking out, the sorceress makes her move.

With a staff in hand, she goes through a series of incantations and summons five different Fish Yokai. Two takes on the form of insects, and wait for the perfect opportunity to slip through into the maximum level security. Meanwhile, the other three wait, aimnig to see which of the local guards could be ambushed and copied.* - Sun Nov 22 07:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||

As a note, the Demon was unique in the fact that it couldn't be detected by traditional sensory ability.

Without an issue, they manage to slip on in, the insect-like transformation s now scouting through the prisons in hopes of discovering one of the dead Necromancers of the past.

Meanwhile, Asteroth devise a decent plan. After the days of observing, she had finally been able to find out when the next shift was going to occur. And of course. . . One of the gents that had been designated to come and take up post as a guard had met an unfortunate accident. . !

In his stead, she sends three Fish Yokai. One was henged as the would-be guard, the other two posed as low-leveled criminals, each one cuffed and being ported. In the 'Guard's approached, he speaks, while giving a bow. "At ease. . . I'm just transporting these two maggots to the cells. Caught them shaking down some of the locals for food. Tch. . . Don't they realize everyone is hungry?"* - Sun Nov 22 07:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||

Indeed, the food in Kumogakure was now no longer an issue. Although,  this was just a recent addition, certainly not everyone was given the alert.

"Hrm? Nonsense. It's fine, I'm sure you all have your hands full here. . . Well not really, but it's my crook, least I can do is handle it," the disgused Fish-Kai replies calmly. A gentle smille is given.

Assuming no interference, the specimen pressed forward with the two criminals still in tow. It gestures for the gates to be open so that they could enter in. Meanwhile, the insects swarm around, eventually locating the deceased body of Baylae. -- This being the person that Asteroth desired to add onto her ensemble.* - Sun Nov 22 08:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||

Wee! Inward, the three shape shifted creatures moved in.

Considering the natural checks and balances, they have to stop at the local check-points and be checked out. Of course, due to the highly advanced nature of the fish's shape shifting technique, things were -very- convincing. All of the transformations were indeed physical, even the clothes that were worn!

Once all of the check points had been breached, the trio move along, eventually reaching the portion of the building that possessed the holding cells.

In these, Baylea's body had been located. An insect crawls along the way, whispering the instructions and directions to the nearby 'Guard.' Slick, right?!

Anywho, now that directions were in place, the male makes way to Baylae's resting areas, and manages to sneak on in. The fishes do the ol' switcheroo, with one now transforming into the devestated state of Baylae's body, while the actual carcass is stuffed into a trash can. With that all being said and done, one of the insects secretly henges as a janitor and proceeds to drag the body on out through the back!

The other FIsh Yokai presumably poof on out, returning to the realm of Jashin. Did things go according to plan? As a note, Asteroth had manuevered on towards the back of the prison, prepared to aid if need be.* - Sun Nov 22 08:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||
Haha! It worked!

Indeed, from the back, the body is dumped off, presumably within reach. Asteroth -- sporting red hair and a mask -- still remained eagerly in the shadows. If all went according to plan ,the body would be submitted. 

If things didnt' go according to plan? Well. . .Shit was likely to get messy. Already, mana built up on the inside of her body, prepared to be released for a magnificient summoning if the going got tough. "Bah. . This is such a pain. Why couldn't your whore ass die in a public area?"* - Sun Nov 22 09:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||
Naturally, the guards probably would notice a body being stolen.

By then, Asteroth makes her getaway to store this carcass for future use. Having done the deed, the Necromancer prances back to the general population. . Just staring ahead, in wait of new prey. 

To perform Jashin's will would take much more than just her. . .Thus, it was time to officially begin recruiting -- forcibly if necessary.* - Sun Nov 22 09:28:19 2015

She had worked so hard to obtain the booty of the self-proclaimed Necromanceress Queen. Naturally, Asteroth was a bit eager to add another loyal minion to her growing network. Especially as the last Ghoul. . . was a waste of time and effort!

She could only hope that this one would actually be worth the energy being expended.

Oncethe dark-skinned Templer was in an isolated area, Asteroth finally could begin with the long-winded ritual. Her staff is taken an dragged along the ground while being flooded with energy. This leaves an imprint of dark magic along the flooring, while the elaborate, gigantic sealing formula is developed. As usual, the target is set in the epic centre. It had an orchid tint, as common with dark energy, and regularly glowed. The illumination alternated from overwhelming bright, to as dim as an old light bulb.

Finally, the dainty blonde prances on to the focal point, standing over the deceased swords woman. The staff is lifted high overhead, prompting the woman to proceed with a loud chant. A bunch of random junk involving her love of Jashin and desire to see the Demons roam free in this world is spewed, amidst the chance. 

The finishing touches are applied shortly, and oncethe final incantations are delivered, all of the energy previously released onto the ground converged to the center. Each particle invades Baylea's body, with the end point being a communion along the belly. From this connection, the sorceress is enabled to search beyond the boundaries of this realm, and obtain Baylea's soul from it's resting place.

Although. . . the process is perversion of nature, and thus morphs the once intelligent entity into nothing short of a muscle. It wasn't a change on the body, clearly, but of the spirit, and thus would be permanent. The woman's carcass convulse as if being struck with one thousand volts of electricity. It as like the lifeless body still had some fight in it, and sought to oppose this perversion of mother nature.

But all the same, everything is futile in the face of Asteroth's desire. The deed is done in five minutes, and the energy from before vanishes as with the cell. She looks on eagerly. . . "Did it work?"* - Sun Nov 22 20:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) was pleasantly surprised.

"Ah. . The self proclaimed 'Necromancer Queen' or whatever. Welcome back to the living realm. "

She moves to the side, no longer standing over Baylea. "Get up. I'll cut the chit-chat. I'm Asteroth, the person that has resurrected you, and your new master. Is that clear? I have big plans for you," the Sorceress said with a sly smile. 

That's right, this was perhaps her first big recruit. She was growing tired of sitting around idly, and with enough work, perhaps the Necromancer could build up a significant work force to do her bidding. "Do you recall your name at least?"* - Sun Nov 22 20:33:04 2015
