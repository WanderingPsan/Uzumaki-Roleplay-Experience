<br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: What's with you, followin us? - Tue Dec  8 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alex(Ninask115) says: I just....want people to hang out with... - Tue Dec  8 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: There where other people around.. hell, the larger crowd went elsewhere. - Tue Dec  8 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alex(Ninask115) says: Th-That's too.....big... - Tue Dec  8 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alex(Ninask115) says: Hnng, s-sorry... - Tue Dec  8 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) yawns.

She nodded, lethargically. "Yes. That's one of the better establishments in Konoha."

Pit-pat, pit-pat. Easily, she could hear the tiny steps along the cobblestoned road, as Alex seemed intent on following the duo. The woman strided along calmly, each step brimming with confidence until the restaurant had been reached.

Before even taking a seat, a silk handkerchief is produced, wiping along the table and chairs. After properly cleaning, ASteroth planted her rear, while remaining silent during the conversation between Mitsunara and Alex. 

"Ah. You really kept following us. You don't have any friends, child?"* - Tue Dec  8 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: . .  - Tue Dec  8 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ponders on this.

"She may stay, I suppose. After all. . While she may have friends. There is only one Asteroth. . ." The mage declared with a nod. Her tone oozed with pride, as she was truly felt her presence was one of a kind.* - Tue Dec  8 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alex(Ninask115) thinks: I really don't have any friends. Only my bats..... - Tue Dec  8 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) beckons for a waiter.

"I know it is-- But thank you for acknowledging it, I suppose. What's your name?" She'd say to the swordswoman. A hand gestures for Alex to take a seat as well.

Why just stand around?* - Tue Dec  8 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) pondered for the moment. 

Pasta and Steak? It'd been a while since she had the pleasures of tasting those treats. After debating, the same is ordered. "Make that a double. Mmm, and a single serving of dumplings," She says pleasantly, clearly fond of the dessert. 

As Alex takes a seat, Asteroth's visage moves onward to the young teen.

". . .The hell? Talk. I'm not here to bite you. Well. . . At least not yet." The tone is playful, although there's some truthfullness to the claim. 

"And it's nice to meet you, Mitsunara. To think. . Someone like you traveling so far? It's not often Isee someone ofyour. . . ilk, venturing so far away from 'home.'" Each word is carefully chosen, and cryptic in nature. For a moment, Asteroth's cerulean pupils shifted over, and stared. . .

A notion that read, 'Yeah. I know.'

With that, the blonde just stared to Alex, awaiting the shyness to fade.* - Tue Dec  8 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) taps her fingers impatiently.

After it was made apparent that Alex perhaps wasn't going to order, the waiter moved off to prepare the meal.

". . I see," Asteroth said casually to Mitsunara. They were speaking in code, sure enough. . . But that much was likely unknown to whoever else was in the establishment.

"--And how is what? Tell me. . Little girl. How do you like Konoha so far? I was surprised to see when it was that big-chested bimbo that took charge over everyone else. Do you know why no one else even considered becoming Kage?"* - Tue Dec  8 02:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alex(Ninask115) says: ..... - Tue Dec  8 02:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: . .  - Tue Dec  8 02:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Hah. I wouldn't be surprised. No comments, young one? - Tue Dec  8 02:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Hrm? - Tue Dec  8 02:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks: Asteroth-/Sama/..? - Tue Dec  8 02:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks: Ohhohoho my.. - Tue Dec  8 02:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alex(Ninask115) says: N-No... - Tue Dec  8 02:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) whispers: Damn. You have a lot of minions, huh? - Tue Dec  8 02:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) turns. She gives a gentle wave to Menma.

"Evening. How are you? And take a seat."* - Tue Dec  8 02:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Ah, kid, what's wrong? - Tue Dec  8 02:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alex(Ninask115) says: No...thing. - Tue Dec  8 02:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Clearly. Something is wrong. . Speak. - Tue Dec  8 02:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: ANd yes, I'm fine, Menma. - Tue Dec  8 02:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alex(Ninask115) says: Noth-thing's wrong.... - Tue Dec  8 02:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Ah... - Tue Dec  8 02:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: THen speak concisely.. - Tue Dec  8 02:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: I think I offended the kid, going off about the Hokage.. - Tue Dec  8 02:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Ah? - Tue Dec  8 02:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alex(Ninask115) says: N-No....not that.. - Tue Dec  8 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Hrm? Then what, m'dear. - Tue Dec  8 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: I got you a Present Asteroth-sama. - Tue Dec  8 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) has her attention immediately obtained.

"Really? I do like. . . gifts."* - Tue Dec  8 02:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Mrm? - Tue Dec  8 02:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) opens the box.

Her eyes showed anticipation. . ! What did she see?* - Tue Dec  8 02:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) was surprised!

She quickly grabbed the bundle of cash, and pockets it inside her wallet. Asteroth was beaming -- and this was rare, considering just how grompy she'd been practically her whole life.

"Wow! Where did you get this from?"* - Tue Dec  8 02:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: My.. - Tue Dec  8 02:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: You have such loyal.... 'freinds', Asteroth- I'm quite impressed. - Tue Dec  8 02:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alex(Ninask115) says: ..... - Tue Dec  8 02:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Well. . I am a people's person. - Tue Dec  8 02:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Mrm, I can see that.... you seem like the kind of person it pays to get to know better, mrm... I wonder when our food will get here. - Tue Dec  8 02:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||
The aroma was pleasing. 

Coupled that pleasant scent with the joy Asteroth felt due to the large source of wealth suddenly bestowed to here, and well. . Today was a good day. Joyously, she took the utensils and began to cut down on the treat, bringing the food to her mouth and taking nibbles. 

"Delicious! Also, I owe you one for this, Menma. . . So, Mitsunara. After this, you and I should have a word privately, understood? As for the young one. . " With some annoyance, the blonde's gaze shifts to Alex. She fights back the urge to roll her eyes at the kunoichi's odd attitude.

"If you're going to be antisocial. You might as well leave."* - Tue Dec  8 03:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: .... - Tue Dec  8 03:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) whispers: ....Was this kid raised by wolves, or something? - Tue Dec  8 03:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) whispers: No idea.. - Tue Dec  8 03:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) squinted curiously given Alex's strange nature.

". . Come back here. . ." She lost the careful tone, seemingly demanding. Her eyes narrowed more, suspicious, yet also intrigued.

"What is there to fear? I'm not even being mean yet.."* - Tue Dec  8 03:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks: ...'Yet'. - Tue Dec  8 03:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Kid... I'd do it. - Tue Dec  8 03:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Mrm.. - Tue Dec  8 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shhifts her glance between Menma and Alex.

"Oi. . What is this, your long-lost sister, Menma? You were just the same."

A finger pointed to the seat. "Take a chair and eat, kid." Again, the tone is demanding, as if Alex had no choice in the matter. Assuming compliance, half of asteroth's meal is split and shoved forward.* - Tue Dec  8 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) narrowed her gaze with a sigh.

"Right. You eat that and chat with my pal, Menma. I want to go speak to Mitsunara here privately for a second. Understood? Be here when I come back."

After taking a lasting bite, the woman presses against the table to lift her form up. A hand gestures for the swordswoman to lead the way.* - Tue Dec  8 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) calmly follows and stops within a random patch of sand.

"Right. . Necromancer? It's odd seeing one out here. Usually, you guys are so stuffed up the Huevo's ass that you never bother to explore. . " She gazes, giving a glance to the sword perched onto the kenjutsu user's side.

"So. Is that why you suddenly took notice to myself and Claud?"* - Tue Dec  8 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) scoffed.

"I don't associate with them. Although, I have abused a friend's connection. The only time i've spent was as a child to hone my ability," Asteroth replies in clear detest. She didn't like the Huevo for one reason or another -- which was mostly due to jealousy or envy.

"I'm surprised you can stand Sunagakure. My nephew claimed there was a priest that gave us trouble. I'd have killed the man already. ."* - Tue Dec  8 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) raises a brow.

"Fortuitous how? I doubt either of us have shared interests, or goals," the necromanceress declared casually. Her hand waved, dismising Mitsunara's presumptions initially.

"I am curious, however. . Are you powerful? What skills do you possess? I would very much like to see."

Her dull eyes hid her true desire to uncover Mitsunara's strength, and perhaps even her weakness. Even as the idle chit-chat was performed, Asteroth was mentally plotting, looking for anyway to gain some leverage -- if possible.* - Tue Dec  8 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's lips spreaded into a grin. So far, Asteroth liked what she say.

Her eyes were mesmorize as the dark purple glow emanated from the sword's form, oozing of malice and dark energies. Still, she recognized it as a low leveled technique for any Death Bringer.

"Not bad. . So a swords woman. I don't participate in. . such brutish tasks. For obvious reasons -- I mean, look at me. However, I'm not particularly inept in spells. For example. . Try this on for size. . !" Asteroth declared happily. With very little preparation, her dark energies crept up out of nowhere, and formed along her hand.

For the briefest of moments, the spellcastor chanted, allowing the plasma-like energy to be casually manipulated and gain a wide-spreaded width. With ease, the energy speeds forward, coverintg about twenty five meters. Every portion of the radius is consumed with a translucent, orchid tinted wave of dark mana, which inevitably pushes Mitsunara back a few feet-- although it does no damage.

"And that's just one. . Likewise, I can conjure up beasts. Some that may even be able to defeat you-- and other spells."* - Tue Dec  8 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's hand rose, covering her maw. 

Like a little schoolgirl, Asteroth giggled, finding joy at Mitsunara's apparently plea. "My. . you sound like you dont' even want to ask for my help. And certainly. . What I showed now is hardly the extent of my ability. Especially in summoning," the mage said in a boastful, and teasing fashion.

She'd sit onto the grass, pondering.

"What I'd ask of you to learn from isn't likely possible. I'd demand servitude. What would you suggest?" * - Tue Dec  8 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) tilted her head.

"That's an agreeable. However, it's unlike I can even force you to do my bidding. I need to have someway to have a hold under you. . "

Going off of that, a single hand is pivotedforward. A dark gathering of energy pivoted about, seemingly being manifested from nowhere. As the amassment builds up, a sphere is crafted, this time breaking off into five different pieces. Effortlessly, the sorceress sends the trio of sharpened projectiles, and impale the wood.

"Not that it wouldn't be worthwhile, of course. I probably won't be able to teach you much of my summoning, based on your religion, that is. I gather creatures from the realm of Jashin."* - Tue Dec  8 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Naturally I'll be teaching you other useful spells. Although, the nifty ones are harder to learn. - Tue Dec  8 04:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Of course. Nothing worth using, is easy. - Tue Dec  8 04:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Still- my questions remain. How do you intend to have... a hold, over me? - Tue Dec  8 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: That's what I'm thinking. - Tue Dec  8 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Hrm.. - Tue Dec  8 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: I don't have much I value to hold hostage, so.. - Tue Dec  8 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I can't exactly put my curse onto you. - Tue Dec  8 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Hrm? A curse..? - Tue Dec  8 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mhm. - Tue Dec  8 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: What manner of curse is this? Or... no, you said it's not possible here, so. - Tue Dec  8 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Irrelevant, I suppose? - Tue Dec  8 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: It's possible. - Tue Dec  8 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: But not appealing. - Tue Dec  8 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: You'd essentially be under my spell. - Tue Dec  8 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: I see. - Tue Dec  8 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Hrm.. - Tue Dec  8 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Mind Control? - Tue Dec  8 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Mind Control is... not acceptable, yse. - Tue Dec  8 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Alright. I'll teach you, I suppose. But you work for me. - Tue Dec  8 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Before we begin, tell me. - Tue Dec  8 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Any dreams or actual goals in mind? - Tue Dec  8 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: That's not the only thing I want- but it's the easiest summation. - Tue Dec  8 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I see. - Tue Dec  8 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mmm. . I'll give you a proposition, i suppose. - Tue Dec  8 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Alright. - Tue Dec  8 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I will help yougain strength. But you're too join me. I too tire of the Huevo.. - Tue Dec  8 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: And wish to form my own network -- filled with our kind. - Tue Dec  8 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: You'll be the first of many recruited within my ranks. - Tue Dec  8 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Potentially even a lieutenant -- given that I don't know your true strength. - Tue Dec  8 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: In exchange, I'll aid you gain strength. Understood? But I expect my word to be taken seriously.. - Tue Dec  8 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) scratches her cheek in thought.

"I once heard of a man with the most powerful body of all. He was a Kumogakure shinobi. Find his body, and take it from the grave, decayed or not. Then deliver it to my home for storage. He'll be of use later. In exchange, you can come and get a basic spell scroll to return home with. I'll message you later when i'm ready to teach you further," Asteroth declared. * - Tue Dec  8 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Alright.  - Tue Dec  8 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mmm. Pleasure fchatting with you. - Tue Dec  8 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: And a pleasure meeting you... Hopefully.. - Tue Dec  8 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: This can be the begining of a long, profitable freindship. - Tue Dec  8 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: I'll see you around, mrm? - Tue Dec  8 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) rudely squeezes inbetween NIgen and Kuro and heads off!* - Tue Dec  8 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Come. - Tue Dec  8 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: A'right. - Tue Dec  8 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) was surprised.

"You can actually carry that ogre around? Come, to my home quickly." She briskly moves along the ground, before reaching the house estate. The door is cracked open and she leads to the basement.* - Tue Dec  8 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) perked a brow at that.

"And why would he tell you? --And more importantly, how did you get him to let you stay?" The underground cellar is revealed, frigid in nature. "Toss it into there. I'll handle it later."* - Tue Dec  8 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Ah. . Hopefully that doesn't incite rage. In anycase, I will give you this basic spell to work on your own. I'll call you later for more hands on training I suppose. - Tue Dec  8 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: A deal is a deal. - Tue Dec  8 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) pulls out a basic scroll from her drawer. It's handed over to Mitsunara.* - Tue Dec  8 06:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods.

"That you should."* - Tue Dec  8 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Farewell, for now. - Tue Dec  8 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) yawns.

"Boredom. What's even going on here anyway? You all the bodyguards?" Asteroth states in an all-too-casual tone.* - Tue Dec  8 07:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shook her head.

"I didn't come to see her. Just out of boredom. Who are you? You're super friendly. The name's Asteroth--" THen comes HELLA shinobi out of nowhere.* - Tue Dec  8 07:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: What. .? - Tue Dec  8 07:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Oh her Asteroth... - Tue Dec  8 07:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Get ready... there might me trouble... hide of you need to - Tue Dec  8 07:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: ... - Tue Dec  8 07:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Packed. - Tue Dec  8 07:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) whispers: ...Ah, all that said, it's very nice to meet you, Miss Asteroth! - Tue Dec  8 07:23:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) doesn't take his arm, of course.

She walks just a few paces behind Menma, each sense being applied to remain aware of the surrounding. "Where are we going?" THe blonde questioned nonchalantly.* - Thu Dec 10 02:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) would have continued to move behind the Uchiha.

She casually looked around the surrounding areas, ensuring that there was nothing to be cautious of along the way. In time, the two official reach the restaurant -- the one commonly chosen by Asteroth personally.

The Necromancer sported a grin, mostly as Menma wipes her chair.

"Good. You pay attention." A seat is taken onto the comfty couch. "HAve you found any progress in the assignment?"* - Thu Dec 10 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) gives a glance to Akechi.

It seemed her date for the evening had dazed off. A hand waves, and both eyes look the woman up and down.

"Funny. . you work here?" How small the world was. Asteroth took had once been an employee in this same establishment.* - Thu Dec 10 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shook her head. 

Menma had lond since gone unresponsive for one reason or another. "Nope, I think he's dazed out. Funny that you work here, I used too as well, a few years back," she nonchalantly notes.

"And simply put  together a complaint. Rias craves approval, she'll tend to your needs."

Asteroth gives the girl the ol' up and down, mentally comparing their own physiques. Naturally, she remained calmed, given that Akechi's was deemed inferior.* - Thu Dec 10 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shrugs. She wasn't exactly a social butterfly.

"I was hired by a manager. I didn't interact with much of the staff, just came and did my job. . . " The Necromancer admits. Notably, there wasn't any food on the table, nore any drinks -- the duo of Menma and Asteroth had clearly arrived shortly ago.

"I suppose not. -- Get us some food, however. We came here just for that."

The tone is partially demanding, but the sheer venom is held back moreso than the usual. "Then you may seat."* - Thu Dec 10 05:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) doesn't seem to mind Akechi's innocence. The fact that she misses the subtle hostility is hardly anything of note -- not everyone thought Asteroth was constantly trying to get under her skin. Mainly because she actually wasn't, this was just apart of the mage's persona.

In no time, several employees come rushing over, prepared to serve her.

After some time thinking, the blonde speaks. "Hrm. . . A plate of lasagna, some garlic bread. And. . surprise me with something sweet. No drinks," Asteroth commanded. No point is even made to look over a menu.

With a yawn, she gestures to the two seats still available. "Konoha is a very dull town, you know."* - Thu Dec 10 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) grunts.

"It's painfully boring. . Sometimes, so much that I want to rip my hair out," Asteroth sharply replies. Konoha was essentially a desolate wasteland -- but it had its perks. Not many people knew to come there to harass her.

For a moment, the Necromancer is lost in thought, before shaking off the daze.

"Honestly. There should be -something- going on. Mundane missions aren't the only for shinobi to do. What about village-wise exercises to give experience? Something of note. . maybe a competition ith the prize of being 'Hokage for a day.'" She yawns, speaking up a storm.

"But whatever, not my village."* - Thu Dec 10 05:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shook her head.

"There being nothing to do is both good and bad. Good that it doesn't attract any attention. . I hate being in populated or revelant places. It tends to draw un-needed headaches. See. . .Kirigakure. But as you could probably tell, I am a woman that needs something to keep my attention. . "

She huffs, and looks to the right as the waitress moves in.

The plates of food are settled onto the floor. "And when I'm bored, get restless. Maybe even reckless. . ."* - Thu Dec 10 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: Eh... - Thu Dec 10 07:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) smirked at the reply.

She pauses, and soon goes to dig into her meal. Asteroth had a strange level of grace to her posture, which carried over to each movement -- even the smallest. Gently, the lasagna is cut into small pieces, and a selective fork is utilizes to pick up the cheesy and meaty dish.

Sauce trailed from it's form, forcing orange-reddish droplets to cascade off the dish and onto the plate, splashing like a raindrop. Thankfully, none manages to get onto the Necromancer's tightly fitted, and well-crafted dress. After muching, the woman turns, nodding just a tad.

"Sneaky? Perhaps. But it leaves the peace. . .And yes, I have a hobby. But it just isn't too interesting. And grows boring after repetition. 'Sides being a waitress. . What do you even do around here?"* - Thu Dec 10 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) gives Nigen the stink eye briefly.

Her attention remains onto Akechi amidst the eating process. 

". . .Sounds like an uneventful life. You should get out more, and do more things. . " A quick glance is given around. "Not that this place has much to offer. My assistant here, Menma. . He constantly looks for activities to do. He'd certainly be interested. . "

From that moment, Asteroth glanced forward, taking none of the faint blushing.

"Amusing. And perhaps you aren't, you do say that you'rej ust a genin, after all. But fret not. . . Everyone must begin somewhere. After all, I wasn't born a goddess, I just became one."* - Thu Dec 10 07:22:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods.

"You should. Plenty to do-- And suddenly. . "

She exhales. "I've lost my appetite. Mmm. . Wonder why."* - Thu Dec 10 07:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I couldn't help overhearing your conversation. - Thu Dec 10 07:28:00 2015

"Asteroth.."* - Thu Dec 10 07:28:51 2015
