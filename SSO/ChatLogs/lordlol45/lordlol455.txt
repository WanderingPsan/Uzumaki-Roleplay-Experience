<br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) gestures the creature forward. It closes in, but doesn't yet attack.* - Sat Oct 10 06:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) sighs.

The Gulab summoning sends a tentacle forward, speedily aiming to strikethrough Azure's shoulder. Another is moving in unison, intent on getting the male right in the knee, thus making evasion and fleeing impossible.

"Oi. . . This is bad. I'd love to leave you alive. . . I really would," the girl says in a neutral tone. She really didn't give a shit.

"But you've seen my pet. And you've seen my skill. I can't have word getting out, you know. . "* - Sat Oct 10 06:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) perks a brow.

The girl was genuinely surprised. He had managed to endure the blow? Wasting no time at all, the spikes are sunken, allowing the tentacles to again wrap around Azure's frame, binding him from the looks of things.

"And what use would you have for me?" She gestures for Kojiro, AKA Yami, to continue with his assault so that a proper meal could be had.* - Sat Oct 10 06:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Kojiro(Parris111) whispers: Tf is he?) - Sat Oct 10 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||It was fortunate that no one was in this ghost town.

She sends away the summoning creature immediately, and gave Kojiro the space he'd require in order to grow more powerful. "Good. . .That should be enough to sate your hunger for a few weeks, no? I'd hate to have to feed you more. . . things may become irritating," Asteroth notes. Again, she calls to be carried.

"Search the village for anyone of significance."* - Sat Oct 10 06:42:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: Mm. . Mm. . - Sat Oct 10 06:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Near the collar-bone. - Sat Oct 10 06:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: What brings you folks to Konoha? - Sat Oct 10 06:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: What is a shinobi without a kage? - Sat Oct 10 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: It is my desire to fix what was broken. - Sat Oct 10 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Kage or not. - Sat Oct 10 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I knew your previous leader, you know. He was a very. . . strange man. Shame. - Sat Oct 10 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: That's why Uncle Hideki is going to be it.. - Sat Oct 10 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Tell me. - Sat Oct 10 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Who runs this village? - Sat Oct 10 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: No-one. - Sat Oct 10 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) smirks. She continues to look ahead, devious thoughts roaming her cranium.

"Oh? And why haven't you all sought a replacement?"* - Sat Oct 10 06:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods.

"Funds. I see. . ."* - Sat Oct 10 06:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Given the swing of your questions. - Sat Oct 10 06:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) thinks: I really can't keep up with the influx of strange people showing up in the village. Then again, I can't really over-step my bounds either... Sigh... This would be easier with direction,.. No such thing for miles... - Sat Oct 10 06:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I have. - Sat Oct 10 06:55:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Not a lot. - Sat Oct 10 06:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: About half a million. - Sat Oct 10 06:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: It'd take millions, I'm afraid. - Sat Oct 10 06:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: It can be used to build up some houses. - Sat Oct 10 06:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: The village doesn't have to be rebuilt immediately. - Sat Oct 10 06:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: It's a gradual process. - Sat Oct 10 06:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: True, but that worries me even more. - Sat Oct 10 06:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Why invest so much? - Sat Oct 10 06:56:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) coughs.

"--- Oh. . . and to care about the little people," she says emotionlessly, her eyes canting towards the side.* - Sat Oct 10 06:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) thinks: Doesn't sound genuine at all. Same as Hideki, personal gain.. If I'm correct... Then again, if it's helping the village who am I to complain..? Still. - Sat Oct 10 07:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: What of the young one? - Sat Oct 10 07:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: What brings you to this village? - Sat Oct 10 07:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) thinks: Damn. - Sat Oct 10 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) turns her head about.

". . .Excuse me?" She says, unsure of why Nozumi suddenly ceased speaking.

Visage is shifted onto Heiwa shortly after. "Evening. I believe I asked you a question?" Asteroth stated in a more gentle tone, even if it still was brimming with a bit of. . . snobbiness.

"You left the village of Kumogakure- - Yes, I recall you now. What brings you here?"* - Sat Oct 10 07:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods, understanding this all. 

She turns and moves towards a fence-- and wipes it down with a handkerchief so that she can lean on it. 

"Right then. It seems logical. Although there is no more danger in Kumogakure, if you were wondering," the lass says casually. She stares ahead, wondering the next course of action.

"How many shinobi do you reckon remain here?"* - Sat Oct 10 07:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) thinks: That's a dangerous question to answer. - Sat Oct 10 07:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: I don't know. - Sat Oct 10 07:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Not even an estimate? - Sat Oct 10 07:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: It'd be different if people actually remained. - Sat Oct 10 07:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Our villages numbers are not a constant. - Sat Oct 10 07:26:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: That guy looks familiar, but..no. He's dead. He was with..that medic. - Sat Oct 10 07:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: Would they even accept a non-shinobi? - Sat Oct 10 07:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: To be frank. - Sat Oct 10 07:29:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: You speak as if I'm a terrorist. - Sat Oct 10 07:30:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I suppose. To the west, yes. - Sat Oct 10 12:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) follows casually.

She's a bit skeptical of Cypher's emergence in Konoha to be frank. He could be putting up an act.

Nevertheless, as the jacket is laid down, she goes to plant her rear on it. "Mmm. Did the masked man leave?"* - Sat Oct 10 12:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: Masked. Wonder who it is. - Sat Oct 10 12:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nodded along.

"Good. I'll probably look around myself as well. I don't know why. . .But I'm pretty optimistic about my chances," she says casually in reference to her desires to be deemed a 'Queen.' Of course, thedesire to lead Konoha went so much further than just gaining social status.

In no time, she's leaning back, assuming the jacket is enough to account for the rest of her body -- the floor was dirty. Once there, a leg is lifted for Cypher to work on.* - Sat Oct 10 13:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) wore boots. They weren't thick, and could easily be mistaken for durable slippers.

"Mhm. I hope. The village failed last time because of Erebus and his agenda. It drove too many people away," Asteroth comments nonchalantly while waiting for Cypher to do his thing.* - Sat Oct 10 13:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's boot is removed to reveal her tiny feet. Each nail is polished, and the skin is as smooth as can be, flawless even. It isn't long before Cypher begins.

Asteroth wore the usual disgruntled or displeased expression through it all, her gaze scrutinizing in nature. "Not bad," the woman spoke with neutrality. There was no need to give praise, as it would grant complacency.

* - Sat Oct 10 13:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) remained mostly unresponsive as Cypher worked his damned hardest to bring her pleasure in the massage.

There's a faint fidget as the boy begins to move in circular motions along the heel-- it indeed had a good deal of tension.  Quickly after, Asteroth settles, remaining as composed as ever.

"So tell me more of yourself. Have you any dreams or ambitions?"* - Sat Oct 10 14:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) raised a brow.

She hummed softly, mainly once Cypher had began to pull on her toes. It felt mildly good -- the boy definitely know what he was doing. Clearly, Asteroth adored being pampered, considering her upbringing. Although, there was a slight lack of satisfaction, as Cypher wasn't particularly forced to do this task.

"Keep up the good work. . . But what do you mean, 'have fun.' Words are opened to interpretation, that could mean anything."

She knew that fact all too well. Her definition of 'cute' often went starkly against popular opinion. * - Sat Oct 10 14:50:27 2015
