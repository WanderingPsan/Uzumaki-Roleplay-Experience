<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) had just walked into the area. 

With a scoff, she looked downward, examining the dead body that was apparently impaled and stuck onto the nearby tree. Oddly, the gruesome sight didn't seem to unsettle the girl, although there was a look of repulsion on her face. 

"Just a girl. . . looking to explore the world. After all, you never know what will happen given the warring state," she replies sharply upon hearing Haru's voice. She seemed to be a well off girl. Her clothes were finely crafted, she sported jewelry and well-kept hair. And of course, the simple manner in which Asteroth walked expressed one thing -- Wealth and high social status.

". . .Although, I suppose I chose the wrong place to come examine." Her eyes again gesture back to the dead body.* - Thu Sep 17 15:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) scratches her nose. Her eyes remained on the carcass, and by now, it's hard to determine whether she's captivated or just too shocked to look away.

Eventually, however, given enough time, Asteroth's gaze falls back onto Haru. "I come from. . . Uh. A far place. The 'Land of Tea'. Or well, a small village in that small country. I figured I should come and observe this chaotic part of the world. . " she says with a subtle frown.

"Shouldn't you like. . . clean up this body?"* - Thu Sep 17 16:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) rubs her nose.

"Oh. . .Pardon me. I gave a glance and figured you to be a shinobi. ." She says, now distancing herself away from that mutilated corpse. Her hand rises, and she yawns casually -- although not in a way that suggests boredom. It depicted partial fatigue, as she had just arrived in Konoha after all.

"But I suppose it is none of my business. I definitely don't want to get blood on me. So. . . what is there for a tourist to do in Konoha?"* - Thu Sep 17 16:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) looked on dully.

Perhaps she had chosen the wrong village to come explore? "I see. . .And what is that you do to pass time? I'm certain. . .You don't simply lounge around, wondering why the village is boring. That would be a very dull life to lead," she says, chuckling a bit to herself right after. 

Her feet continued to move, distancing her body away from the carcass towards the right. Asteroth remained curious -- what in the world did this guy do? If he wasn't a shinobi that is.* - Thu Sep 17 16:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shrugged.

"Well. . .I'm not exactly keen on seeing dead bodies. I am not fighter, shinobi. . savage -- whatever those people are referred to these days. It's unsightly that someone saw it fit to leave in public. Nevertheless, I suppose I will have to go find something to occupy my time," she says. Abruptly, she turns about face, purposely ensuing that she no longer had a view of that ravished corpse.* - Thu Sep 17 17:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tatagami, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Hm, maybe you should try a different village. - Thu Sep 17 17:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tatagami, Haru(Dopespruit) says: But it's dangerous to travel in the current situation. - Thu Sep 17 17:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Hrm. . ? I just came from Sunagakure. - Thu Sep 17 17:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tatagami, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Well, there's still Kirigakure. - Thu Sep 17 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tatagami, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Kumogakure and Amegakure as well. - Thu Sep 17 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tatagami, Haru(Dopespruit) says: How did you actually get from Sunagakure to Konohagakure? - Thu Sep 17 17:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tatagami, Haru(Dopespruit) says: It's dangerous to travel alone. - Thu Sep 17 17:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Hrm? I paid for transportation. - Thu Sep 17 17:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tatagami, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Well that works. - Thu Sep 17 17:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods. She heads off to find some other form of entertainment in Konohagakure.* - Thu Sep 17 18:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: . . . What are you doing here? - Thu Sep 17 18:42:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: | - Thu Sep 17 20:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) would have leapt on a nearby wall formation. She has a wooden staff in hand, and uses it as a crutch to lean on. 

"Mmm. . .WHat's going on here?" the lass murmurs.* - Thu Sep 17 20:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: \ - Thu Sep 17 21:11:15 2015

She's captivated by the giant snake summon. "Oooh. That's pretty cool. Is this the true extent of a shinobi's power?"She murmured. Not once did Asteroth flinch upon seeing Manda's beeline towards Yan.

Harvada Ray - Using Negative energy, the Necromancer fires a continous flow of energy in sets of three spheres.

Pandora’s Box - Commanding the shadows, the user summons rays of darkness to form a box around their target. The box is then stabbed with numerous blades of shadow to bind and injure the target. 

Soul Amplifier - The Necromancer concentrates all the negative energy they can muster to consume their soul. It erodes the soul itself, but empowers the spiritual power the user has, making them darker and stronger(spiritually) for as long as the technique is active. * - Mon Sep 21 01:31:56 2015

Regime change. . ! Regime change!

A whole lot of bullshit. As usual, Asteroth cared little for paying attention to worldly affairs. While she appeared to be just an ordinary citizen? The woman in fact was an entirely different species -- part of the Necromancer race. And of course, a potent user of Dark Magic. 

She'd manuever along the road, hips swaying every now and then, all until her house had been breached. The door is pushed against, and begins to slide open with a creak. The sound made one thing apparent -- she's been here for quite a while. Casually, the woman sways inward, and closes the door behind. The entire housing area is frigid, cold enough to make your entire body rock or shiver if you weren't used to the drastic temperature change.

Of course, Asteroth paid the climate no mind. She preferred such, simply so that her 'toys' could potentially remain in better condition. ANd by toys. . . I meant 'bodies.' Indeed, she could 'romance' the dead, as in raise them back, no matter how powerful they may be. Sadly, there remained severe limitations in that skill -- at least for now.

After settling within her home, the constant usage of 'Chakra Suppresion' comes to an end. No longer would her dark energies be kept bottled up due to her paranoia. Her mana spews out, granting a brief aura of darkness that hugs every inch and layer of flesh. "Ah. . .It feels good to be able to unwind for just a little bit. I suppose now. . . I should check on my pets. I'm sure they've been missing me greatly. . ." A wooden staff is taken from underneath her mattress, and by this point, the object is used as a focal or gathering point for a large quantity of dark energy.

The wooden tool gains a purplish skin as an increasingly potent quantity of power begins to build up. Eventually, her mouth is flapping, and her voice box uttering various sound effects. As it would turn out, these were simple, yet magical incantations. Her voice practically vibrated through the realms themselves, and seepedi nto the resting place of her master -- Lord Jashin.

Sadly, Asteroth lacked the tools to truly bring about that monstrosity. Thus, she'd settle with the lackies. The blonde's body quivered as a warm overcame her dainty frame -- it was thrilling to use dark magic. Moreso because it brought her so close to the very being she desired. . .The one that shit admired. . . lived for -- and envied. Oh, why was this poor thing cursed with only being a half-breed. Or rather worse, a non-demon.

After some time, the immense energy that surged through the staff is put to use. It assaults the space-time continuum itself, ripping open a portal towards the dark worlds. Unfortunately, it wasn't a physical portal, nor one that would last for long. In time, the power continued to build up, overloading the space, and releasing a plume of corrosive, lavender spunk. As it clears, a simple. . . Jar was left in it's wake? 

It wobbled around, as the glassy/metal exterior enforced a bit of rumbling. Before long, the creature settles.

"Come now, my pretty . . . No need to be shy. Reveal yourself!" the maniac yelled excitedly. She truthfully enjoyed the mere presence of a demonic entity, as it showed her just a glimpse of what true greatness existed beyond this world. To think, so many chaotic, yet god-like entities were just beyond her reach. Ones that greatly exceeded the might of these simple-minded Yokai that she could conjure. 

At her behest, from the jar's interior comes strange, blackened arms. Legs follow shortly after, and soon the bulky construction moves ahead. It's speed leaves much to be desired. . .And once close, it. . 

Awww. It hugs! Sadly, this sickens Asteroth. On cue, A hand flicks forward, prompting the dark energy spears to manifest. They move, piercing right through the summon's body, and forcing a disperse.* - Tue Sep 22 04:41:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Just need those gauntlets for my fist watch. - Tue Sep 22 19:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) leaned against the fence.

She vaguely recalls Flexus' appearance, but says nothing on the matter. After some thought, her eyes drift onto Max. ". . .This village is so dull. . . I thought with a 'zealot' Kage. ..  things would be more interesting," Asteroth muttered to herself with mild irritation.

That said, from her pocket, a book is retrieved. There is no title shown on it, nor are any words really visible unless you were looking directly onto the pages. Possessively eyes fall onto the coarse sheets, and her visage is scanning the items for information. Casually, the woman's mouths the words as she reads along, gaining a wealth of information.* - Tue Sep 22 19:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hello. - Tue Sep 22 20:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) had been moving down the road with a confident stride. Her fine clothing fluttered in the wind, that seemed to be relatively restless on this particularly evening. Despite the turbulence, Asteroth still held a regal persona or demeanor admist the travel.

Of course, as the walking occured, vision was not directed towards the surrounding, nor on the road. Rather, it was glued onto a book that was seated right in her left hand. Almost obssessively, the lass continued to read the words, her lips occasionally moving as she instinctually mouthed the contents being studied.

Thus, Ushinawa's original approach would have gone missed. 

Accidentally, her swaying hips bumps against Ushinawa's form, effectiving giving a hip-check. 'Startled', Asteroth recoils back, her frame pushing against the fence. "Oh. . You again. The guy that randomly came and tried to burn the mansion down," the blonde muttered casually. Distance is kept, however, just incase this guy was crazy.* - Tue Sep 22 21:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Have you seen a man by the name of Kenshin? - Tue Sep 22 21:21:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shook her head. 

While she was 'unattentive', Asteroth indeed was very aware of her surrounding. Her senses constantly wondered about, taking a survey of the field. 

"Nimble," the citizen thought.

"I haven't seen nor heard of a man named Kenshin, no."* - Tue Sep 22 21:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I see... - Tue Sep 22 21:22:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Hmph.. why is his name Speedstar? - Tue Sep 22 21:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Probably because he's super fast? - Tue Sep 22 21:28:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) scratches her head.

This conversation got awkward pretty fast. He looks as it seemed Ushinawa had prance off -- likely due to being busy. "Err. That's your friend? I saw him here once before. . ." the woman speaks, seemingly unnerved.

"He was. . . Pretty scary. Burned down an entire mansion. I thought for a second that I was going to be next," Asteroth exhaled on the comment, though falls relaxed seconds later.* - Tue Sep 22 21:42:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) scratches her nose upon seeing the rising tension.

"And what. . You think someone is going to try and ransack Konoha before it can rise again?--" Her eyes fall onto Hideki, who now seemed to have malicious intent.

No comment is given, but going by the look on her face, Asteroth is clearly judging the guy.* - Tue Sep 22 22:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) thinks: Yeah, don't like her. - Tue Sep 22 22:18:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) walks into the area.

Upon reaching the table, she does a court bow, while waving towards the girl. "How cute. . . I suppose you are the Hokage's daughte? Do know when your father will be in? I'd like to ask about gathering a few scrolls on ninjutsu," Asteroth comments.

Of course, she appeared to be a simple citizen. Her energy was low, to a point where you'd have trouble even detecting her with sensory ability -- almost as is she were dead. 

There's a forced smile worn, to mask the woman's typically sour expression. Had to be on her best behavior.* - Fri Sep 25 02:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) perks a brow.

"Just to sate my curiosity. . " mused Asteroth. She peered closer, prompting Katsune's features to become more apparent. After some thought, it's clear that this was the interim Hokage, perhaps even the permanent leader.

"It isn't high leveled skills I'm after. I'm not even a shinobi. I just want to see how some of these things work. Like. . .Genjutsu Kiai, the 'Shunshin' technique and so forth," continued the dainty lass. She still wore a fake-ass smile, hoping to butter Katsune up to assist in aid. No comment is given towardsthe bored expression Katsune currently sported.* - Fri Sep 25 02:57:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods.

"Of course I am. I've lived here for months. .. Even before all of these. . " She sighs, annoyed at the increased population.

"People started flooding in. . ." After a pause, Asteroth takes a step forward. Her hands presses against the table, allowing her body to lean over. She doesn't get too close, of course. Her eyes shift on over, and a coy smile forms.

"Something wrong? I hope the pressure of being kage isn't getting to you. . "* - Fri Sep 25 03:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Fri Sep 25 03:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's smile recedes. But on the inside, she's a bundle of joy.

"I take that as a yes. I didn't mean to. . . irritating, you 'ma'am'. . .  Regardless, yes. The scrolls. I'd like to get my hands on them."* - Fri Sep 25 03:07:44 2015

"What. . ?"* - Fri Sep 25 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) seems genuinely baffled.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) exhales, this was becoming annoying.

"If you don't wish to grant knowledge on such basic techniques, I will simply give in, I suppose."

She remains baffled at the suspicion and turns to exit -- before stopping at the sight of the smelly Akimichi.

"Oi. . Why are you here again?"* - Fri Sep 25 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Master...? Maloth...? - Fri Sep 25 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) sticks her nose up.

"Hmph. Really now?" The gal murmurs. She thinks back to the name 'Maloth' and immediately shudders upon thinking of the hideous, monstrous beast.

"Oi. At least you were eating. Glad you're over giving petty threats to random citizens," she murmurs while taking additional steps to exit.* - Fri Sep 25 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shrugs. A book is taken from her side. She reads it upon exitting and continues along the road to reach home.

"Tch. Why do I even come out anymore?"* - Fri Sep 25 03:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||As antisocial as ever, Asteroth continued to linger in her house in solitude.  She smiles, as while in the safety of her home, there was no need to restrict her dark energies even further, and thus she could freely do as she pleases. After waking up in the morning, the dastardly Necromancer is swift to maneuver on towards her basement, and grabs her staff along the way.

Today's training? Was going to be geared entirely towards an area of expertise - the summoning skill, it was this skill that would eventually allow the release of her lord and savior, after all. Indeed. As an accomplished maestro of the Dart Arts, Asteroth possessed the unique ability to not only manipulate an energy source unique from chakra, but she could form a connection with entities beyond this realm. There were many pantheons that one could follow, yet she followed the one true god.
Lord Jashin.

It was from his doing that the blonde-haired, prissy girl was enabled to summon his 'children' or underlings.  Before even beginning with the process, she falls onto her knees, and looks towards a statue. Towards the right? There was a single individual held in bondage, a red-haired, freckle-having teenaged girl.  She's squirming, screaming, and crying up a waterfall. Yet it all mattered little to Asteroth, to be completely honest. 

The captured girl is taken, and placed over a sealing formula on the ground. In a quick, and effective manner, Asteroth produces a sword, and goes to slash at the teen's throat. The slashing continued for the next few minutes, as the poor thing is systematically torn apart. The blood spilled, and oddly moved along the formula on the ground - as the symbol was literally crafted by carving the ground up. Once the crimson blood moved to each area, Asteroth kneeled in the center, allowing the plasma to move onto her flesh. 

This. . . Was a part that she didn't enjoy too greatly. For all her devotion to Lord Jashin, the Necromancer still -despised- getting messy. It was a pet peeve of her's. Regardless, upon kneeling, her head descended and a purple aura runs along her flesh. She's muttering, granting a prayer towards her Lord and Saviour, begging for forgiveness as a result of the lack of efficiency. The praying was fervently engaged in for close to an hour. Speedily, she's cleaning up, and preparing to practice the summoning technique once and for all.* - Fri Sep 25 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) had been sitting down. There's a blanket on the floor, and her eyes are glued to the sheets of her booklets.

"Hrm . . And what's happening here?" Asteroth questioned in a low tone of voice.* - Sun Sep 27 10:25:29 2015

Wore a face that showed no real opinion on the matter. All that was apparent was that same stern, almost irksome expression.

"The apathy. Hrm, I suppose being in the shinobi profession tends to induce such, right?"* - Sun Sep 27 10:31:28 2015

"I guess it's time I go-- Oh wait. . " She murmurs, before pulling out a few cards. Her rotation is cut short, and she's once again facing the group.

"My boss wants me to advertise as well. 'Go Easy Bistro' is having a special-slash-party or whatever. If you guys want to stop by, do so. Might even have some competitions," Asteroth explains. Her voice lacked any enthusiasm, as it was very clear she was coerced into the advertising role.

"Any. . ?"* - Sun Sep 27 10:38:17 2015

"You too."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) had stepped into the establishment. Her head initially is facing the ground, suggesting that perhaps Asteroth didn't -really- want to be here.

". . Bah, the wonders of having to work for a living," the young gal complained, though her self commentary falls short upon taking notice of the apparent engagement of affection. Sitting on her shoulder was a uniform, as that's what was required for employment.

". . .Geez, get a room," the blonde murmurs, seemingly offended by the clear display of fondness. She continues to slide her feet forward towards the counter.* - Sun Sep 27 12:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shifts a gaze onto Erebus once more as he spoke those words. 

There's a thoughtful glance -- but that's all Asteroth gives. Rather, she briefly moves towards the back, getting suited up in her bar maiden gear. 

"Mmm. . Does this man mean he has been blessed by Lord Jashin himself? Nonsense. . ." the woman whispered to herself while changing. 

Eventually, Asteroth moves back to the front desk, leaning against it. "Oi. . . Lovebirds. I'm on duty, I guess. If you have a request, name it." Meanwhile, her peers are gathering the needed supplies.* - Sun Sep 27 12:37:45 2015

"'Finest meal. . ' That could be anything," the youth thought to herself in an angered tone. Her body, however, suggested none of her actual emotions. In a leisurely pace, she saunters on over back to the counter, and gives the order. 

"Get some of the good wine out. . . .And bread for some reason. While you're at it, roast up some medium rare. . . Boar meat." 

It isn't long for the order to be complete -- ten minutes at the most. After placing it on the cart, Asteroth rolls it on over, and casually begins to unload the dishes onto the table. Her eyes were neutral, but she held an aura about her. . . Boy, were these two being judged for having the audacity to do these semi-lewd acts in general, nevermind this being public.

"There you go. . .That will be five-grand. Of course. . . complementary tip." A hand motions towards the arriving party, gesturing for them to wait.* - Sun Sep 27 13:09:20 2015

"Will try. . " she says with flatly, and with a stereotypical, anime-esque 'Hmph' at the end. Of course, despite the attitude issues, Asteroth knew when to choose her battles. She turns, and waddles on over to the arriving gentlemen.

"Evening, how may I help you?" Cue fake-ass smile.* - Sun Sep 27 13:17:52 2015

"Milkshake and Dumplings. You two have sweet tooths, clearly enough," Asteroth said in a lazy tone. Quickly, she turns and begins to head off. Considering the ease of the order, there was no need to actually go to the other employees.

Instead, she personally fulfills the order. 

Her delicate digits move through the assortment of utensils, snaking out a cup and top. As the container is held under the milshake machine, filling up, Asteroth is placing the dumplings into an oven. THey're heating quite quickly, in about five minutes, the thick, yet doughy material is pluffed out to perfection. They're glazed, and of course, a side-dish of cream is gathered into a bowl. 

Having completed it all, the bar maiden has each of the items set on a tray. With a confident stride, hips occasionally swaying, the casual Konohagakure citizen manages to reach the duo's table. The contents are set. "There, there. Don't worry about paying now, I suppose. I'll give you the bill once done."* - Sun Sep 27 13:32:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) is swift to continue with her daily training exercises. Konohagakure was slowly becoming a morei ntriguing village. Especially with the discovery of a full-fledged Jashinist. Erebus was an effective counterpart. While Asteroth had been gifted with the ability to summon creatures from a different realm, this strange man had actually uncovered the 'immortality.'

It was a high honor, reserve for only the most devouted members of the faith. Yet despite Erebus' high status, the male had still rubbed Asteroth the wrong way. Just thinking about the previous meeting made the blonde's skin shiver. "Why is a nasty guy like that. . . given Jashin's supreme blessing. It doesn't making any damn sense. . "

As per usual, she'd begin the ritual by first pulling out a morning sacrifice. This time, it was an elderly man, one that had been bamboozled to going back to Asteroth's place the previous night. Despite her reserved and prude-like nature, the Necromancer was no stranger to using her flawless appearance in order to lure around foolish, perverted men. And that's precisely how this elderly man had been captured.

The sequence was what you'd expect of a devout Jashinist. A careless murder, allowing the victim's blood to again trickle along the symbol carved on the ground. Once content, she heads to her bedroom, allowing dark energy to swirl around-- clearly coming from her delicate frame. "Ahh...! It feels good to unwind sometimes. I hate that I have to keep my energy restricted so much when I'm in this village. But this is necessary, I suppose. . . Staying in the Land of Vegetables is no good for me. . "

Indeed, at all times, the blonde-haired woman kept a lock on her power. It was this manuever that kept dark energy signatures undetected by all, save for an opposing priestess. If her energy was kept in a lock, there was no way in hell anyone was going to detect her nature as a Necromancer. Thus, there would be no harrassment.

Opting to start before procrastination set in, Asteroth whips out her handy, dandy staff. It's the focal point of her magic casting as per usual. Once a viel of purple-ish energy came over the object, she's chanting, releasing various incantations. Some may deem her to be a mad woman, but each comment went a long way, allowing for the energy to be more easily controlled.  

In time, all of the power built up again targets the air molecules. The oxygen particles begin to quiver, and are broken down, allowing Asteroth's dark energy to casually attack the space-time continuum itself. It isn't long before a hole in space is being ripped, allowing a brief bond between the Human world, and the realm of Jashin to be linked. Surprisingly, doing so took an astonishingly low amount of power.

Perhaps it was a testament to her growth as a summoner. No. . it was -definitely- a testament, proof that she had been doing the work of her lord and savior to perfection. For a brief moment, you could swear that there was an actual visual, allowing the woman the fortune of seeing the 'Sacred Lands.' 'Course, this was simple hallucinations.

In time, the as the wormhole is split open, a familiar entity is pulled outward. A simple-minded, jar-like demon. One of Asteroth's favored summonings. As usual, it clatters around, having a poor sense of balance due to the abrupt summoning. 

If it had a face, the Furu-Utsubo would be frowning as it was just in admist of getting a meal. Most likely being one of its brethren. "Don't look at me like that. I need to practice. . . Now then. . . I will summon one of your brothers and sisters. . . Err, -or-, rather. " Still feeling relatively rested, her dark mana again is pouring out, gushing from the staff and into the atmosphere.

Asteroth's mouth flapped, releasing another incantation in the area. For that moment, every other problem or thing in the world was shut off, as she applied her absolute focus into the sequence. Perhaps with continued practice and familiarity, the woman would be enabled to eventually summon her creatures without the use of lengthy incantations -- that could easily be interrupted in battle.

Boom!

Lavander energy explodes, building up a gust. Her hair flowed and she staggers back. One cue, another Furu-Utsubo is spawned. Without even saying a word, they rush, battling one another.* - Mon Sep 28 22:51:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) slides her feet along the area, bored out of her mind. Working as a bar maiden tended to lose it's appeal, yet it was a necessary to accomplish her goals. Eventually, her travels land her right into the village's mansion, although her eyes remained on a book. 

Upon seeing that there was someone else in the room, her objective takes an entirely different twist. Beforehand, she had been prepared to 'interview' Erebus, in order to comfirm whether or not he truly was a man of faith. After all, she'd not let any random punk claim to be a devout follower of Jashin, at least not with out proof. 

"Boy. . . Konohagakure really has been rowdy today," Asteroth comments, hoping to break the presumed silence. A curt bow is even given, to butter up the presumably egotistical ruler. 

"Anywho, just stopped by to see if you had any work. My daytime job isn't cutting it," the daintily built woman speaks bluntly. Of course, she was clearly no shinobi, and hoped not to acquire any physical or combative labor. * - Tue Sep 29 00:56:19 2015

The scroll is caught easily, before being pocketed.

"The meal. . I don't really care for the money. I made more than enough that day. However, whenever you're free, I supposed i'd like a word," Asteroth comments. She was still skeptical, even with the shinobi's exploits, was Erebus truly blessed? Although, that skepticism is kept hidden.

Without a second word, she twirls about, her golden locks flick admist the rotation. Assuming not stopped? Asteroth heads off carefully to avoid making contact with the newly arrived Rosa.* - Tue Sep 29 01:19:21 2015
