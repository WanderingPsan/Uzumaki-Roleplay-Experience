<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: If I choose to remove of her. - Mon Oct  5 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: She will be removed by you. - Mon Oct  5 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I don't care. - Mon Oct  5 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: ....And you are? - Mon Oct  5 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I'm sure that a private conversation is what you desire. - Mon Oct  5 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: Pandora is suddenly so much more useful than Kohaku. - Mon Oct  5 03:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: I don't know what transpired over night. - Mon Oct  5 03:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: But it's good. - Mon Oct  5 03:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: I shall go spectate Kohaku's fight with 'the individual'. - Mon Oct  5 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Go on. - Mon Oct  5 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: Suddenly, such obedience. - Mon Oct  5 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) blinks. She remained unsure of who Edge spoke of -- at least initially. Nevertheless, the woman takes a step forward. 

"I am the woman from the letter. 'Raven'. . if you will. And it matters not if the conversation is public, I am simply here to offer my services -- in exchange for you aiding me on occasions."* - Mon Oct  5 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: This seems like a gank situation. - Mon Oct  5 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: Someone behind me, and someone in front of me. - Mon Oct  5 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) had conveniently been carrying a body bag, mind you.

"Indeed. I suppose you'd like a demonstration? Likewise, tell me more of your goals -- if that isnt' too invasive. I've heard the generalized statements -- that you wish to destroy the shinobi system, and the Gezo. Both are prospects that I'm not necessarily against. But certainly, you have a bigger plan in the works, no?"

By now, the body bag is set onto the floor. She kneels, unzipping it in a slow, deliberate fashion.* - Mon Oct  5 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: . . . . . . - Mon Oct  5 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) blinks. As the bag is being unzipped, it isn't anyone of actual importance -- she had left Amu back at her base of operations, after all. 

Asteroth's gaze shifts back up. "You've gone silent. .  Have I've unnerved you?" 

She says with a grin -- which was a rare facial expression for her. The unzipping continues, revealing the resident creepster, Hanabi, former contract holder for the Snake summons. Asteroth's hand drifts to the back, retrieving a marker. 

"Oi. . You don't mind if I draw something up, no?"* - Mon Oct  5 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods. She begins with the boring, tedious process of writing up strange Fuuinjutsu glyphs with markers, something that's easily wash-able when the time comes. This was neccesary, considering her inexperience with the jutsu.

In the end, there are two massive circles drawn, which inevitably intersect. Hanabi's body, the one that came from the bag, is placed within the meeting point. At once, her hands are covered with chaotic, dark energy. This was perhaps the first time Asteroth or rather, 'Raven', had even truly showcased her true might.

The energy dances around the seal, and eventually latches onto Hanabi's body like a wildfire. It pulsates for a moment, before pooling together at the carcass' stomach. Immediately, the energy is dissolved inward, going through the flesh, and sparking life back. Shakingly, Hanabi's once motionlessly frame gained a pulse. Both eyes open, the former summoning specialist is now standing on two legs, looking onward towards both of the mysterious gents ahead.

". . .And that's it. Although, my resurrection for now is limited. Thus I won't exploit it. . . Nevertheless, this is just a fraction of what I can truly accomplish. Imagine with mastery. . ." the Necromancer gloats, hoping to butter the rogue leader up.* - Mon Oct  5 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||As a note, she isn't controlling HAnabi at the moment. If you speak to her, she'd answer.* - Mon Oct  5 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: Absolutely stupendous... - Mon Oct  5 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: She's stupefied me. - Mon Oct  5 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: She has learned how to resurrect the dead. - Mon Oct  5 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: I yearn for such power. - Mon Oct  5 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||The resurrected party looked ahead, examining her own decayed form. Was this really happening? "Long time no see. . .I won't question why I'm here, I suppose. . " The zombie takes eager steps forward, removing the cape that she wore, revealing her amble breasts. "I do own you two solids, didn't I? How are Misa and Hideki. . ?"

Asteroth's hand cringes, as she debates on taking control away from the ridiculously lewd woman, but thankfully she ceased.

". . .You seem so hurt over nothing. . . I am giving her back LIFE! Or would you prefer her to linger underground, decaying into dust? This is potentially going to be her second chance. . ." The Necromancer scolds, irked at the Masked Man's selfishness.

Eventually, however, the woman turned to face Edge once more. "As for you. As you can likely guess, head on combat isn't my forte. What I require is muscle, I will help, presuming you are able to complete a few favors of mind in the near future. For example. . .There are several, physically dominant men that I have my eye on. When the time comes, I will make a call -- because I will want them. Simple. . . For now, I simply allow their forms to developing. It's amusing. . . Really. They don't know, but they're merely cultivating their bodies. . . growing like fine vegetables. . ." the witch said with a coy grin. Her tone is whimisical, and she's getting lost in thought, overcome with joy from the prospect of claiming the prospects' bodies -- but not for anything perverted obvious.

A glance is given back to the Masked Man. "Any last words. . ? I'm going to send her back for a bit."* - Mon Oct  5 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods. A hand snaps, and all of the power within Hanabi's course ceasesto exist. 

"Precisely. Although, I have candidates of my own, I won't decline a giveaway. In anycase, feel free to call me at your leisure. The messenger bird from before should be able to locate me quite easily."* - Mon Oct  5 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Of course. - Mon Oct  5 04:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: No problem. - Mon Oct  5 04:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Then we have an agreement. - Mon Oct  5 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Good. - Mon Oct  5 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Tell me though... - Mon Oct  5 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: A necromancer like yourself. - Mon Oct  5 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Why haven't I heard of you before? - Mon Oct  5 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: It is simple. . .Those within the public eye. . .They are targets. - Mon Oct  5 04:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Like I've said. I don't do. . . head on combat.  - Mon Oct  5 04:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Alright. - Mon Oct  5 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: That's fine. - Mon Oct  5 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Don't mind me. - Mon Oct  5 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I do this to everyone. - Mon Oct  5 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) takes steps back with a bewildered facial expression, although the mask hides such.

"For what reason. . ?"* - Mon Oct  5 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Don't worry about it. - Mon Oct  5 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Not too much at least. - Mon Oct  5 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I'll be going then. - Mon Oct  5 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I'm sure we'll have very -intimate- relationships. - Mon Oct  5 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I will take my leave, I suppose. Ring me up when you need me-- Right. .  - Mon Oct  5 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Anyone dead yet? - Mon Oct  5 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) leaves the bird.

She makes her exit.* - Mon Oct  5 04:50:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) raised a brow.

Asteroth. . san? It was about time people spoke to her with respect, much like the citizens used to do in her homeland. "Mmm. . .I am unsure. I'm open to suggestions," the dainty woman replied.* - Wed Oct  7 04:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's lips pressed into a grin. Was this guy serious?

You can tell the skepticism that Asteroth felt, as her eyes narrowed, and her cranium cantedu p and down, allowing her to examine the teen's form. "A butler. .  Yes. A body. . perhaps. Yet your physique, it leaves much to be desired. Perhaps if you worked on your body a bit more," the authoritarian spoke concisely.

". . .Curious. What skills do you possess? And why are you so willing to serve? . . Somewhat redundant, I suppose. People normally would take honor in even being in the presence of a beauty like me -- at least back in my homeland. . . Although, the citizens here seem to be different."* - Wed Oct  7 04:52:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||This was like music to her ears. Although, she had her doubts.

In the back of her head, she was skeptical. What if this guy was just some pervert trying to get her alone after gaining trust?

"I'd like to see your fighting style then. . .Since you feel good enough to boast about it. Come now. . . It wouldn't take long," Asteroth insists.* - Wed Oct  7 05:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) does a twirl, allowing her positioning to be towards the south. She struts down the path, hoping to lead Cypher to a more secluded area. Once in an empty area, she snaps her fingers.

"Alright, get to it," Asteroth demands.

Having given the order, a hand sets on her hip, and she's moving back, giving Cypher ample room to show off.* - Wed Oct  7 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) kept in her stance. Another hand rests on her hips, allowing the woman to comfortably view Cypher in his expedition.

With meager sensory ability, Asteroth picks up on the gathering of chakra, much to her delight. . "Interesting. . .Does he use chakra to. ." the woman speculates, but says nothing aloud. Eventually, as the teen breaks into a speedy frenzy, her eyes widen a tad.

The usual scowl or stern expression briefly fades, now replaced with a coy, amused grin. Was this the extent of Cypher's strength?

"You use chakra to enhance your fighting prowess. Seemingly, you're a close-quarter- combat specialist. That was a good show, but how refined are your physical ability? Be it strength, speed, endurance. These are things a girl needs to know, y'know."* - Wed Oct  7 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) was simply leaning against the mountaintop. In her hand was the typical booklet, one that she read for reasons unknown.

"...! Don't sneak up on me like that!" the woman screeches, her hand flinching as she debates on tossing the book. Thankfully, cooler heads prevail. 

". . .But evening. ."* - Wed Oct  7 12:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) wrinkles her nose.

"Swell. Albeit. . a bit bored. Had it not been for my family's allowances, I may have been in a pickle. . You know how hard it is to find work in thisdamn village? Especially with all of these refugees," Asteroth complains, scoffing at the notion of even having to -try- and get employed. The book is slammed shut, and settled onto her hip.

"You will serve me free of charrge, yes? Although. . " She deviously smiles -- another rare occurence. A hand rises, pressing against her chin thoughtfully. 

"I suppose my attention is enough of a payment?"* - Wed Oct  7 12:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's smile subsided, yet she still very much enjoyed the exchange. Cypher was the type that she preyed on. . . So needy and desperate for feminine attention. Arms now behind her back, Asteroth begins to take steps forward, her hips swaying unintentionally in a provocative, model-like fashion. ". . Right then. We should go . . .What have you on the agenda for today? I might something I'd want to be completed," the spoiled snob says in an almost sing-song tone, teasing what she'd have Cypher do -- should he accept.

She's heading on towards the north.* - Wed Oct  7 12:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) somewhat pitied the boy. . But at the same time, she remained captivated. He was a puppet, enthralled by her stunning looks. It wasn't often that the men -- at least shinobi-wise-- were so enarmored that they could look beyond Asteroth's shortcomings. 

". . .Indeed you are. . " 

She manages to hold back on the devious smile again, and continues to proceed ahead. Like a cow-girl leading her cattle, she moved, expecting Cypher to eagerly follow behind. Not a word is spoken as to where. ..  Then it's clear, they're approaching the local village restaurant. She wears a look of disgust briefly, but manages to mask it with the usual annoyed scowl that she wears.

". . .This place. . . Looks so filthy. For all the time this village has existed.  . . they couldn't improve the infrastructure?" Asteroth murmured to herself. With a sigh, the woman begins to make a path up the hill, only coming to a stop once by a table. "We can discuss over a meal, I suppose. Your treat."* - Wed Oct  7 12:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||"It's like taking candy from a baby. . .I know I look good. . . But I'd have expected I'd need to turn on my charm. He's essentially betwitched by me and all I did was demand an apology. . ." Asteroth pondered to herself as they made entry way into the restaurant. 

She isn't surprised as Cypher diligently goes to pull the chair up for her.

Upon seeing this, Asteroth reaches into her purse, retrieving a handkerchief and holding out it the Zetseun. ". . .The chair could be dirty. Wipe it down, if you will . . .Make sure to only use one side," the authoritarian says, her tone demanding, suggesting that she wasn't asking at all. Of course, the instructions were specific, as she had no intent on getting any of Cypher's germs himself.

Impatiently, she takes a step back, arms folded and feet tapping against the ground. "Come now. . .I'd like to have a leisure chant with . . . What was your name again?"* - Wed Oct  7 12:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) smiled. She pats the boy on the head -- and the smile does seem genuine. 

"Ah yes. .. How air-headed of me. It's like I'm channeling every single blonde stereotype. . " Asteroth jokes in a monotone voice. She gently makes way towards the seat, and does a twirl. Upon planting her bum in the cushioned chair, one leg crosses over the other.

"Thank you, however, Cypher."

A hand motions for the teen boy to push her in, like a real gentlemen. Assuming he done such, Asteroth snaps her fingers, hoping to beckon some of the staff over to begin ordering food -- Her demeanor making her appear like royalty, when the woman was anything -but- that. 

". . .In anycase. . I'm unsure if I've asked before. What. .  binds you to me? Believe it or not. . -some- people think I'm a bit too. . . high-maintenance. Hard to deal with even," the woman states, forcing a brief frown. As it fades, there is genuine offense evident in her facial expression at the notion of anyone deeming her unfit to be her mate. Even if she was too prudish to ever entertain such.

In addition to this, the employees -- rudely I might add -- ignore her call, some muttering some harsh languages, calling the woman out of her name. Save for a vein that briefly pops onto Asteroth's forehead, she makes no mention of this. . They just made the list, however.* - Wed Oct  7 12:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||Feigns sheepiness fleetingly. 

A hand raises to cover her mouth, though no giggles or grins escape. "My. . Quite the charmer you are. . . Even if your delivery requires improvement--" She stared on, looking right into Cypher's soul.

Just for that moment, Asteroth could feel the animosity building up in his frame. The gaze that had been given to the waiter/waitress. . . It pleased her, as it showed that Cypher took his job as protector very seriously. "Mmm. . . Quite protective of me. How kind. .  a power, young shinobi coming to rescue of a dainty damsel in distress such as I," the mysterious woman mused, her mouth breaking into a smirk -- but never a smile.

"Perhaps if you weren't so young, you'd be an ideal companion," the woman adds, hoping to tease and get the boy's hopes up. Her mouth opened again, but before she could arrive, one of the teenaged waiters had arrived. He wears a bowl-cut, and seems to be well. . . Not all together up there, if you catch my drift.

"What up, dudes and dudettes! How may Is be servin' you?" A notebook is in hand, along with a pen to make sure that the order was copied correctly. 

". . My bodyguard here will order for the both of us. I suppose he should have good taste, no?"* - Wed Oct  7 13:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) thinks: If...If only I was...a Bit older... - Wed Oct  7 13:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's right brow rose again. 

Her elbows are pressing against the table, allowing her hands to be in prime condition to serve as a resting place for her head. Both eyes continue to stare Cypher down as the endearing youth seeks to show off his wealth.

"My. . my. . I'm impressed. Who would have thought that a young lad like you had such steep pockets. . .Growing more appealing by the second. Sadly, I have morals. . ." A hand briefly moves from it's position, shoo-ing the waiter off to go complete the meal. In no time, he's submitting the order to the cook.  Once more, those employees seem a bit sour, and foolish one verbally (and clearly) debates on spitting in the food.

". . I've never heard of those dishes back at my home. . Curious. I hope neither taste horrid. . Which one will be for me? And in addition to this. . . would you like to hear of what I'd want -- in terms of objective. . "* - Wed Oct  7 13:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's eyes shift up towards the right, her nose wrinkling. She's thinking. . .

"I'll take the beef, I suppose," she says blandly before leaning forward.

Asteroth choooses her next words carefully as to not make Cypher believe her to be shady. "In anycase. . .I've just heard recent news of Kirigakure. Bad things have happened there. . .I was just thinking of going to that village as a vacation. I hear they have nice beaches. . . Sadly, things may not be going that well. I'd like for you to go there in my stead, to y'know. . . Make sure everything is okay," she says sweetly, batting her eyelash to hopefully get the teen to do her bidding.

"Perhaps see who of significance still lives?-- Or has died even. And to see if danger still lurks. . . Assuming a swift recovery, I may just well go there," she says with a shrug.* - Wed Oct  7 13:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) smiles. She falls back to her original stance. 

"Good then. . .Do report all you'd see in detail," she'd state -- her tone still demanding, but now carrying a bit of gentleness. Cypher was beginning to grow on her, that was for sure.

"In anycase. . .Feel free to tell me of yourself in the meantime."* - Wed Oct  7 13:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods. 

By then, the food had been delivered. Two steaming bowls, and utensils to boot. The aroma quickly flushes into the area, brushing against Asteroth's nostril. Intrigued, her eyes cant down, staring ahead into the Beef Stew. . or whatever it was called. It's coloration is of a mixture of red and brown, and the meats are show floating to the top. 'Course, there were signs of fine seasoning.


"Here at last. . But onto your grandpa. You still have living relatives then. . good to note. As for specifics. . your likes, your dislikes. . .What exactly makes you tick."* - Wed Oct  7 13:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) at last began to eat. She grabs a pair of chopsticks, and sticks it right in, going for a juicy piece of meat. Gently, it's brought forward to her lips and nibbled. . 

Then she realizes.

On reflex, Asteroth practically gags up the 'treat', sadly it would be unfitting for someone of her stature to spit up half eaten food. Instead, a napkin is taken, and is used to allow the chewed dish to politely be spat out.

A grimace is given to Cypher. . "I was beginning to think you had some good taste. . Gah. . It's going to take forever to take this foul taste out of my mouth," she complains. A napkin runs along her tongue, before she settles down. 

"Regardless. . . I suppose you aren't too fcomplex of a person. .  Lest you have more information to share."* - Wed Oct  7 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shake her head. She'd lost her appetite.

"It's fine. . I suppose I will leave you to checking our Kirigakure now. . Yes? I'd like to know the status as soon as possible."* - Wed Oct  7 15:03:40 2015
