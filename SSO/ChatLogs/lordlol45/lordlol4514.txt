<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Then again it's your fault. - Sat Nov  7 00:35:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I'm surprised you don't have any demons to help you. - Sat Nov  7 00:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Maybe your laziness is your own downfall? - Sat Nov  7 00:37:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) turns to look towards Mizumi.

"Ah. I've heard a little. Who is the new Mizukage? -- And what's wrong. . ? You don't seem too happy."* - Sat Nov  7 00:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Oh?!~ - Sat Nov  7 00:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I should go meet them. - Sat Nov  7 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Mizumi-kun..there's no need to worry about me.. - Sat Nov  7 00:44:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I've met this.."Ortho" if you're referring to the man connected to that giant snake. - Sat Nov  7 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: I had my mask on...So who knows if he knew it was me... - Sat Nov  7 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: He's seen my mask. - Sat Nov  7 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: We've met in Konohagakure. - Sat Nov  7 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Why did Index attack you? - Sat Nov  7 00:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: And what type of trouble was she causing? - Sat Nov  7 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: All of this was in Kirigakure, by the by? - Sat Nov  7 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Yup. - Sat Nov  7 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: She was being rather aggressive towards the Mizukage and Ortho. - Sat Nov  7 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Ah. And back to the first question. -- Who is the Mizukage? - Sat Nov  7 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: I didn't catch a name. - Sat Nov  7 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Or he said it... - Sat Nov  7 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: I just don't remember it. - Sat Nov  7 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: An appearance will work too. - Sat Nov  7 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: the Mizukage robes... - Sat Nov  7 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: and the blue hat. - Sat Nov  7 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: face somewhat covered. - Sat Nov  7 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Of course. Well, Nigen. - Sat Nov  7 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Go check for me. - Sat Nov  7 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hmph. - Sat Nov  7 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) looked on with an uncomfortable gaze.

"Mizuki. You're acting weird. . . What's wrong?"* - Sat Nov  7 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: This bitch just got my name wrong....I thought we had something.... - Sat Nov  7 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: -omit- - Sat Nov  7 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Welp! - Sat Nov  7 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Sat Nov  7 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: This could be a bomb. - Sat Nov  7 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Here..you hold it for me, Fickle-chan. - Sat Nov  7 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: You're insane. - Sat Nov  7 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Blah..blah..blah. - Sat Nov  7 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Will you get out of here already? - Sat Nov  7 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Meh.. - Sat Nov  7 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You're rushing me.. - Sat Nov  7 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Well. - Sat Nov  7 01:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: And you? - Sat Nov  7 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) raised a brow.

"My form? And it's a petty. I found your old persona amusing."* - Sat Nov  7 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shrugs.

"I haven't heard much of your exploits," Asteroth admits. Regardless, Mizumi had never seemed too crazy -- at least not from her perspective.* - Sat Nov  7 01:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: What compelled you to be in Kirigakure, by the way? - Sat Nov  7 02:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Ah. Makes sense. Does he seem friendly? - Sat Nov  7 02:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Mm...Didn't get to speak to him much - Sat Nov  7 02:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: On a side note. You claim this 'Ortho' guy is responsible for the chaos. - Sat Nov  7 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Yet he was there as you were? - Sat Nov  7 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Ah. .. I suppose this is the friend Index told me of. - Sat Nov  7 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: The one that's wanted by Suna. Thus forcing his departure. - Sat Nov  7 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Or so I assume. - Sat Nov  7 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Seems like trouble. . the last thing I want is for Index to get dragged through mud over some harlot. - Sat Nov  7 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shrugged,

"Home. Drowning myself in books. Learning new -- spells." She says at last, no longer feeling it necessary to keep the nature of her ability a secret. At least not from Mizumi.* - Sat Nov  7 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods. "Indeed. I don't use ninjutsu. I use magic. --Very potent magic. Although I haven't refined my abilities well enough to make. . . confident moves. At least not yet. Once I have, however. . . Things may begin to get a lot more interesting," Asteroth teases -- still keeping much of her abilities cryptic.* - Sat Nov  7 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shrugs or shakes her head.

"I haven't a clue. Y'see, my type of magic is often. ..  disliked by certain people. Like the man that once came, Yukio I believe. Thus, people who possess my skillset tend to avoid making it public. Lest they get an unfriendly mix of people coming for their head," Asteroth replied with annoyance.

Her mind wonders, thinking back to the gathering that occured in Sunagakure. Ugh! Priests made her sick, the thought forces an uncomfortable shiver.* - Sat Nov  7 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods.

"Although, he knows 'ninjutsu-like' techniques as well."* - Sat Nov  7 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods. Magic was complicated -- and in her eyes, superior to Chakra.

"That sounds like a plan. Albeit, aren't sensor types a little less offensively capable? To help in your endeavors, I have an old scroll saved that could help you. It's a sensory or stealth based technique -- chakra suppression. Are you familiar with it?"* - Sat Nov  7 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shifts her eyes from side to side.

"What books I have isn't of much concern. As for why I have this 'scroll.' It's cause I derived my own variant from it. Now then. . . If you want it. I'll have one of my assistants run it over."

As per usual, doing such is trivial. She sends a bird. In a few minutes, someone is rushing over with the scroll. "Do not abuse the technique, mind you."* - Sat Nov  7 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mhm. It should be  useful. Although. . you won't be able to use your ninjutsu while suppressed. - Sat Nov  7 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods.

"Indeed. It is how I've managed to keep my identify under wraps. I developed this for the sole purpose of suppressing my 'dark' energies," she admits.* - Sat Nov  7 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Of course, of course. Least that can be done for the man that saved my life. - Sat Nov  7 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods.

She arises, patting the boy on the head. "I'm sure it will serve you well. In any case, I'm going to return the the usual spot, since it's usually where visitors go if they need me."

She then moves, hips swaying, back towards the west. Her arms remain folded, as once the conversation with Mizumi had ended, Asteroth re-obtained her usual, scowling nature---

"Oi. Mizumi. Enter that." Briefly, the Queen paused before continuing off.* - Sat Nov  7 03:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Ah. A pity. . Seems I'll need to depend. . <*shivvers*> On Nigen. - Sat Nov  7 03:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Sheesh.. - Sat Nov  7 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Yura..yura toooo!~ - Sat Nov  7 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Oh.. - Sun Nov  8 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Fickle-chan..funny meeting you here. - Sun Nov  8 05:18:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) folds her arms.

She doesn't flinch nor budge at the sudden release of snakes. After all, stranger things have been seen. Wordlessly, Asteroth kept a focus onto the situation, although cautiously takes a step back.

"Bah. . . More Drama," the Queen thought to herself with aggitation.* - Mon Nov  9 00:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: Why are Nigen's friends so. . .  What's the word. .? - Mon Nov  9 00:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) turns about face.

She proceeds towards the east to handle some business.* - Mon Nov  9 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||Quickly, she'd proceed with the annoying task of beginning her Dark Magic training. For months on end, Asteroth could feel the power swelling inside her -- her soul constantly growing and gaining more experience with each passing day. And now? The Queen had resolved to firmly complete the mastery of each skill.

Thus granting her with the needed spiritual force to perfect the resurrection ability.

The first in the long line of techniques meant to be refined was the Dark Spear ability. It was perhaps Asteroth's only means of generating an  offensive effort, and would be the first/last line of defense should her minions not be about. Thus, it goes without saying -why- the woman sought mastery of this particularly skill.

Thankfully, it required no lengthy incantations and could be generally performed on the fly. With ease, the woman proceeds to build up her dark energies from within. It differs greatly from the norm -- which was chakra. As a legitimate alien, her version of energy seemed more easily controlled, and as such required no utilization of handseals. Rather, all that the woman needed was a focus mind and great work ethic.

From this, a viel of energy forms about her body, making it clear that she's successful in producing the sickly, purplish energy. Taking a large bundle, Asteroth manuevers it, placing the three to five seperate bodies of mana into the open. It's an easy process, given her already high level of skill. But in addition to this, the once massless forms of might proceed to take form. It was like a spiritual or mental muscles. Although, it was far from physical, this meta-physical or intangible embodiment of Asteroth's spiritual's force was steadily growing more powerful and used to the typical motions.

The mass-less gathering of Dark Mana proceeded to fizzle out into a smoke-like state. From this, it swirls, clumping together shortly after to form condensed constructions. As the items take shape, the size and outline grows to become eerily similar to that of a Kunai. That settled, the woman flicks a hand forward, prompting the gathered items to flick ahead. With fierceness, they slam against the wall, effortlessly moving right through the wooden obstacles that dared to block their path.

Content, Asteroth moves on off.* - Mon Nov  9 03:04:44 2015
