The book seems to be a cover on basic economics.

"You read me like. . " She gestures her book up. "A book," Asteroth continues, snide with the commentary. Judging by her finely woven clothes, and the look of sterness worn at all times, you can tell what class of society she hailed from.* - Tue Sep 29 07:08:22 2015

The mission given was quite literally a bore. Unfortunately, it was something Asteroth simply had to cope with. After all, she had to actually make a living as she aimed to fit into Konohagakure-- accumulating power to achieve real goals. With a grumble, the woman took a gander at the scroll's contents, which essentially served as a roadmap to reach the mission's destination. 

"I hate this. . . The inside of my body, it really feels cramped, if only I could just unwind my power without fear of being lynched or surrounded by onlookers. Tsk, these filthy bastards would jump at the first sight of someone being different," Asteroth muttered, feeling really oppressed. Oppressed. . . even if it wasn't the work of others forcing her to endure these uncomfortable situations. 

Alas, as she traveled along the road, her gaze drifted back and forth. On occasions, it moved to the mission scroll, which accurately detailed where to move. But mostly? It was on that strange book she always read. One that was covered up as an 'economic' book. But of course, it was anything but that. Instead, the booklet was legitimately just Asteroth's spellbook, teaching her how to better utilized a favorite summoning of her's-- the Furu-Utsobo.

After a half hour walk, she comes upon a mansion. This was the visitor. An elderly old lady, lecherous in nature, and seemingly SWIMMING in cash. She was stack to say the least. Meekly, the Necromancer knocks along the gates, calling forth the granny who eagerly reaches the exit. The strange senior citizen is eying Asteroth up and down, as if undressing the curved youth with her eyes alone, yet saying nothing on the matter. To distract her of this very obvious invasion, Asteroth's eyes fall back onto spellbook, hoping some nefarious spell would undo with the awkwardness that existed.

Before long, the two are chatting up, as it seemed she had to cater to the visitor's every whim. They'd spend the next few hours exploring Konoha, going to an assortment of sights. One being the witch's workplace. After being teased about 'dating' some old woman, the duo eventually make off, hitting other hotspots, such as fighting arenas, spas -- thoroughly on this -- and of course, the city's mainpark. As the sun set, she looks ahead.

"Alright. . .I think that's all, miss. I'll bring you back home. . " Cue a brisk walk to the mansion. Asteroth practically has to lug the drunken woman along. Of course, due to her unconscious, the barely out of her teens, mischevious necromancer steals a few yen  before dropping her off home. Briskly now, the blonde heads back on to the mansion for the loot -- eyes still glued onto that mysterious booklet.* - Tue Sep 29 12:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) she pushes the door open the day after -- but not before wiping down the knob with a handkerchief. Once in, she gives another curt -- yet fake -- bow of respect. 

"Evening. I finished the mission the other day, but it got really late. The old coot kept me out all night."* - Tue Sep 29 12:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Well. .  - Tue Sep 29 12:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: 'Mission is a strong word. .' - Tue Sep 29 12:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: ...Huh? - Tue Sep 29 12:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: <*Perks a brow*> Just commenting on the busy work I was given. I came looking for extra payment. Got stuck babysitting some senior citizen. - Tue Sep 29 12:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: ... - Tue Sep 29 13:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: Right. - Tue Sep 29 13:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: I'll be out. - Tue Sep 29 13:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||
Indeed. There wasn't a lot known about Asteroth, considering she hailed from a small, developing country. One that was insignificant, and thus garnered no attention from the outside word. 

Asteroth in particular had managed to slip into Konoha during the chaos that ensued admist the war. Thus, she manages to remain below the radar. With a brow raised, her mouth opens, expressing confusion. "Hrm . .? I didn't think I'd need privacy to receive my payment--" She stops short, as it donned upon her mind what had been said the day prior.

"Oh right. ."* - Tue Sep 29 13:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||
Cue brow twitch. 

A vein pops out of her forehead, and her delicate flesh reddens -- not out of embarrassment, nor being flustered, but out of anger. She tilts her cranium a bit back, giving a nasty, vengeful glare. To even suggest anything as lavacious as that-- it was despicable.

"He's made the list. . " the blonde thought to herself.* - Tue Sep 29 13:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||
Almost as if that had never happened, the second Taiga exits, she reverts back to a more normal, reserved demeanor. A brief exhale is performed, allowing the rage boiling within her body to be metaphorically released into the atmosphere. Turning back, Asteroth's eyes sets back onto the monstrosity that was Erebus. It's by then that she -really- fixes up her act, by adjusting her entire stance, and making sure her outfit was perfectly straightened out.

"Ahem. . Right. You spoke prior of being a devout follower of Jashin. . . Yes?" the strange traveler spoke, her eyes narrowing, and a coy yet devious smile spawning. The energies in her body boiled, but even with the excitement, she's more than able to keep it under check, making it a mysterious of what the girl could truly accomplish.

"I've often read on the religion. And I know for certain. . .True jashinist would not tolerate a fake. You claim. . . Or boast, rather. . To have even obtained the blessing. And honestly? I wish for comfirmation . ." The narrow gaze seems to obtain a level of scrutiny, as the mere notion of there being a guy pretending to have been blessed by the saviour, Lord Jashin, honestly ticked the summoner off.

"What do you say?" Although she hadn't outright said anything, the implications for her intrigue had been implied.* - Tue Sep 29 13:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||
Wordlessly, she looked on, unphased by the stream of blood that sped from Erebus wrists. Endlessly, sanguine nectar continues to pour. . .

Thus, Asteroth watched for minutes on end to comfirm. 

Towards the end of the sequence, that familiar, devious grin forcibly found it's way back onto the less. . .flamboyant Jashinist's face. "I see. . .So you are the real thing. . . I'd assume. I suppose then. . .It is no use to keep my identity a secret. I too am a follower of the faith -- yet I haven't been gifted with your talents as of yet," Asteoth notes, aiming to remain as cryptic as possible.

The less Erebus knew, the better. "Despite my apparent uselessness, I suppose when the time comes, you may just find an ally in me."* - Tue Sep 29 13:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: They're still here? - Tue Sep 29 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||
The grin from before widens.

"I suppose it is only fair to show you my blessing. After all, you've showed me your's, this I will show you mine. . " And all too briefly, her dark energy flare for a second. She mutters some unintelligible chant, prompting purplish chi to seep into the area, and ram itself directly into the compact air molecules. Before long, the space-time continuum is literally ripped apart, prompting the dark chi from before to explode.

Briefly, the energetic residue clouds the area, and forces up a gust.

As it clears? A simple-minded summoning is conjured. It's a green colored, jar-like entity. With arm-like appendage, they're charcoal black in nature and wiggle irregularly. "This is one of my babies. Sadly, the creature you see now is all I can offer-- But rest assured, this is a spawn of Jashin. One of his underlings from the realm he inhabits . ." It was a strange claim, but even without sensing, you could smell the dark undertones that came with the demon summoning.* - Tue Sep 29 14:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods.

She had much more to share -- but wanted to ensure that Erebus was trustworthy. There would be nothing worse than to have all of her skills out in the world -- with her potential enemies knowing just what Asteroth could be capable of.

Once more, a curt bow is given, this time with actual respect, considering Erebus had proven to be a more devout follower than even herself. "It's been a pleasure, I simply had to comfirm. Although. . I would be a liar to say that I don't more tricks up my sleeves. They're simply not up to par or standard to be showed off," Asteroth notes, referencing her ability to resurrect the dead for her own bidding, albeit in a limited capacity.

She turns and proceeds towards the exit, but steps short one step. "Although. I do request one thing. I wish to head to Kumogakure for a few day's time," she's quiet as to why. All the while, her mana is being suppressed, ensuring that no one, save for an accomplished priest, would be able to detect her energy. "Certainly, even with your apparent paranoia, you can trust that isn't for nefarious plots. I have no intent on harming a fellow follower of the faith. Likewise, your knowledge of my true nature. . . It gives you much leverage," the beaut notes in hopes of butter up the defacto Hokage.* - Tue Sep 29 14:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Consider your caravan expenses paid for by me. It's the least I could do for a fellow follower. Your tricks are just that, Asteroth --- yours. I seek not to view your entire arsenal, I like the thrill of adaptation. - Tue Sep 29 14:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Keep in mind, Asteroth. - Tue Sep 29 14:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Snitching is a sin. - Tue Sep 29 14:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mhm. Of course. Believe me, I'm simply going to go see someone. - Tue Sep 29 14:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) scoots on off, and gets into a caravan.* - Tue Sep 29 14:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: <*Has officially left*> - Tue Sep 29 14:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||
Rumble, rumble, rumble!

The caravan was anything -but- comfortable. It rocked uneasily, sending Asteroth's hair in a frenzy. What's worse is that the weather was hardly cooperative, leaving her a sweatied mess. But in time, the trip was over. Graciously, she races off the cart, while dismissing the caravan drivers that begged for tips.

"See you slobs later." Her hands wavered off, shoo-ing them away like they were stray dogs following her for food.

With a regal stride, Asteroth moved along, while simultaneously aiming to re-fix all of the make-up that had been sweated off. In no time at all, she arrives at the Kumogakure plaza spot, her eyes darting around, before falling onto Bernadotte. That was a familiar face.* - Tue Sep 29 15:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) doesn't wave back.

She gives a stern, unnerving glare back to her childhood 'friend.' Oh how irritating he had been back then. . . sadly, that trait didn't recede in age. "'Prissy Pants. . ' Is that the best you can come up with? I suppose it makes sense, your brain capacity was never all too high," Asteroth retorted with a stereotypical 'Hmph.'

Her arms swiftly fold around one another, eyes averting briefly to the side. After some thought, the Necromancer's gaze falls back onto Bernadotte, lips pressed into and beginning the formation of a frown.

"I simply got word of you being here from a relative-- That brings me to this point. Why are you here? And what have you been doing?" a foot stomps into the ground, her tone -demanding' an answer, rather than asking. She knew this fool knew -her-, and she had no intent on letting him blab on about their exploits in the Land of Vegetables.* - Tue Sep 29 15:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) glared dulled once Bernadotte began to show off his 'badass' blades. It was look that made one thing clear. . 

"Unimpressed," Asteroth stated bluntly, rolling her eyes to make the condescent come full circle. "And quite trying to impress me, I have no interest in you," the girl continued, wearing a devious smirk as the swordsman was given no praise whatsoever. 

And then he does it. . 

Quickly, her face reddens, not out of flusterness -- considering the subtle compliment that had been given -- but out of rage. He spoke aloud, in PUBLIC about her graverobbing antics. Even if there wasn't anyone clearly around, even speaking in such a manner drove the curved necromancer into distress. An arm lunges out, intent on grabbing Bernadotte by the collar. 

Presuming no resistance, since he certainly could resist and was likely a better combatant than the support-based Asteroth, she'd drag him off. Her pupils had damn near dissapeared, leaving her eyes white, and veins popping from her forehead -- a stereotypical anime face if you will. Before long, Bernadotte would have been dragged into a home and pushed into a wall.

Asteroth just stared menacingly from there.* - Tue Sep 29 15:39:31 2015

". . .The insult 'Prissy Pants'. . Is. Horrible," she notes with venom, her teeth clenches together right after, giving a mean mug. Although, considering her features, the gesture could be taken as either menacing, or just endearing all together.

"And stop commenting on my looks! I don't care what you think," Asteroth continued, hoping to put an end to Bernadotte hormone-based commentary. Her hands utilized  its grip, allowing her to weakly slam the much bigger Necromancer into the wall. Whether it hurt or not mattered little.

"Keep your mouth shut. I never want to see nor hear -- or even hear ABOUT. . . you saying a damn word about my origin. Nor my true nature, do you understand?!" she growls, before exhaling, feeling the point is made. Although, her gaze never leaves Bernadotte, she wants to ensure that the nonchalant Satanist would do as he was told. 

No attention nor concern is paid towards the idle threats -- she knew Bernadotte wouldn't do a thing.* - Tue Sep 29 16:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) scoffed.

"Quit referring to your 'Lord Lucifer'. . . As if he is the superior being in the world. Lord Jashion reigns supreme," the devou zealot said with mild irritation-- still feeling that she was in control of the situation. 

It's by then that Bernadotte sought to flip the switch -- and honestly? Asteroth allows it. This was simple security, to ensure that Bernadotte felt as if he was in control, and thus would be willing to listen. In short order, she's pushed, and pinned to the wall, even yelping in a meek fashion. ". . .My. . You are so strong. . ," the woman noted with a pinch of sarcasm, while rolling her eyes. 

"Regardless we have an agreement. Refrain from the idle talk of. . . dark arts."* - Tue Sep 29 16:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) rolled her eyes yet again.

"Yes. . Yes. I am sure your lord, Lucifer, is almighty. . . infallible. Sadly, I'm not quite up to having another religious debate over which 'God' is more powerful," Asteroth says with an exasperated sign. A hand moves up, pressing against Bernadotte's chest to nudge him away. 

"You're invading my personal space."* - Tue Sep 29 17:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) rolled her damned eyes again as Bernadotte continued to show his perversion. "Is that all yo uthink about?" Asteroth muttered with bitterness. 

"Before I go to gather this body. Show me -- What can you honestly do with that petty stick of your's?" A hand gestures for Bernadotte to actually demonstrate.* - Tue Sep 29 17:09:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) || And finally, she begins to read the several scrolls that had been graciously provided by the former, stand-in Hokage -- Katsune. The dainty, miniture little lass that seemed to be an overall bore. The first of the scroll seems to be on a basic manuever, the 'Genjutsu Kai' technique. A jutsu meant to release any and all genjutsu that had been placed on the victim -- 'Course, there were several restrictions and limitations. 

'Genjutsu Kai, a skill that is a cut above the basic techniques taught in the academy. For this, a shinobi must have competent chakra control to be enabled to manipulate one's circulatory system to get the desired results. Overall, it's dubbed D-rank,' Asteroth read boredly, though still with enough intrigue to muscle through the rest of the repetitive ass information. Why read a book on shinobi techniques as a -Necromancer- of all things? It was a great question to ask, after all.

And the answer was quite simple. Even if Chakra and Dark Magic were two entirely different energy sources -- there were still clear similarities. Like a regular ninja, Asteroth could easily be caught in an illusion, be it by shinobi, or be it by priestess. It functioned in the same way as common illusionary skills, thus they'd have the same weakness -- Pain or Disruption. Via reading, she'd be more than capable of devising a Necromancer variant to do away with potential nuisances -- one that would require no seals whatsoever. 

She pours a glass of sake, and before long, the reading is continued as she leisurely sips along. '. . .Going further. The 'jutsu' is a two part technique. You see, for a genjutsu to properly work, you would have to see or come in contact with a trigger. What the trigger does is simple, and that's target your cerebral system, and implant chakra within the circulation of chi around that area. It's through this process that an opponent can inflict a genjutsu, and force you to endure false sensations. To counter. . . One must simply go through enough shock -- or in this technique's case -- disrupt or destroy the floor.' 

It's by this point that Asteroth's blonde brow is risen, captivation evident. She greedily takes another gulp of the bottle, her eyes never once leaving the paper. Of course, before moving to the next paragraph, there's a picture or diagram in the way. Initially, the NEcromancer shows irritation at the interruption, as her patience was running low for sure -- But upon acting -look- rather than just glance, she sees the value. Indeed, as you would guess, it depicted precisely what the book detailed. A simple 'citizen' being put under a 'illusion', or genjutsu -- as the phenomenon is commonly referred to. 

The diagram is pretty basic, showing off a simple picture of a human body. But the main points happen to be the interior, where an elementry version of the chakra circulatory system is shown -- first in a state of neutrality, then in a state that's inflicted with the genjutsu. At last, Asteroth reaches the point she desires most, the reading. 

'Using your control of your energy, hault the flow. Once your internal rivers of power had been put on hault, you manipulate the currents, taking an external source of energy, and pushing your flow of chakra in the opposite of the natural path. If this is done with a power rivaling the initial genjutsu, then you will be freed. Simple as that. Although, it's easier said than done, as most people aren't quite acclimated with using chakra in such specific fashions.'

And the jutsu was that easy. Being the intelligent, young woman that she was, the Necromancer seeks to test the theory herself. Staff in hand, the woman raises her arm forward, sinister and purple mana already spewing from her pores. Each inch of her skin is bathe in that ethereal nectar. . . Her energy so potent and sickly that it forced the very hair on her head to stand upward, wavering back in forth in an all too menacing fashion. It wiggled, quivered, and very much resembled reptilians in terms of motion. Before long, a large chunk of the energy finds itself upon the staff, which is used as a medium for Asteroth's work.

A few incantations later, and she feels the desired effects internally.* - Thu Oct  1 13:57:58 2015

However, now Asteroth had an entirely different 'beast' to tackle.

And no, this beast wasn't a demon.

Rather, it was simply another tedious skill. A variation of the known technique, Genjutsu Kai. Quickly, her hands grab the staff, and allows additional chi to funnel around it. The effects are typical. An aura of purple or lavender energy washes over her body, allowing chi to spread around her flesh, hugging onto it like a secondary skin. Asteroth's hair fluttered as a direct result, and her clothes sways to and fro. But most importantly? The staff is subsequently allowed to be the epic centre of the energetic release.

Without another thought, she's chanting like a freakin' priest -- a real world world priest. This incanation is truthfully a spell, allowing the Necromancer a more profound and potent use for the energy. As the mana fluxuates, she finds that the internal flow of her energy is slowed to a crawl -- making any movement damn near nonexistant. All in all, this is a strange feeling. It felt as if her insides were empty, no longer filled with life or any vitality. This feeling. . . she depised it, yet the sensation remained necessary. How else could the budding Necromancer truly ascend to greatness?

How else would she even come close to unleashing Jashin and his children onto the world? In this state, without mastery of the new jutsu, she'd find herself susceptible to illusions. Illusions being a skill that certain Priests and/or Priestesses actually excelled in. 

With the continued chanting, eventually,. the frozen mana shifts again, allowing an opposing current to be flowed. It reboots her once inert systems, and eventually allow her former state of being to be re-obtained. "Ah. . .That was good. I think I'm getting the hang of this. . . I need to try again, this time with no chants. By now, my flow and control should be enough that I can do the release with just a thought."

A true master of Genjutsu Kai would have to be able to do such. How else were they to break free from a genjutsu that has them paralyzed? The brown, wooden staff is set onto her drawer soon after. Asteroth, in her haste, takes a seat, one leg folding over the other in a meditative stance. With a hum, the dark energies in her body flared once more, swirling about in her soul, and eventually venturing upward. This process, no matter how easily described, is a difficult sequence. A bead of sweat had spawned from the immense stress, developing just above her eyebrow and trickling down in a curve. It slid along at a snail's pace, reaching the nose and holding onto the edge for dear life.

Meanwhile, Asteroth's mana remained uncooperative. It occasionally moved to the proper areas, but the fluidity was akin to molasses. Although, unlike molasses, on occasion, the current tended to move in the opposite direction, or just didn't plain move at all. It seemed that the bulk of her energy was hell bent on remaining at her core, near the stomach. Nevertheless, she's never one to succumb to adversity. In a few minutes, the mage manages to freeze her system, while also sending an opposing current. This all happens with just pure thinking prowess.

Having effectively practice,Asteroth takes rest.* - Fri Oct  2 21:57:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||In her time home, the Necromancer continued with her training, adamant in mastering a new skill. One based off of the common technique employed by shinobi -- Shunshin. Of course, the skill in itself had been tailor-made to account for her different make up of energy. After all, Asteroth didn't use chakra, instead she used mana.

Unlike practical shinobi, no seals were going to be used. Instead, she'd literally release commandments in the form of spell chants, allowing her chi to build up and shroud her body. Upon reading a few minutes of text, Asteroth deems that she's more than ready to tackle the jutsu. 

Cue more chants, making her sound like Raven from Teen Titans. On the last syllabel, the energy that was being crafted prior takes flight. It prompts the woman's body to move, this time with added acceleration. Blurring around the region, she eventually lands a few meters to the north, although the usage made her feel sick. For the next few hours, she practices, uncovering much needed experience for the jutsu, and further allowing her overall experience to push her soul into a new thresh hold of power.


Cue a few hours of blank period. And thus. . . the Sand Demon had come to wreak havoc on Konohagakure. Indeed, the approach was anything but expected. Up to this point, the day was was tranquil, and the village hidden in the leaves continued to prosper, garnering far more strength than you could imagine. Under the watchful eye of Erebus

Ba-bump. . .Ba-bump. . Ba-bump! 

The ground quaked, under the might and sheer weight that the Shukaku sported. His body, now wrapped in iron-cladded armor, oozed with malice. Even those without sensing capability could feel the powerful chakra lingering in him swelling, and bursting onto the scene.

It was one that forced the typically stoic spellcaster to wobble in her step. Thankfully. . 

Prior to this, Asteroth had been at work, prepared to claim the very body that this Tetsumi fellow had raged over.For this occasion, asteroth moved in complete and utter secrecy. Her chakra -- or rather mana - remained suppressed, moreso than ever. It completely blotted out her signature, making detection or sensing impossible -- well, via chakra sensing at least. By now, with the creature going on a rampage, the citizens scrambled, and thus not one would be paying attention to the latest endeavor.

With a mask worn, Asteroth's true appearance remained concealed. This persona is what she dubbed as 'Raven' -- to save her own identity. Staff in hand, the curved woman's hand shoots up, allowing a purple, thin veiling of energy to go around her form, along with the staff. As you'd know, the staff was imperative for all magical workings, as it helped focus dark mana, and thus perform spells.

For the next sequence, Asteroth just continued to build up energy, the potency being fierce enough to build up a light gust. It forces her beautiful locks to waver, artificially -- meaning the gust was doing none of this. Having done the proper measures, the Necromancer at last begins to chant, releasing various incanations. The sound waves command the large outpour of energy, and immediately, her dark mana spills out into the atmosphere. 

The verbal incantations eventually force enough energy to seep into the atmosphere. It breaks apart the very fabric and space and time, allowing a brief link to be formed connecting the Human World and the Realm of Jashin. From this surge of dark might, a string of creatures are pulled out -- of course one at a time. Turtle-like, slimey looking abominations known as 'Kappas.' They lacked in intellect, and certainly were ruled by their natural senses or instincts. These were. . . To sleep, fight, and to rape -- usually women and children. 

After one is spawned, she orders the commands. Although, as usual, the beast vivaciously makes an approach, only to be rebuffed by Asteroth and ordered into the water. "I want you to uncover the body of the world's greatest engineer. She had beautiful brown hair, is endowed. . and is completely covered in 'receivers'. . .Whatever those are. Chop-chop. I accept nothing but the best, considering this is the water, where your ilk excels in."

That being said, Asteroth continues to spew out magic into the area, the likes of which swiftly spread once to conjure up more beasts. At the end, her incanations come to a stop, leaving a total of four Kappas spawned. One more goes to enter the water, likely to assist in the recovery of the engineer's body. Upon having the other orders given, the two remaining Kappas sprint off, clearly intent on reaching Asteroth's home. 

In all the commotion, it was unlikely that anyone was going to stop the two demons in their path. Thus, as they fish through the land, they're able to gather the two bodies bags -- one containing the deceased Hanabi, the other possessing the carcass of Mitsuru. Both were in relatively good condition, considering that Asteroth exercised processes that rid the body of odor, and certainly kept them refrigerated. Meanwhile, thet wo Kappas in the water eventually retrieve their target -- Amu.

Successfully now, the Necromancer had three good bodies to work on. Two of which held particularly interesting abilities. One to summon snakes, the other to be the brightest mind in the generation.* - Sun Oct  4 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||
After two days of traveling, she's forced to rid herself of the demon companions. The trio of bodies are taken by herself, carried along a cart. Even despite her fragile appearance, she possessed a good deal of strength, perhaps enhanced due to the magical energies that swirled on the inside. Taking advantageo f such, Asteroth has no issue in relocating the bodies, as she now was shacking up at Bernodette's place -- even if the fellow Necromancer hadn't even permission. What was his? Was now also her's.

No time at all is wasted. Feeling herself on the brink of evolving, she eagerly begins to practice her techniques. Considering being behind closed doors, and out of all public view? The witch is able to cut loose, allowing her energy to surge out. It was this state that her power was in max capacity, and her soul was no longer constrained. 

By now, one of her summoning had reached absolute mastery. The one she favored -- the jar-like creatures that could devour chakra attacks, excluding those made from tangible substances. Such as water, or earth. 'Course, there was still another gremlin that Asteroth had yet to garner full control over. And that was going to be the objective for today. She heads to the bathroom for this one, and runs the bath tub. 

Once more, still holding onto her basic staff. It held minor magical properties, but generally, the only purpose was to assist in focusing her energy, rather than empowering it. With the tool still in hand, her mouth opens once more, prompting a thick outpour of dark energy to seep into the area. Again and again, it targeted specific points, while aiming to make the most out of the energy already siphoned out. The less you'd need for the same action? The better.

It was this sequence that asteroth sought to perfect, as it would also making conjuring up beasts a bit more easy to do. And less time consuming for that matter.

Above the water, the energy quivered, shaking and forcing the excessive momentum to form ripples along the water. As it cleared, the space-time continuuem briefly breaks, again forming a bridge -- a minor one -- that would port the Human Kingdoms and world of the Demons. A fissure, metaphorically, was spawned in order to make this rip open. In no time at all, a singular Kappa had spawned. On reflex alone. it dashed ahead, as it seemed enthralled by the admittedly curavecous, and model-like form that Asteroth possessed. 

With the usage of a staff, she smacks the turtle-based creature on the head, sending it reeling back, and falling into the water with a splash. Droplets of water fell along the ground, some even getting onto her clothes. Yet the goal had been completed. After conjuring a single Demon, she sought to outdo her own limit. Again and again, several different demons are being developed along the land, topping off at ten total -- the limit of Asteroth's reservoir of chi.

Upon training fher skills, she takes a seat, finally having time for a breather.

"Alright./ . .Maybe I should learn a new spell."* - Sun Oct  4 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||The process picked back up, with Asteroth rigorously aiming to reach mastery of the Kappa summons -- which was logically. They were by far her most potent, offensive threat. Although, only when water was around.

Regardless, staff in hand, she routinely builds up a mass of chakra -- each time taking less energy than before -- and siphoning it into the cracks of space and time. It breaks open a brief portal, which subsequently allow another Kappa to be pushed out. This time? The Necromancer's increased skill is making itself evident.

Rather than being like a horny teenager, her summon was docile, obedient even. It meekly settled into the water, waiting for commands. Yet there were none to offer. Content, Asteroth sends it off, and once more continues to recover lost energy.* - Sun Oct  4 03:34:36 2015

Yet what she saw was not an act of cruelty, but simple filth. Today, Asteroth walked around with her wooden bo-staff. And it was this weapon that'd be used to discipline. It slides through the skies, aiming to slam against Bernadotte's head.

Thwap!

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) gives a glance to Kojiro and immediately turns away. On the inside, her energy boil inside. . .The darkness within practically begging to be released. Sadly, this wasn't the time nor the place.

Instead, she takes the staff again, swinging it with a degree of proficiency. The goal? To smash right against Kojiro's scrotom. It was like she was attacking a pinata.

"I'm having second thoughts about being in this village. . .Bernadotte is bad enough. . " she murmurs to herself.* - Sun Oct  4 06:08:12 2015
