<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Evening. - Sun Oct 18 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Anything I can do for you? - Sun Oct 18 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Be it a Massage, food, Or simple company. - Sun Oct 18 18:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mmm. . . A massage would be fun, but that would make me far too lazy. - Sun Oct 18 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: As I have business I need to conduct. - Sun Oct 18 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Food sounds well, I suppose. - Sun Oct 18 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Then later perhaps? - Sun Oct 18 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: And of course. - Sun Oct 18 18:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) would have followed Index in to where ever he had decided.

As per usual, being a super neatfreak, she's wiping down any doorknob, nor any chair that she's unfortunate enough to come in fcontact with. As the items or objects are cleaned, Asteroth finally takes a seat, her nose sniffing to take in the aroma as Index finally makes his approach. 

It smelled mildly pleasant -- In fact, extremely pleasant. Yet the village leader, and self proclaimed 'Queen' wasn't exactly willing to taste the food just yet. "Take a bite out of everything first. If you like it, let me know if it's good to eat." Of course, she was also just testing for poisons as well.* - Sun Oct 18 18:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||After some internal debate, Asteroth made the decision to actually indulge in the treat.

Using cleaned utensils, bits of sushis are gathered, and brought to her lips. Gentle, regal chews are taken. . . allowing the taste or flavors to truly soak along her tastebuds. And after some time, she swallows.

There's a brief pause, making Asteroth's opinion on the dish unknown.

But given enough time, the beauty eventually sports a giant smile, estatic and legitimately impressed by the skill in which Index had crafted the meal. "My. . This is one of the best dishes I've eaten in my time on this continent. You're on par with my chefs. I ought to have you cook for me more often. In any case, I'm super bored. . . What would you like to do after we're done eating?"

Her hands stretches out, pulling several different plates closer to her form to allow for more covenient eating.* - Sun Oct 18 19:14:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Is that so? Will you be taking a group of guards with you? - Sun Oct 18 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mmm. No need. - Sun Oct 18 20:52:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Allies can easily become enemies in the blink of an eye, And incase I am needed to infiltrate any Ninja Villages, It's best my identity isn't known to their populus and Shinobi.  So I'd request permission to wear a disguise, as a precaution. - Sun Oct 18 20:57:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) remains sitting in her caravan. Her hands flapped through the airwaves, allowing a gust to grace her fair skin.

". . .This place is hot. . Get me some water and fan me. . " Asteroth demands with an aggitated grunt.* - Sun Oct 18 21:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) sighs.

She's leaning against a chair, and allowing the caravan's roofing to serve as a shield against the vicious sun rays. Her body was already overheating, as the typically pampered blonde shows clear difficulties in becoming accustomed to the extreme climate.

Omega's fanning does well to appease some of the discomfort, but in the end, she's still a very unhappy camper. 

Eyes fall onto Susumu. "Oi. . .Go get us a chunnin then."* - Sun Oct 18 21:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: She really tries to look like a queen doesn't she. - Sun Oct 18 21:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Alright. - Sun Oct 18 21:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Be back in a moent. - Sun Oct 18 21:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) gives a glance to the arriving figure -- Hassan.

"Excuse me. I suppose you are the Kazekage?"* - Sun Oct 18 21:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) would have taken Omega by the hand.

She uses the grip as leverage, allowing her for balance to remain uncompromised throughout the descent. Once on the floor, the woman begins with a regal stride through the village's gate. Her eyes move from side to side, taking in the unique structure of Sunagakure's entry.

With Omega closely behind, she makes an approach to the Kazekage, given a forced bow, and even cracking a smile. 

"The pleasure is mine. I suppose you will be leading the way?"* - Sun Oct 18 21:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Sano. - Sun Oct 18 21:35:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Mhmm..I hope I can catch her in time..well..if this doesn't take too long. - Sun Oct 18 22:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Judging by this positioning, I can only wonder if Hassan wants to use me as a meat shield. . . - Sun Oct 18 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||Once again, she allow her underlings to lead the way. Through the travels, both eyes observe the surroundings, taking in all of the features, and taking pleasure in the pleasant aroma of the office.

Asteroth follows closely behind the two, while staring expectantly towards Omega. By now, the two should have a strong enough relationship that they wouldn't even need to verbally communicate -- and that belief seemingly is true. Once the masked figure had wiped off the chair, the dainty woman makes her approach, planting her rear into the seat.

Another handkerchief comes out, wiping the table, allowing her elbows to rest along the surface. ". . .You've had many famous friends. But let's cut to the chase. . . I was told you wished to speak with me?"* - Sun Oct 18 22:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) tapped her fragile fingers along the table.

It released pattering sound effects, although in a low, hardly audible fashion. The rapid movement of her finger tips subtle alluded to one facet of Asteroth's personality -- impatience. ". . .I see. . You have my attention, Lord Kazekage," the Amegakure Queen declared, her eyes locking onto his.

She hardly blinks, and clearly seems to mean business, judging by the stern gaze that was practically drawn on her face. 

"You speak of treaties. . . Agreements. I am inclined to play nice -- just go into detail. I'm sure a man that has gained enough experienced as you would know how to strike a deal that would be equally as advantagous to both parties," the blonde-haired woman stated, her tone reserved, yet lacking any true emotion. She exhales, mouth opening again in preparation to speak.

"I w-- In fact. The floor is your's. What do you desire?" Asteroth says, hesitating for just a moment.* - Sun Oct 18 22:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Peace.. - Sun Oct 18 22:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zuvian, Xon(Simbasax) thinks: Its bascily one big absobrtion huh.... - Sun Oct 18 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Of course you can keep your independance. - Sun Oct 18 22:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: A-aaah politics. This makes me wanna giggle. - Sun Oct 18 22:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) remained silent, weighing her options.

The deal honestly seemed to be a fair one. But yet. . . It failed to fully apease Asteroth. She needed more.

"I like the idea -- However. . .From what I can gather, the organization you seek is to put us all. . on an even playing field. I never had any intent on attacking nor bringing harm to Sunagakure. Rather, Iwish to morph Amegakure into an entirely different village. . . To stray away from the typical shinobi system. . . It is to be a place of innovation and knowledge," Asteroth explains calmly.

" -- So yes. . . I will accept the offer -- under a single condition. Economical support. Amegakure is in shambles, even with the recent flow of money from my benefactor. That is all I can ask of, Lord Kazekage," Asteroth says, her eyes nearly pleading. There's a glimmer amidst her pupils, hopefully -- yet also confident. She remained sure, with enough prodding, she could get whatever she want just from her charm alone.

After all. . . How else could a lazy bartender suddenly ascend into Queen-hood?* - Sun Oct 18 22:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: . . Meaning. I need -- Or require money. - Sun Oct 18 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) raised a brow.

After some thought, she believes these requests to be agree-able. "Understood. Obviously, however. . .I will have my own men to serve as protectors to my Kingdom. In anycase. . Yes. I hope to have something worth while in a year's time at the most," she says. Her body is tensed, seemingly ready to arise.

"Meeting adjourned?-- Oh right, I'll sign whatever document is needed of me."* - Sun Oct 18 23:33:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) writes a check.

It's for seven-hundred thousands. "We should get going. Or do you wish to enjoy time in Sunagakure for longer?"* - Mon Oct 19 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Then we're off. - Mon Oct 19 01:08:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Home at last. . - Mon Oct 19 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: What crappy weather. - Mon Oct 19 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) exhales. It was pretty irritating.  Sunagakure weather and such.

"I suppose. As a note, how soon can you go to gamble?" Asteroth inquires while gesturing for Omega to lead.* - Mon Oct 19 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) takes her approach to the housing area.

It's notably spotless, devoid of any stains, dirt trails, or even a dish out of place. Asteroth kept her place tidy -- as she despised anything being unclean, or even disorderly. 

Upon reaching the entrance, her shoes are slipped off. 

Asteroth make paces around hte living quarters, ensuring that everything was just as she left it. Her room remained locked, the basement un-breached, and so forth. Upon securing her bases, the blonde-haired beaut makes a brisk stride on over to the bathroom, which was already having it's water ran.

She dips a finger into it, before turning to face Index. It's pleasant, for sure.

"Hrm? As for staying. You may there here, I'll have a room arranged for you. On a side note -- When can the gambling be done? The sooner I get the money, the better."* - Mon Oct 19 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||She nods along, wearing a smile.

"Good. The money will be put to good use. On a side note, you may prepare my bed. I'll be heading there after this-- likely to sleep after my studies," Asteroth noted. She motions for Index to exit the bathroom, while her hand continued to feel the heated waters.

Assuming compliance, the woman is swift to lock the doors.

Strip by strip, her garments are slipped off, exposing her delicate flesh, and womanly curved. In a few strides, she';s gently sitting in, allowing the hot waters to spawn a fog, clouding and obscure vision. Some of this smoke would seep underneath the door's opening, and spill into the next room.

Assuming Index waited around in the house, he'd find that Asteroth tended to take her time with showers or bath. She wasn't going to leave anytime soon.* - Mon Oct 19 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Good evening, Xon. - Mon Oct 19 23:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zuvian, Xon(Simbasax) says: Good evening. - Mon Oct 19 23:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zuvian, Xon(Simbasax) says: Soooo..Whats on the agenda for today. - Mon Oct 19 23:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mm. - Mon Oct 19 23:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I intend to begin with some reconstruction efforts. - Mon Oct 19 23:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zuvian, Xon(Simbasax) says: Ahhh That will do the place some good. - Mon Oct 19 23:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zuvian, Xon(Simbasax) says: Maybe we can send for some help from Suna. - Mon Oct 19 23:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zuvian, Xon(Simbasax) says: Since we did get that very lucrtive deal. - Mon Oct 19 23:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hey...M'lady. - Mon Oct 19 23:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Hrm? What is it. . ? - Mon Oct 19 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Nothing, I'm here to serve you aren't I? - Mon Oct 19 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Is there anything you desire? - Mon Oct 19 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods.

She gives a glance to Index along with Xon.

"It's time we take the reconstruction of Amegakure more seriously. I want you all to use your abilities to clear out an area. . . "

She says, conjuring up a scroll from out of nowhere. It possesses a map, one depicting Southern Amegakure. Of course, given it's part of time, the area is notoriously known for it's poverty and high crime rate. It has a decently high population, numbering at about one thousand -- most being simple citizens, however.

"I've authorized construction within the south. It's relatively populated. . . Sadly, the positioning is too perfect to pass up. I want you all to go with a team, and ensure that those pigs leave in an orderly fashion. . . Some may be violent." She pauses, giving a glance to gauge Xon and Index's reactions.

"Likewise,there are street-level gangs that tend to have a lot of sway in the neighborhoods. -- Kill them if they're trouble. Once you can clear out the peanut gallery, my men should be able to get rid of most of those buildings. We'll need space, after all. . "* - Mon Oct 19 23:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zuvian, Xon(Simbasax) says: Ohhh look the drone can talk. - Mon Oct 19 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: They'll be given funds to get new places to live. - Mon Oct 19 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Where they gp is none of my concern. - Mon Oct 19 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Do you care to call me a Drone again? - Mon Oct 19 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'd advise against it if you value your tongue. - Mon Oct 19 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zuvian, Xon(Simbasax) says: If thats the case then why did you state they may be killed. - Mon Oct 19 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zuvian, Xon(Simbasax) says: Awwww so cute. - Mon Oct 19 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: She said the gangs may be killed. - Mon Oct 19 23:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: . . . - Mon Oct 19 23:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Listening skills. - Mon Oct 19 23:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: You would do well to earn some. - Mon Oct 19 23:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's narrows.

"Understood, councilmen?"* - Mon Oct 19 23:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) adored her Index-- Punk.

She gives a glance to Xon, then back to Index.  "If you don't wish to perform the mission -- then that's on you. Index, you may complete the task on your own," she says, motioning the young lass off.

"Regardless of your participation, my will is to be completed. Whether you like it or not," Asteroth notes with a grunt. The councilmember was beginning to become an irritant.* - Tue Oct 20 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) remained leaning against the fence, an assistant holding up a book to her face.

Meanwhile, she casually filed her nails, up until Xon approached the area. Mildly irritated, Asteroth gives a glance upward. 

"Mmm. . .Right. Where is Index?"* - Tue Oct 20 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zuvian, Xon(Simbasax) says: Ahhh your butt scratcher I have no ideal where he ran off too. - Tue Oct 20 01:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) points a finger menancingly.

"Watch your tone. My 'butt scratcher' is far more valued than you are!" the domineering woman proclaims, seemingly defensive of her precious Index.

Regardless, Xon doesn't seem to get actual payment. She waves him off. "I'll review your work later."* - Tue Oct 20 01:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's fist tightened, her mind relaying the imagery of that ludicrous eyebrow waggle.

Her face gradually gained redness due to her range, and her teeth were clenched tightly together. In no time, Asteroth simply couldn't contain herself any further. She lunges ahead, gripping at Xon's collar.

"Don't you. . . Ever. . .  Make such a suggestive. .  .and -crude- comment again? UNDERSTAND?" the proclaimed 'Queen' yells, staring daggers to the often insubordinate councilmen. Of course, considering her model-like looks, it wasn't very likely that intimidation would be had.* - Tue Oct 20 01:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||She's able to ignore the whisk of smoke that's purposely thrown into her face. . .

At least for a while.

In response, after gagging a tad, Asteroth sends a punch to the center of Xon's chest. It lacks strength simply because the woman wasn't a physical combatant in the least -- yet the point had been made. 

Still aggitated, if not stopped, she shufflesb ack to the other fence, and leaning again. "Stop talking to me." Her arms are folded in protest.* - Tue Oct 20 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: ... - Tue Oct 20 01:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Good... - Tue Oct 20 01:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: That's neat. - Tue Oct 20 01:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) gives a glance to Ichiro.

She says nothing, but from the gaze worn, you can tell that she's both mystified -- and intrigued. Who the hell was this strange? "Hrm. . ? Can I. . . help you?" the Amegakure Queen inquired, her eyes conveying some degree of mystique. Even if this guy wasn't strong, she liked the persona or aura that Ichiro carried with each step.

For now, she doesn't notice the two new arrival.* - Tue Oct 20 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||She stared forward, remaining silent as Ichiro went through his whole speech, explaining his purpose and intent.

As it comes to a crawl, a grin spawns, and a stifled giggle eventually manages to escape the blonde's voice box. Things at times seemed too good to be true. Nevermind gaining a village for absolute nothing, now. . . She had dozens upon dozens of able-bodied men coming to tend to her every need.

"Ichiro of the Engi clan. T'is a pleasure. I'd introduce myself. . . But it's clear that no such thing will be required. Your willingness to serve is noted -- and will be appreciated. If only certainly individuals would learn from such a fine example," Asteroth conveyed, her voice calm and lacking the usual snark or aggressiveness. It was akin to royalty speaking to the masses, her smooth tone perhaps being enough to pacify any suspicion or disapproval.

-- It's then that steps along the sandy road catches her ear, and prompts the beaut to turn towards the east. She gives a glance to Susumu, as well as Saeza. Briefly, visage falls back onto the young lad to hear rear -- Ichiro. "You may rise."

Assuming her complies, attention swiftly turns back to Susumu and Saeza. "Back so soon? And with friends. What do you need?"
* - Tue Oct 20 01:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: To talk and such, I've also figured out some new things.. - Tue Oct 20 01:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) briefly gives a gander to Saeza.

"Is it about your little girlfriend? -- I suppose we can speak. . . Albeit, it'll likely need to be in private."* - Tue Oct 20 01:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Age doesn't matter. - Tue Oct 20 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I'll have to teach you a lot, Saeza. - Tue Oct 20 01:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods. 

It was nice to see that people knew how to address a Queen.  A glance falls briefly onto Index. "Huh. . . About time you showed. I can sense that you're wary -- But fear not, this is just my brat of a nephew you. He and I will speak briefly. You all can wait here,"  she says. A quick twirl is given, and he begins to head on off to the west. A hand gestures for Susumu to follow.* - Tue Oct 20 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I said alone. - Tue Oct 20 02:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'm sorry M'Lady for being late...There was some business I had to attend to. - Tue Oct 20 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Why can't she? - Tue Oct 20 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: That was the intent. But in that case, I suppose one of my guards should come as well. - Tue Oct 20 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: *Sigh* - Tue Oct 20 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: How about that one? - Tue Oct 20 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Then I shall. - Tue Oct 20 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Index, you'll be with me. - Tue Oct 20 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Now I'll have to whisper. - Tue Oct 20 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Annoying. - Tue Oct 20 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Ichiro. Sit tight, I'll have work for you in a bit. - Tue Oct 20 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Understood, my Queen. - Tue Oct 20 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Wow. - Tue Oct 20 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: This is amazing. - Tue Oct 20 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) briskly walks, heading towards her private quarters.

She takes a seat once within the room, one leg going over the other. Asteroth's elbows press against the desk, allowing both hands to support her cranium.

"Right. What is it?"* - Tue Oct 20 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Alright well uhm. - Tue Oct 20 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I've figured out. - Tue Oct 20 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: What to use that gem for. - Tue Oct 20 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Hrm? Do tell. - Tue Oct 20 02:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Er..Are you sure? - Tue Oct 20 02:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: If it's classified, send it via a simple note. - Tue Oct 20 02:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: Although it makes it debateable. . Why bring the young one? Could have just been a one on one chat. - Tue Oct 20 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) smirks.

"Sounds like an interesting prospect. I'll have to test this theory for myself," Asteroth comments. She gives a glance to Saeza.

"Well then, introduce yourself."* - Tue Oct 20 02:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) can't help but to smirk as Saeza's bow.

She really did feel like royalty.

"I see. And what is it that you seek? Amegakure is quite a bit of travelingfrom Sunagakure, after all. Surely you desire something."* - Tue Oct 20 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Oh. - Tue Oct 20 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: She's also very interesting. - Tue Oct 20 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Also, You have to use that gem's edge. - Tue Oct 20 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: To use it correctly. - Tue Oct 20 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) tilts her head once Susumu speaks.

"That's all she wanted. . .? To meet me? I'm flattered. . . But I anticipated more. -- You claim she's interesting?" Her gaze shifts, falling onto the apparent child.

"Are you?"* - Tue Oct 20 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shifts her gaze interchangeably between Susumu and Saeza.

She knew just how much Susumu loved to show off. "Ah. . . For a second, I thought you came here in reference to my nephew showing off his skills. The moron does that a lot."* - Tue Oct 20 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mmm, nothing. - Tue Oct 20 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: ... - Tue Oct 20 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) thinks: Your secret...His secret...*internal eyeroll*  - Tue Oct 20 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: *Sigh* - Tue Oct 20 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I've also come to talk to you. - Tue Oct 20 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: About the priest, Bryson. - Tue Oct 20 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: He is spreading rumors all around Sunagakure about me. - Tue Oct 20 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Nasty ones. - Tue Oct 20 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Telling everyone that I am evil, and will murder them...And all sorts of stuff. - Tue Oct 20 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) taps her fingers impatiently.

"Irritating. .You both. .. This Bryson individual, along with yourself. Had you not been so eager to use your skills, you wouldn't have invoked the ire of this priest. Regardless. . . This is a matter of sticks and stones. Surely, you don't think I can do something about a priest of Sunagakure, do you? I just signed a treaty with the village."* - Tue Oct 20 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: What do you wish for me to do, however? Assuming I can end the issues. - Tue Oct 20 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I need to use that gem. - Tue Oct 20 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: If you catch my drift. - Tue Oct 20 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I've deducted it can't be used on him, because of what he is. - Tue Oct 20 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm... - Tue Oct 20 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Then why do you want this gem? - Tue Oct 20 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I will talk with him first. - Tue Oct 20 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: And, I want to use it. - Tue Oct 20 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: That is why. - Tue Oct 20 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Oh, we're also here for two weeks, Asteroth. - Tue Oct 20 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I've come to help you with the village also. - Tue Oct 20 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: If you need some yen, Just ask. - Tue Oct 20 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Hrm. .  - Tue Oct 20 02:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) goes to grab the gem, hidden within cleavage.

It's slide along the table. "Don't be stupid with it. I know how overzealous you get. Regardless, Isuppose that's all? Your help will be appreciated."* - Tue Oct 20 02:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: If that's all, I should head back. - Tue Oct 20 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: . . . . - Tue Oct 20 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: And give some attention to my new bodyguard. - Tue Oct 20 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mm, Mind if we stay at your place? - Tue Oct 20 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I do not. Just stay out of my room. - Tue Oct 20 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Alright. - Tue Oct 20 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: That's all? - Tue Oct 20 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hm.. - Tue Oct 20 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: One more thing. - Tue Oct 20 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Can you teach me something later? - Tue Oct 20 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Depends on how well you've progressed from our last lesson. - Tue Oct 20 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: It's.. - Tue Oct 20 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Decent. - Tue Oct 20 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I can use it pretty well. - Tue Oct 20 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Later then. I don't feel up to it. - Tue Oct 20 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Alright. - Tue Oct 20 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I was also wondering. - Tue Oct 20 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: If you coul get me a staff. - Tue Oct 20 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I'll see about it. - Tue Oct 20 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Susumu...What's there to do in this village? - Tue Oct 20 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mm...Lots of training. - Tue Oct 20 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Lots and lots. - Tue Oct 20 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: No more annoyances. - Tue Oct 20 02:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: M'Lady. - Tue Oct 20 02:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: What would you like to do now? - Tue Oct 20 02:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Going for a swim, dining, A massage, or perhaps you'd like me to run you a bath? - Tue Oct 20 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I have to actually go see if I can give the new guy an assignment first. - Tue Oct 20 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Alright. - Tue Oct 20 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) makes her approach at last.

Anything going on?* - Tue Oct 20 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zuvian, Xon(Simbasax) says: Nope nothing. - Tue Oct 20 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zuvian, Xon(Simbasax) says: Was just geting to know Ichiro here. - Tue Oct 20 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods.

"Indeed. You seem inexperienced, thus your objective won't be too difficult. . . You may even choose a partner or two," Asteroth comments as she pulls up on the scene, Index just behind.

"The mission is a standard assignment, often deemed 'grunt' work. Some prankster thought it'd be fun to start trouble at the local pet shop. Half a dozen animals -- dogs, cats. ..  rabbit -- They've escaped. Hunt them down. Luckily, each has been trained, so they should be within a three blocked radius."

She takes a pencil and paper, jotting down the location and giving the proper parameters. * - Tue Oct 20 02:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) gives a glance to Saeza.

"Hrm? I don't go anywhere alone. Is it imperative that my guards not be with me?"* - Tue Oct 20 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Well....I'd like to speak to you about something which I'd rather your bodyguard wasn't privy to. Trust me, I mean you no harm whatsoever...That would cause much more trouble than harming you would be worth. - Tue Oct 20 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: You two can whisper. - Tue Oct 20 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I suppose. - Tue Oct 20 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Nonsense. - Tue Oct 20 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: M'Lady? - Tue Oct 20 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: It is fine. - Tue Oct 20 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hmm.. - Tue Oct 20 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: <*Cue brisk walk*> Right. How may I be of assistance? - Tue Oct 20 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||Blinks.

A necromancer of her standing? It served to stroke her ego, that was for sure.

"A vampire? Tall claims. Especially from a child. . .I would need proof," Asteroth notes, a coy smile creeping onto life. By then, she was at a relaxed nature, no longer feeling it completely necessary to have her energy restrained fully.* - Tue Oct 20 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) took a step back, admittedly startled by the sudden change in appearance. 

Certainly, this wasn't ninjutsu -- at least from what Asteroth could tell. The hairs on her neck stood up, due to a feeling of both trepidation and excitement. "An interesting specimen. To even dissolve into a flock of bats. I'm genuinly impressed. And we are capable of a lot. . "

She says, remaining crptic with her skills.

"We are capable of resurrecting the dead in several different manners. In addition to this, dark magic, binding spells -- and so forth."* - Tue Oct 20 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods.

"Someone of your skillset would be greatly appreciated -- But mum is the world. Do not speak of what you know," Asteroth instructs, hiding her annoyance -- Why did Susumu always run his mouth?

"Is that all?"* - Tue Oct 20 03:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) tilted her head in mildly confusement. It was hard not to take it the wrong way.

Excluding that brief expression, Asteroth remains stoic, cracking up a smile even.

"Of course. I would love to. It is a pleasure to be made one of your friends," the Necromancer replies, accepting the request with a gracious attitude.* - Tue Oct 20 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shrugs.

"Not a lot. The village is still developing. Typically I simply go to enjoy a nice meal cooked my bodyguard/butler. Excluding that, reading, soothing bathes, and people watching is how I pass time. Certainly, whatever you can find to do at Sunagakure, you'll likely be able to find here," Asteroth notes. 

She gives a gesture to the door, suggesting that they begin to head back to the crowd.

Assuming agreement, Asteroth begins with leisure strides. "Curious. Besides perhaps thirsting for blood, what did you do to pass your time?"* - Tue Oct 20 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Nothing really....I have a question. - Tue Oct 20 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Would you be offended if I sunk my own funds into your village? - Tue Oct 20 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Of course not. How much do you wish to donate? - Tue Oct 20 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Three-Quarters of a million dollars. - Tue Oct 20 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: ... - Tue Oct 20 03:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Were they.. - Tue Oct 20 03:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: LESBIANS...!? - Tue Oct 20 03:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Ah... - Tue Oct 20 03:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: It is good to see our Queen is alright. - Tue Oct 20 03:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) is straight as an arrow.* - Tue Oct 20 03:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: So you two have fn? - Tue Oct 20 03:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Did you finish the mission, Ichiro? - Tue Oct 20 03:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I did m'lady. - Tue Oct 20 03:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Indeed. Interesting friend you have there. - Tue Oct 20 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) snaps her fingers.

From the woodworks, two attendants come from nowhere, each with a bundle of cash. "Mark this one for a mission completion. And hand the man his money."* - Tue Oct 20 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Anything of note has gone in my time away? - Tue Oct 20 04:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Not that I know of ma'am. - Tue Oct 20 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm.. - Tue Oct 20 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Saeza. - Tue Oct 20 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: The village is on lockdown I heard. - Tue Oct 20 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: So we won't be going back any time soon. - Tue Oct 20 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Oh yeah? M'kay. That's fine. - Tue Oct 20 04:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Hrm. . Is it? - Tue Oct 20 04:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: I'll have more time to speak to Lady Asteroth. - Tue Oct 20 04:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: For what reason is your village on lockdown? - Tue Oct 20 04:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: The Kazekage probably left is all. - Tue Oct 20 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Hm... - Tue Oct 20 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Yea, He left. - Tue Oct 20 04:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm.. - Tue Oct 20 04:08:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) slide her feet along the grass regally. Both hands remained interlocked, her arms held behind her back.

Gracefully, Asteroth arrived onto the scene, both eyes observing the area.

"Evening, lad. What's going on here?"* - Wed Oct 21 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: He's training. - Wed Oct 21 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) flicks her brow on over to Susumu, the gaze scrutinizing as ever.

After a brief thought, attention falls back onto Ichiro. "I see. I trust you've been fighting at least on par? You are one my guards, after all. . " She says with a drawl, pausing for a small portion of time. 

Her mind wandered, before Asteroth inevitably speaks again. "In anycase. . .What has occured in my absence?"* - Wed Oct 21 03:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Nothing. - Wed Oct 21 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Everything's been silent. - Wed Oct 21 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I have m'lady. - Wed Oct 21 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: And yes, nothing has come up today. - Wed Oct 21 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mmm. WEll then, do you two wish to be put to work? - Wed Oct 21 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I do ma'am. - Wed Oct 21 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Dunno. - Wed Oct 21 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Depends on what. - Wed Oct 21 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) grunts.

"Well. . .If you two are feeling adventurous, I do have -one- task that needs to be fulfilled," Asteroth says with a legitimate yawn. 

"Y'see. . . It seems not everyone takes kindly to me more or less booting a few families out of Southern Amegakure. There's be retaliation -- One jackass even broke into my house. He escaped before I could capture him, but not before taking my favorite set of pearls," Asteroth replies, shuddering at the thought. It had occured as she took one of her routine, hour-long bath.

Fog had been foaming the house, and made it a bit hard to determine the facial features. 

Nevertheless, a good enough view had been obtained. A drawing is produced and handed to the duo. "Alright. Best of luck. THe crook may or may not be dangerous."* - Wed Oct 21 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: You got it, Ichiro. - Wed Oct 21 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) yawns.

"I suppose I will supervise as you get leads."

She motions for herself to be carried.* - Wed Oct 21 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: ... - Wed Oct 21 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||She allows herself to be carried, likely in a bridal fashion.

A hand motions for Ichiro to head off. "Alright. First thing first, we ought to collect clues or witnesses. Going towards the south would be a wise first choice," Asteroth suggests, her body fidgeting to get into am ore comfortable positioning among Ichiro's grasp. Although a suggestion, as the 'Queen', the blonde spoke with an air of authority, and seemed to be demanding rather than giving mere suggestions.

In the event that Ichiro heeded these instructions, he would find that the trip to Southern Amegakure was a swift and effortless one. Even with traffic, the citizens of Amegakure would easily recognize Asteroth's presence. ANd as of late, they were being conditioned to be subservient -- as they rightfully should be, considering their lower social or economical status.

Alas, uponm reaching the designated area, you could describe the region in two words. 

Sleezy.  . .Poor.

These were the slums, an area that Asteroth had recently taken over. Buildings were still in the process of being deconstructed-- Read: Destroyed. it left many without a place to sleep or even eat. Yet despite the rapid changes and the ruthless industralization of the area, many of the commoners clung around, using the half-broken houses as their own areas of rest. Certainly, some of thesee individuals could be questioned!* - Wed Oct 21 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||She motions for Ichiro to set her down -- and upon his compliance, Asteroth's legs stretches out, her feet diligently finding balance along the floor. She moves, getting towards Ichiro's rear, as the male would certainly serve as the first and last line of defense if anything went amiss. "Hrm. . .Yes. . . Answer the question if you will."

Of course, the first person approached would be a middle-aged woman. Her face is wrinkly, and peppered with 'freckles.' Despite the old look, her body remains fit, suggesting a previous career as a shinobi. 

Indeed, the woman -- dubbed Amayi -- had lived through the dangerous regime of the previous Amegakure adminstration. "N-No. . . I don't think I've seen anyone or anything out of the ordinary ma'am and sir. . . Everyone you see in this neighboorhood are humble, law-abiding citizens. . . We don't wish to start any trouble, and will likely on our way once your employees are taking down the few houses that stand," Amayi replies, her voice occasionally stammering due to apparent nervousness.

The elderly woman's eyes cant towards the side, completely and utterly avoiding direct eye contact. She's partially shaking, but it remains to be seen if that's due to emotion, or simply her natural reaction to the chilly weather.* - Wed Oct 21 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||The Queen herself took to a nearby fence, her arms folded and her back leaning against it. With a sense of marvel, the woman looked ahead, watching with approval as Ichiro did his thing. Even if it could be seen as cowardly considering this was a well-built man. . . essentially shaking down an old lady.

A shadow loomed from Ichiro's form, which fell over Ayami's own fragile body.

"It's. . W-well--"

". . .Tch. . . Look what the cat dragged out the bag. Don't you have some place to be, bitch? And take your little sex-toy with you," a mysterious, deep and suave voice spoke suddenly. It carried an air of confidence, and clearly the comments were meant to demean and garner the attention of both Asteroth and Ichiro.

The figure that approach was cladded in black clothing, a hoodie, and facemask shielding his mouth. One arm was exposed, while the other hand was stuffed within a pocket, seemingly fishing for something -- be it cash or weapon. To the figure's rear? Was a mass of re-inforcement, apparent underlings. ". . .I ain't going to just sit here while Miss Prissy-Bitch and her little boy toy comes around my block. . . messing with my people."

"-- And who the hell are you, Robin hood?--" Asteroth retorts, her tone carrying a high level of venom.

"Might as well be. I don't know why these people support ya. Just 'cause you're bringing money into the town-- That ain't all that matters! Yeah, money is power in this world! But the little people are more important. I'm going to give ya a chance now, to leave before things have to get messy. . " the hooded figure warns, his cronies chuckling and nodding in agreement. 

"--Ichiro. Do away with the crowd. These are nothing but street leveled thugs. . . Certainly, you'll be able to defeat them, right? And retrieve my pearls if they're on his person. If not, then we have some real fun after this."* - Wed Oct 21 05:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||
"Good work, Ichiro . . But watch ou--"

And it was too late. Wearing a sadistic grin, Amayi -- y'know, the old lady -- had already sprung into action. From her cleavage, a sharpen Kunai had been withdrawn, held tightly within her right hand. With a single thrust, the weapon goes diving ahead, in hopes of plunging into the guard's shoulder.

With a sign, Asteroth removes a wooden staff, which quickly enlarges once exposed.

". . .Just say the word, I suppose. I trust that someone of your skill level will be able to dispatch these mooks, however," the Amegakure Queen noted with a smug grin. Of course, the person Ichiro had opted to attack does poorly while in the clutches of the 'Iron Claw.' It's a painful move, and certain is enough to keep him from drawing at the weapon in hand.

Amidst this all, the gang leader is just squealing like a little school girl. Although, there were still five mooks in the back, each one preparing for battle, albeit waiting on Amayi's order. Perhaps the old hag would be able to complete the job and shake down the queen and her crony?* - Wed Oct 21 06:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||And thus they charged!

"Get 'im! Kill this bastard!" The gathering of men charge, each one equipped with sharpened weapons.

At once, while within range, they all stab, attacking different angles of Ichiro's sturdy frame. If that wasn't enough, they'd opt to begin grappling, hopefully proving to have enough unified strength to keep the beast of a warrior in check.

"---! What the hell. . Is this thing. . .I should use some ninjutsu then," Amayi declared, she quickly takes a step back, forming three short seals. Her chest is puffing up, allowing the chakra to mix in with the oxygen, before both are expunged -- in the form of a giant flaming sphere! It was relatively low-leveled in the grand scheme of things, as the woman's overall strength had diminished in retirement. (20 dam)

The apparent main leader continues to grunt nad scream as the foot presses against his gut, the force enough to send his body sailing ahead. "My. . You have quite the body, you know. That's a quality I admire in my men," Asteroth noted, even as the horde screamed and continued to wage battle.* - Wed Oct 21 07:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ||And that's what takes the cake.

Immediately, each of the opposing forces step back in fear, their body practically shaking due to the trepidation that came from their form. "H-Hrm?" Amayi shouted, her eyes averting back to the ground.

Asteroth in particular looked on with a charmed grin, as Ichiro showcased one of his nifty abilities. "Golden armor. .? It looks almost like maple syrup. . 'Amber' even. Interesting skill you have there, it seems I've chosen wisely in choosing one of my guards," the Necromancer noted, her tone light-hearted and delighted for once.

The ambush hadn't gone as planned, clearly enough.

The leader of the rambunctious group of citizens -- Sanjo -- continued to quiver, his eyes opened wide at the marvelous sight. "L-Look! I was just trying to get some extra money to help feed my people! D-don't kill me! H-here, take back these pearls!" He says, reaching into his coat and withdrawing the jewelry. 

The white 'stones' quickly are passed over, forcing an even wider grin to be spawned onto the Queen's features. From the looks of it, the entire horde had grown passive, as they no longer sought to go against Ichiro. Rushing ahead, ASteroth retrieves the desired item shortly after. "In anycase, Sir Ichiro. You may do with these people as you please. I don't tolerate criminals. . . So I may turn a blind eye to whatever punishment you deem fit."

She says, giving him the go ahead to be as cruel as he wanted- - or to let them go. His choice. "I'll be returning home." * - Wed Oct 21 07:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: . . . - Wed Oct 21 20:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) stares, arms folded.

"What do you want?"* - Wed Oct 21 20:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: Do you know who the Kage is? - Wed Oct 21 20:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: There is no kage. - Wed Oct 21 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: Leader? Bishop? Supreme Overlord? - Wed Oct 21 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: For what reason? - Wed Oct 21 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: Ugh, well...I don't really havea  home.. - Wed Oct 21 20:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Sounds unfortunate. Curious as to why you would choose Amegakure of all places. - Wed Oct 21 20:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: Not really...Kirigakure kicked me out, Suna wont let me in...Kumo is too boring, and Konohagakure is too weird. - Wed Oct 21 20:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) goes back to her leaning routine, a book being risen.

"But yes, it's also odd how. ..  uninformed you are," Asteroth continued. It was no secret that she was the 'Queen' -- Yep, the title was literally Queen.

"I am the person you seek. Remove the mask, I suppose. So far, you've given me no reason to deny you access to my kingdom."* - Wed Oct 21 20:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) narrowed her eyes, skeptical.

"Keep it for now. I will validate your claim at a later date," Asteroth says with a sigh. She briefly glances to the masked figure, taking in all the clear features of the concealing agent.

Her eyes avert back to the book. "Mmm. What is that you intend to do here now?"* - Wed Oct 21 20:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) thinks: He's too close. - Wed Oct 21 20:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) gives a glance to Ichiro, a smile generating onto her facial features.

She clearly enjoys the defensive nature, as depicted by Ichiro. Nevertheless, the ANBU Agent is addressed.

"Information would be useful, yes. Albeit, I don't intend to use any for malicious intent. . . As for tasks, you've yet to even be registered. Certainly, you don't expect me to give the first guy that comes up to me. . . work, yes? At least not without you being in my system."* - Wed Oct 21 20:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) tilted her head in thought.

It was difficult, as the agent refused to reveal his face. "Mmm. Go to my office and speak to my servant. Get your finger print noted, a sample, and give your name. Then pledge your allegience -- not to a shinobi -village-. . . But a growiing Kingdom. You'll find that things here aren't precisely like regular ninja villages, although there are some similiarities."

Of course, given the Agent's omnious and mysterious nature, Asteroth still remained cautious and unwilling to fully trust. Certainly, he'd find in the coming days that the Queen sought to keep tabs on him, via secret agents occasionally trailing him during the day. Assuming the ANBU had done as he was told, in his return, the Queen would have given an approving nod.

"Right. . I suppose then you'll want work?"* - Wed Oct 21 21:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: --- Likewise, even with my desire to avoid conflict. Information you may provide would be greatly appreciated. - Wed Oct 21 21:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) shrugs. She could compromise -- for now.

A dismissive wave of the hand is given,. motioning for the Agent to do was he was told. "Also leave a name, obviously."* - Wed Oct 21 21:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: Here or...when signing up? - Wed Oct 21 21:36:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Interesting. - Wed Oct 21 22:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) blinks, a twisted grin twitching onto her maw.

She enjoyed the news, as Index's affection meant one thing -- he'd be inclined to continue serving. Albeit, it'd be a lie to say that Asteroth didn't have -some- sort of affection for the young lad, which isn't to be confused with feelings of love.

A hand rises, and rests onto the boy's head of hair, which was rare considering Asteroth's tendacy to avoid touching people. "Adorable. But yes, as you say. . . You are a tad too young for my age. You're seven years my junior," the Queen notes, speaking gently to let the youth down easier. 

"--Your strength is debateable. But tell me more. . What -is- your darkness? There is no shame, we all have dark secrets after all," the Necromancer replies, as she too held her power mostly under wraps.* - Wed Oct 21 22:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: I hope my job as a guard doesn't apply to feelings. I don't work well with those. - Wed Oct 21 22:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) 's fingers gently moved through Index's thick locks. 

"Ah. You've done some less than deisreable things. Alass, this is the world you live in. Where children are trained to be merciless killers," Asteroth remarked, seemingly numbed to the shocking news that Index had provided. . . After all, she had done worse things.

"---And what is that?" the blonde asks, clearly a bit interested in seeing what he had learned.* - Wed Oct 21 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) ceased with her action, allowing her arm to fall limply to her side.

"Ah. . I can sense the killing intent leaving your body. It's nearly palpable. . Oddly, however, I am more enticed than afraid," Asteroth states with a drawl.

Her eyes avert back down, reading her booklets once more, taking in a wealth of information in regards to classified information. "Nevertheless, your revelation is an intelligent one. In this world, you'll find that many things aren't exactly as they seem. Yet your own feelings. . . they will never betray you -- But be careful. Never allow your emotion to get the best of you, Index-kun. . "

Her lips mouth some words, as the booklet is continously read. After some time, Asteroth can provide a last comment.

"I am, however. Touched that you would convey such information to myself. As my kingdom develops, you may find that I can be of assistance to you."* - Wed Oct 21 23:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) nods.

"Indeed. I won't say anything else on the matter, however."* - Wed Oct 21 23:26:17 2015

"I've just been having more work down on the re-pairing on Amegakure's infrastructure. In a few day's time, we should have another round of money coming in as well.

It wasn't long before she returned, this time with a scroll in tow.

"A simple delivery mission for the two of you. The information within the scroll isn't -too- valueable. . But I want it delivered regardless. Hence why I'm not sending a bird. You two simply have to escort this scroll to the local village, the sea port village," She instructs, referencing some random NPCvillage that only exists IC.

The scroll was simple. It depicted a delivery order that Asteroth sought to make, mainly comprised of special herbs and (somewhat) rare rocks. "Do so swiftly."* - Thu Oct 22 03:22:40 2015

Guards surround her as usual, some fanning, others holding a tray of grapes.

"--Hrm? Good, good. That's all I have for you all today. Go take a rest. I'll be speaking with the rep later," Asteroth replies in a scatter-brained fashion.* - Thu Oct 22 04:27:31 2015
