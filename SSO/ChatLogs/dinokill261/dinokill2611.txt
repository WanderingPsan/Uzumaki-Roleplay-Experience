He hesitated for a moment, dropping the pebble and walking away. Man he really hated Eri's hairstyle that much to launch a pebble at the person. A sigh escaped his lips as he continued to walk down the road. Gin didn't feel like getting in trouble today after pulling a lot of stunts around the village lately.* - Tue Oct  6 21:49:26 2015
