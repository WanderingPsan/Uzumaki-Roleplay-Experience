<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) pulled the doctor's coat on, sliding her hands into the surgical gloves and lastly concealing her face with the facemask. She'd nod lightly toward Zenaki with a smile.

"Yeah, this'll be my first surgery." Her tone full of delight.f* - Sun Nov  8 00:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) approached the side of the table, slowly beginning to recall the handsigns necessary for the Novice Healing technique. She would await for Zenaki's direction before proceeding with anything. Erin would exahle lightly, slowly clumping together a good measure of her reserves to prepare for kneading chakra into cellular-regeneration-amplifying substance.

"Ready when you are."* - Sun Nov  8 00:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) formed several handsigns in less than a second. A pale, blue, translucent aura of chakra embraced both of her hands and lower forearms, as she hovered said hands in front of the male's skull while he lay stomach-first on the operating table. The chakra emanated within the wound, proceeding to lighten up the interior of it for Zenaki while rapidly disinfecting any flesh within the vicinity of the affected cells, which were regenerating exponentially quicker due to her properly kneaded chakra.

She didn't heal as fast as she could, because the only goal right now was to stabilize the flow of chakra to her hands so that it'd continously clot the blood that was rushing to the wound. The constant flow of chakra would consistently clot the blood from getting in the way of Zenaki's part of performing this surgery.* - Sun Nov  8 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) had continued to heal him all throughout that hour, though her characteristic exuberance had diminished to nothing by then. She was definitely going to guzzle down one of the many canned coffees she kept within Zenaki's fridge, the one upstairs, at the very least. Her hands would pry away from the unconscious, carrot-haired male, breathing mildly. Erin was exhausted from constantly expending chakra to make Zenaki's job easier. But it was done, it seemed.

"M..Man.." The turquoise haired girl said with a look of tiresomeness, her cyan eyes, which were duller than usual, were set upon Zenaki and then the patient.* - Sun Nov  8 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) nodded, following slowly. She simply placed her butt on the arm chair, since Zenaki put him on the couch.

"What're you gonna do with his blood?" She asked curiously.* - Sun Nov  8 01:33:52 2015

(*[Moldy Cauliflower] didn't care. He didn't trust them at this point, if they were forcing him to do an operation. His body would have been useless. Inuzuka DNA is useless too, since it isnt a kekkai gankai, but rather Hiden, hidden moves taught. If they wanted something rare, they'd litterally have to be taught by him, the only one in Sunakagure. Dying as a Shinobi was no biggie, but it would suck after all.*)* - Sun Nov  8 04:43:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) lifted a brow, peering at Mirai from head to toe with her bright, striking cyan stare. Erin smiled brightly, responding to the female with a folding of her hands and a straightening of her seating position from a slouch.

"I'm one of the second most proficient, prominent medics you can find! What in specific would you like to want to learn, under the branch of healing Ninjutsu??"

She beamed toward Mirai, blissfully pleased with the Hokuma's presence, because she had no company, other than whiny shinobi and citizens a like.* - Thu Nov 19 01:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) extended her right arm out to Mirai, intending to shake the female's hand gently. Erin's smile grew bigger at this point. She was still fresh mind-wise, and that was proven by how genuine and even innocent her stare and her smile was.

"I am Inoue, Erin! It's nice to meet you, Mirai! I'll happily take you under my wing." The turquoise haired girl stated, the tone in her voice proving that she had no demeaning emotion toward the Hokuma. If anything, it proved that she was being true to the core about wanting to help her. In Erin's eyes, what was a medic without wanting to help others?

Erin slightly stood up out of her chair, moving forth to shake hands and maintain levelled, genuine eye-contact with Mirai, the turquoise haired medic's smile never fading.* - Thu Nov 19 01:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) pursed her lips, thinking intensely as her cyan gaze peered back down upon the paper, her hand resting on the edge of the desk. She looked back up with excitement.

"Well! I have my break right now, so I was kind of lazing off. We can start your training now, then!" She said with a bright grin. Erin pulled out her scarf from within the desk, folding it around her own neck lightly then allowing a part of it to drape down the front of her torso.

"Let's go, then!"* - Thu Nov 19 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) smiled. She settled down on the sofa, urging Mirai to do so as well. Afterward, the turquoise haired female removed a kunai from her backpouch, running it's tip across the back of her left palm.

"I'll show you a demonstration, and you do your best to imitate what I do, alright? I'll be teaching you the most basic healing method I know, the Basic Healing Jutsu." Erin wiped the kunai's tip off on a small handkerchief, then placed the kunai down on the couch arm.

She formed several handsigns, emitting her right hand in a pale, translucent, dull cyan aura. She hovered her palm over the back of her other palm, immersing it in the substance. By speeding up the rate in which her cells underwent mitosis, she -rapidly- amplified the healing rate of the specific vicinity where her healing chakra met the wound, causing skin to rapidly reform and seal it, as well as sanitize it and clot blood.

"Now you try."* - Thu Nov 19 02:31:28 2015

The turquoise-haired girl would form several handsigns dexteriously, then emit her hands in a pale, translucent, teal-aura. She cupped his hand between hers, allowing the chakra to immerse the bruises and cuts. A soothing feeling would engulf his hand as she sped up it's natural rate of repair with her chakra.

After that, she allowed the chakra to fade away from view, then she stuffed her hand inside of her backpouch, removing a pair of scissors and a sufficient amount of gauze. Erin cut off the gauze after extending it out. She wrapped the bandages around the entirety of his hand, tucking the gauze in place so it wouldn't fall free.
