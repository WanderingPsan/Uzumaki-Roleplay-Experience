<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) peeled the scroll open, squinting down at it with her cyan orbs. The turquoise haired female continued to read the rather legible writing in the innards of the scroll. She'd seat herself down beside Zenaki. Erin would absorb any information she could attain, something that was rather easy considering she was a natural prodigy.

She'd purse her lips, then continue reading. She interpreted the bundles of information as well as possible. Anything that she misunderstood would be reread by her. All in all, she was rushing to learn the Genjutsu: Kai technique as quick as she could. The entirety of her focus was set upon the scroll, as she sat upon the sofa within Zephira's home.* - Thu Oct 29 20:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: 9k god. lets search one - Thu Oct 29 20:54:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: One I myself have not mastered yet. - Thu Oct 29 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Do I also have to master it here or can I get a scroll or just learn it and then master it some other day? - Thu Oct 29 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: How good are you at it? - Thu Oct 29 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: It's quite new for me still. I'll get to you later for it. - Thu Oct 29 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Aight. - Thu Oct 29 20:58:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) skimmed the scroll with her cyan gaze once more. She folded one leg over the other while pressing her side to the arm of the sofa, resting her left arm atop the arm. The turquoise haired female continued absorbing the information with intentions of having a good enough understanding of the technique to apply it to physical usage.

With that being said, Erin would return the scroll to Zenaki. She would proceed to clasp her hands together. After doing so, she'd furrow her brows, intending to grant the entirety of her attention to what she was doing. She'd proceed to halt the flow of her chakra, and after feeling as though she successfully did it, she exhaled with a small, optimistic smile.

The turquoise haired Uzumaki clan member would slowly start the flow of her chakra once more. Slow wouldn't cut it though, and she knew that. Upon finding that she was doing this part of learning the technique wrong, the female exponentially fluxed her chakra, surging it rapidly. Though it took more chakra than she wanted to do this, it was still successful.* - Thu Oct 29 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) pressed her hands together. THe female would halt the flow of her chakra shortly after clasping her hands together. Erin would then immerse her body in a sudden, rapid flow of chakra, repelling the effects of any genjutsu that she'd fall victim to. The turquoise haired girl furrowed her brows as she felt the technique sap away some of her overall reserves, but she could refill said reserves with stored ones.* - Thu Oct 29 21:05:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) applied her fingertips to the area in which the damage from his spar was inflicted.

"Hold on.."

A pale, translucent, white-ish blue aura of chakra immersed her hands. She lightly pressed her hands to any area of his body that seemed injured. The chakra would exponentially increase the natural cellular healing rate of the skin cells that were afflicted by the tone of the chakra coming in contact with the odd exuberance.

Erin would only add to his abnormally high rate of healing. "You seem to heal quicker than normal.." The turquoise haired female would murmur. If she couldn't completely heal his wounds she'd apply gauze to the afflicted areas of his body, providing him with a small dose of medicine after giving him a rather quick checkup.* - Sat Oct 31 05:23:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) was awoken by a scream coming from the basement.

"..." A paranoid gaze immersed her facial features. She twisted up her mouth.

"Nnnn..." She made a sound that sounded like a growl.* - Thu Nov  5 23:49:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) fumbled around with the needle launcher that Reguel gave to her. She exfended her right arm out, pressing her left hand to her wrist, specifically a lever. Pulling said lever down, she'd launch one of the senbons within the launcher at the wall in front of her. Though, she wasn't accurate enough, and thus it was a little off course. None the less, the senbon still pierced the wall, remaining in place.

"I wonder.." She chimed with delight. She planned on practicing until she performed the technique properly.* - Fri Nov  6 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) thinks: Pew pew.. - Fri Nov  6 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) pulled the lever back up. Her cyan gaze came to a narrow as she leaned back abit while sitting upright on the couch. The female would yank the lever down, firing yet another senbon. The senbon was off course once more. This time, it ricocheted off of the other senbon that was already within the wall. She puffed her cheeks up in frustration.

"Aw.."* - Fri Nov  6 00:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) peered at the wall. The female would lift the lever. She was beginning to think of ways that'd perhaps improve her aim. None the less, her mind was blank. It seemed she couldn't find a way to be more accurate with her senbon shots. She thrusted the lever downward, squinting and proceeding to fire the senbon. The senbon shot forth, stabbing into the wall only a few inches from the previous senbon.* - Fri Nov  6 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) says: This lever system isn't exactly nice... It'd be nice if I could do rapid fire with this.. - Fri Nov  6 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) tensed her body up a little  bit as she allowed her right shoulder to press to her ear. She tried to perceive the direction and aim of the next senbon as well as possible. The turquoise haired girl stood up, beginning to feel a little more enthusiastic about trying to properly use this senbon launcher. She ran to her right slowly, her footsteps pattering across the floor most likely heard in the basement.

Her cyan gaze was focused to her left, and her head was shifted to her left as well. She thrusted her right arm out, bending her left and pressing her hand to the senbon launcher. With as much effort possible, the girl began to shift the lever up and down, firing senbons as quick as possible. She was obviously disobeying the systematics between using the senbon launcher.

"Pew pew!"* - Fri Nov  6 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) suddenly found her balance lost. The female would smash her ankles into the table, before going airborn and soaring midair over the table. She smashed down on the other side, slamming side-first into the wall, and thrashing her right arm against it as well. She yelped loudly, being lucky enough to have not hit her head on the wall. Erin dropped onto the misplaced pillows, moaning in pain.

"Agh..."* - Fri Nov  6 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) slowly stood up, rubbing the back of her head and giggling. She knew for a fact that the people in the basement probably heard the loud noise of her slamming onto the floor after shooting over the table. The girl would rearrange the pillows, proceeding to navigate around the table. With an awareness of her surroundings, Erin would press her hand over her wrist, where the senbon launcher was located.

She ran quickly across the floorboards, keeping her right arm extended out in front of her. Erin fired off a trio of senbon at once, attempting to quickly put in more senbons and fire those off as well. All the while she relied on her peripheral to help her move around without smacking into anything again. She swerved on her bare feet, running across the home once more while firing senbons and perorming barrel rolls of the sort.* - Fri Nov  6 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: This is my true..Change of thought process... - Fri Nov  6 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: In the end though..We're all satisfied..And you're set free.. - Fri Nov  6 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) was getting better at her aim for sure. The girl skid to a stop, proceeding to look at the wall with a small grin that was akin to that of an innocent child's. The female fired forth a couple of senbon, both of which hit shot at where she aimed. Erin would twirl on her feet, firing a couple more senbon. The turquoise haired female would pull the lever back, aiming more directly with her cyan gaze focused upon the wall, firing yet another senbon.

She began to refill the senbon launcher on the ammunition provided. The girl wanted to change and even improve the usage of this launcher, but for now she didn't know how to. The turquoise haired female didn't hear anything in the basement, thus she intended to check. Erin would slide the door open as quiet as possible. Instead of going down the stairs like a normal person, she'd dive off of the top of them.

She soared down the flight of stairs, her right arm bent across her chest area, with the senbon launcher directed to no target in specific. "Pew!" She blindly fired off a senbon only moments before slamming into the floor on her side, yelping in pain. The girl knew or a fact that such an action would leave a mark if not impair some of her bones. She would stand up and sheepishly move to take her senbon from where-ever it landed. Since she was practically the worst at aiming, there was absolutely no-chance neither of the duo would be hit.* - Fri Nov  6 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Oi, Tetsu. - Fri Nov  6 00:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm?..What's wrong? - Fri Nov  6 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) looiked over at Ai and Ketsuki, her gaze going agape.

"Um... I'm a medic... fevers aren't a big deal, don't worry!" The Turquoise haired female remarked, making her approach to the duo. She'd look down at Ai with an ascension of her brow.

"Set her down for me, please!"* - Fri Nov  6 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) blinked. "S---He's a guy!?" Erin asked with a dialation of her fluorescent, cyan eyes. She would look down at Ai, a look of pity engulfing her facial features. The turquoise haired female would give him a mini-slightly hurried checkup, in order to check just what was wrong with his health.

<Maybe he's in the same case as me?>* - Fri Nov  6 01:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Uh..oh... I hope she..- he is going to be fine. - Fri Nov  6 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) felt her eyes go agape.

She wasn't ready for this responsibility.

Erin closed her eyes briefly, inhaling and then exhaling. She opened her eyes and looked to Ketsuki, partially fearful of her capabilities as a medic.

<This may be in Zenaki's area of work, but she's asleep right now... it's up to me..> Erin thought to herself. Her brows were furrowed as she contemplated decisiveness.

The turquoise haired girl would look at Ketsuki. "Calm down miss..." She'd state. Erin would squint slightly, forming several handsigns. A pale blue, translucent aura of chakra would immerse her right hand. She'd clasp Ai's hand lightly with her left, holding it up. The female would hover her aura-covered hand over the professional transexual's injury, immersing it in the chakra.

The cellular regeneration within the area engulfed in the blue chakra would be amplified greatly, thus healing the wound rapidly. The female would've, at this point in time, roamed throughout her kunai pouch, pulling forth a syringe that was already prepared with a green-ish, clear liquid. She'd inject the liquid into Ai's arm, having given him a small dose of medicine.* - Fri Nov  6 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) thinks: Ergh... he's actually poisoned.. - Fri Nov  6 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) nodded lightly.

"I'd require more equipment. And besides... this isn't my field of work." She'd state, continuing with her cyan stare drifting to Kuro; "Help me get him to the hospital, please." Erin would state, her arms sinking below the back of Ai's knees, her hands clasping at the "sweet tranvestite's" legs. She assumed Kuro or Ketsuki would help lift Ai upright by supporting the poisoned girl's upper body.* - Fri Nov  6 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) says: The medicine should delayed the inclination of the fever's severity. - Fri Nov  6 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) carried Ai off to the hospital with Ketsuki's aid.* - Fri Nov  6 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) informed hospital staff of her diagnosis, in addition to the poison that had inflicted Ai.

"The poison's far too low-levelled to be considered fatal. At most it causes a fever, which increases in severity. I've managed to stall the fever with medicine... so please provide her with an antidote as soon as possible." Erin would state to one of the nurses, before re-entering the room that Ai was placed in.

"Since he won't require intensive care, visitors are allowed. Try not to impair his rest, ok?" She'd say with a small smile to Ketsuki, approaching the doorway.* - Fri Nov  6 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) says: Mhm. - Fri Nov  6 01:50:04 2015
