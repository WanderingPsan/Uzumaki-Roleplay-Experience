"Like that!" She'd state, parting her arms.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) approached the home. As usual, it appeared that either Zenaki wasn't there or she was inside. Judging by the last time she waited, it'd take awhile before the female was to come out. In the mean time, Erin would lean against a nearby object, her arms folded. The turquiose haired female would slowly tap her foot agianst the ground, unfolding her arms.

The girl would purse her lips, proceeding to clasp her palms together briefly. She'd apply a decent surge of chakra, and then she'd proceed to make the chakra emanating from her lower, dissipating gradually. The 'signal' of her chakra would progressively become fainter, until there was no trace of her chakra at all.

Erin would smile lightly, then part her hands. In one rather concentrated usage she would proceed to surge her chakra once more. Her chakra reserves would flood to life once more, becoming much more apparent to sensors. She wondered if Zenaki or that 'Hanae' fellow were attuned to chakra sensory. The turquiose-haired teen hoped one of them did, so that perhaps they'd come out.* - Sun Oct 25 20:01:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) proceeded to throw her hands together. In one loud clap she'd clasp her hands together. The female would proceed to surge the entirety of her chakra. The chakra would immerse the entirety of her body in a thin veil. After covering her frame, Erin would proceed to start suppressing her chakra. Her chakra reserves would become fainter and fainter to sensors.

Finally, her chakra would be gone without a trace to those that could sense reserves. The turquiose haired girl would smile as she completed the action. She'd proceed to fold her arms once more. This time, instead of clasping her hands she would try to surge her chakra on it's own. The Inoue female would try to use the surged chakra to immerse her body.

The chakra immersing her frame would slowly allow the 'signal' of her chakra to sensors to become fainter. Eventually, the 'signal' of her chakra was completely gone. She'd peer at the house out of her peripheral, continuing to wait patiently on whom she referred to as her sensei, whether it was confirmed or not.* - Sun Oct 25 20:28:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) says: Yep! Hey Hanae! - Sun Oct 25 20:45:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) clasped her hands together. Her chakra reserves would grow fainter and fainter, before completely losing their trace. Her turquoise gaze, trained upon her pressed hands would lift up to the trio, as she parted her hands and rested them at her sides.

"I know how to do this perfectly now!" She'd announce, beaming brightly.* - Sun Oct 25 20:49:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: A demonstration is fine. - Sun Oct 25 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) approached the female, proceeding to place her hands on Hanae's shoulders. Erin would then immerse Hanae in her chakra, using said, surged chakra to make Hanae's reserves grow fainter in terms of ability to be sensed. Erin would then allow the suppression of Hanae's chakra to come to a halt, her reserves becoming perceivable by sensory shinobi.

Erin would remove her hands from Hanae's shoulders, grinning.

"There you go. Now try it on your own." She'd smile.* - Sun Oct 25 21:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: I'm going for a quick walk... - Sun Oct 25 21:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) proceeded to smile lightly. The female would attempt to put her chakra control, double that of a genin of her average skill level due to her medical-specialty, to good use. With that being said, Erinw ould proceed to apply a decent amount of chakra to the surface of her hands. She'd proceed to extend her arms out and look down at her palms expectantly.

Unfortunately, she spotted no difference or type of exuberance within the palms of her hands. Dissapointed in her lack of understanding, the turquoise haired female would begin to immerse herself in chakra once more. The reserves emanated within her were invested into a plume of the exuberance within her hands. Said chakra sstill lacked necessary volume to be applied to specified usage.

She'd squint in dissapoint. Erin would groan rather impatiently, pursing her lips. As she furrowed her brows and krinkled her nose in frustration, it appeared that Erin still wasn't willing to give up. She surged her chakra once more, proceeding to immerse her hands in the chakra and allow the fine volume of it to be attuned to "donating" it to others. The turquoise haired female would move forth, pressing the base of her palms to Hanae's shoulder, peering up at Hanae with a smile.

The chakra would flow into Hanae, reinforcing her reserves.

"Here you go..!" She'd state with a bright smile.* - Sun Oct 25 21:42:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) says: Hmmmm.. I wanna learn all you know about healing! - Sun Oct 25 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) says: Oooh... - Sun Oct 25 22:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) says: You're like a medical wiz! - Sun Oct 25 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mmm... - Sun Oct 25 22:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Which one does sound the most fun to you? - Sun Oct 25 22:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) says: Hmmm.. the order's up to you! - Sun Oct 25 22:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) says: I just wanna get better at being a medic! - Sun Oct 25 22:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Hm.. - Sun Oct 25 22:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Let's start of with the basic healing. - Sun Oct 25 22:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) says: Okay! - Sun Oct 25 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) exhaled lightly then smiled optimistically. She'd remove a kunai knife from within her pouch, running it's sharp blade across the back of her milky white palm with a small wince and a biting of her bottom lip. It obviously hurt. Erin would wipe the kunai off with a handkerchief, placing it within her pouch. From that point, the female would form handsigns.

By forming the handsigns, it meant that it'd be easier for her to knead her chakra properly for the basic, D-Rank technique. With that being said, the turquoise haired female would contort the handsigns at a decent rate of hand dexterity, proceeding to surge her chakra. Applying her fine chakra control as a medic, this was only easier than it naturally would be.

Having a natural gift for healing, the girl was confident that she'd be able to heal the wound or at least partially rejuvenate it. The surged chakra would emanate her right hand in a pale, nearly transparent, white-ish blue aura. Erin would hover her hand over her left's back palm, the glow of the aura automatically clotting the blood surfacing within the wound.

In addition, the wound was sanitized. It was clear that she had a phenomenal understanding of the technique, and not only that but it healed at a greater rate than average; especially when her experience as a medical shinobi and her experience with using the jutsu came into play. The wound was completely healed in a few moments, but it was clear that using the technique had used a decent portion of her chakra.

"Did I do it properly?" She'd state, extending her left arm out toward Zenaki and showing the white haired female the back of her palm. There wasn't a single trace of the small cut she produced with the kunai earlier. A confident grin surfaced onto her bubbly, happy-go-lucky facial features.* - Sun Oct 25 22:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mhm. - Sun Oct 25 22:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) says: Alright! Can you teach me that newbie healing thingy..? Wait.. Novice Healing.. I think, hehe. - Sun Oct 25 22:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Master this one first. - Sun Oct 25 22:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) says: C'mooon.. I can master it super quick.. - Sun Oct 25 22:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Do it. - Sun Oct 25 22:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: In front of me. - Sun Oct 25 22:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Master it. - Sun Oct 25 22:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) says: Hng... - Sun Oct 25 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) furrowed her brows and puffed her cheeks. She'd pull out yet another kunai, cutting herself across her left palm. She'd yelp and flinch, cutting her palm more than she intended. Blood would drench the entirety of her palm. She'd moan in dismay, taking the kunai and placing it within her backpouch. Erin would form several handsigns, immersing her right hand in a pale, nearly transparent aura of chakra.

The turquoise haired girl would proceed to press her hand against the surface of her palm, immersing the open wound in the immense chakra. Her body's natural healing ability was amplified by her chakra, thus the wound began to repair rapidly. It'd close within a matter of ten seconds of constant flow of chakra.* - Sun Oct 25 22:53:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) proceeded to throw both of her hands out rapidly, she'd aim to yank her hands around Zenaki's wrists, clenching her teeth and glaring at her. "Return it and stop actin'me, ya'fuckin' bully!" She'd hollar back at the white haired female.* - Sun Oct 25 23:15:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) clenched her teeth, gritting them fiercely.

"Play? I'm tellin' ya' to stop physically assaultin' me cu'z you think I'm gonna be kissin'someone's ass when they gonna look down on me! I'm not gonna sit and letcha beat me up for someone who coulda done it on his own! If he cared about my opinion he woulda done somethin'to change it!" She'd keep her grip, no matter how unfathomable the pain was. Erin was a fierce one when she got fired up. Being doubted was one of the few things that got her to that level.

"-HE- himself woulda attacked me if he had a problem wit'what I'm sayin'! So... back... off!" She'd shout.* - Sun Oct 25 23:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) lurched her head forth the very moment Zenaki pulled her closer. It was an involuntary action, induced by her immense frustration with the situation at hand. Judging by their height difference, she could've headbutted the white haired female in her lower, facial-region.

"Baka!" She roared!* - Sun Oct 25 23:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) yelped, biting her lower lip. Whatever grip on Zenaki she had would falter, as she fell into the white haired female's clutches. If there was one kinky quirk that she had about her, getting bitten on the neck, or biting someone on the neck, was debillitating. Her rage vanished, and a wave of submissive thought process ran through her head.

"She... got ma'weakspot.... nnnh..."* - Sun Oct 25 23:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) dropped to her knees, otherwise clinging onto Zenaki if the female still had a grip on her. Erin was breathing heavily. She'd look up to Zenaki, her face red with embarassment. A nod of acknowledgement followed. "That was unfair.... now I'm thinking weird.." Her case of slang had diminished with her anger, it seemed.* - Sun Oct 25 23:36:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) 's hands would half-clench. Her response was a drawn-out moan. Her eyes would slam shut at the blissful pleasure that immersed her body. Her hands would navigate toward Zenaki's shoulders, whining and whimpering when the area she guided her hands to was absent as the female pulled back.* - Sun Oct 25 23:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Tell me. Did you understand? - Sun Oct 25 23:51:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) whimpered lightly. She'd start to form several  handsigns, surging her chakra. Upon surging her chakra she'd immerse her hands in the pale, slightly transparent, white-ish blue charka. Erin would press each hand to each bite wound on her neck. She'd speed up her body's natural healing rate with the chakra, proceeding to stand up.

"Zenaki-sensei... can I stay with you until I get an apartment.. pleaaaaase?" She'd plead.* - Sun Oct 25 23:58:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) threw her arms over her head, her hands clasping one another as she yawned lightly, stretching. She'd blush shortly after, noticing how improper she was. The turquoise haired female would relocate, seating herself on the bench. She'd look around the courtyard with her pair of curious orbs, before running her hand throughout the kunai pouch wrapped around her pants leg.

She'd remove a small scroll from the pouch, prying said scroll open and squinting down at what was legibly written within it. She read the contents with what seemed to be great interest. Erin's attention was captivated by the contents of the scroll. She knew the answer to Index's inquiry, but appeared too focus to respond.* - Mon Oct 26 01:24:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) closed the scroll. With a pursing of her lips a small, optimistic grin would grace her facial features. Her cyan stare would peer at Toudou from head-to-toe rather quickly. Without a moment wasted she'd nod, and brightly smile at him. "Sure!" She'd state with her rather exuberant tone. With that being said she'd return to what she was concentrated on.

She'd form several handsigns, then emit her hands in a pale, almost transparent, white-ish blue aura. It was less vibrant than how the description of the technique's appearance was in the scroll. Thus, she'd disperse the chakra, forming the handsigns once more.

This time she'd be more fluid with the handsigns, simply using them as means to better manifest her chakra reserves. The turquoise haired female would allow a veil of white-ish blue, translucent chakra to cloak her right hand and lower forearm. With her left hand she'd clasp hold of a kunai from within her pouch, gliding it's blade along her palm. She'd swipe the kunai off on a handkerchief within her lap.

Erin would place the kunai back within her tool pouch, allowing her palm to face upright as she pressed her right hand's palm to her left's. The chakra immersing her hand would begin to amplify the natural recovery rate of the skin cells within the vicinity of the chakra, which was attuned to the purpose it had at the moment. With that being said, she easily began to repair and recuperate the skin that was tampered with and damaged by her kunai. With little to no difficulty she healed the wound without a trace of it remaining.* - Mon Oct 26 01:47:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) peered over at Reguel. She recalled that technique being utilized by her teacher. While her attention was partially directed to Toudou, it was focused on what was going on between Index and Reguel. She'd take a quick glance to Toudou. "I am.. I'm a natural healer infact.. but.. one moment, please."

The female would stand up from the bench, stepping forth a bit so Reguel could actually acknowledge her; that's if he chose to.

"There's no need to do this.. look.. I know he's.. pretty mean but, that's no reason to initiate things." Erin figured that reasoning would help solve this issue at hand.* - Mon Oct 26 01:55:37 2015

She had high hopes that Index wouldn't do or say anything to ruin that. With a bright grin she'd answer his inquiry. "Inoue, Erin! I'm a medical kunoichi. I'm still fresh at the profession though. I should be good once I patch myself up in the chakra department, same with control!" She'd inform him.* - Mon Oct 26 02:00:44 2015
