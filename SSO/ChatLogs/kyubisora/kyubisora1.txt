<br><font color=green>*Exor(Exorbital1) says: (Lol)
<br><font color=yellow>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) sighed heavily as he was tired of his useless routine. "Fighting used to be fun...but having to fight the same people over and over again becomes annoying,"he murmured to himself as he raised his right fist chest-level, before cracking it, releasing all of its tension. As he did this chakra began to build up within himself flowing throughout his body especially the mid-section of his head, specificly his eyes. "Alright lets get started."

With his preperations complete he slid his right hand quickly into his holster before running foreward at a rather intsense speed, hopping to utalize the element of suprise. With his right hand grasping a kunai, he ran contiued to run foreward attempting to slash the kunai across Saito's chest, while keeping his left hand within his pouch.*
<br><font color=green>*Exor(Exorbital1) says: (Hey)
<br><font color=green>*Exor(Exorbital1) says: (Who said they could edit videos)

<br><font color=green>*Exor(Exorbital1) says: (Brb)
<br><font color=yellow>*Kugayashi, Saito(Shulker1000) was not paying much attention to Sotokon within the least. As a matter of a fact  Saito's eyes were closed, he didn't notice when Sotokon began to rush towards him. So he was sliced across his chest by the kunai. After Sotokon did so when he felt the sharp pain hit his chest. His eyes opened widely a sign on shock and anger filled his  blue eyes. He then reached his hand quickly to grab Sotokon's own.

  Weither it was succesful or not he would then swing his sheated katana towards Sotokon's head attempting to injure him or atleast make him dodge to put some distance between them. After this was done Saito would look up towards him and say "....If you really wanted to fight all you had to do was ask...and I'd prefer a fight on the water...but I guess when your enemy strikes first you don't have that luxury of choice...".*
<br><font color=green>*Kugayashi, Saito(Shulker1000) says: {James u can post the html is whispher}

<br><font color=green>*James(Lord Anime) says: (I lack Yen
<br><font color=yellow>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) felt as his kunai twitched within his hand as it cut into Saito's chest. The strike wasn't lethal nor was it close to being extremly deep. None the less the wound was a wound and it would sting. Not long after the strike was successful he felt a hand being placed upon his own. "Hrm."he grumbled as he'd twist his hand easily escaping the grasp held by Saito. As he did this he maneurvered his head to the left avoiding the katana heading for his skull. "Your preety good."he muttered to his new oppenent as he'd jump backwards giving himself some distance between his enemy. As he flew through the air he'd perform a collection of handseals.

Upon landing ontop of a tree branch, his hands stop performing handseals fore he was complete. He held the handseal speaking to Saito."Let's see what you got."*
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (Saito)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (Awake?)
<br><font color=green>*Kugayashi, Saito(Shulker1000) says: {yea}
<br><font color=green>*James(Lord Anime) says: Hm.
<br><font color=green>*James(Lord Anime) says: Feels like something bad is going to happen.
<br><font color=green>*James(Lord Anime) says: Dunno why.
<br><font color=yellow>*Kugayashi, Saito(Shulker1000) watch as Sotokon dodged his attack he said "Well your good too.....". He then began to unsheate his katana. He left the sheathe straped to his belt and jumped forward towards Sotokon. The handle of his katana was dark blue and the sliver blade of it glimmered within the sun. As he headed towards him he said "I really don't want to have to hurt you too much...so I'd advise you not to drag this on too long.". He'd then throw the katana towards Sotokon and begin to preform a few hand seals. After doing so he'd jump up behind the katana and try to reach for it. If it were to hit Sotokon or he was to grab it, Saito would grab one end of it and release his jutsu. If he grabbed onto it he would say "Lightning Style: Earth Flash...".

  After which his blade would be filled with lighting and it would channel down it towards the other end attempting to injure Sotokon.*

<br><font color=yellow>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) 's brown eyes watched intently upon his target. "What are you up to..."He asked himself as he watched Saito moving along the ground grasping the blade before it reached Sotokon. With the distance between the two he persumed Saito was about half of the distance he was away from him then before. Not long after he watched Saito grasp the blade a beam of lighnting bursted from the blade, cutting through the thick air of Kirigakure. "Damnit."he cursed underneeth his breathe, as he was forced to utalize his speed to avoid the blast of lightning comming at himself. 

As he fell from the right side of the tree he straigtened his body upright while spitting outward. "Wind Style: Air Bullets!" his mind exclaimed as he contiued to spit bullets of air outward directed upon Saito. Five wind bullets bursted through the air, piercing the thick misty air of Kirigakure as if it was nothing. All of them were aimed for Saito's chest consecutivly.*

The two blades collided in a loud clash and the mere impact of the man's attack caused James to slide back a few yards and stopped just short of the wall.

"Wind Style: Air Bullets, "he murmured within his mind as he released a collection of winds bullets foreward from his mouth directed upon the Concealed figures chest. With the high speed movement of the bullets and the close range. The odds were slim that the man infront of himself would be able to avoid the technique.

By utalizing his unnatural speed, he would appear rather far away from the fight, giving himself some time to think on what his next set of actions would be. Through his thought proccess he began another set of handseals.*

The figure shunshins backwards and stands there. He makes several handseals quite quickly. "This is the end." He says as he puts them together. "Katon: Gokakyuu...Fuuton: Kamikaze!" He exclaims as he breathes in deeply. The male releases a giant fireball about 30feet across towards the genin. He then pulls his hands backwards before smashing them together in front of him. He would create a great gust of wind that would turn into a tornado and hit the fireball.

Carefully watching everyone's movements, she took a step to the side a bit as the Concealed Figure was making his move, he wasn't aiming his attack at her, and she didn't need to react so quickly. Stringing together a few hand seals, she said in her mind, "Ninja Art: Fog Clone Jutsu." 

Materializing from the mist in the atomsphere, multiple fog clones were created in the area, four of them surrounding the Concealed Figure, and three surrounding Luna. Since these clones were made out of fog, it takes little chakra to create mutliple ones. These clones do not have the ability to attack, however if attacked, the attack would pass right through them, leaving the opponent confused while looking for the real one. She did this in order to help distract her while other attack, and create a clever diversion.*

<br><font color=green>***Concealed Figure*(Uberseether) says: ( o-o tf? that jutsu is a hoe )
<br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) would simply frown, her eyes obviously perceiving a conjuncted jutsu. "No way they can dodge this one....guess I have to help them..." she said softly, bringing up her hands and weaving handseals at an almost untracable rate, finnaly ending so that the chakra melded within her body could take the form of her elemental affinity. 

With this, the mizukage hunched her head forward so that a powerful jet of water slammed against the grassy earth below, the water only expanding with a violent explosion so that it turned into a massive rushing shockwave, speeding right into the wind enhanced katon technique. The two substances would ram together, the water naturally overtaking the fire seeing as how it acted as an extinguisher. The wind only added to the waters power aswell, allowing for a thick plume of steam to drift about as the resulting war over the elements. 

"Hmph..." she grunted to herself, suddenly hopping from her position and standing before the genin, looking over at them for a brusque second before shaking her head, signaling she was displeased with what they have done. ".....Shame...." she said, giving a gesture of her hand, giving them an order to go and escape to a much safer position, the blanket of steam proving more than enough cover for them. "....One last technique and this clown should be useless..." she said, bringing up her right arm and placing it high into the air, holding a single handseal, her other arm now coming to chest level, holding a handseal aswell. "Hidden Mist Jutsu.." she muttered, the puddles scattered across the floor suddenly rising into the air, the water in the air also mixing with her chakra, an extremely thick haze of mist now covering the area, one unable to be viewed through clearly by the untrained.(Meaning, if ur not used to having good senses with this technique ur screwed). With this the mizukage would make her move, now aiming to get behind the concealed figure with her extremely large samehada, utilizing the silent killing technique to approach from behind so that the sharkskin blade could draw extremes amount of chakra from him/her/it and use it for her own purpous*

With his hands already combined before hand it didn't take much time before a burst of wind similar to that of the one performed by the man before was created infront of himself. Utalizing a even more chakra he swapped hands once more adding to the strike with a collection of wind bullets. With each being 1 handseal it be as if Sotokon had performed 2 handseals.

The air around him would shimmer for a moment. Then all of a -huge- shadow would appear in the mist. Its Yellow eyes would dart around looking through the Mist with ease. 

"Grragh!" The large blue cat would snarl. "GRAGH!" The Nibi roars as it releaeses a huge burst of fire from its body. The fire would arc through the area whipping at just about everyone in attendence. *

<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) nodded as she headed the Mizukage's words, watching the uprising water from her jutsu surround the area, protecting them from the beats' fire attack. She attempted to run out of the area, completely avoiding the battle that was sure to come.*
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: .......*trollface*
<br><font color=yellow>*James(Lord Anime) watched as he saw the massive ball of flame fly towards him and he realized he was trapped. He wouldn't be able to outrun the flames in time and didn't think his Wind Jutsu would be of any use. Just as he was about to try it anyway, he saw a jet of water suddenly appear and dose out the flames. To his surprise, the Mizukage had arrived to save the day. When he heard her words of disappointment, he felt disappointed a bit. Just then a mist quickly began to cloud the area; a mist so thick he couldn't see anything at all. He was absolutely useless at the moment.

Just then he heard a massive roar and through the fog saw the shadow of a large creature through the distance. James froze, but only for just a moment. Although he couldn't see a thing, James could tell something bad was headed their way. James would quickly attempt to preform a few hand seals and aimed his hands below him. 

"Wind Releae: Great Breakthrough!"he'd yell. Suddenly a massive gust of wind shot from his hand with enough force for James to use it as a catapault to launch him over 40 feet in the air. He aimed his hands at an angle where he would not only be shot high in the sky, but backwards as well. As he felt his Chakra began to deplete, he canceled the Jutsu and fell onto the roof behind him.*

<br><font color=yellow>*Kugayashi, Saito(Shulker1000) watched as a huge shadow appeared. He was filled with a bit of fear from the sight of such a massive creature. Then suddenly he felt a rush of water surround the area. He then jumped up and back trying to land on the building that he remembered was behind him. He bare landed on it and almost falled off the edge. He climbed back up and said "Guys...I think we should listen to the Mizukage atleast for now...and come up with a plan....".*

<br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) would simply stare as the Nibi charged forth, her eyes widening for a second as her right hand shot forth to the hilt of her samehada. Since the being was nothing more than a mass of chakra, this could work to her advantage. "Time to feed samehada.." she said with a whisper, thrusting out her blade and having the tip of the blade meet right on the centermost point of the Nibis claw. "Hm...!" she grunted loudly, the beasts chakra now being drained at an intense rate, only quickening with each second it spent touching the blade. Due to the insane amount of chakra the samehada was absorbing, it would only grow. The samehada couldn't contain itself much longer, its bandages suddenly ripping under the stress of the growing blade, the sharkskin now fully exposed, its razor sharp teeth clamping together as it savored the chakra of the tailed beast. 

The samehada however would cringe afterward, its dislike for fire getting the best of it for a brusque second. The chakra absorbed would mix with her own chakra pools, giving her the extra push within battle she needed. ".......Come on you foul beast..." she said softly. Taking a mighty leap backward and throwing up one seal, letting forward yet another burst of water chakra to come crashing into the Nibi. The same massive wave from before aiming to slam into the tailed beast*

<br><font color=yellow>*Nibi(Uberseether) roars as its chakra is sapped. "Graagh!" It exclaims as it is hit by the attack. The Nibi is knocked backwards and hits the ground with a crash. It looks forwards, its vision blurred slightly. It hears someone speaking. "Graaagh!" It roars as it leaps towards the sound. It attempts to land on the source of the sound and rip it to shreds. ( AKA Sotokon )*
<br><font color=yellow>*Valtim, Duskrix(Shayne9989) Appears in a cloud of smoke, The area completly shrouded in a thick mist he'd turn his head, Glancing both left and right, "Tsk?!" he'd mutter as the Mizukage  voice is heard, With this, He'd Shift his body's position, Preparing to move if neccesary

<br><font color=yellow>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) 's eyes grew rather large as the large magestic cat pounced in his direction. His normal calm attitude was removed and replaced for a second with extreme fear. "Wha...what am I suppose to do...."he'd be thinking to himself as his thoughts rapidly flew through his mind. The meneacing glare of the beast froze him. Fore it was obvious, it's intent was to kill him. Thinking back now to his father's words his senses were restored. "Move!" he'd exclaim loudly as he attempted to push his comrade out of the way of the giant animal decending in their direction. They didn't have much time before the large animal would be upon them. Its shadow was already covering their bodies. Hopefully his teamate would follow him, as he attempted to grasp the boy's hand and drag him along with him. As he made a dash for his life.*
