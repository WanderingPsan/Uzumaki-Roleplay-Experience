He slowly reached for his underwear to pull it down, slowly.. his member slowly flopping and smacking against his stomach. Khalil's eyes widened to see Geralt's member exposed. "W-What... h-how... you are big...." he said slowly reaching for his member, to wrap his fingers around the shaft and his other fingers on his balls, massaging em. * - Fri Oct  9 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) blushed slightly feeling a hand going up to the back of him, his butt... Geralt's finger tracing around the hole. Which made Khalil a bit nervous... he slowly let go of Geralt's member, reaching for his own underwear as he took it off, revealing his member and butt. Khalil turned around as he was now on his stomach, popping his ass out, his fresh.. shaved, smooth tight hole exposed for Geralt's need. "T-There..."* - Fri Oct  9 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) slowly spreaded his legs apart, his hole fully exposed once again, before feeling his fingers prodding against his hole for a bit. "A-Ahn...." his back arched, reaching for the covers to grab with his face on the pillow. A tip being pressed against his hole. He slowly nodded, they didn't even get it lube or anything. "I-I'm ready.."* - Fri Oct  9 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) was too nervous to look, but he coulf feel the smoth head of Geralt's member right at the entrance and felt as Geralt rubbed the headthe head around the hole, lubing up the area a little bit. Then he felt the pressure of Geralt pushing. It was firm, but gentle enough it wasn't really hurting till he went all the way in. "AHHNN!" he grunted, moaning as his face went deeper into the pillow, his nails scratching the bedsheets, while his ass backed up to the air. * - Fri Oct  9 04:28:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) was picked up again, he sighed not knowing what else to say to the brute so instead just stayed in his grasp. "Hunt? Why go hunt? What are we going to hunt? There's nothing here to hunt!!" Khalil exclaimed while his stomach was slowly growling. "I am so hungry though..."

Also, he was wearing womanly clothes, a blouse, short pants and plain sandals. * - Sat Oct 10 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: ? - Sat Oct 10 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | Never again would he want Maloth to bring him to the restaurant, his steps were hella hard and made too much noises. "WOAH! Watch it, Maloth!" he sighed, now finally arriving to the restaurant and -FINALLY- being put down on the bench. Sitting down, raising a leg on-top of the other he quickly grabbed the menu, scanning through the selections. "I have no money, so can you buy it for me, Maloth? Oh and I like steak!"* - Sat Oct 10 02:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) ordered his steak, as it shortly arrived. "Thankss!" he smiled at the waitress, looking towards Maloth's side.. he noticed the dozen of dishes. "Oh.. wow..." his eyes widened, giggling to himself. Of-course a Brute like himself would want to eat so much, right? Right! Though, Khalil was more... wiser, he grabbed a fork and knife as he began to eat the steak slowly while Maloth did the same-- but more aggresively.

Gulping a piece of his steak, turning his head towards Maloth, raising an eyebrow he spoke. "You sure.... eat a lot.... OH! is that rice?! Can I get some?!"Khahil eyed the rice that was ordered by  Maloth, wondering if his new friend-- or if they were friends, would be nice enough to offer some to Khalil.* - Sat Oct 10 02:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | Finally, the rice being handed over to him, he quickly started to eat, turning his head towards Maloth. "Mmmmhm." and without the utensils, the feminine shinobi started to eat his food as if copying Maloth. But he couldn't do it, since he burned himself with the hot rice. "OUCH!!" He yelled quickly blowing his fingers, before reaching for the spoon and eating the same way as he was eating earlier. 

-- He didn't even see the saliva going into the bowl of rice, so he just ate it like that! 

"Mmm! So good!"* - Sat Oct 10 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) felt the slap on the back, laughing to himself with Maloth he smiled. "Mmm! It's really good, yeah. But.. I just like dressing as a girl.. not really one though." he shrugged continuing to eat his food, slowly while moving his head to the side and side. As if the food was really good, because it was good. "Mmm! Food is very very good! Yes!"* - Sat Oct 10 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Then... I don't know, call me a girl then, I guess... - Sat Oct 10 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) whispers: I like dressing as them. - Sat Oct 10 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: So, we train? - Sat Oct 10 03:06:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: How would we do this? - Sat Oct 10 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) looked around to see the scroll being tossed on the floor, then suddenly mud and water coming out and around the terrain. 

"What? Seriously...? This is how we'll have to fight now...?" he's eyes widened to see the water and mud but that didn't stop him from wanting to show off his skills! Quickly, he ran towards Maloth, trying not to fall or anything on the mud. As he got closer, he jumped in the air, sending a straight kick towards the Brute's chest, attempting to make him fall backwards.. if that was possible and all!* - Sat Oct 10 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | He was bounced back from Maloth's chest, falling on-to the mud, now being all soaked up with the mud he slowly tried to get up but tripped over it once again. "Gah. I CAN'T DO THIS!" he yelled pouting a bit with a frown before getting up once again. Listening to the roar of the brute made him get even more afraid of this type of training.. what if this brute tried to kill the feminine shinobi? It was possible but he wouldn't want that to go there.

"Grrrrrrh!" 

Khalil yelled, quickly running towards Maloth as he crouched down to sweep his left leg, trying to make the brute fall down but instead made his leg bounce back, thus causing a bit of pain. "NHHH!!" Khalil stood up, staring at Maloth for a second as he ran once again, sending a straight kick towards him, but more underneath... where the men's weakness spot was there more. 

His manhood.* - Sat Oct 10 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | Yup, he couldn't have done anything to the brute, but instead got beat up, slamming his body against the ground. Now, the feminine shinobi was all muddy. He stared at Maloth, frowning a bit before feeling his boot on the chest. "AGH! Okay you win!"* - Sat Oct 10 04:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | Finally standing up from the ground, since his clothings were very muddy, it did tight in his womanly curves though, so it was exposed for Maloth to see. Backing away a bit, he shook his head, rubbing the back of his neck. "I..can we please take a break for a little bit..?"* - Sat Oct 10 04:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Yeah! We can lay on the ground. - Sat Oct 10 04:49:42 2015

As Maloth was showering, it went quicker for Khalil to clean up his muddy pants. "Uhhh.. all done, cleaning up your pants." he left the wet pants on his bed, just so it would try a little bit. Khalil walked to the bathroom with a towel on his hand, looking away so he wouldn't see anything but he did see the water seeping underground the bathtub. Khahil should've known that this was about to happen.

"It's fine.. I'll clean that up later..."

He sighed leaving the towel in the bathroom before walking towards his bed, sitting down, while raising a leg on-top of the other since he was wearing a skirt after all. * - Sat Oct 10 06:47:28 2015

"Uhhh..." walking back outside, he noticed Maloth. "So.... yeah, you should get dressed!"* - Sat Oct 10 07:02:49 2015
