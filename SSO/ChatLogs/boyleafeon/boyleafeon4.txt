<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | "Yeah! We go do mission!"

 It was exciting to have a mission with Maloth, especially when they were going to build up a house! But, all he was going to help with was giving the brute the items to build up the house. He didn't posses that type of strength either to carry those heavy items but instead just helped out. Why not? Besides, it was helping a few people to get houses, those who didn't have one so it was a good thing to do! First time that Khalil would've done something like that.

   Khalil heard some flirty whistles given to him, and a few guys yelling out 'Hey girl.' and that just made the male giggle a bit but he didn't really say anythin to them and just helped out Maloth with building the houses. "Mmmm! Sooo. I can totally help with decorations from the inside."* - Wed Oct 14 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | No, he wasnt' making fun or anything of Maloth's talk. 

He actually liked doing the same thing when he's around Maloth. There was some sort of connection that he loved of having to do with him and damn it, one day.... Maloth is going to see that! But for now, Khalil was going to help him with the house. Suddenly a guy walked towards Khalil, trying to flirt or whatever but Khalil just ignored him to walk back towards the brute, to give him some help if needed. 

 As he entered the house, looking around the place. "Yeah, this house is really cool..." Khalil was impressed at how good the house was coming along, he grabbed a few furnitures to fix around, making it all cute and sutff for the families who would live there. "Hehe. I like this, Maloth. Us working together!" Khalil turned around  owalk towards Maloth before patting his muscular chest, whispering at him. "M-Maybe later we can do what we did?" he giggled softly before going back to work. Of-course, Maloth would know what he was talking about.* - Wed Oct 14 19:09:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | The two have finally arrived at the meeting, it was just starting too. There were to chairs there for himself and for Maloth to use. The trap sat down on the chair, raising a leg on-top of the other before folding his arms over his chest to nod while quietly hearing the meeting. Leaning forward, he whispered to the brute. "Alright, just.. try to stay quiet and not make any noises, please?"* - Fri Oct 16 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) reached for Maloth's hand to grab, if he allowed it, while staring at the meeting as it occurred. They might have been staring at Maloth with the whole 'brute' looking thing but Khalil knew very well that they might've been staring at him. The meeting did say that a male shinobi was suppose to arrive at the meeting but that was it.  They suspected a male, they got the male shinobi at the meeting.. it just that he had feminine features. "Mmm... you'll be fine, don't worry. All you have to do is stay quiet and I'll do the rest."

 The trap spoke before grabbing his notes, starting to write out important notes that was said during the meeting, while grabbing Maloth's hand-- if he allowed it of-course.* - Fri Oct 16 03:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) rose an eyebrow, turning his head towards Maloth. "Hm? Oh. I'm just writing notes is all." the feminine male nodded, as her fingers interwined with Maloth's fingers, holding his hand tightly before going back to writing down her notes. "Mmm. This would be good." Khalil looked up to see the meeting once again, nodding his head with everything of what they were saying. Understanding what they were saying but felt quite bad that the brute had to stay here and not do anything and just listen. 

 It might have been boring to him but it was a mission that the two had to get done! "Mmm." Khalil heard an important notice before looking down at his notes, writing out what was said. "If you are bored, you can leave, Maloth." said the femanine male while writing her notes down.* - Fri Oct 16 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) felt the grip tightening around her hand, turning her head to look at Maloth while raising an eyebrow. She knew good and well that the brute was getting bored. "Don't worry. I am almost done.~" the trap smiled at Maloth before continuing to write down on the notes. * - Fri Oct 16 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | "All done!" 


 The trap yelled, as the others just sat there staring at him. "Sorry." Khalil blushed slightly with a nervously laugh, standing up as he was still holding onto Maloth's hand before dragging him away from the meeting. "Don't worry. I am all done and I was just writing important notes about the meeting is all. Nothing big or anything.~ I know you was bored, Maloth. I know you pretty well." he giggled to himself as they walked back to the kage to return the notes.* - Fri Oct 16 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: What do now? - Fri Oct 16 04:36:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: I see chief! - Fri Oct 16 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) yawned cutely, stretching a bit as he made his way back to the center of the village. Noticing Maloth and his teacher going at it again. "Woah, they are always fighting but I like taking notes from them!" the feminine shinobi said, reaching for his notes and a pen, quickly taking notes of what was happening. The ground started to shake and break a bit, they had such monstrous strength, something that Khalil wanted to posses but he knew good and well that training would be the one to help him out. 

 <Woah. I can't believe they are actually breaking a bit of the ground. Probably is Maloth.... god, Maloth is so strong.>

The trap was amazed-- LUCKY! to have a teacher like Maloth himself. Khalil started to slowly learn and move into the taijutsu profession, that's what he wanted anyways. Thus, the feminine male continued to write on his notes, as the fight was going. * - Fri Oct 16 18:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) finished taking notes, walking away to do some practice of his own. * - Fri Oct 16 20:13:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) nodded, reading over the notes, cuffing a string of her hair behind her ear. "Mmm."* - Fri Oct 16 20:34:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Oh, some notes that I wrote while you guys were fighting. - Fri Oct 16 20:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: I love that thing you said, 'clothesline' whatever it means. - Fri Oct 16 20:35:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) was too busy reading over his notes. "Sorry, Maloth. You can teach me another time." she said biting her bottom lips softly to read carefully over the notes before switching the pages, nodding. "Alright.."* - Fri Oct 16 20:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Ooh, it's nothing, Maloth. Don't worry about it. But uhhh, you can go if you want. I don't want you to stay here all bored, knowing how you are. - Fri Oct 16 21:00:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Hm? You do? - Fri Oct 16 21:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: I thought, I annoy you, so I tend to like give you some space. - Fri Oct 16 21:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: If be 'noy. Maloth woul' jus' bea' to mud. - Fri Oct 16 21:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) nodded before sitting down on the ground himself, a bit away from Maloth while his eyes rested on the notes. "Haha, sure you would. --- eventhough..." the trap turned her head to look at Maloth with an eyebrow rose. "You did, beat me up to the mud."* - Fri Oct 16 21:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) whispers: Well!~ You did something that I couldn't stand up straight or walk for a few days. - Fri Oct 16 21:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) giggled to herself before closing her book to look at Maloth. "All done. I just need to practice a bit more and I will be all set." Khalil nodded, standing up from the ground to give a pat on Maloth's back just how he did with him. "I'm going to go home and I'll see you in a bit, alright?"* - Fri Oct 16 21:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Uhh, no. It's fine. You don't have to come with me, besidies I'm just going to go change my clothes and I will come back and we can practice. - Fri Oct 16 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Mkay? - Fri Oct 16 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) was wearing a skirt that's why.* - Fri Oct 16 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | As the two entered the home, Khalil tied her hair up into a ponytail before removing her skirt and yes, he removed it right in-front of Maloth. So, it didn't matter... the brute saw Khalil naked anyways. The trap had girl panties, and by his butt cheeks some marks could be seen, finger marks but they were slowly disappearing away. "Alright. So, I'll just get my pants and then we can go umm get ready for training!"

 Khalil nodded to himself, turning around to go to his closet. * - Fri Oct 16 22:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | "Hey Malo--" felt the giant hand on his bum, it might have been a tight squeeze but that shit hurt like hell. The trap yelped, jumping up and onto the bed with his eyes widened. "That was.... random..... but I kinda liked it.. though it hurt!" Khalil smiled with a smirk before standing up from the bed to put on his pants for training. It was a bit difficult to put it on because of his bum being fat but that didn't matter, he managed to squeeze it in there. "Phew, so, ready to go?"* - Fri Oct 16 22:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: I mean... how else do you want to train? - Fri Oct 16 22:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Not know! - Fri Oct 16 22:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Ugh. See? I bore you or something. I don't know how to train but let's figure it out, yeah? - Fri Oct 16 22:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: You no' bore. - Fri Oct 16 22:27:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Do you want to train or stay here? - Fri Oct 16 22:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Let's go! - Fri Oct 16 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Real fight! - Fri Oct 16 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: You can hurt me if you want. - Fri Oct 16 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Mm. . - Fri Oct 16 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Not wan' hurt too much.. - Fri Oct 16 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: You have too! If I want to be strong like you! - Fri Oct 16 22:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Fine. . - Fri Oct 16 22:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) nodded at Maloth before taking a few steps, getting into his fighting position while motioning for the brute to start first, since the feminine male always did. "You first!"* - Fri Oct 16 22:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | His eyes concentrated on the brute, taking a few steps back before shaking her head, and covering her face as if not wanting to be hit but he was already rushing towards the yamanshi. "OOO--!" The trap was quickly sent flying backwards, far away from the Brute and rolling along the round, his breath being caught up as if he couldn't breath good. Khalil gasped, staring at the ground while coughing and trying to breath but he couldn't breath normally. 

It was as if... Maloth punched the air out of him!* - Fri Oct 16 23:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | Yup, something was going on with his lungs because he couldn't breathe right, the kick was too powerful! Khalil slowly stood up, a hand over his tomach as he noticed the brute comin closer to him. The trap shook his head, taking a few steps back. "Wait wait." he took a deep breath, but as he did.. his ribs started to hurt. 

"Gah. No no. Stay away from me. I'm fine but just stay away."* - Fri Oct 16 23:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) looked at Maloth to see him frowning, the trap slowly made his way towards the brute to wrap his arms around the brute's waist, pulling him closer to him. "Don't worry. I'm fine... you just... managed to uhhh... you kicked me really hard... " he coughed but as he did, his lungs started to hurt. "Gah... okay.. let's keep your strength down a notch. Just a little down. Kay?"* - Fri Oct 16 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) nodded before clenching both of his fist. This was the only time for Khalil to prove to Maloth all those techniques he was using back then when fighting with his teacher. "Mmmm! ALRIGHT!"

 The trap quickly ran towards Maloth and attemped to send a straight punch towards the brute's chest. If sucessful, the brute might've been sent back just an inch. But that was all of his strength that the trap was using against the brute! * - Sat Oct 17 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) wasn't done as of yet, she quickly crouched down to send a straight punch once again to the brute.. but this time it was going straight towards his manhood, his penis. If sucessful, Khalil would climb up his body and make a front-flip to appear behind the brute, turning around...! She leaned forward and her teeth went to his waist, biting it! * - Sat Oct 17 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) sighed knowing that he didn't really do anything to the brute, taking a few steps back Khalil shrugged before reaching for the brute's hand to grab, his fingers interwining with the brute's. "Kay! Let's do somethin else."* - Sat Oct 17 01:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Mmmmm. We can go get some missions? - Sat Oct 17 01:21:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) smiled at Maloth, blushing a bit before sitting on his lap. 

Then suddenly blackscreen. * - Sun Oct 18 06:24:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Sigh. - Sun Oct 18 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) turned around to look at Maloth, as he fell by his side, the trap quickly ran towards Maloth jumping on his lap and wrapping his arms around the brute's neck to hug him tightly. Comforting his sensei. "I'm so sorry, I missed you a lot! I thought you left me."* - Mon Oct 19 05:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) leaned forward -if allowed she would try to give him a kiss on the lips! If not then oh well. "I missed you is all. Wait are you alright? Are you hungry? Want to go home so you can shower?" she said obviously worried about Maloth, while still was on his lap with her arms around him.* - Mon Oct 19 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Yeah, I will cook. - Mon Oct 19 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: I will even wear a maid outfit!  - Mon Oct 19 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Come on! - Mon Oct 19 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) turned on the water for Maloth to shower in. "I turned on the water for you and put a towel and some clean clothes on top of the bed. Don't worry! I washed your clothes when you were away, so you have clean pants and stuff. Haha." smiled at Maloth before turning around as she walked towards her room to switch out her outfit into a maid one, just because she wanted to make Maloth feel good!
     A few minutes later, she was finally done with changing her outfit before going to the kitchen to begin the cooking! The maid outfit was rather, very very.. cute... and she wasn't wearing no underwear! Very short too!~ "Gotta cook for Maloth! Gotta cook for Maaaloooth."* - Mon Oct 19 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | A few minutes later, dinner was finally ready and there was a huge buffet on a table, just for Maloth. Everything that he liked, bunch of plates with food and all. Yeah, Khalil was acting weird but it was just because of his ... love that he had for Maloth. Yeah, she was in love with him and is afraid to really tell the brute. Since Khalil was just a male afterall. "Dinner is all ready!" said the feminine shinobi before blushing slightly as she sat down on the chair, waiting for Maloth to finish with his shower. 

 <I hope he likes it..>* - Mon Oct 19 06:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) blushed slightly to see the brute having a towel wrapped around his waist, but she quickly went back to smile at Maloth tryin to get the dirty thoughts out of the way. "Acting different? I am not... I just.. missed you and I wanted to do this for you. How do you like my new look? Well, haircolor haha... .." her cheeks started to turn pink looking away from Maloth as the brute was eating. "Well, eat up!"* - Mon Oct 19 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | "Thanks! I am glad that you like it."

 Khalil bit her bottom lips as she slowly walked towards Maloth, leaning forward to kiss him on the chest as her tongue ran all the way down her chest to his waist. "Just keep eating, Maloth.~"  the trap said, removing his towel as his massive member was exposed. It was flaccid but that didn't stop her from grabbing it with both of her hands and slowly stroking it. Just wanting to make Maloth feel good after all those days he was away. If Maloth wanted Khalil to stop, he will! But for now, she was stroking his member slowly with both of her hands.* - Mon Oct 19 07:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | Yes, this is what she wanted to do to Maloth, just him eating and enjoying his time while she did her work down there. Feeling his crotch slowly getting harder, warmer and heavier, she leaned her head forward to pull the skin back a little, her tongue extending to lick around the cock's soft crown.  She grasped his member kissing the tip of his cock, slowly her fingers wrapped around the hard member to give it a couple of strokes while opening her mouth slowly to enter his hard swelling member, as she tried to enter it all but already at eight inches it was , hitting her uvela thus making her gag a lot some of her saliva falling to the ground. 

Taking his cock out of her mouth, she gasped for air, placing a hand on his balls to massage it while the other hand was stroking the shaft while she was playing with the tip, using her tongue, flickering it, licking around it, spitting on it and sucking the tip as if trying to get something to come out.* - Mon Oct 19 07:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | As the brute fet her his cock, it was an amazing huge monstrous size and it felt good having it in her mouth. She thought of it as a pacifier and it calmed by butterflies. Feeling his hips moving to push more of his cock into the trap's mouth, it got about 10inches inside of her mouth, she could feel the cockhead in her esophagus. It made her gag a lot, as if wanting to vomit quickly taking out his cock out from her mouth to cough, taking a deep breath to see the brute with a smirk. "Hah.. you sure went crazy there...." she coughed more before leaning forward once again.

 As so, with her tongue she started to lick the underside of his cock. Both of his hands on the huge member, moving it out of the way as she leaned forward to his gigantic balls, sucking and kissing the left nut, sucking that left nut inside of her mouth before doing the same thing with his right nut, kissing it and sucking it at the same time while her fingers quickly moved up and down his shaft. His cock was just laying ontop of the trap's face, all the way down to his nuts from the tip, she licked it all the way up. "Gonna come for me?"* - Mon Oct 19 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | "Please, lemme taste it...!"

 She said continuing to jerk him off faster while licking his tip, feeling his cock twitching a few times. The releasing of his thick cum shot all up on her face, clothing and even the ground. Khalil blushed slightly licking off the cum from her face, then the ground, and then his cock swallowing all the cum and cleaning the dirty cock with his tongue. The trap stood up from the ground before sitting on the brute's lap. 

"You know... I'm kind of tired now but... when I wake up. I want you.. inside of me." she nodded, leaning forward to kiss the brute on the neck while holding him tightly. "Never leave me again..."* - Mon Oct 19 07:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Maloth! Hey hey. - Mon Oct 19 20:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: I do good! Mmm! Hey hey.  - Mon Oct 19 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: C-Can I carry that hammer? - Mon Oct 19 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | "Yeah yeah!"

 She blinked looking at the hammer before reaching for the hilt, not all of it because of the spikes but she tried her best to lift the hammer up. "I.. I can't do it! Gosh! You can lift up good." Khalil shook her head, trying it once again. But got scratched a bit on his finger by the spikes. "GAH Ouuuuch. :c "* - Mon Oct 19 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Pft... I am fine.. - Mon Oct 19 22:11:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Fine.. - Mon Oct 19 22:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) bit her bottom lips, taking a few steps closer to the mountain, turning her head to look at Maloth she sighed looking back at the mountain. "Alright... I guess...." Khalil clenched both of her fists before sending those fists onto the mountain. It didn't make nothing but a very very small crack. "---...I'm sorry.."* - Mon Oct 19 22:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Uhh... teach what move? - Mon Oct 19 22:25:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Noo. Maloth teach what is get show. - Mon Oct 19 22:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Oh.. - Mon Oct 19 22:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: So all I have to do is just kic my leg upward? - Mon Oct 19 22:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Sure!~ - Mon Oct 19 22:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | "Alright... I can do this then. It's not such a bad skill anyway."

Khalil sighed taking a few steps towards the brute to now stand right next to him. She started to get a bit nervous because of the brute showing her this type of technique. It was similar but easy to do, other than her usual trick that she usually does. The leaf whirlwind technique. But today the feminine shinobi is going to learn how to do something new... something more offensive. "

The trap send a few kicks in-front of him, just to warm up a little bit. A few more kicks into the air, she turned to look at Maloth with an eyebrow rose. There was no way in hell that she could actually do that.. superior strength kick that the brute had. But that didn't really stop the feminine trap to do something like that. She wanted to get strong, not for herself but for the people that she cared about. 

Khalil grabbed a boulder just how the brute did, placing it in-front of her. "Alright. Sooooo, I just kick this boulder and it would be sent flying right? Mhm!" the male trap kicked the boulder a few times beore attempting to do what the brute did. The few kicks continued against the boulder but it was just damaging his foot. It was hurting her a bit but that was not going to stop her one bit! "Grrrh!"

She sighed, quickly raising her right leg up, attempting to kick the boulder but was sent flying away like about five feet into the air. Khalil bit her bottom lips, looking at her foot while jumping on one leg. "OW OW OW OW OW! It hurt!"* - Mon Oct 19 23:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: I-I'm fine.. - Tue Oct 20 00:17:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | "Oh.. this is what we have to do? PFFFT! Easy!" 

The trap shrugged looking around the rubble to try to find the pearls that were missing due to this Kenshin guy attacking the town and what not. "Pearls peaaaarls. Wow. These pearls have to really cost a lot!" she giggled continuing her search for the pearls, hoping that she could help out the lady who had lost them. "Don't worry! We will find it!"* - Tue Oct 20 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) stretched a bit, fixing up her dress before turning her head to look at Maloth and feeling his hand tapping against her lower back, blushing slightly she slapped Maloth's chest but knew that it wouldn't really hurt or anything. "Hey sexy and day be okay! It is so ... quiet around here, oh wow."* - Wed Oct 21 19:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) felt the brute's hand resting on her ample bum, she bit her bottom lips while running her fingers up and down his abs slowly befor speaking; 

"I don't know, to be honest. Maybe we should find some new leader... chief... because this one isn't really doing anything."* - Wed Oct 21 19:46:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | ".....I already told you..."

The girly-boy rolled his eyes before noticing the tongue shooting out at Khalil in a violent manner. The attack was too quick for her to avoid it, but feelin the tongue wrapped around her legs and getting pulled up into the air. She felt her legs slowly burning up. "AAAH!!" Khalil yelled attempting to fight it off, and the poor girlly-boy didn't have any weapons to fight back with! "-LL-LET ME GO!"* - Sun Oct 25 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) Continued to squirm and fidget, all in futility as she desperately hoped to break free from Shojis strange tongue. Feminine, high-pitched grunts were in abundance, but none mattered in the end. The ghouls grip was absolute, and refused to budge, no matter how loudly or heavy the pleading or grunts were. 
Khalil remained in a state of panic, as she could foresee the end drawing near.
There was  a brief- moment of hope, namely as Kyushiki rushed to the rescue. But alas, the second the water is spiraling ahead, the Ghouls strange tongue was transformed once more. It gained the sharpness and likeness of a common spear. Without question, it bee-lined forward, pushing through her flesh easily, and penetrating through the other end.

.!

Khalil grunted and screamed  as thats all she could do. Her breathing grew haggard and fatigued as she could feel the life or vigor in her body slowly slipping away. Vision was speedily becoming hazy, and galloons of blood tricked, or rather, GUSHED out from her frame, painting the floor in red. 

No. . . No. . . I cant die here. . . M-Maloth. . . save me, the dainty figure thought with sorrow. Her ears swelled up, reaching its maximum capacity before tears eventually proceeded to spill out.

By this point, it was a foregone conclusion. The blow had been fatal, and thus Khalil had been marked for death. The feminine figure remained lodged within the Shojis tongue, desperately clinging to life.

 
Sadly, the Grim Reaper was indiscriminate. The hazy vision soon faded into nothingness. Softly, Khalils eyes would shut, and shed briefly reminisce over her life  as was common for those that died prematurely. Briefly, her mind shifts on over to her loving clan  the Yamanshi clan. One by one. . . They all fell, and the rapid decline her siblings honestly was beginning to push Khalil over the edge.

Then it happened. Her knight in shining armor had arrived. The lovable brute, and defacto chief of Kumogakure. Leaving him was perhaps something that hurt her the most. I. . . Im sorry I wasnt strong enough to stay in your life master. . . Please, dont meet me too soon.

And those were the last words the femboy would have ever spoken. His soul fades right from his body, tranversing into limbo where it could perhaps stay in watch, or perhaps ascend to the Pure Lands. * - Sun Oct 25 01:04:00 2015
