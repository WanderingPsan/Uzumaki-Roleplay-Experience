<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) fixed his skirt a bit before turning his head to look at Maloth. This might have been just a mission but it was more than that to him. He wanted to actually learn how to fight via taijutsu, so why not have a spar with the best Taijutsu fighter in the village while doing the mission at the same time? Khalil ran his fingers through his hair, before taking a few steps back and getting into his position. Just because he was wearing a skirt that didn't really mean that he wasn't going to stop to fight him. "Ready, Maloth?!"

He smirked.* - Sun Oct 11 21:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | <Alright.... I just... I need to find something- a weakness for this brute.. but what?>
He bit his bottom lips softly, raising his eyebrows to see the Brute getting ready for the spar. A few seconds, he rushed towards the trap-- pretty quick too. He was channeling the bull in him, wow he was fast. Khalil's eyes widened taking a few steps back but then was strucked in the chest, being sent flying backwards and rolling through the ground. The feminine shinobi, slowly stood up from the ground looking at his skirt to brush off the dirt. "Ooouch...." he frowned.
  
   But this was a spar afterall.. there was nothing else that he could do, and to just try and beat up the brute. Khalil would quickly run towards the brute as he quickly sent a straight punch towards his chest. It was one where he used most of his strenght on it too!* - Sun Oct 11 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | Alright, so maybe it was a bad idea to rush forward to the brute... hell he didn't even flinch because of the punch that Khalil did to him. It was as if he was hitting some kind of really really hard brick wall! "AGGGH!" his fist hurt but that didn't stop the trap from trying to at-least do a bit of damage to the brute right? Right! All he had to do was think of a few things, perhaps try and kick him again on his weakness? That didn't really do anything last time. He squinted his eyes, quickly rushing towards Maloth as he sent a ew kicks, starting with a low, middle and then finishin it off with a high kick, a heel drop.
  He was sending many kicks towards  Maloth, though his speed wasn't as fast as the brute was. But that didn't stop Khalil!* - Sun Oct 11 22:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | Alright, so the kicks weren't really that good either.. the day that Khalil beats Maloth. Is the day that he would finally be VICTORIOUS!!! But for now, he just needed more training. As his heel was grabbed by Maloth's huge hand, his body was now being rotated. "Agh!" the feminine male yelled, covering himself down there so nothing would show. "Alright, you win, sheesh."* - Sun Oct 11 23:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) was hoist up, his skirt pulling it down a little so nothing would show or anything. "Mmmm. You know, I can walk, Maloth.."* - Sun Oct 11 23:17:45 2015

"Agh...." biting his bottom lips, he ran his fingers through his hair, ruffling a bit before turning his head to look at Maloth with a smile. "Mmmmm.. do you feel weird? That I like you?"* - Mon Oct 12 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) shrugged looking at his knee as it wsa all fixed, he walked towards Maloth to sit on his lap, smiling at him. "Just wondering if you feel weird of me liking you. You know, that type of like. But don't worry, we can remain as friends. -- Master." he giggled slightly, staring into his eyes. * - Mon Oct 12 06:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | "Well, since I  am your slave. I guess, I can do anything you ask." he nodded before laying his head on Maloth's shoulder, reaching for Maloth's big hand to grab with his own before softly rubbing his thumb against Maloth's rough palm. "You seriously have huge hands, haha."* - Mon Oct 12 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) blushed slightly to feel his arm around his waist, feeling the adjustment onto his lap. Thus giving Khalil more of a chance to get closer to Maloth, wrapping his arm around Maloth's chest to hug him tightly. "What do you want to do? Get out of this place or something?" the trap yawned a little, looking at Maloth befor leaning forward to give him a peck on the cheek. But he had to actually raise his body up because of how tall Maloth was. It was a quick peck and suddenly went back to laying his head on the muscular chest.* - Mon Oct 12 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) felt his body getting pulled closer, he closed his eyes before looking up to see Maloth's body temperature turning a bit different. He didn't know what it was excatly but instead just shrugged his shoulders and continued to cuddle Maloth as he was pulled closer. Khalil already felt their bodies connecting, his warmth skin, feeling his chest. "Mmmm...." there was nothing for them to do. "Well, I don't know. Want to stay here or go outside? It is whatever you want.~" Khalil nodded, running his fingers up and down Maloth's abs.* - Mon Oct 12 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) turned his head to the side to look at Maloth while raising an eyebrow. He wondered what he meant, or what was happening but he did feel something rising, he could feel it because of his legs pressed against it. The trap looked down to see the arousal as his fingers leaned forward to it, poking it. It felt really hard, and huge.. as if he wanted something other than just sitting down. Khalil's eyes widened before getting off Maloth's lap to knee between his legs, seperating his legs to poke the arousal with his finger once again.

"Looks big.."* - Mon Oct 12 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | "----"

Khalil's eyes widened to see the brute's member bein exposed already, it was swollen and thick... -- his cock was huge. How was that even possible...? And it seemed that he was only semi-hard. But, since his master wanted it, Khalil just nodded his head into his command slowly leaning forward to grab his semi-hard member with his hands. His tiny little fingers wrapped around the shaft to slowly jerk it off while his mouth opened in an awe. 

"Wow..." it felt, hard, warm and heavy in his hands.. but that didn't stop him! He leaned foward slowly lowering his head, kissing the tip, so very gently. He kept his lips planted on it and slowly ran his tongue around it, to tease him a little. Khalil slowly leaned his head a little more to try and get him all but he couldn't. So, he just reached out her tongue and lapped around the base as he bobbed up and down slowly, not fully his length but did get about 5inches in and he was even gagging by doing so! 

He pulled his mouth back up to the tip, lickin the soft crown before his eyes looked up at the brute, hopefully him enjoying it.* - Mon Oct 12 07:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | The taste of his cock tasted like sweat but that didn't matter to the trap, he actually did enjoy it a lot. Khalil started to slowly remove his skirt and underwear to reveal his naked body while licking the crown of Maloth's cock. He moved to straddle the brute's legs, with Khalil's bare ass in the air. Khalil slurped his way down, or well he tried to do it. Noticing, Brute's pulling his pants downward even more.. he saw the sizeable, cum-filled scrotom.

"---" Khalil's eyes widened, reaching with both of his hands to grab his balls, cupping them while he massaged them slowly. While his head bobbed up and down but slowly going inch and inch trying to go all the way down but he couldn't! It was too much and too big. He cupped his lips lightly around the brute's shaft, giving it a few licks like a lollipop before he settled into a slow rhythm, occasionally flicking the head with his tongue.

Khalil stared at the brute before standing up, letting go of his member. "...." his body was fully exposed and he could see that Khalil was really a male. But the trap turned around to reveal his fat smooth ass to the brute, wanting for the brute to do something... good. If its possible. * - Mon Oct 12 07:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | "Ahnn...." he was grabbed and slammed onto the mattress with his head burried into the pillow and his ass raised into the sky for Maloth to do what he wanted. He felt the massive cock slammed right in-between his rear, feeling the warmth and heaviness by just that slam. He was already all lewd up, but how was he going to be able to take that huge monster inside of him..?

Listening to the brute's commands, Khalil slowly nodded.. his heart beating super fast, by just feeling the cock's crown being pressed against his entrance. It felt soft and huge-- but that hand slam was too strong for the Yamanshi. His ass cheek felt as if it was burning up, hell Maloth's hand marks could be seen as well. 

Feeling the crown pressing against the entrance, taking a few deep breaths while moaning. The trap slowly moved his hips backwards to just enter the brute's crown. His head flew backwards, long hair probably smacking against his back, going deeper and deeper slowly tryin to get every inch. The brute's cock being sucked inside of the trap, it felt as if it was expanding even more. Though, for some odd reason Khalil enjoyed the stretching and pressure in his asshole. Though, it was really painful that made him bite his bottom lips hard enough to draw blood with his fingers scratching the bed sheets.

His ass sphincter started contracting, squeezing his cock as his member was now fully entered inside of Khalil. Finally taking one last deep breath, he waited for Maloth to move. * - Mon Oct 12 08:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | His body felt as if he was going to be broken into half...

Though, he didn't want the brute to stop doing what he was doing. Even-though it was painful.. Khalil was actually enjoying it. He then spread his legs wide so that the brute could see his asshole being expanded clearer. As his length was finally in, he pushed back, causing the bulging cock to instantly bob in and out of him slowly. 

That instant when he smacked his ass cheek again, he jumped and squealed, as his toes curled up. 

Khalil was so slick and wet that he slid his virgin ass down the massive cock and began to slowly hump him by moving his hips slowly. The trap enjoyed the pain, especially because of his master's cock but the pain started to slowly fade away. He slowly slid out of his cock before grabbing Maloth by the shoulder and attempting to push him on his back on the bed, it was possibly that the bed might have been broken. 

He slowly climbed up, taking hold of his solid cock and slowly dropped himself down, impaling himself. Facing away, he slowly started to rise and fall on him, moving, shifting, touching. Khalil bent over, one hand reaching out in-front of her and started to rock back and forth his cock, his other hand reached for his own penis cause why not. His ass moved back and forth, closer to the brute, panting as she pushed harder and harder.* - Mon Oct 12 08:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) slowly but surely his rocking was getting the good of Maloth just by how he placed both of his hands on the traps hips. He was already on fire and coul've taken him then, but wanted to prolong the pleasure that he was giving and receiving. Khalil moaned inaudible bable, when he kept pushing the brute's cock all the way in and out as he rocked back and forth with a quick pace. The sensation was incredible, like nothing he'd never experienced, his cock was so huge, so warm!

"Ahnnn!" Khalil was bucking back into him meeting with each of his thrusts. He was moments away from releasing his load, the brute not Khalil. The trap moaned and began to hump against him, they were fucking pretty fast and loud that his gigantic balls could be heard smacking against the trap's rear. He shuddered with excitement, hearing the brute's warning, though that didn't mean for the trap to stop..! He wanted the brute to cum inside of him, all of it inside! 

Khalil felt the brute's cock slamming in and out of him, causing a sharp pain in the trap, wincing a bit but it became more and more pleasurable by each thrust that the brute did to the feminine male. * - Mon Oct 12 09:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | "I-I love it so much..."he managed to say as he worked in and out of the trap. He could feel the cum startin to work its way closer and was in a way quite surprised by it since the brute had so much 'manly' ness in him but was defeated by this. Now who was the dominant one? Khalil was nearing his orgasm which he quickly picked up on, and began to get fucked by the brute at a furiouse pace. 

Going faster and faster. A thick of strand of cum spewed out of the brute's cock. It did fill in the trap's ass but it was falling into the bed as well. He felt the hot load being released insid of his ass, the feeling of which was enough to make the trap cum as well. He sat motionless with his cock still inside of the trap, slowly moving his hips before catching his breath as his back was now on the trap's chest. 

The cock slowly removing itself from the trap's hole, taking a deepbreath. Khalil turned to look at the brute with his stomach now pressed against the brute's chest. "You want to do it every night? Alright." he nodded to his mater's command before leaning forward attempting to give him a kiss on the lips. If allowed by the brute.* - Mon Oct 12 09:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | Nodded his head before going down to clean up the brute's cock, licking all the cum while holding the flaccid cock with both of his hands. The trap cleaned the cum from the cock and the matress. All cleaned up! Kissing the massive cock's crown, and giving it a few licks around! The trap crawled slowly into the bed, layin down next to Maloth.

With his ass popping out still, his cheeks were red and had Maloth's hand printed on em. "Night Master.~"* - Mon Oct 12 09:44:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | "Sooo bored. Wonder where the others are, hopefully Maloth didn't leave the village without me..."

He sighed, folding his arms over his chest, speaking to himself looking down at his skirt to fix a little before feeling a giant hand resting on his head. Khalil smiled turning his head, to see Maloth standing right next to him. "Maloooth! I thought you left the village without me. I haven't seen you in days." he nodded, giving Maloth a quick hug before punching his shoulder. "Where were you?"* - Wed Oct 14 14:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Well, first I did some training and then I ate.... and then I went to sleep... - Wed Oct 14 14:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) looked around, raising an eyebrow. "There is no people here... and the Kage was busy. Buuuuut I still don't know what to do with this technique I am trying to work with." he shrugged before sighing to himself to look at Maloth. "Wanna go ahead and spar?!~"* - Wed Oct 14 14:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) felt the swat on his booty, blushing a bit he turned around to walk away towards the training arena! "Alright. But bare with me here..... I have always wanted to show you this technique but... never really got to do it." he nodded, attempting to make Maloth proud of himself.* - Wed Oct 14 15:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) totally noticed the craters, his eyes widened wondering exactly what was going on-- but clearly hit him in the head that it was all Maloth's doing. "Huh." getting his mind out of it, he turned his head to look at Maloth, nodding at him. He was nervous because of him showing off his technique that he has been working on. "ALRIGHT!! I GOT THIS!" yelled the feminine male before running towards Maloth.
  Quickly, he made a front-flip appearing behind the brute and turned around to send a furry of punches, following by the techniques on his sides and then sending a straight jab to his manhood. Yeah, this was one of the techniques that the trap was working on! Besides, he was really gettin good at the whole taijutsu stuff.* - Wed Oct 14 15:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | None of what he did was good anyways, damn it. 

As the brute spinned, sending a leg towards the trap, it made the feminine male fly backwards and rolling his poor body across the ground. "Ooooow..." Khalil slowly stood up from the ground to look at the brute. He pouted cutely before his eyes went towards his skirt that was a bit ripped off. "Gah. I should've put on some pants or something...." Khalil just stood there staring at Maloth, with his cheeks turning slightly pink. "T-Thanks... I need to work on my technique more.."* - Wed Oct 14 15:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | "But my skirt is broken....." he sighed, shaking his head before getting back into his position. If he wanted to be a taijutsu specialist, then fighting Maloth would have to be the way for him to do it! "Come on!" Khalil would quickly run towards the brute before sending a straight punch towards Maloth, followed by fury of kicks, starting with low kicks and then high kicks going all the way up to Maloth's chest, attempting to at-least make the brute knock back one tile. * - Wed Oct 14 15:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | "Yeah but still... I don't like it being all broken. Maybe I should change into some pants." 

 He nodded staring at Maloth's muscular chest, biting his bottom lips but then snapped back to reality as he was then hit by the brute once again sending the trap flying backwards. Khalil slowly stood up from the ground, one again as he shook his head. "Nope nope nope." it was all too painful for him, especially when his skin was thrown off to the ground getting a few cuts or whatnot. "I'm going to go change and then we can go at it again!"

Hopefully the Brute would understand, Khalil would turn around to walk away, holding onto his skirt so nothing would be revealing. * - Wed Oct 14 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | As he was walking away, he was stoppd by Maloth's rage. "Damn...." the brute seemed to be really angry at Khalil. Turning around to walk towards the brute, he showed him where the skirt was ripped off, it was revealing his behind too. "See? I can't. I have to go change. It will be quick, I promise!"* - Wed Oct 14 15:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) giggled before clapping his hands twice. "Yay! Alright!"

He nodded, walking away to the store and uickly going to change his clothes. Yeah, he was pretty fast and was running his way there!

A few minutes later, he was wearing a high waisted tight black pants that showed off his womanly curves. Going back to the training area, he quickly ran towards Maloth and without really saying anything, the trap crouched down, swiping his leg underneath Maloth's legs to attempt to make him trip down!* - Wed Oct 14 15:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: imma show u on skype - Wed Oct 14 16:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) | That was a really bad idea to do that, but at-least he managed to get a few hits into the brute right? That was enough training for now, though. As he was about to say something to Maloth, the trap was quickly grabbed and thrown across the floor, sliding on it actually. Khalil bit his bottom lips softly, standing up before walking towards the brute, shaking his head. "Can we just... take a break, please?"
