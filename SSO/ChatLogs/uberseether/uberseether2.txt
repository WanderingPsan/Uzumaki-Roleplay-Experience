<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikuryunaki Hanesegawa(Uberseether) nods her head as she quickly begins to focus her chakra. "Good..." She says as she suddenlly slams her hands together. "Andorra Limiter Released....Cromwell Ascension Activate....." She states as her tattoos all begin to glow. The blue tattoos on her wrists suddenlly begin to extend out as if they were large metal rings on her wrists.

The black tattoos on her back, were they visible, are also glowing brightly. A black bar appears at the base of her eye and sort of 'loads' up to her pupil before stopping. "Let's begin..." She states before suddenlly raising both of her arms up toward her training partner. 

"Andorra Limiter Charge Complete....Hinder Bomb." She exclaims as she suddenlly releases a massive burst of chakra straight from her arms. The chakra is blue in color and has the ability to knock her target flying, as well as causing concussive force.* - Mon Nov 23 01:30:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikuryunaki Hanesegawa(Uberseether) nods her head, breaking her concentration. "Alright let's go!" She says as she jumps back into position. She was at about 95%, her ability to restore chakra was massive as a part of her Kekkei Genkai.* - Mon Nov 23 01:59:53 2015

She says giving the shortened form before suddenlly rushing forward. "Andorra Mode Signature Activate: Accela Flash." She states as she suddenlly shoots forward, an image of her body appears directly where she once was similarly to using Bunshin.

She seems to dissappear three more times, each time creating a 'Bunshin'. She stops moving directly beside Chiky, kneeling. She sticks her leg out attempting to sweep the girl off of her feet. The technqiue which she used seemed to be not much more than a distraction as each of the bunshin was standing in a different position.* - Mon Nov 23 02:07:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikuryunaki Hanesegawa(Uberseether) chuckles as she felt that some sort of success had occurred. She suddenlly leaps upward, contorting her body as she poitns her hands down toward her opponent. "Hinder Bomb." She states aiming to perform a singular blast toward Chikyu's midsection, aiming to cause her damage via concussive force.* - Mon Nov 23 02:13:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikuryunaki Hanesegawa(Uberseether) is thrown away from her target and slams into the ground. She groans as she stands up. "Ow...That hurt.." She says as she brings her right arm up and points it at Chikyu. She was holding her head with her other hand. "This is...Wrong..I can't hurt you..." She thinks as she begins to charge her chakra. She doesn't fire anything off as she simply stands there, her senses flaring outward.* - Mon Nov 23 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikuryunaki Hanesegawa(Uberseether) looks like she was going to cry. "I-I can do it!" She exclaims as her hand begins to glow even more blue. The orb growing on her hand begins to grow to the point where it was almost half her size. "I can do it.." She says, not intending on using her technique yet, she was jsut holding it in, one turn at a time.* - Mon Nov 23 02:26:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikuryunaki Hanesegawa(Uberseether) turns her head and takes notice of the girl running at her, the sword having flown away. The girl then looks at Chikyu. "Ugh.." She states as she suddenlly exerts her chakra. She shoots towards Chikyu, faster than the girl was moving towards her, and aims a massive kick towards the girl's midsection. She didn't want to hurt her anymore. She just wanted to land a hit. She utilizes the accela flash at the last moment, aimign to attack faster than she would normally be capable of.* - Mon Nov 23 02:51:56 2015

He clearly doesn't want to be here...He seems shifty anyways...I don't really trust him right now." Chi states. Her mind was focused on that individual, she really thought he was shifty and was having a hard time trusting him. She wasn't sure why but it seemed to be in her nature to distrust everyone.

"It's the angel in me..." She thinks to herself as a small voice at the back of her mind speaks up.

"Or maybe the demon!" The voice cries out as she suddenly snaps out of her mindscape and returns to real life.* - Wed Nov 25 07:58:17 2015
