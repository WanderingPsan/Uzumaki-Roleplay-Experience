<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bremusa(Ej247) Walks down the little hall way and would make a quick to turn to enter the clothing store. One many stores in the village but this one was the unlucky one to get a female like Bremusa to enter it. She stops there in the door way standing a nice brave six foot tall, her eyes are  very light green. Her body almost all exposed if it wasn't for her  fur style amazing get up then she would be completely naked. Lucky that wasn't the case, but sill she draws the attention from most of the employees in the shop. Those light green eye's scan over the room before she takes a few more steps inside heading off to one of clothes racks. She turns her body to face it looking at the clothes. "These garments are not suitable..."She said out clearly for those in the shop to hear. She wasn't one for inside voices at all. She speaks with a stern, strong voice but it still has that feminine  touch to it. * - Thu Oct  8 06:11:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bremusa(Ej247) turns away from the clothing and stares down the other two inside the shop. He gaze is first shot at Lyala but is quickly switched to Maloth.

"Do my eyes lie to me? Or do I see a warroir of great strenghts."She said, seeming to like his rather large size.* - Thu Oct  8 06:21:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bremusa(Ej247) seems rather unfazed by Lyala comment. Instead her full attention is completely on Maloth a great man who shows great physical attributes of a warrior. Though she is thrown off by his speech pattern a little. Though she not on for being rude at all. The warrior asked her who she be so she must answer with pride. 



"I, am Bremusa."She said.* - Thu Oct  8 06:37:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Uchiha's Hatred: This character carries the hate of the Uchiha with him. He is relentless, and hate driven. His power is boosted, and so is his mastery over the Sharingan. His power grows at a quickened pace, and he seeks to end not only the source of his hate, but all those connected to the source, and connected to his hate as well. He loses himself in hatred, and destroys everything to try and sate the insatiable urge which follows him. His strikes are much faster and stronger than the average fighter.

Though it seemed a few of the little brown warriors were ingaging the brute in combat or trying to get him let the male/female down.

A women with hardly any clothing on laying on the ground like this a good show for the two males watching. But once she got over the stun of the attack she stands up and dusts her self off.

"I am an amazon. Amazons are a tribe of just women who do every thing men can do hundred times better."She shouted before sprint off forward again. She waits to get in some sort of rang and would try to send a kick for the brute stomach.

It annoys her a litle but she turns that inner anger into a fuel to feed her soul for fighting..That warroir soul to not give up untill she gains something. 

"Maybe Maloth is just a very strong man. But this won't stop Bremusa no.. Even if takes me weeks to get better..All amazons must come out on top."She siad as sh eattmepts to wrap her arms around the brute and then would try to lift his heavey ass up..* - Mon Oct 12 04:01:04 2015

"Grrr." She is annoyed and really want sot hurt him just to shut the brute up. So she rushes froward and in rang she quickly attempts to send just a combow of punches for his face.
