See I found my self walking around the village bored out of my own mind. Just couldn't think of any thing intresting to do with my down time. So I went walking off to find the good old pond. I was exspecting to be alone there but no, It clearly a busy day. I was going to turn around and leave but my caught a glance at the beauty that is the Mizukage.

So I put on my casual cocky smirk of a smile and walts right on over. Now I'm no shinobi not good with all those tricks they do so I was walking inside the pond. About waist level water is where I stopped before waving torwards the great leader of the village.

"Hey there can I request I meeting with you my lady!" Yeah that right I yelled. What can I say I'm little I have to raise my voice.* - Mon Oct 26 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Repurakon(10thMizukage) ||

My cocky smerk of a smile leans a little far to the right side of my face. My face blushes a little peachy color I could tell I felt it in my gut. Because see I wasn't exspecting to be noticed at all by the kage but see what happens when you raise your voice. 

So before I opened my loud trap I gave a quick glance at the others in the area.  Oh they all seemed like chill lasses which was good. My attetion went back to the Mizukage this was busness so I had to make sure I was being professional. 

"See my lady. My name is Repurakon, Akon for short. I'm a Armor and weapon smith looking to get a contract signed up with you!"Yeah I was still yelling, had to make sure my voice was heard you know.* - Mon Oct 26 18:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) thinks: Stupid. - Mon Oct 26 18:15:15 2015

I nod to mizukage as she gives me the thumbs up. It finally happened I can start making some money this was such good news to be that I felt like the sun was just giving me a big old hug. Yeah I'm a big softy inside but I won't show it all that much.

"Why thank you my lady~"Yeah okay you got me I wasn't yelling no more but thats because its hard to put on the charming voice if you yell. 

But now with that greats news it was time to get the hell out of this water. So I turn and walts my way out of the water my pants just dripping wet I was soaked.

"Guess I'm head off to the local tailor." * - Mon Oct 26 18:21:13 2015

After I spent a good hour or two at the tailors just to find a nice pare of pents to fit my nice suit. I walked back to my room, yeah I don't hava a nice home and what not. I just stay at the local inn, I'm on the second floor in room two twin ten. Once I got into my layor I derobed took a shower and got dressed in my afternoons best.

"Looking real good." Yeah thats right I was staring at my handsome sel fin the mirror. I just cant help my self, I'm just to durn good looking. "Now let's see how bad me wallet is hurting."I sat aat the desk took my wallet and opened it up. 

My gut turns and twists when see the ammount inside. *Bang* "Ouch" Yeah my head hit the desk it was depressing buming me out. "I need to make some gear for these sinobi to look over." Yeah my mind just runing a mile a mintue, I stand up and toss on my jacket. Not much rest for the day now I head right back out of my room make it downt eh stairs and exit the inn.

I wear a smirk on my face and not my ocky smile smerk its more of I hate my job smerk. See I'm busy mining for ore so I can craft a few weapons and armor for these shinobi to take a look at. So I'm working my body hard swinging this pickaxe all type of ways to break through all the dirt and dig out the clay. As I'm doing this wonderful stamina draining poriton of my craft I look down and see that I had dirt covering my shoes. 

Now before you go off and judge me saying he's a pretty boy.. Well you are right, I am a bit of a pretty boy so when I saw my nice kiri-Js got dirt on tem that bad it made my gut turn. But hey it happens when all your clothing is the best there is and you look fly even at work. 

So yeah I swing and swing this oickaxe nocking out large vanes of dirt, clay, and rocks. Shoveling it all into a neat pile outside of my mane work area. I'm breaking a sweat here there you just enjoying my day. 

My pickaxe is doing a wonderful jub at helping clear this stuff out but the clay here. JEez, wow this stuff smells and isn't hard no it moist. Theres lots of this stuff just in the ground it gets in my way like three forths of the time I mine. So I decide to set the pickaxe off ot the side and grab my shovel. I stare at this vane of grey clay and just start to hack a tit I mean I'm going apes on this stuff. 

Trying my best to dig this stuff out quickly, you kow I'm working my body double time here. So you know my shovel hits this stuff and kind of sinks it and I quickly pull it up and tosst he chunk off to the side. It makes a funny flopy sound when it hurts the ground but the smell is just harsh... Hue, reminds me of a few summers back during my child hood days. But I wont bore you with a flash back of my past life.

Good hour or so passes and I'm still at it and I'm just mad. I feel like I'mr eaching th eend of it but every time I move some hard dirt theres clay so I get reall upset you know. I stand up and draw that shovel back and just toss it into the clay. *CLING! CRUNCH!* "Crap!"Yeah when I threw my shovel little did I know there was some ore hidden behind the clay and well long story sort my shovel has a dint in it. No big deal I'll fix it when I have time. 

So I grab my shovel look at it and shrug my shoulders tossing that junk of to the side. I get on my knees and start to move the cly with my hands and bam what do I see? You guess it lady iron her self oh it was just perfect. So I rush to stand up and grab my pickaxe and start to wack, and hack at this iron vane to break junks of it off the main part.

A good three hours or so and I finish up with that I'm tired panting, sweating and just a dirty old mess. So I decide to call it and day I pac up the ore I did get into these like berlap sacks. YOu know the ones they uuses for spuds and stuff. I got about four bags worth a little less. So I tie them all up with this rope and then swing itover my back holding it steady by the little rope handle I made. I leave my shovel there and grab my pickaxe and head off to the inn.

"Need to shower"My mind is racing I canr eally smell my self and I stink. I hate it  so ocne I got my dirty self into my room first thing I did was take a shower and make my self look handsome all over again. Ha!, that took about four hours.

Now with that done I open theses berlap sacks and man they stink the ore covered in this nasty clay stuff. So I wash it off in bath tube no big deal. I then go about sortting each little piece weighing them and counting how much I got. I got my little note book, and all that stuff setting about dates to turn this stuff into iron bars.

I sip on this bottle of water this hot chick at the first desk gave me. She was was such anice girl but the water to be honest is shit. Must be old, yes people I have weird taste buds. Any way I decided to take a break from my work and go talk to a few of the shinobi. So I head off to the best place for this. 

Acording to my memory they hang around the courtyard doing stuff and talking. So I thought "Hey why not head there" I make way there walking ins tyle you know. Leaning back just a tad hands behind my head like I was just so chill. I finally step into the coutyard and man what do my eyes see.

"They are allowed to that in open like that."I was confused, my words easly express that. There two sinobi had to be wtihthe weapons and what not they were using. These guys where fighting  in the coutyard I'm shocked a little but shrug it off and keep my cool.

My head turns and my eyes set on the Mizukage. "Hey there lady Mizukage, its me again!"Yeah I yell I have to heard you know because I'm little.* - Tue Oct 27 02:08:51 2015

I did make eye contact to mizukage but I had to look over to this other guy. ((Arata)) I give him a quick glance over see what this guy was all about, he looked alright. Guy seemed liek he knew how to dress in style but oh jeez. Shivers, cold shivers down my spine and the feeling like you want to barf. 

See he got close up to me and I was able tos ee this dud freak of a face. His eyes were milky white and just the side of his face just no. I try not to let it show on my face and be respectful. You know you don't go acting a fool when a dud holds a weapon and is trained to kill.

"Names Repurakon. Akon for short. "Yeah you got me again I didn't raise my voice it was hard to with that nasty feeling in my gut. But I remain chill extending my right out incase this guy was a hand shaker. 

"I can make them all."Yeah I know you all thking what a liar. Just I was really hoping these shinobi were not going to ask me for something that would just be unreal. * - Tue Oct 27 02:18:14 2015

Hey I was fine with this guy not wanting to shake hands. My right hand returns to my side. I thent urned my head to look at a man who was being disrespcetful. I smirk a little oh the feeling to let my temper get the best of me was strong but I shrug it off. I was just here for busness and wasn't going to let any one stop that.
