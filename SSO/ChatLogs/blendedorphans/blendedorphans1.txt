<br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) looked over to her former student with nothing but a blank stare, no pity, no sadness for his betrayal, only understanding that everyone is not to be trusted. "You shouldn't be here....Neal," referring to him by his former name for the first time in years.* - Mon Aug 31 21:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) felt her nostrils flare and her left eye twitch as she shifted some of her weight and chakra flared inside of her in anger at his offer. Within a moment she already was seeing his death as she stood over his corpse as centipede's forced in and out of his body in giant holes they had eaten through him. 

"You know that I would never accept that, and that the very idea of leaving Zetsumo's side is sickening to me out of anyone else. You are foolish to ask -me- of all people to walk away when no one is more devoted than I. Not even Beth who claims she would do anything for Zetsumo. She does not understand true devotion."* - Mon Aug 31 21:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) exhaled out as her hands shifted under the lengthy sleeves to gesture to her bugs to spread out around the area further so she could keep track of his movements. "You shouldn't step closer, if you step into this village I will have to act against you. Leave, Neal."

She paused but never faltered her eyes from his figure unlike he had, "I -did- give you your name, that is why I am giving you this chance to leave now without consequences. I knew it was not possible for you to truly be a follower, you were never meant to be a follower, I knew this day would come eventually."* - Mon Aug 31 21:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) squinted her eyes now as he spoke of this day and being saddened, "I have no friends, all my friends died a very long time ago." Her expression transitioned to that of one very serious as soon as she saw the red in his eyes and the fire licked at some of the beetles on the very far exterior of the perameter.

Soon enough bugs were seeping out in large heeps from her pore all over her body, showing the macabre scene of bugs coming from her pores, nostrils, tear ducts, ears, and mouth. A second version of herself stood before her and even as it was finishing forming the real mukade as the two of them were concealed in smoke, new bugs were beckoned without handseals and then locusts were flowing out from her body and they flew out towards Orakuru and began to form a spindle formation trying to knock him back into the fire barrier directly behind him.

As soon as the clone had been formed it shot towards Orakuru at excessive speed (11 tiles). Almost instantly as it attempted to reach Orakuru's side it sent out a high kick towards his upper left arm an shoulder but it was merely a feint as a low kick was sent directly between his legs attempting to disable him by a kick to the groin. Clearly Mukade did not care about disabling a man in such a way, anything to gain her the advantage.* - Mon Aug 31 22:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) scoffed at his attempt to slash at bugs that were moving in such a sporadic fashion. He did kill the first wave but there were several more that came at him in random formations that would indeed knock him back in the end regardless of his attempt. 

His attempt to avoid the first kick only actually HELPED the second kick to land since that is what the skill the clone used was entirely for. (fail smh, lol) Mukade didn't waste time and immediately added more bugs to the spindle formation and brought a second formation out to his west aiming to increase the attacks that seemed to begin draining his chakra with each landing of the attacks, not to mention likely giving him bruises lightly from the swarm smashing into his body as a whole with each pass of a random targetting spindle attack. Almost immediately after she formed a short series of seals and bit her thumb before crouching in a blur and a foot long centipede was summoned before burrowing under the ground and heading slowly towards Orakuru's person.

The clone almost immediately aimed to leap into the air and aimed to kick him right in the Adam's apple in a epic dynamic entry! Wahhhh. 

(First rp drain 131 chakra, this rp drains 262 chakra)* - Mon Aug 31 22:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) snickered as she watched him burst the clone into fire on the front of it. Almost as soon as he had done damage to the clone it burst into a GIANT swarm of bugs that began to swarm over him and tried to latch onto his body to drain massive amounts of chakra from him. (if not dealt with this will drain 655 chakra this turn)

She motioned just to behind the door of the gate and folded her hands into seals as her body began to glow blue and she began to make more bugs on the spot at an excellerated rate inside of her body, wanting to have an endless supply. The bugs that were moving in two seperate spindle formations, one from the north of Orakuru, and one from the West of him, continued to drain his body. (a total of 262 chakra between the two spindles combined)

The summon under the ground continued to move forward now just under his person and it used the opportunity of him lacking focus to spring up from under the ground and then immediately attempted to chomp down on his ankle for an extremely painful bite. It did not attempt to flee afterwards, but literally just tried to continue biting the teenager deeply to deliver it's infectious toxin.* - Mon Aug 31 22:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) using her basic water chakra she spat out some water at the fire ring to provide an escape route if necessary. Her previous ability to hopefully gain some more bugs had dissipated by then and granted she hadn't done it for as long as she normally would only because she could hear majority of her creatures dying from the fire, they crackled like popcorn and the woman scowled in anger. 

The bug on his ankle, since it hadn't been attacked for some reason just kept holding on and poure MORE toxin into his blood stream due to him not removing the three foot long insect from his leg, obviously this was also a weight hindrance to his leg. (2 more rounds, due to added toxin)

She flowed out more bugs in large amounts which formed another clone as she remained behind the wall and this time didn't use smoke as to not draw attention to her location. There was chakra all over the place and she hoped he couldn't see her since she didn't know exactly how his eyes worked but of course he couldn't see her chakra through the wall (GG Sharingan). The clone walked out towards him walking rather slowly as it mimicked how Mukade remained far away from her opponents, larges amounts of bugs began to swarm out and overhead as they came from all directions at Orakuru and she used this larger amount to conduct two more spindle formations. One of the ones that had been to the West of him, aka behind him, hadn't been destroyed by the fireball sent to the North East and thus it continued draining him. Now there were two more spindle formations, one to the North of his location, and another to the South of his location which took a bit longer to get to him. (total drain would be 393 chakra due to the two added spindles)* - Mon Aug 31 23:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) rolled her eyes at his idiocy but at least he actually killed the summon now which became a puff of smoke and was gone. The bugs he killed were indeed killed off but he still had a spindle to the North chasing after him and a clone which he thought to be the real thing trailing after him and now chasing him but keeping a good distance. The clone spat out water chakra to a portion of the ring and it was sizzling and steamy for a moment enough for her to pass through. The clone then flowed out more chakra as more bugs began to swarm around her and aimed to come in for a spindle formation from the East and West around him as he ran, trying to knock him forward onto his front as he ran.

[3 total spindles, North/west/east = 393 chakra loss, one turn till total effect of toxin, two turns till loss of that leg's joint usage]* - Mon Aug 31 23:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) || Too bad for Orakuru he just cut his leg open for NO REASON, since it's not a venom but a toxin that is in the form of an infection that was already through his muscles not just his blood stream. He was pretty screwed on that fact unless he gets medical treatment. A good portion of her bugs were killed and the clone burst out into a massive swarm that had two thirds of it destroyed by the explosion as the bugs hovered in the air staring at the golem, could they drain that thing? It had chakra but they weren't totally sure it was organic. Meanwhile Mukade was debating what she should do, she wanted to see if he would take an offensive route.* - Mon Aug 31 23:52:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) panted heavily as she ran up, along her body were several burns in her clothing.* - Tue Sep 01 00:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) had black circles under her eyes from the chakra depletion which was RARE for her in the last few years, clearly it had been a hard battle. "We were fighting at the gate, then he summoned one of his golems to go on the defense. When I came out from behind the gate to take the offensive again the golem had disapeared and he was gone. He escaped while my bugs were killed off from around him temporarily so I couldn't track him. He knew I was going to follow him if they were."* - Tue Sep 01 00:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) 's eyes squinted lightly as she lowered her gaze. When he attacked her she crumpled over slightly and coughed out as the wind was knocked out of her.* - Tue Sep 01 00:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) gives the bitch glare at the shadow bottom bitch.* - Tue Sep 01 01:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) turned and slowly walked away with a heavy sigh, she might as well go rest and clean up after the long battle. Deep down in her chest and gut her belly hurt and was in knots from feeling depressed about her failure... failure to kill or capture Neal but at the same time in her heart there was hate... hate towards Zetsumo vaguely because she knew that she had succeeded on one fact.... she had managed to stay alive for him.* - Tue Sep 01 01:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) stopped walking and turned back around to face his direction out of respect, unlike what he showed her. "No, Zetsumo..."* - Tue Sep 01 01:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) turned to walk away without a word, another heavy sigh emitting. There was a rage inside of her, and pain... so much pain, but she refused to let it out in front of anyone, not even Zetsumo any longer. She had no desire to be near anyone, she had no goal any longer, even the goal she so dreamed to achieve for Zetsumo and herself seemed ... too far away and like an illusion now, it all was beginning to seem like it wasn't worth it.* - Tue Sep 01 01:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) tensed for a moment when he had grabbed her. When he took her to the private area she wondered if he had released her or not?* - Tue Sep 01 02:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) kept her head down staring at the ground and then eventually closed her eyes. She just wanted to hear his voice, to see if it was genuine when speaking.* - Tue Sep 01 02:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) felt her chest compressing, "you blame me, you say it was because you were attentive but I was in charge and so you blame me...."* - Tue Sep 01 03:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) 's eyes squeezed tighter in their closed rest, and she exhaled out a sigh of stress and sadness, not to mention frustration. "I am not enjoying this, nor would I ever enjoy punishment for losing your trust. No do I ever take any of your punishments lightly....they mean more to me than you could possibly know." Her head rose as she look to him with glazed over and bloodshot eyes. "I dont care about the power... I never did, but by you doing this I feel... defeated, are my attempts so far pointless? Is the fact I lived for you not something to be glad about? I know I didn't kill him or capture him for you but I fought as hard as I could and he paid the price up until he managed to escape with his damn ability to teleport away. I know you always want more from me, I know I should have persued him until I couldn't walk anymore but somewhere deep down it feels like you think I let him go... I would never do that."

She paused and sighed out while tugging at her hair with both hands, "Ugh...  you know why he came here? He came to try and make me join him, he was asking me to leave you. I then immediately attacked him, maybe it was foolish but the very mention of him wanting me to leave you instantly made me see red and his body at my feet."* - Tue Sep 01 03:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) frowned heavily at the ground and hadn't looked at him even as she was touched by his cool zombie hand that she normally would have leaned into. "His leg still had use before he escaped but the toxin inside of him would soon enough disable his entire leg, that is why he was able to escape... Eventually he may have broken an ankle from trying to run when his leg gave out or locked up in the knee and hip joint."

Her frustrated look continued on, "I never saw myself as a queen.... but now you just want me to be a tool. I may not have been your equal but now I am nothing, I don't feel as if I did wrong by you in the past concerning Neal. What he did was his own doing, and none of the teachings I gave him were what turned him. I'm not even sure why he has left us, the only thing he said to me at the gate is that he wanted something 'better' for me... he said I deserved to have a free life... and then..." She cut off and shook her head. "And then you turned me into a tool and it hurt. I know you don't like dramatics, it took a lot in me to even come speak to you about this. All of this feels like I have lost you forever and I'm nothing to you now then a useful tool to pull out of your toy chest when you need me. I feel like all the other parts of our relationship are gone with just a simple decision made on your part. If that's what you want... fine, but... I cannot guarantee that I will be the same person. You wanted me strong, and I became strong for you, Zetsumo." 

Her gaze traveled up to his own, "A tool can only be a fraction of it's weilder's strength, and if you wish to force me into that roll then I will be forced to weaken. I am only alive after fighting Neal, who had nearly every possible fighting style that should trump me, because of your will for me to be stronger. I fight with your desire behind me to push me to succeed and kill my opponent, now... now I'm just going to be a puppet for you to use when I'm needed." Her gaze lingered on him for a moment before lowering again.* - Tue Sep 01 04:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) lowered her gaze she remained silent for a long time before forcing herself to speak in a low tone, "Yes, Zetsumo...." She didn't want to push the topic more since she knew how these types of conversations could get on his nerves and she had already failed him enough. The cold shoulder, the lack of punishment, it all showed that he -didn't- care about her in a twisted way that made her know that something between them was broken. It wasn't simply a shift in hiarchy.* - Tue Sep 01 04:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) spoke in a hushed tone as he turned towards the door, "You never would have a reason to lie to me, would you Zetsumo?"* - Tue Sep 01 04:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) rose her head to look him in the eye with her bright topaz gaze with a lighter tone in her voice, "I suppose that only shows what you do to me deep down, Zetsumo."* - Tue Sep 01 04:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) was ignoring his attempts to leave fairly thoroughly and stepped towards him a single step. "Would beating me to an inch of my life ease any tension you may be feeling... Neal related... or otherwise, Zetsumo?" Her eyes seemed dilated now and the sadness had dissipated away. She had cut off the emotion as another had replaced it, a predatorial one with desire, she couldn't help it. Spending any time with Zetsumo alone did this to her.* - Tue Sep 01 04:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) shifted her teeth back and forth against each other in a gritting motion. "So nothing I can do might make you feel... a little less stress?" <Or a lot less> her thoughts added on as she glanced his visage over slowly and her eyes dilated further making a yellow ring around the blacks of her enlarged pupil's, nearly cat like when they are in 'play mode'. 

"I don't want to sound... -selfless- but really you shouldn't take it out an anyone else but myself, you shouldn't have to waste your time taking out your stress on anyone else but me..."* - Tue Sep 01 04:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) felt her heart rate pick up as he pushed her backwards towards the wall. Carefully taking slow steps until she was pressed up against the cool surface and looking into his dark eyes as she tried to appear like nothing and changed emotionally or attention wise within her, but all her attention was on his. 

"Don't get me wrong, I wasn't asking for anything... only ... offering myself to your needs. I felt like it needed to be reoffered, with recent events and me being gone for so long, or was it not needed. Did you not forget that I'm yours and only yours?"* - Tue Sep 01 05:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) smirked gently at him rolling his eyes at her poetic stupid antics of speaking in a charming way when she clearly had something devious in mind. Her hands ran along his chest and then down his ribs before snaking their way between their tightly pressed bodies and into his attire. Gripping his length almost out of instinct without any trouble of finding it she stroked hard and long while parting her lips faintly and peering into his eyes. She wanted to see the pleasure he received from feeling pleasure from her touch once again after such a long time.

Stroking in heavy and hard strokes she didn't let up, teasing him just enough with even the slightest amount of pain from how hard she squeezed to give him just what he wanted from her.* - Tue Sep 01 05:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) glanced down as he cut through the thin spandex fabric of her body suit and the girl scoffed, "tch, always ruining my clothes, these are hard to repair you know." She squeezed long and hard on his length to torment him for destroying her clothing yet again just as he did nearly every time he had her. The woman's perky creamy breasts put on display as one hand removed from his clothing to jerk at her spandex bottoms and ripped them down enough so that her pale ass was against the wall and her exposed sex was just before his own. One leg wrapped around his hip high, as she was locked in the single leg standing position with her spandex pants coiled and twisted around the raised leg's boot constricting her movement intentionally. 

Her head cocked slightly as she stroked and pulled the length of his cock free of the confines to meet the tight space between their bodies. Rubbing the head of his sticky cock against the mound just above her clit. "Well? You want me, I can see it... I can -feel- it. I'm all nice and ready for you, even wrapped myself up like a sick little present, or is this not enough bondage for your taste?" It was rather vanilla for the two of them after all. She peered down at how her legs were constricted and holding her against the wall and against his body.* - Tue Sep 01 05:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) groaned as his hands traveled over her breasts but his request for her to take it in her rump had her nervous, she wasn't a fan of it there and he knew it. He actually enjoyed torturing her this way since it was the only thing she had trouble handling sexually. She shifted the arch of her back some and rubbed the head of his length all down her pussy lips and finally between her ass cheeks as she slowly guided it to begin pressing in against the tightened pucker which hadn't been fucked in such a long time. "Nng..." Her breath gasped and she leaned her head back against the wall as the very tip of his head was just beginning to breach the tight ring, she forced him in further until the head had made it's way past and that was the hardest part of this to deal with.

Rocking back and forth she guided him deeper and deeper inside of her, luckily he was so turned on so all of the sticky mess he had create was a bit of help. Moaning out gently she began to rock against him in tight circles that became wider and broader to force him deeper inside of her. Her body was hot and felt deseperate for attention as she worked her hips against his own.* - Tue Sep 01 05:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) snickered with a little whine at the end from mild pain her her behind, "O-of course not, I can make jokes can't I?" She opened her eyes peering at him as the strong desire to kiss him that she always felt lingered in her mind for a moment before she began to rock her hips against him harder. Gripping onto his left side of waist and her right hand behind his shoulder and neck for support. 

Suddenly she felt the pressure against her hips and shoulders and bolted her eyes downward towards them as her leg was ripped away from his hip. Groaning a growly moan out but also desperate for more attention she gave him pitifully sensual eyes. As he forced deeply inside of her she screamed out and bit down hard on her lip before leaning her head forward against his chest and collar bone. "Thats it, mn... Zetsumo..." 

Her head rose to peer up at him from lower than she normally would be when speaking to him, lips parted slightly and eyes full of pleasure and...what was likely seen as relief. "More than you could ever know, this is one of the few joys I have in the world. Please give me more?" She squeezed tightly around him as she constricted her muscles in her pussy to tug around his length inside of her ass, she wanted to force him to loose control if it was possible even while he was still slightly annoyed with her.* - Tue Sep 01 06:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kiiro, Mukade(BlendedOrphans) felt embarrassed and harassed by his words but that didn't stop her from moaning from calling her his slut, she didn't care if he meant it or was roleplaying for foreplay she adored him speaking to her in a degrading way just as much as a sweet peachy tone. "Zetsumo, please... PLEASE I want you to fuck my ass harder, deeper, I NEED you to fuck me harder, there's just something missing without you inside of me!" She was screaming out the words, unaware of where their location was exactly and not caring who heard, after all Zetsumo had her ass now and she was all his.

From a good distance away, Kami watched the water's edge and how it pulsated against the sands, seeing how it was convulsing where there was dead slosh from other dead bodies in the past. He formed handseals and then lowered his hands as chakra formed in his body and was held in wait of the person's arrival.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kami(BlendedOrphans) had already formed the handseals and waited, as he saw that the person decided to back track out of the water he instantly released the jutsu. While Kyubishu was climbing out of the water a giant cloud of gun powder swarmed over the area in such a manner that it seemed like a dust storm. It was extremely fast, much too fast for Kyubishu to handle. Kami remained where he was as the cloud was formed and centered around Kyubishu's postion around the water so he would be trapped on all sides. 

As the cloud reached it's position in a matter of seconds, a snap of Kami's fingers and a flame was flicked out towards the cloud of gun powder. Within another few seconds the cloud exploded around Kyubishu as he was still trying to climb out of the water. A pity really... it was almost too easy.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kami(BlendedOrphans) had started to take a step forward to see if Kyubishu was dead or not when Menma came into his line of sight. He could see Menma much clearler than Menma could see him so his reaction time was going to be a bit faster initially. As Menma was talking, the man took no time to wait as a single handseal that literally took him all of a fourth of the time of a single handseal, it was like in a flash hardly even able to be seen as a stream of fire shot from his mouth and aimed to circle around Menma's position to block off his paths through the two water beds--- he really shouldn't have walked in that narrow ally.~ Course the fire did not go atop the water but either he would have to go on the water or suffer damage from the fire if he tried to go through it.

Almost instantly after the short second of the first handseal another set of handseals were formed in the time span of a single seal. All of this was happening extremly fast. As the fire from fire run had finished, the gun powder storm cloud was flying out right after it. This would be a double trigger attack, the gun powder was not going to need any flicker of flint to get it going this time... no it was going to explode as soon as it reached Menma's position. Aiming to keep him trapped and then immediately explode around his body. Clearly his opponent was a psychopath of some sort. --- Or perhaps just a pyromaniac?

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kami(BlendedOrphans) had keen eyes on his position and as the lightning ball morphed through the cloud, the male quickly darted in a roll off to the South to avoid most of the attack. Of course a good amount of the attack would get his back and shoulders as he did this, because of that his body would seize quite a bit as he rolled to a stop and then rose back to his feet. The attack would of course stun him for a moment nerve wise but no permanent damage was evident as he quickly formed chakra in his hand and shot out small fire balls across the area into the already exploding area to try and amplify the attack as much as possible. Of course from all the exploding he could hardly see an outline of Menma, where as Menma wouldn't be able to see him at all.

(damage of lightning ball is halfed due to avoid, no static damage taken)* - Sat Dec 12 21:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kami(BlendedOrphans) watched as the jutsu disipated and there was nothing left. His eyes narrow, "waste of chakra..." He left the area to go find a hide out to recover.* - Sat Dec 12 21:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kami(BlendedOrphans) peered around the corner, he could see someone at the far end of the dead end and squinted a bit making out the same man he fought before. He formed handseals quickly and walked along the waters surface, he proceeded closer and closer until he was in range of attacking which was still out of range of Menma's sharingan sight. As the handseals were complete a sudden burst of chakra flowed out as the gunpowder filled the dead end and aimed to fill it all quickly in order to destroy the man hiding at the end of the ally. To further make sure there was no way to be spotted he kept to the walls and once the attack had been blown out, the only thing Menma would see coming is the gunpowder cloud and in the next instant there would be a spark of a flame of chakra tossed from the snap of Kami's fingers and sent out a spark that ignited the cloud. 

Soon after he formed handseals quickly and held them... just in case it was needed.

(double checked and shar only has the sight range of what your sight perk is, so your range is your screen size at 32x32. Where as T2 sight on my part can easily see at 16x16, i never come into your sight range)* - Sun Dec 13 00:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kami(BlendedOrphans) was holding handseals still and seeing that he had taken action to try and hinder her attack she released the five ball with a giant exhale from her lips. Aiming to literally enflame the rocks that were falling atop him, it seemed that the rocks began to literally melt as the came crashing down around Menma. In that same fate... the boy had little time to try and flee the cave in. In the process of trying to backpeddle after releasing the jutsu he managed to break a leg from a rock striking him and recieved several large gashes and internal bleeding from the rocks. Struggling to come up out of the water with only one leg working he gasped for air and clung to the cliff side beside him to hold himself up out of the water. Peering back towards the cave in blocking Menma off he was certain there was no way to survive that... even if there was, no way he was getting out of melted rocks caving in around him.* - Sun Dec 13 00:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kami(BlendedOrphans) began to pull himself along the wall to leave the area. Grunting in pain and trying to go find a dark corner to try and do something about his wounds.* - Sun Dec 13 00:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: (This area, is filled with sand) - Sun Dec 13 01:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kami(BlendedOrphans) is pulling himself along the wall with a broken leg and gashes all over his body. He's soaked with water as he tries to pull himself along, if ANBU is a sensor he can tell his chakra is also quite low.* - Sun Dec 13 01:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kami(BlendedOrphans) was locked into place and because he had a broken leg cursed out in pain and leaned his head against the wall. He knew he was dead, there was no way to fight someone off with the damage to his body. Apparently they were going to have a chat before he died? "A cave in..."* - Sun Dec 13 01:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kami(BlendedOrphans) watched the ANBU as the sand traveled up his body and he didn't look scared at all. Instead he looked judgemental and disappointed in the boy about to kill him. "Remember this in the future, the face of the man you killed who was helpless so that you could become a political figure, so that you could be connected by the corruption of Gezo. Remember it well and let it haunt you, boy." With that the sand covered his chest and then head before imploding in on him and killing him instantly.* - Sun Dec 13 01:32:57 2015
