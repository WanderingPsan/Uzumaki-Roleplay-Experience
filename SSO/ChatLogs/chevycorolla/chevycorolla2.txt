<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: On to my own training then I suppose. - Thu Sep 17 20:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) decided to get back into the act of training, letting his hands perform the handseals for his doton technique as he used it to further himself from the plaza. Soon, once he found himself a good spot to train at, he proceeded to make way onwards to an area near the ocean. Soon, he found himself proceeding to perform handseals for his exploding wave technique, and with them done, the wave encompassed quite a large bit of the land around himself.* - Thu Sep 17 21:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) continued to utilize his handseals, proceeding to combine both techniques for his combination. It didn't seem like much but if anything it was kind of a 'Suprise Wave' deal. Regardless, he continued to do such, letting himself move through the ground towards a different point, recalling upon both within his head as he moved around. Next he performed the wave technique, letting his powerful wave move amongst the waters.* - Thu Sep 17 22:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Just spreading the message Tethys has left for battle in Kumogakure... - Fri Sep 18 00:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) remained focused on the training he had ahead of himself, allowing himself to make his way throughout the ground beneath his very feet, the texture feeling akin to sand as he moved around. Soon, he breached land now, letting his hands access another series of handseals in what seemed to be an instant. After doing such, he found himsself releasing a store of suiton chakra from within, letting a wave crash onwards through the waters ahead of himself. His eyes locked in upon the long wave while he attempted to keep himself ready for another attempt.* - Fri Sep 18 03:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) stuck to the normal ebb and flow of his training, letting his hands access a few handseals as he started up the chakraworks, focusing on the doton element for the time being. Soon, the ground beneath him was shifting and so did his position, following along to another point within the Earth before allowing himself to raise upwards. Soon afterwards, he allowed himself to pickup the slack and release another round of handseals. In only a moment, his chakra was being released in one massive wave of water.* - Fri Sep 18 19:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) increased his efforts in training, picking up the speed now as he allowed his hands to work together to perform back to back handseals. Each series being completed with ease and each ending with the result of him moving between two points and launching such a large wave off into the waters of Kirigakure. No amount of distraction could prevent him from goin on with his practices.

With everyone else focused on how to fight the war, Elon was preparing himself to assist, not wanting Kirigakure, his second home, to turn out just like Konohagakure. His own skillset had to be improved, and any amount of jutsu would benefit him in the task of war. Regardless, he followed the pattern: Handseals, Hiding Like a Mole, Handseals, Exploding Water Shock Wave.

His eyes remained locked on his hands when performing the seals, and his eyes locked on the focal point of the technique whenever performing either of them. While he was in this mode of focused training he allowed himself to continue on , a feeling of ambition taking over his body. He was ambitious for the sake of his village and the sake of using these techniques to represent the improvements that had taken over him as he continued living.

Not only did Elon focus on his training at hand, but the possibilities that would soon come in his future, with his sensory abilities and his ninjutsu prowess combined together. His massive chakra pools being wasted away in his training efforts. Several waves cutting across the ocean in front of himself, several holes being made and resealed as he moved. Nothing had stopped Elon at this moment, his inner-beast revealing itself in this moment.

At this moment was simply the first time he'd been seen without a smile upon his face, at the least, of his own willpower. His hands still moving in tandem to complete the techniques before going on with technique after technique. His chakra was beginning to dwindle now however, and after firing off the final wave of water, he let himself take a moment to rest and enter meditation.* - Fri Sep 18 19:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Yo. - Sat Sep 19 23:02:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Alright.. I only have one thing I can teach you, in that case. - Sat Sep 19 23:28:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Do you want me to give you a scroll on it, or a demonstration? - Sat Sep 19 23:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: A demonstration'll be better. - Sat Sep 19 23:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) nodded as he payed attention to the woman's demonstration. He had no idea who they were but from the looks of it, the technique was a bit different from most that he had within his arsenal. However, he presumed it was just a more concentrated form of chakra. Stepping forward, he allowed himself to occupy the space nearby her position.

For a moment, Elon allowed himself to simply sigh as he observed, picking up his hands to begin performing the necessary handseals for the technique. His mind recalling upon the two specified. A quick motion of his fingers and he formed the simple Ram and Tiger handseals without problem. As his hands settled on the end, his chakra was built in a matter of seconds, forming into the suiton element before he allowed a single stream of water expel itself from within.

With Elon's mastery of both chakra control and the suiton element, the technique was rather simple to imitate especially with instruction. His chakra had now been splayed out in front of the public as a display, his sensory abilities allowing him to compare the viscosity of the two different substances where they lay. Once done, Elon would simply give the female a look through his peripheral vision, "Like that?"* - Sat Sep 19 23:42:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) moved himself off to the side of the plaza, making sure that he wasn't anywhere near the other inhabitants as he didn't wish for anyone to get stuck within the technique. Soon, he found himself putting his hands through the same two handseals as instructed. Soon he found himself releasing a simple stream of water that proceeded to spread outwards into a thick pool of water, showing a poor viscosity, but it was apparent that it was there now.* - Sun Sep 20 00:07:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) forming the Ram and Tiger handseals again, he allowed himself to focus a gathering of his chakra into his own belly. In the last few days he'd been practicing techniques way above his own skill level, even with his mastery over his own element and chakra. Yet, with the introduction of this jutsu it seemed to be refresher. As he focused on the technique, his eyes trailed along, focusing on the original point he allowed the first pool to set prior to now consider it lost its viscosity. Finally, a stream pushed forth throughout his mouth and took up the space, and his eyes remained upon it, his own thoughts focusing on how he'd done with the technique currently.* - Sun Sep 20 00:14:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) stayed on the same track of mind, letting himself put his hands into the same motions he'd been doing, allowing himself to repeat without any problems. The technique was becoming a bit easier with each practice of it. Within a few moments he proceeded to open his maw, letting the stream of liquid spray forth and connect with the ground. With that done, he allowed himself to check upon the viscosity, his sensory abilities assisting in such.

His hands motioned through them with ease as his eyes remained on Erebus, as well as his sensory abilities which had begun to focus in on him. The feeling that had been given off by this man alone seemed ominous with ill intent, and it seemed that Elon would need to plan for himself ahead of time now. With the process of the handseals done, his chakra would focus into the Doton Element.

His chakra had then been applied to the ground beneath his feet, actively shifting it into a liquid for himself to maneuver into as he began speeding away from his initial point, his intent on making it out of the gates of small plaza.* - Sun Sep 20 09:55:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: I guess it will just determine how much time it takes for Kirigakure to return to a stable state. Before, helping can be done for foreign matters. But, I doubt there is all to fear about helping out are allies. - Mon Sep 21 17:30:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Time to go master the waves. - Mon Sep 21 19:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) proceeded to set himself near the waters of Kirigakure, his eyes facing the distance now. Soon, he raised his hands and began to actively practice the movement of his hands. They both easily accessed a set of handseals, allowing himself to access the Doton element before he began to delve directly into the ground, shifting his position to move a bit north of the waters. Soon after, he allowed himself to spark up a few more handseals and easily let a single wave drive forward from himself, overtaking the forces that moved the waters and kick up a bit more waves alongside it.* - Mon Sep 21 19:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) steadied himself on the same premise, allowing his hands to pick up on the handseals once again, he immediately accessed his Doton chakra, letting it encase him as the ground below turned to sand. Soon after, he shifted his position, moving throughout the area and back to his original spot before bursting forth, hands first. As they exitted ahead of himself, handseals were already being performed and he easilly accessed the suiton element, letting a large wave expel from within and drive forward across the seas.* - Mon Sep 21 19:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) repeated the same two techniques in the exact same order. A few handseals and the application of his own chakra, and it allowed him to make his own movements throughout the ground beneath himself. Soon after, he did the necessary handseals for his own explosive wave, letting it move forward throughout the ocean.* - Mon Sep 21 21:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) now stood alone once more by the waters, allowing himself to access his most powerful jutsu at the moment. His hands proceeded to come together, connecting to form the handseals necessary for the technique. He had a bit of mastery over it but it was obvious that he was still required the necessary chakra, which of course he allowed himself to apply. His chakra pathways focusing into his gut as suiton chakra filled it up. Eventually, the maw of Elon opened up and out came an incredibly large wave, maximizing range as it traveled outwards, being both wide and large.* - Wed Sep 23 19:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) proceeded to follow the same routine of handseals and chakra management. His chakra within himself beginning to store up in his gut, eventually becoming an abundance of suiton chakra while he completed the handseals. Once done, he released a rather large wave of water from his maw, and proceeded to watch it wash up and over the land, crashing into the water below before causing a chain of waves.* - Wed Sep 23 23:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) found himself standing alone, beginning to perform a series of handseals now as he observed the area ahead of himself. It was a simple expansive ocean with waves crashing against the side of the island. However, it was when Elon completed this technique that he found his own powerful wave washing over Kirigakure's large waves, consuming them for itself.* - Sun Sep 27 13:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) continued to remain where he was, allowing himself to collect the necessary handseals while building chakra within himself. The suiton chakra focusing within his gut pushed up and outwards. Almost immediately afterwards, he found himself releasing this chakra with the completion of handseals, sending it outwards in another wave at the outside world.* - Sun Sep 27 14:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) continued to perform the same handseals just as before. His hands easily finding them while his chakra worked up within his gut. Soon after his handseals were done, his chakra was released, blasting forward in a single wave as he observed the oceans ahead of himself. With ease, the wave was overwashing the smaller ones and pushing against the ocean.* - Sun Sep 27 14:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) followed up his last jutsu usage with another, his hands finalizing the handseal process as he had once again performed them. With ease, he found himself performing the same wave technique once again. With ease he was allowing a large destructive wave push forward and reach across the land.* - Sun Sep 27 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) proceeded to allow himself to access the same jutsu once again, his chakra building up within himself. Alongside this, his hands performed the necessary handseals prior to himself leading into the wave technique once again. With ease, he was releasing it across the ocean.* - Sun Sep 27 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) still performed the same technique, allowing himself to access the same ninjutsu once again. His hand easily performing the necessary handseals while focusin in on the ocean ahead of himself. Almost immediately afterwards he pushed forth the wave from within his gut, letting it wash out and over the expansive ocean ahead.* - Sun Sep 27 15:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) continued to access the ninjutsu, letting his chakra build up within while his hands performed the handseals. Within a few moments, he found himself releasing this chakra in quite a large wave. However, he simply waited for this wave to keep moving forward before proceeding to pick up on another set of handseals and release another suiton technique. This one of course placing itself on the ground in front of him.* - Sun Sep 27 15:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) picked up on the technique once more, letting himself practice the handseals at least twice before releasing a large wave. His chakra pushing outwards in the form of suiton of course, yet this was an empowered wave. Elon practically engulfing the immediate area with a large mass of water, watching it wash over and into the ocean. It was almost as if he made a small lake and waterfall above.* - Sun Sep 27 16:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Yo, yo, yo. - Sun Sep 27 16:35:50 2015
