<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) thinks: Eh...lame missions, too easy. Oh well. - Fri Oct  9 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) turned, going off to begin on his missions.* - Fri Oct  9 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) found himself coming across the stray hole within Kirigakure. As he observed, it seemed to be a bijuu print in reality. As he looked down upon it, Elon simply wondered how he could go about filling in the hole. Standing there, Elon only observed before beginning to press his hands into a simple set of handseals.

Gaining a focus on his chakra, he allowed himself to focus upon the Suiton element. Recalling upon the mission details, he knew now that he was free to fill it however he wished to. With ease, Elon opened his maw, letting a wave rush forward from within his mouth, finding the hole, to actually be multiple, considering it was a paw print basically.

A moment later and the water Elon had produced seemed to carry through and over each opening, sinking in enough to create small pools amongst the water. His observations led him to believe that he'd done a good job as of now. Once he'd done such, he pulled back, observing the space with his eyes.

Elon had then proceeded to access a simple set of handseals before utilizing the Hiding Like a Mole technique to move onto his next mission, using his sensory abilities to search for a single dog now.

As Elon swam through the ground of Kirigakure, he could feel his chakra slowly deteriorating, but he came across the signature he needed. In a matter of seconds however, it seemed the dog had heard his underground motions, due to how close he was and proceeded to sprint. Elon gave chase with ease, never letting up on the jutsu.

His approach lead him to find a position underneath the dog, eventually preparing himself for his chance to grasp at it without problem. Within a few seconds, Elon was pushing past the dog's positioning and eventually bursted upwards, utilizing the Headhunter technique to grab onto the dog.

Once Elon had came upwards, he held the dog in his clutchees, using a single arm to keep hold as he performed more handseals, easilly accessing the Hiding like a Mole jutsu once again. Afterwards, Elon sped back to the owner.

Once Elon returned the dog to its rightful owner, he found himself simply standing there and looking amongst Kirigiakure, unsure of where to take himself next in order to complete the final mission in his hands.* - Fri Oct  9 20:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) had now found a location to build a home, allowing himself to begin accessing a few handseals as he made an approach. Once arriving at the location, he opened his mouth, producing a simple layer of suiton chakra to cascade over the ground before his form.

In a few seconds afterwards, Elon found himself accessing his doton ninjutsu to apply himself to the Subterranean Voyage technique. Utilizing this one, he combined his own hands and doton chakra to move wooden logs into position, building them up on top of the sticky substance.

Afterwards, Elon was easily making due with what had gone on, finding that he'd finished the base of the home within a matter of seconds. Within a short moment he proceeded to exit the ground, looking over the base that he'd formed. Afterwards, he moved on to applying wooden planks, using the Hiding Like a Mole tactic now.

While Elon moved underneath the ground he was allowing himself to transport wooden planks and apply them to the base he'd already created, wondering if there was even any jutsu to make doing such a thing easier. 

Once he'd set the planks in place, Elon backed away, cascading his sensory-imbued eyes to the area above, wondering how tall to make the home. Eventually, he stepped back into its region, letting himself apply a few more wooden parts to created a one-story home.

Now that Elon had the base, the flooring, and the walls, he needed to set a roof in place and simply entered the humble abode, figuring that someone else could come finish the job, considering for the most part, he'd done it. Creating a house, just without a roof was all.

A shrug and a nod, and Elon was accessing the Hiding Like a Mole technique and finding his way back to the center of the village, figuring that he could get his reward now for the three that he'd done. His mind only apologizing to himself for the inability to finalize the home that he'd left behind.* - Fri Oct  9 20:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) simply approached the area now as he looked over both Genesis and Kirie. To him, he had no idea of what was going on, but he could only feel for their chakra signatures. As his chakra influenced eyes cascaded over the both of them, Elon gave a wary response. "Uh....no. Koeki was really...the last one from what I know..."* - Fri Oct  9 20:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) thinks: I attempted to kill him but failed. - Fri Oct  9 20:51:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) nodded as he looked at Kirie, simply allowing himself to state, "Yes ma'am, finished all three." He then took a brief moment to exhale a simple breath, letting his eyes release their sensory ability, only relying now on the most basic of forms of sensory, his range shortening. After such, he replied to her second question. "Suiton and Doton ma'am."* - Fri Oct  9 21:09:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Watch closely. - Sat Oct 10 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) turned sideways, allowing Ortho to get a full-body view of Elon as he stood straight, continuing to apply the Suimen technique along the way. As Elon faced off into the distance, he let his hands carry on into a short set of handseals before applying his ninjutsu knowledge over the element. With the handseals done he raised two fingers towards his mouth, using them as a sort of targetting device. Once placed, his mouth seemed to puff up, swelling with chakra he'd been storing up for the technique and releasing it off into the distance now. A singular, linear, straight stream exitted and went quite a distance, carrying over the lake and easily connecting with the bank. After doing such, he turned back to Ortho.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) allowed himself to raise his hands, holding them out in front of his face now as he performed another short series of handseals. Within a few seconds he found himself producing chakra within his body, letting it churn into the Doton element, remaining wet but hard in the same instance, rather proving quite odd for a technique of this nature. Even then, he still allowed himself to extend the shot from within his mouth, propelling it forward and letting a mudwave act just the same as the Watergun technique.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) caught the scroll, nodding afterwards. "Got it."* - Sun Oct 11 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) thinks: Should I activate it? - Sun Oct 11 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) thinks: We are standing on water. - Sun Oct 11 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) thinks: We both have an advantage since we can both do Suiton techniques. - Sun Oct 11 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) simply oppened a single strap on his backpouch, placing the scroll within his backpouch before applying his innate sensory ability to the Mizukage. Keeping his eyes locked onto her however, he figured that she was going to be rather versatile in this battle against him. To start things off, Elon applied his handseals to one of his more basic ninjutsu techniques, allowing his chakra to take place within his gut at the same time.

A single sigh later and he was now releasing the technique, allowing a stream of water to push past his own lips, his mouth opening wide as he expelled his chakra in Kirie's direction. For now, he was simply testing her to get a feel for her skillset really.* - Sun Oct 11 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) simply released the technique upon seeing how fast Kirie was compared to himself. Elon was extremely lacking in physical combat skills as he observed her, his sensory ability being the only real thing he had to keep a tab on the girl. Yet, Kirie was already on his position now, and delivering a swift combo to him.

It only really took this moment for him to lose his focus now as he crashed through the waters, losing his footing and focus alike. As he drifted downwards within the lake, he could tell that he only had a few moments before he began to drown really.

Thinking in this moment, he let himself apply his physical strength and proceeded to carry himself downwards to the bottom of the lake, kicking away from the initial breaking point until he could allow his hands to perform handseals. Application of the doton-nature crossed his body now, and he was finding his swim from the water to change to a swim in the Earth below, planning to make his way over to the nearby ground and bring himself back to a better standing point.* - Sun Oct 11 05:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) continued to make his way towards the land now, his sensory abilities picking up on a change in Kirie's signature. This simple change however, lead him to wonder what she could've been preparing, figuring that she was about to make use of a jutsu upon him. Yet, he could see that his escape was working for now as he met with the bank, producing his form at the top now to only turn back and face the woman.

Looking out within her direction, Elon could only perform a few handseals, seeing that he lacked in the ability to utilize his Doton techniques for any offensive means. But the time to transition from his swim to accessing an assault was also gone, leaving him open for the taking at the moment as he stood there, looking upon her.* - Sun Oct 11 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: I would not have taken this position if I was not confident in my abilities Fujitora. - Sun Oct 11 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) observed Kirie utilizing her own ninjutsu of sorts, allowing himself to bring up his own chakra as he finished his own set. Molding his chakra for the ninjutsu, rather than applying the Suiton element, Elon quite easily accessed the Doton equivalent to the Watergun technique, or so he believed of course.

However, when he released his force of chakra to counteract and collide with her own jutsu, he assumed that he'd be the victor in this clash, his own elemental prowess being rather excellent and of course, using a technique that worked especially well with a suiton combination.* - Sun Oct 11 06:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) observed as Kirie countered his technique, utilizing one of the more widespread suiton techniques that Elon too, contained within his arsenal. Yet, his reflexes weren't quite on par with his newfound Mizukage's and he'd of course actually lack the ability to counter the wave, or even her approach as his sensory abilities seemed to be the only thing singaling to him that she was approaching his position.

Even then, he found himself remaining confident and proving to push himself to get better. As Elon observed the wave, his hands connected, attempting to form another series of handseals in order to access the same technique that Kirie had done. However, the kick to his face had thrown him off, sending Elon in a backwards motion before he eventually tipped over, connecting with the ground behind himself.

Elon simply remained there a while, not wanting to stand to continue, but he figured he'd need to.Yet, with Fujitora present he figured he could play dead and act like he was knocked out for the least, his face still holding the pain upon it.* - Sun Oct 11 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) thinks: Yo...She's really a hard hitter... - Sun Oct 11 06:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) thinks: I'm not messin' with that fam. - Sun Oct 11 06:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) simply lingered there in the grasp of Kirie's hair, actually somewhat shocked by the technique. It was something new to him as he'd never seen it prior to now. But regardless he attempted to do his best to play the role of possum, keeping all of his thoughts to himself.* - Sun Oct 11 07:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) found himself standing at his usual training spot, eventually allowing himself to access a short set of handseals for a bit. Soon, Elon was performing one of his more widescale techniques, allowing himself to launch a wave of Suiton chakra in a forward motion before himself to crash into the waters. Without much of a problem he allowed his wave to join the ocean before himself. Once done, he allowed himself to begin focusing a layer of chakra throughout his body, accessing the Doton element.* - Mon Oct 12 15:10:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) approached the area where he believed a majority of people were buried within Kirigakure, allowing himself to take up a position a bit off center. Even before arriving, the dog in the area gave off an obvious chakra signature, seeming to be the only living creature within the surrounding area. Keeping his eyes locked down upon the dog, Elon observed that it was rabid, and would more than likely give him rabies should it bite into his form.

Keeping that in mind, Elon stayed low, moving himself into a closer range to reduce the possiblity of himself missing his target. Once capable of striking the animal, he focused his chakra, holding the necessary handseals in the ready position. A simple shift in his position, and Elon heard a cracking sound come forth, only wondering what could possibly have been underneath his feet.

Within seconds, the dog before him proceeded to charge within his direction at a rather intense speed, obviously faster than himself of course. Regardless though, he switched his focus from the handseals and simply shifted his chakra to spread through his enitre body. Afterwards, Elon brought a single arm upwards, allowing it to darken now as the dog came into contact, biting down against his own armored skin.

A smirk drew across Elon's face, finding the technique to work with ease. He was unsure of whether or not he could be considered a 'genius' for making this, but assumed that others could have possibly developed it as well. Even then, he proceeded to bring forth the other hand, allowing it to act as a bludgeon. With the connection from Elon's fist and the dog, he could only hear bone crack and watched the dog slowly die, slumping to the ground before himself.

Afterwards, he moved on to burying the body that it was chomping away at. And eventually, the dog as well. Of course however, he created seperate holes for each, continuing to respect their forms. Once he'd done such, he covered up both openings and allowed a simple sigh to escape himself before moving on to collect some. He was now on to the second mission, basically going down the line of importance to himself.* - Wed Oct 14 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) found himself now approaching one of Kirigakure's more plentiful rubble sources. While there were great amounts of rubble in many places, he found a centerpoint within Kirigakure that would hold all he needed. Finding such a thing to be rather simple to carry out, Elon brought himself to collecting a few bits.

Once done, he allowed himself to carry out the task of transporting them along the way to Kirigakure's walls. Along the way, he came to a stop, finding a simple cart that he could utilize to his full advantage. Keeping this in mind, he brought it back to the initial point and filled the cart.

Once Elon had a full cart, he simply carried out the task of bringing all of the rocks and debri onwards to the West wall considering it was the first point that would be used as a defence. With the wall in sight, he could see workers awaiting him to make the delivery.

Now pulling up on the wall, Elon allowed himself to cast out his hand and begin unloading the set of rubble he'd had within his cart. Passing out what he could to a few of the shinobi working upon the wall, he found it rather easy to get them to pick up on their work again, for a while he helped too.

Once done, Elon returned the cart to where it belonged, rememebering there was some trash in the area he got it from, basically taking him to the last mission he had on hand.* - Wed Oct 14 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) now found himself walking amongst the roads of Kirigakure, leaning down as he passed around applying his hands to the trash amongst the ground. Lifting up some trash and tossing it into the bags he had set along the cart.

Moving forward, a simply sigh and Elon came to a pause, perfomring a few handseals before eventually allowing hismelf to expell his chakra into a rather large wave of suiton chakra. With ease, he was clearing out quite a bit of trash. Where it all went? Who knew. As long as it was clear of the roads.

Eventually ,Elon went back to the normal method, bagging up what he could on his way back to find Kirie and turn in his mission, obviously labeling his progress with all three of his missions.* - Wed Oct 14 03:28:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) assumed that it was safe enough now to begin collecting the goods detailed within the mission. As a result, Elon stepped forward, taking care to prep a cart for transportation, considering he wasn't going to trek all the way back without something to support the inventory. Once all goods were set and ready to go, should he go unharmed or without being stopped. He'd begin to face Kirigakure, not moving back towards the village without making sure Violet was all set to go, and Xon, should he choose to return alongside them.* - Wed Oct 14 21:34:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) nodded, proceeding to pull off with the supplies now that he'd had them set and ready to go. Shortly, Elon was making his way on to Kirigakure, finding it to be a workout just to get started back. A sign that he needed to work on his physical abilities a bit. Regardless, he trudged on, his stamina drive keeping him going onwards.* - Wed Oct 14 21:43:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) pulled into the area, pulling a cart along behind himself. Sweat drifted across his brow and he continued to maintain a sense over his chakra, obviously keeping a great vision over the entire vicinity around himself. As he came into the social center of Kirigakure, he allowed himself to bring the cart to a stopping point, moving it to the side a bit as a means to leave space for entry. Once he'd done so, he turned his vision over to Kuro and the Mizukage, simply remaining silent just in case they were engaged in conversation. It was a simple sign of respect really.* - Wed Oct 14 21:52:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) observed Kuro for a moment, pondering on his words. They intrigued him of course, but Elon had more important matters to attend to. He was given a mission, and it was his duty to carry out the task. Therefore, Elon allowed himself to make an exit, searching for a group of children to deliver his word to.* - Wed Oct 14 22:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) now found himself standing outside of a rather large building. He was glad to have come across it, considering it had a big platform, good enough for giving a speech of course. However, as Elon overlooked the people passing amongst the streets, working to rebuild or simply living in poverty, his eyes seemed to lower and sadden a bit.

Within the next few seconds, Elon was raising his own arms, cough just a bit as he proceeded to speak. "Come, come villagers of Kirigakure. I have words to share with you all." Meanwhile, as they all began their approach, Elon was beginning to feel a sense of embarassment and nervousness cross him, wondering if he could truly go on with this speech.

Clearing his throat once more, Elon looekd down upon the crowd that seemed to form before himself and simply began to speak to the public, delivering his message. "Citizens of Kirigakure, I understand your pain, your suffering, and most of all your hate. I too once went through all of this, experiencing these feelings after my home, Konohagakure was destroyed. Sadly, I must ask that you cast these feelings aside."

A pause came from him, hearing an uproar from the public. Luckily however, it seemed there were a few reasonable villagers which quelled the threat immediately. Starting again now, he simply exclaimed, "I only ask this because it will cloud your thoughts. Leave you defenseless against the greater evil and make you just as bad, if not worse. There are younger generations amongst us now, and they need not be raised in a world of hate and destruction."

A short round of whooping and wooing as some had obviously agreed with this point. Continuing on with his speech, "All we can do now, is make an attempt to better the lives of our young, and to start, the best thing we can say is, everything is fine. Everything will be alright. Kirigakure will get better and return to the former glory it once had. That is all, but I thank you, for listening to my words." With that, he now turned, moving to exit the stage.

With Elon leaving now however, he could hear an uproar, not one of violence and hate, but one of support and happiness. They had of course gone overboard and felt great about the speech, finding a new found ambition to work even harder and get their village back into a working order. A smile drew out across Elon's face, and still proceeded to find his way to the Mizukage's position now, choosing to turn in his mission.* - Thu Oct 15 00:06:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Deliver more rubble to the wall. - Thu Oct 15 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: They are running out of construction material. - Thu Oct 15 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Alright. - Thu Oct 15 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) thinks: Man they run out fast... - Thu Oct 15 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) turned, going off to find an abundant source of rubble to deliver.* - Thu Oct 15 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) found himself passing around the village of Kirigakure, allowing himself to search for any rubble that he could use to benefit the rebuilding efforts. As he did so, Elon allowed himself to come across a cart, taking it up in arms and pushing it onwards now. He figured he could return to the same point and recieve rubble from there before returning.

Coming across a rubble pile, Elon accessed it, utilizing his own chakra to cascade his body with a layer of Doton. This caused his arms to darken, leaving the rest of his body to remain normal. He'd only did this as a means of preventing his hands from getting cut or scraped by any pieces of rubble.

Once Elon had lifted enough and filled his cart, he proceeded to move on from the scene, choosing to deliver to the southern wall this time. His efforts had left him with a full cart now, and he proceeded to let himself heft up the weight now, carrying it from Point A to Point B.

With a slow pace, he would take some time to get there, but he assumed there was no rush, as they weren't expecting any sort of attack. But then again, Elon figured that it would still be better to excersize caution for himself. Regardless though, he trudged through the streets at a reasonable pace, keeping himself on a temporary schedule to reach the wall in time.

Gaining sight and sensory over the wall, Elon could easily find a point that he was meant to drop off rubble. This was apparent due to the fact that some workers were resting, sweat rolling from their foreheads and the consumption of various foods showing that they were on break. Once Elon rolled up however, he simply pronounced his arrival, stating, "Delivery." Setting down the cart now and beginning to help unload the weight.

It only took a few minutes to set down all the material Elon collected, rather, leaving the cart for the works to utilizie to their full advantage and move rubble with mroe ease. After a minute of assisting them, he simply turned, giving a salute and a nod before doing so and making his way back to Kirigakure's designated social hub.* - Thu Oct 15 00:49:29 2015
