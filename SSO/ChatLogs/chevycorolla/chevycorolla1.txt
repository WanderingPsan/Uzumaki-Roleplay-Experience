<br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) sighs as he stands by himself, just as he did in all of his training sessions. Regardless, his hands were raised and he began to weave them into a series of handseals. After a few moments his suiton nature kicked in and allowed him to take action.

Eventually he opened his mouth and a splurt of water shot outwards, quickly increasing in size as it becomes more widespread, forming a large wave of water as it shoots forth, cascading over the ground ahead of him and leaving traces of water.* - Mon Sep 07 10:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) put his hands into another series of handseals quite quickly. They easily accessed the input necessary for his suiton jutsu. With ease he completed the technique, his hands  raising upwards as they acted as a guiding tool. Water pushed forth, escaping the maw of Elon as it washed over the ground in front of himself.* - Mon Sep 07 10:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) continued to perform to the best of his ability, allowing his hands to access the handseals again. There was no problem with doing so, considering he was an expert in the use of the technique. Regardless, he found himself making progress as he completed the hand combo. As a result, his chakra was released from his mouth in a wild, raging wave of water. The ground ahead of him, remaining wet.* - Mon Sep 07 10:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) decides to put another twist on his training, or rather, the same he would normally fall into. His hands began to perform a different set of handseals, his chakra focusing on the doton-nature. Eventually he completed the seal, his chakra creating an invisible veil of sorts around his form as he dug deep into the ground and began to move forward. 

Eventually his upperbody was revealed, completing another set of handseals in the same moment already. After doing so, he began to part his lips, the crashing waves he'd conjured so many times beforehand once again making their way through the area around himself, wetting the ground once again.* - Mon Sep 07 11:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) kept his focus on his techniques, letting himself perform the same necessary handseals for his tunneling technique. He'd easily perform such as a means to allow himself to move from one point to another and release himself from the ground, performing another set of handseals in succession.

After he completed them, his lips parted and yet another wave of water was fired off, his chakra reserves draining as he covered the ground in the liquid.* - Mon Sep 07 11:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) continued to actively train with the two techniques. He progressively charged up his chakra for the techniques in the moments that he used his handseals in preparation for them. With the first one ready to go, he easily entered the earth below himself and began to move off to the side, reappearing a bit away from his original position.

As he resurfaced, he accessed his chakra once again and completed another set of handseals. He was now using the techniques back to back as a raging, wild wave of water pushed forward through his mouth and crashed amongst the  ground ahead of himself.* - Mon Sep 07 12:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) continues to actively practice with his jutsu as he allows himself to progressively perform handseals again. The doton-technique he'd been using to travel amongst the ground was the first he'd begun on. Upon completion, he easily moved from one spot to the other.

After doing so, Elon allowed himself to start up the second jutsu combination, moving his hands in order to actually perform the jutsu. Once he finished, his lips parted and he now let a stream of water free from within, firing forward.* - Mon Sep 07 13:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) nodded. "Alright. Deal."* - Mon Sep 07 19:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) went off to go do his mission.* - Mon Sep 07 20:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) found himself entering one of Kirigakure's great restuarants, as a meeting amongst officials was to take place here. The entire placing having been rented out by them. Elon, himself, was invited to sit amongst them, of course accepting the fine chance to learn something more about his homeland's higher ranked members. Finding his way in, he took a seat in the back, observing each official take their seat and relax.

Soon enough, the meeting began and a single member, seemingly the oldest had begun to speak amongst the group. At the moment, he spoke of Kirigakure's military standings. Elon progressively took notes, gaining insight on various opinions and facts that had skipped his ears over the years that he'd been here in Kirigakure.

With the same topic continuing on for some while, the men grew more rowdy, speaking at much louder tones. It seemed the discussion turned into a debate. They agreed and disagree about both political, and physical power amongst the ranks. Elon remained intrigued, saying nothing as he continued to scrawl out multiple notes. He was attentive, and so far this seemed to be very educational to him. 

Soon, when the old men seemed to grow tired of their own bickering as the topic would go nowhere, they decided to let it rest for future debate, and moved on to the next topic. They began to establish talks of their allies, and connections, finding the discussion to elaborate on Kirigakure's wellbeing and how it placed them in better standings compared to other villages. Elon of course made notes of this, as it seemed the most important and intriguing to himself.

The way things seemed amongst these men, they all had very strong opinions about each village, and they all respected each other on these opinions, sharing similar points across all members. Elon listened to them bring forth a dislike or a like, and provided proof to back up their statements. Regardless of what they said, it still got noted, Elon thinking on some matters himself.

Following the men on to their next topic, it seemed they discussed more or less what was going on in Kirigakure itself, such as the changes in how their Shinobi are trained and how they act. It seemed they also touched on the subject of the Chuunin Exams alongside that. This left Elon to ponder what these changes could mean, and how they would benefit the village. 

Continuing to take notes, he listened to them as they stated what they all knew of the villages current Chuunins and those that had failed, including Elon. He didn't let their words get to him however, as he was content with his reasons for failing. Regardless of such, he took note of this and figured that soon the meeting would come to an end and he'd have enough notation to turn in. It seemed the topic was to change once again soon.

Elon's pencil stayed to the paper as he continued to write, focusing his ears on the new topic of their trading exports. With the way Kirigakure was locked down, it seemed that such had become a bit more difficult as all traders required inspection. Elon had never thought about this but it brought up a good point and he nodded his head to the thought of this before eventually letting himself jot down notes on that.

Lastly, he found himself continuing to listen in, keeping note of all the things that were said, and of course still relevant to the current situation. However, his notes eventually had a point that expressed that their fishing trades were still flourishing as expected of Kirigakure. He continued to keep his mind locked onto the topic, finding this all to be intriguing and important to learning and becoming more in touch with the village, even if he was the foreign guy.

Eventually the meeting came to a stop and so did Elon's hand which had now begun to rest. It seemed he could do ten times more writing than he could handseals in such a short amount of time. He found it a bit amusing but nonetheless, he packed up his things and made way to find the Mizukage to turn in his report.
* - Wed Sep 09 19:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) nodded as he watched Himura's demonstration. The technique was obviously simple chakra control, and he knew this from earlier observations of figures using this technique, as well as his sensory abilities defining the placement of chakra. Nodding afterwards, he proceeded to move towards the tree, placing himself on one side as to allow Baen a place to begin.

As Elon looked at the tree, he began to focus on his own feet as the centerpoint, utilizing his control over his own chakra to assist him in this excersize. For a moment, he took a deep breathe before moving to lift his leg. Upon exhaling, his chakra enfused foot approached the hard wood and made a simple connection with the tree. Eventually he proceeded to let the other follow shortly after and plant itself amongst the side, finding his footing wouldn't hold.

Steadying himself once again, he focused his chakra, finding that he wasn't really applying as much effort as he normally would in training. His mind was a bit out of it, but he figured he should focus now. In this attempt, he practically did the same thing, keeping an intense focus on the chakra being carried throughout his feet. They had once again pressed against the tree, eventually the other planting itself on the wood too. Now that he was giving focus to the technique, it was actually quite simple for him to make his way upwards.

His chakra stabilized now, and Elon was standing amongst the side of the tree. Overall, he began to move upwards a bit before centering himself on what he believed to be the middle of his side. His eyes shifted over, looking to Himura as he spoke outwards, "Like this?"* - Wed Sep 09 21:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) allowed his eyes some rest.* - Wed Sep 09 21:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) nodded, figuring that walking on water wouldn't be difficult at all considering he was proficient in controlling his chakra when interacting with water. He was in tune with this element. He'd already proven to have great control, and having the basics of applying his chakra to the element was already in his understanding. Therefore, Elon proceeded forth, allowing his foot to press forward as he made his show of crossing amongst the water.

His chakra flowed throughout the feet, taking place within that specific line out of the entire pathway. The amount was entirely stable enough, his mind already identifying the difference between both wood and water with extreme ease. Adjusting his chakra as he walked along, he was faintly rising and lowering, yet remaining in a good range for the most part.

It was obvious in this apparent moment that Elon was no master, yet he could easily keep this actively going for hours on end without interference. His eyes fell upon the water and he simply watched his chakra work, observing his own chakra pathways with his own eyes as he moved across the water, rounding at the halfway point and making it a point to return to the land as he looked to Himura. "I've got it down it seems."* - Wed Sep 09 22:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) passed Tethys the scroll.* - Wed Sep 09 23:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) accepted it. "Will do."* - Thu Sep 10 00:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) takes a moment to open up the scroll that Mizumi had given him as he began to let his eyes read intently on the technique, only knowing of it by ear. He figured the technique was generally very strong, but he could probably learn and master it in no time.* - Thu Sep 10 16:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) continued to read through the information that was written within the scroll. First he let his mind wander over the parts relating to what the technique did before focusing in any other information, figuring it'd be better to see if it was useful to him.* - Thu Sep 10 16:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) continued through the scroll. The knowledge was actually coming together quite easily, but he saw that he still had a bit of a ways to go. Regardless, he found himself placing eyes on the required handseals for the technique, allowing himself a few moments to practice the combination before continuing.* - Thu Sep 10 16:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) continued to keep his eyes upon the words within the scroll. He found it to be getting easier to understand as he went through, taking in the info with ease. His extensive knowledge over chakra and the suiton element however lead him to have an even better understanding at the moment.* - Thu Sep 10 17:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) remained focused, keeping onwards as he allowed his hands to work on the handseals for a moment, getting them down quite easily before continuing his read.* - Thu Sep 10 17:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) remained with his eyes on the paper. He wasn't having any trouble still, considering reading wasn't difficult. Regardless, he figured he was nearly done with the scroll, but the knowledge he was gaining still intrigued him, wanting him to read into the technique intently.* - Thu Sep 10 17:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) remained with his eyes focused on the scroll and his mind thinking on the contents of it. He was wittling the scroll down to the last of its info, finding himself on the road to completion.* - Thu Sep 10 17:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) believed he was now on the final bout of reading the scroll, and had of course allowed himself to proceed onwards with the knowledge presented. He was to win this round, and edged himself forth in anticipation as he now understood a majority of the info.* - Thu Sep 10 17:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) passed Mizumi the scroll.* - Thu Sep 10 17:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) believed that now was a good time to get to work on mastering the jutsu. He knew it was a powerful one and figured that he would have trouble using it unless he proved his prowess over the element through it. To begin with, he raised his hands, performing the necessary handseals as he began to hold his chakra at the ready, preparing for use of the technique. 

Upon completion, he released the water from within, similar to the Raging Waves technique he used, yet more devastating and wide-ranged. The technique began to ride from the land, into the water nearby, kicking up an even bigger wave. He remained where he stood, finding it to be quite draining upon his own chakra, his forehead already caked in sweat from the single use.

"Wow..."* - Thu Sep 10 19:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) continued to work on the technique, his hands moving into the handseals again. He wasn't going to get better by just standing around. He needed to master this technique, only so that he could get better and find himself worthy of the rank of Chuunin. Regardless, he felt his hands complete the sequence.

In the next instance, Elon's mouth opened up, water cascading forth as it proceeded to wash over the land ahead of himself. He figured he'd done well in performing the technique, but the amount of chakra he was applying seemed to be overbearing. But that was just something he'd fix with more training over time.* - Thu Sep 10 20:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) remained proponent with his training, pushing himself forth to continue on with it. His hands accessed the handseals once again as he easily began to perform the technique. He focused intently on the water ahead of himself, making it his target as a means to reduce possible damage to his surroundings.

Once his hands completed the technique's handseals, Elon found himself releasing a massive wave of water from his mouth once more, observing the large wave as it rolle forward. He figured he could do many things with the technique, and even branch other techniques off from it.* - Fri Sep 11 02:24:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) took up a stationary position nearby one of Kirigakure's various ports. However, he faced the general direction where the ships didn't linger or pass by. After confirming it was safe, Elon proceeded to move his hands into the various hand motions, performing a series of handseals for the overpowering technique he'd gained from Tethys' scroll.

Upon completing the handseals however, he eventualyl opened his mouth, releasing the wave of water from within his lungs with his chakra empowering, and creating the force of course. The large wave crashing through the ocean before eventually disappearing into its depths, probably increasing the expansive hydrosphere.* - Sat Sep 12 22:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) remained vigilant as he looked around, still trying to be careful of his surroundings. His hands easily accessed the handseals once again as he continued to remain in his position. Eventually his chakra flowed from within his form, an extremely large wave of devastating power unleashed from within his body as it began to move forward. The wave easily pushing through the seas ahead of himself. * - Sat Sep 12 23:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) continued to practice the technique, utilizing the speed of which he performed handseals quite easily. His hands weaved in and out without problem as he performed them, already having the seals memorized. As he came to an end, he exhaled and out came the wave of water, flowing nonstop through and into the ocean.* - Sat Sep 12 23:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) proceeded to set himself near Kirigakure's waters, figuring it would be best to combine his own training with cleaning efforts. In a short moment, he began to perform a series of handseals. His chakra within began to well up within before becoming an abundance of suiton chakra.

Soon, once he completed the handseals and transfered his chakra, he released it from his mouth. A wave pushed forth, appearing like the Raging Waves technique he used, but soon it grew and became even larger in size as it encompassed quite a large range ahead of himself.* - Tue Sep 15 07:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) picked up on the handseals once again, letting his hands actively enter the procedure. Within his body, his chakra swelled in one central point before pushing on its way upwards. The completion of the handseals caused this process to accelerate, the suiton chakra pushing forward and releasing itself in the same form as it rushed onwards.* - Tue Sep 15 07:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) accessed the technique again, letting himself focus on using the Raging Waves technique this time. His hands moved quite easily, performing the technique without problem before he released the small wave. However, he didn't pause there. Soon, his hands entered the secondary input and his chakra swelled once again in a larger abundance. Afterwards, another wave was fired from within his mouth. This extremely large wave pushed forward and collaborated with the smaller one, working to push it forth into the ocean and further move the poisons if possible.* - Tue Sep 15 07:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) actively repeated the same thing, his hands performing the combination of one technique before releasing the first wave. Immediately afterwards, his hands were in the process of performing the next technique's handseals. Soon afterwards another extremely large wave was released and it encompassed the large gap between himself and the ocean.* - Tue Sep 15 07:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) allowed himself to pick up his arms, letting them clasp together to begin forming the necessary handseals for his Raging Waves technique. Soon, he let his chakra well up within himself, easily creating water within himself before his jutsu was released from his mouth directly, transfering from land to ocean water.

Not stopping there, his hands had already performmed another set of handseals while maintaining his chakra. Soon it accessed the chakra needed for the technique and a wave of water was produced from within himself, pushing forward. With that done, an even larger wave moved after the original, taking it over in mere seconds.* - Wed Sep 16 01:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) continued to access and utilize the same techniques in the same order. First creating the smaller wave using the Raging Waves technique before progressing into the much larger one. He figured that soon, he'd be capable of shifting one technique directly into the next rather than having to create great timing.* - Wed Sep 16 01:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) continued to develop his prowess with the ninjutsu techniques, allowing himself to remain where he was performing a few various handseals. Soon he released the first wave, allowing a ragingly large amount of water surge forth. Immediately afterwards, a much larger wave pushed onwards, consuming the smaller one.* - Wed Sep 16 01:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) picked up on the techniques again, allowing his hands to access the set of handseals once again before taking aim at the ocean. His chakra welled up within his belly, churning into the liquid suiton chakra neeeded for the technique and some more. Soon afterwards he proceeded to allow himself a moment to actually release the jutsu, sending a small, wild wave of water outwards compared to what he was to release next. Soon his hands picked up on the handseals again, moving into the new technique before finally coming to the finishing point. Once completed, he released the large, destructive wave and let it overtake the much smaller one.* - Wed Sep 16 07:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) made use of the techniques again, his hands speeding through the handseals before ending. His chakra stored within seemed to remain in the suiton state for usage again. Utilizing this water, he released a single wave into the oceanfront before picking hip handseals once again. Almost immediately, another wave, dwarfing the original by ten times, moved forward and took it over.* - Wed Sep 16 07:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) picked up on the two techniques once again, allowing himself to access the set of handseals needed for the first wave. His chakra within swelling up into the form of water as he performed his handseals. Soon afterwards he released the first, small wave. Afterwards, his hands practiced the handseals for his more taxing technique, allowing his hands to complete the series, the chakra he already had abundant was more than enough for the technique. In the short instance, he fired off the large wave and let it move forward to overtake the smaller.* - Wed Sep 16 16:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) connected his hands once again as he started on utilizing the two techniques in tandem again. His hands performing the handseals for the Raging Waves technique with particularly incredible ease before sending it forth. The technique shredding across the ocean ahead. Secondly, his hands moved into the Exploding Wave technique, finishing such with some prowess. An even larger wave now moving forward and taking over the area ahead of himself.* - Wed Sep 16 16:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) accessed the techniques once again, purposely switching the order now as he turned, facing the land around himself. His hands entered the handseal input for his Explosive Wave technique, moving through the process rather easily however. Upon completion, the large wave washed forward, covering the ground in front of himself. Soon afterwards, Elon found himself performing a few more handseals before releasing the smaller wave, letting it move across the makeshift pool from the previous technique.* - Wed Sep 16 16:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) turned back to the ocean, figuring it was better to send his techniques off into the water instead. His hands came together once more, easily accessing the Raging Waves technique now as his hands moved from handseal to handseal, completing the technique. After such, he allowed himself to shoot off the technique. Not a moment after, he was performing the Exploding Water Shock Wave handseals, soon releasing that to chase after the initial jutsu.* - Wed Sep 16 17:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) continued to practice his techniques. His hands working to finish the handseals for both, firing each jutsu off in quick succession, one after the other in his attempts. Each wave combining at a certain point considering the power and force behind each and how it caused them to travel.* - Wed Sep 16 17:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) placed his hands together once again, Elon's face growing into a stern look as he kept eyes on the water. He wanted dearly to master these techniques, purely for the focus of going against the enemy known as Zetsumo. It wasn't payback, nor revenge but he knew that he had new allies, and his goals had to align with theirs. Soon, his hands created the handseals and eventually his chakra welled up within. Upon completion, a wave of suiton released, pushing onwards away from hismelf and converging amongst the oceanside.

Without hesitation, he began to input the next set of handseals, keeping what suiton chakra he had leftover within himself. Alongside such, he added on more, practically taking a moment to store an entire ocean within himself. In the next instant, he found himself proceeding to inhale and then exhale, water gushing forth after the initial wave and taking it over. In the distance, it dispersed, mixing with the waters of the ocean.* - Wed Sep 16 17:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) repeated the process once more, letting his hands act as he began to perform the necessary handseals. In the same instance his own chakra was guaranteed ready for the technique. It was almost as if after each use he'd proceed to restore his ammunition with enough chakra for both immediately.  Eventually one wave was released from his mouth. Then he proceeded to release the second, launching it forward to connect with the first.* - Wed Sep 16 18:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) continued on with his practices, letting himself perform the two techniques back to back, using the chakra he continued to hold within. In a short moment, he allowed himself to release a single wave of water in a forward direction. Soon afterwards, he proceeded to launch off an even larger wave to encompass the first. * - Wed Sep 16 18:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) continued to make short work of the techniques, easily performing the handseals as his chakra emained in the form of Suiton for the moment. He was allowing the waves to continue propelling forward from within himself. Each traveling in the same direction as they crossed the ocean ahead of himself.* - Wed Sep 16 18:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) still found himself making use of the techniques, his hands traveling from one seal into the next. He easily completed the first technique, remaining steady with the skills of a veteran at utilizing the technique. Afterwards, his chakra pushed forward, alleviating itself from within his gut and moving out into the ocean as a wide wave.

Secondly, his hands went back to the process of handseals as the water moving outwards veiled them. It was pretty easy to do, even if he'd only recently learned the jutsu. Regardless however, he released the suiton natured chakra and let it move onwards, exitting his reach as it pushed through the ocean.* - Wed Sep 16 18:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) repeated the same process as before, finding it to become a natural routine. He got the feeling his hands were beginning to increase in speed as he did this. His mind figuring that he could possibly perform his techniques with such succesion in combat just as he was now. However, that would be a question for later. At the moment however, he was focused on releasing the waves, and that he did. His eyes watching them both travel along the oceans waters.* - Wed Sep 16 18:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) decided that he was getting too used to the pattern, choosing to let his hands swap between two entirely different sets of handseals. As well as choosing to begin letting his chakra take a chance at switching between elements. First, he completed some handseals, letting doton chakra encompass his body before eventually picking up the chance to dig deep into the ground, moving his position over a bit whilst performing handseals. Once done, he revealed himself and let a single wave move forward from within, his suiton chakra having been prepared mid-movement just like the handseals.* - Wed Sep 16 18:54:17 2015
