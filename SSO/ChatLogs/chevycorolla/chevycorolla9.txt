<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) seemed to find himself on the outskirts of Kirigakure as he accessed the beachside. Without any hesitation, Elon began to initiate a few handseals while his sensory abilities went to work for himself. With ease, he was progressively casting his chakra into his gut, allowing it to take up the form of the suiton nature.

With only a mere push of the chakra forward, he released a single large wave, before turning to the sound of the explosion. A gasp from Elon and he was on his way there, swimming through the earth after a series of handseals and soem chakra.* - Tue Nov  3 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: *Cough* I nominate myself as the new Mizukage -Omit, cause too soon- - Tue Nov  3 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) arrived on the scene as he observed the blazing Mizukage Mansion. Elon had no idea what to do in reality, considering this was a first for him---actually acting that was. However, as he stood there, he proceeded to access a set of handseals while on the spot, proceeding to charge up his chakra as he stood there.

Once he'd completed the necessary handseals, he allowed himself to open his maw, expelling the chakra from within. It pushed on from the gut region directly through his lips as his cheeks puffed outwards from the mass of chakra in the event. Of course however, his wave was directed specifically at the building, attempting to encase the entirety of it.

However, due to how wild the blaze was, he was unsure if he could quell all of the flames, but he hoped for enough to allow entry and exit without much of a problem. Regardless, he'd take a step back after his performance was completed.* - Tue Nov  3 06:39:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) actively accesses his personal sensory technique, applying the Mind's Eye of the Kagura for a better perception over his basic sensory technique. Of course, he wasn't only checking for Kirie's chakra signature, but one that oculd represent the attacker in this situation. He obviously planned out out the enemy in the same isntance if possible.* - Tue Nov  3 06:45:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) turned to look at the group of Shinobi, stepping backwards. Considering how Elon had gone throughout life so far, he figured he was no weere near fit for leadership, and he didn't even want to be considered a canidate. He didn't want to be another Koeki, to put it simple. He was of course trying to avoid the crowd now, even though his entrance was big enough to detail him.* - Tue Nov  3 06:56:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) stood alone on the beaches of Kirigakure once again. After the events of yesterday, the feeling he had was much different, showing a sign of sadness rather that his usual elated attitude. Remaining still as he cast his eyes out across the waters, Elon could do nothing but allow himself to simply bring his hands up together to access a few handseals.

A few motions and eventually he found himself building up a bundle of chakra. As he did so, in his mind he simply thought. 'This is the second time...I can't let it happen a third...For Kana, I must get stronger.' Then a simple grunt was made before his cheeks filled with his chakra.

Expelling this chakra, it easily formed into the water utilized in the technique, bringing itself across the land now as he proceeded to turn. He'd heard the destrcution within the background and allowed himself to carry on from his point, swimming through the earth now as he moved to present himself to the new location of the random attack on Kirigakure.* - Wed Nov  4 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) came to meet the flames that would ensue amongst the hospital of Kirigakure, finding that he was there to stand alone while the troops of the village more than likely dealt with the bandits. However of course, Elon only brought his hands upwards to perform a series of handseals. In his attempts, beads of sweat formed on his forehead. Not out of exhaustion or difficulty, but only because of his nervousness.

Shaking his head, he pushed on though, allowing his chakra to take place in his gut as he accessed his technique. His thoughts going back to his mentors and tutors. Those that he stood in place for now, 'For Noriko...Tethys...Koeki...Kana...All of those before me. I made a promise...' 

With the passing of his thought though, he released the technique, opening his maw to expel the Suiton natured ninjutsu in the direction of the hospital. His only intent to remove the flames from it, assuming that they could assess the damages later afterwards. If he hadn't been stopped beforehand however, he'd turn to face any oncoming forces.* - Wed Nov  4 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: riven you didnt see violet rp last night did you - Wed Nov  4 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) sensed the surge of chakra speeding onwards to his location, finding the introduce of the Fuuton element to be problematic. He had no considerable counters whatsoever, and even then, he was too slow. All he could do was take the strike head on, finding a great deal of damage to his head region, his hearing probably being taken from him by the contact.

Now Elon was in a situation that he'd never been in before. A fight, and therefore he knew nothing of what he could possibly do. He was completely inexperienced and only believed that he could jsut rely on his normal tactics. Using his sensory ability, he turned to face Ortho and brought his hands together, understanding the difference between their skillsets.

Rather than making a direct attack he proceeded to introduce a few handseals before himself, acessing his chakra in relation to the Doton nature before turning the solid ground beneath himself into coarse sand. Elon's only intent to dive deep and tunnel his way from his current position onwards to Ortho's.* - Wed Nov  4 01:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: Ok Violet... ready to take out a giant snake? - Wed Nov  4 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) shifted himself through the area, bringing himself in a swimming motion forward. The intensity of the situation was getting to Elon as he moved onwards. However, it seemed that even with his sensory abilities on hand, he still didn't retain the ability to either counter nor dodge the strike produced by Ortho.

His head didn't even move to look at the attack. An expression of suprise and fear crossing his face as he recieved the damage of the spike. His movement was paused and the flow of chakra he produced for the technique had ceased. His body now suspended in animation underneath the layer of earth while the spikes jutted throug his form.

No real thoughts crossed his mind, other than a single name. The one that remained most important to him over every other person he'd evere met. 'Kana.' The thought bringing him a sense of happiness in his state of shock as his blood leaked from within the body. His durability failing him regardless of how well his body was trained.

As he remained suspended there however, his eyes shut and so did his mouth, and he could do nothing but ooze the sense of failure at his loss in the situation as he believed he'd soon suffocate, and die in a haven he deemed safe. Nature was his homeland and he loved it, only oozing the tiniest sense of respect for Ortho in that regard, glad that Elon would die as one with the Earth.

His chakra, had simply faded.* - Wed Nov  4 01:32:09 2015
