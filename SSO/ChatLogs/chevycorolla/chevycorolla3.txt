<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) allowed himself to stand there for a moment, proceeding to perform a single handseal as he accessed the sensory technique. Within a moment, he was easily scanning the area around himself. Of course however, Elon knew that his range wasn't really quite expansive enough.

With that in mind, he allowed himself to access his more genetic ability. A moment of thought and he found himself proceeding to access a chakra pathway leading directly for his own eyes. This had indeed activated the Mind's Eye of the Kagura. Elon closing his eyes as a flash of brightness took place within his vision. Afterwards, he found himself blinking them open before spying the around. His visage covering a wide expanse.

Without a doubt, he was practically seeing everything of Kirigakure minus the outter region. A deep breathe and Elon simply spoke to Kohaku. "He's definetly not within the walls. They went far for this presentation I guess."

With that, Elon was picking up a set of handseals, allowing himself to access the Hiding Like a Mole tactic before beginning to speed away from the region. He was now moving towards the gates of Kirigakure, planning to cover one of the many exit regions. And should the bridge problem present itself? No problem, Elon could just ride the waves across with safety. Regardless, he was now on the search for Himura. * - Tue Sep 29 00:59:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) entered the area once again, now exitting the ground as he proceeded to reveal himself to those within the area, now exitting the Hiding Like a Mole technique. His body exposing itself to those within the area. Once he stood there, he looked onwards to Kohaku, speaking up once again.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) set himself near the waters, accessing a single technique now as he allowed himself to enact the series of handseals that were proctored to him for the jutsu. Elon's face falling weary as he'd grown somewhat tired of this training. There was no benefit from such, considering he was no combatant, and there was never a need for Elon in this village.

However, he still continued to apply his chakra, letting himself focus upon such as he allowed himself to push out the wave of water that was to be produced by the jutsu. Elon remaining rather still as it flowed forth.* - Tue Sep 29 23:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) allowed himself to access the handseals again, proceeding to pickup on the tactic once more. A moment later and his hands were weaving through the seals necessary. Soon, Elon was allowing himself to charge up a massive amount of chakra, eventually releasing it in a forward front to connect with the lake ahead of himself. * - Wed Sep 30 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) accessed handseals once again now, letting himself find the correct combination before presenting a store of ready chakra to the technique at hand. Within moments, Elon was allowing himself to release a single wave of chakra and let it push forward, carrying out across the lake with its great chakra in the form of suiton.* - Wed Sep 30 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) raised his hands, bringing them together now as he allowed himself to access a set of handseals. His mind was focusing his chakra into the suiton element. With his skill assisting him in the usage of his technique, his hands had easily completed the handseals necessary for the technique with ease. Eventually he found himself expelling a fountain of water from within his mouth, launching it forward into the ocean before himself.* - Thu Oct  1 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) allowed himself to access his handseals once more, allowing his chakra to enter a doton state. In only a few seconds he was shifting into the sandy ground beneath himself, traveling to a new area as he used his sensory ability to broadcast the location of people to himself.* - Thu Oct  1 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) unearthed himself now, looking amongst the same lake from a different angle considering there was no one active for him to converse with at the moment. Soon, he was performing handseals once again, actively focusing his chakra into Suiton as he went along with it. Upon completion of the seals and a buildup of the chakra, Elon was releasing a humongous wave into the waters, making it go short considering the distance from him to the other embankment.* - Thu Oct  1 02:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) allowed himself to access a set of handseals as he began to apply himself to the suiton element, actively pushing forth the product of his chakra with the completion of the handseals. The result simply allowing a massive amount of water to gush forth from within himself and approach the lake in front of himself. Afterwards, he would follow up by expelling the remaining chakra he'd saved in his gut in a small pool nearby.* - Thu Oct  1 05:52:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) allowed himself to find the general area that Koeki had specified, finding the construction crew had already been set within the area. However, as Elon approached he allowed himself to assess the general region, quickly getting to work on trying to find the dimensions of the area for him to layout the region for the arena. His eyes recalling the set map for things. Once done, Elon let himself set back at a focual point.

Marking each point now, Elon simply proceeded to back away from the center point and set himself so that the entire workspace ahead of himself. Performing a few handseals he soon let his chakra within his gut begin to pickup and swell. With the completion of his handseals, Elon allowed himself to release a rather massive wave to cover the ground and remove any obstacles, as well as smooth out the area before himself now for the cement to be layed down.

After clearing out the area before himself, Elon simply raised a single hand, signaling for the construction team to move in and begin layering the area with concrete. Elon allowing himself to assist by moving into each line ahead of the concerete, making sure to apply a suiton ninjutsu to wipe over the area ahead in order to smoothen out the earth layer before him.

Eventually, Elon accessed one of his Doton techniques, more specifically, Hiding Like a Mole in order to tunnel underneath the foundation. His intent merely to check the groundwork and make sure they were spreading the cement evenly across an even ground layer. With each spot that see,ed to be unleveled, he'd reveal himself and speak out to the nearest construction workings, stating, "Add more here."

Exitted the ground now as he looked across the cemented area beforeh im, finding the work done by himself and the construction crew to be rather effective as their conjoined efforts left a well enough layer for combat to take place on. With the concrete set in place, he'd completed his part of the deal, figuring Koeki would spice up the arena with something later on. Turning now, he proceeded onwards to turn in his progress.* - Mon Oct  5 03:42:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) turned his head as he looked upon Tramerus, nodding as he motioned to exit the courtyard. "Come on red."* - Mon Oct  5 03:52:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Aight. - Mon Oct  5 04:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) turned to go find some random stranger that didn't look like a commoner.* - Mon Oct  5 04:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) allowed himself to walk amongst Kirigakure for a bit before arriving amongst the port area. Surely newcomers would be left around here. As Elon came near, he allowed himself to activate his sensory technique and begin peering at the area around himself as he looked onwards. Soon, Elon came across a peculiar character that they had yet to see prior to now.

Approaching, Elon raised arms to them in the form of a welcoming approach. "Welcome to Kirigakure, this is our port district where we carry out our biggest trading industry between the villages." It was a rather rude introduction and entry into a tour but Elon figured it worked, and so did the visitor. Regardless, Elon proceeded to make his own way towards the housing district, having the visitor follow behind himself.

Upon arrival, he guided one arm up to point at the region behind him, simply speaking again. "This is our housing district, home to all of Kirigakure's shinobi and civilians alike." For the most part, this area was self-explanitory so Elon simply brought his mind to think on Hogo Island, guiding the visitor to this part of Kirigakure.

As they came across this part of the village, Elon pointed a finger out across the water to the more than likely, destroyed island. "This is the remains of Hogo Island, former home of Tethys Hogo and Noriko Hogo. Destroyed by a careless genin during a scouting test." A simple sigh came from within and he began to progress onwards to another district, finding this to be a rather vague area coming up next.

Looking upon the gate with its two circles representing who-knows-what, Elon holds a hand out, gesturing to the entirety of the district. "This is one of Kirigakure's many districts, housing those that share various unique abilities. Possibly subject to becoming a clan district soon if anything." He then proceeded to walk along with his visitor, guiding them on a path towards Kirigakure's hospital.

Coming to a stop in front of Kirigakure's hosptial, Elon began to speak once more. "Another thing Kirigakure is famed for, is having the best medics around, even our current Mizukage is renowned for her medical ninjutsu." After stating such, he figured there was no better way to end their interactive tour with the academy, and then back to the docks for an entire round-trip dialogue.

Finally coming to the academy, Elon raised hands upwards and pointed at the massive building. "This is Kirigakure's academy, however, it is also the biggest hangout for shinobi within this village. Whether it be nostalgia, or just a generall great place to hang out is really unknown." And with that, Elon simply gave a nod continued on back to the docks, bringing the visitor back to their beginning destination, considering Elon didn't even know what elese this village had in store.

Once Elon had brought the villager back to their port and waved them off, he sighed, giving off a great smile and a wave before proceeding to take his leave. After doing such, he'd return to the courtyard rather easily, having now completed his mission.* - Mon Oct  5 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Yo, yo, yo. - Mon Oct  5 04:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Mission complete. - Mon Oct  5 04:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Good. - Mon Oct  5 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: Lady Koeki - Mon Oct  5 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) found himself standing at a location cut off from Kirigakure's main society, leavng him at what seemed to be, a home to the homeless. Accessing a few handseals, Elon proceeded to shift his body into the soil which had been refined to be more like a sand now. Eventually, he allowed himself to swim down to a halfway point before letting himself launch directly outwards to reach over the water. Soon, he applied the suimen technique as he came down atop it.

Standing there amongst the water he allowed himself to begin applying his own handseals to access one of his less experienced techniques. With ease, Elon found himself weaving handseals related to the Syrup Trap technique, soon expelling this viscous concoction into the ocean nearby, not really caring for where it went.* - Mon Oct  5 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) continued to access the syrup trap technique, weaving his hands throughout a couple of handseals as he allowed himself to begin focusing his chakra throughout his body. A short strain and it was turning into the suiton element, producing a thick liquid within himself, soon being released from within to connect with the sea beneath himself.* - Mon Oct  5 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) still continues to access the syrup trap technique, pushing out a few handseals before letting his chakra take form within himself. After a few moments, Elon was quite easily producing the liquid and allowing it to be fired directly into the waters beneath himself.* - Mon Oct  5 05:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) continued to access the same ninjutsu, allowing himself to continue to perform quite easily with his handseals. Soon Elon's chakra was welling up within his body and taking the form of the suiton nature before he eventually spit it out, leaving a stick blob to either float or sink, he had no idea if it would do either.

After performing that technique, Elon began to let his hands speed throughout another set of handseals, eventually releasing his chakra from his mouth in a thick haze, effectively creating a mist around his person. It seemed that now, Elon was doubling up on his tactics for use.* - Mon Oct  5 10:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) continued to knead out his chakra into the surrounding area, keeping an active mist around himself. Combined with Kirigakure's natural layer of mist, he was practically invisible amongst the waters. While his eyes remained set forward and his sensory abilities kept him aware, he eventually broke into another series of handseals, soon firing off another Syrup Trap into the waters beneath himself.* - Mon Oct  5 11:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) repeated the process, allowing himself to keep the chakra required for the mist within the air. He proceeded to follow up with another set of handseals, easily performing the Syrup Trap technique. He was actually coming up with these rather easily, eventually shooting out a puddle into the ocean.* - Mon Oct  5 11:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Yo, yo, yo. - Wed Oct  7 17:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: ...Hello... - Wed Oct  7 17:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) allowed himself to remain still for a moment, accessing an innate ability to sense his surroundings. A drain was being placed upon Elon's chakra now but it didn't bother him, considering he had quite the abundance of chakra. As Elon remained still, he began to practice the art of handseals, soon finding it to transform into much more. Within mere moments, Elon allowed his chakra to secerete from between his lips, 

With several handseals now done, Elon allowed himself to apply an element of nature to the chakra, focusing upon the Suiton element. Within a short moment, he found himself proceeding to fill the area around his person with a strong mist. As Elon looked amongst it, he could see clearly throughout it, using his own sensory abilities to allow such.* - Wed Oct  7 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) remained still for a mere moment as he let his vision take to the vast area before himself. Looking onwards, Elon easily took to the wind and allowed his hands to access a series of handseals, easily pushing his access with the technique he had in mind. For a moment, Elon allowed himself to sink into the ground, easily swimming forth from his position to another, eventually taking up a simple pebble and dipping back underneath.

Afterwards, he'd proceeded to ocme back up once again and swim forth from his position until finally pulling up again. With ease, he allowed himself to focus his chakra into the Suiton element now as he completed another set of handseals, eventually releasing a strong current from within himself towards the open air.* - Thu Oct  8 10:19:56 2015
