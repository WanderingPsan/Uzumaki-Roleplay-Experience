<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) proceeded to enter Amegakure with the crew he'd been told to travel with. As Elon looked throughout the small village, he couldn't understand why the mission was so high-ranked, considering there was never any danger whatsoever and normally a mission of this caliber was considerably low on the ranking boards. Regardless, he found no reason to complain, just making sure to keep his sensory abilities in focus now as he looked out amongst the area, searching for any chakra signatures that signified a trap or anything. A simple statement would come from Elon though, as he seemed to settle. "Eh...Seems the same."* - Thu Oct 15 20:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) allows himself to observe Asteroth, finding her presence and chakra signature to be new to him overall. A sense of caution drew over himself as he remained set on the female. All the while, he simply thought to himself, 'Unknown...Possibly dangerous. Gotta be careful." 

Yet, so far she seemed to be harmless, at least to Elon. He just did his best to carry himself as the respectful figure he intended to be, stating a response. "Just a quick delivery."* - Thu Oct 15 20:22:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) cast his vision to Jirun, nodding. The mission was done and he was to return to Kirigakure now. He simply allowed himself to speak a few words however, "Job's done, so no more worries." With that, Elon made a quick 'escape' you could say, trekking on back to Kirigakure immediately, unless stopped of course.* - Thu Oct 15 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) joined Jirun with his return to Kirigakure, finding himself planting foot in a single spot. Seemingly, the same spot he'd always return to whether it be for training purposes or mission purposes. Elon had always felt an attachment to this spot, even if it didn't seem so special. Regardless, he let his eyes set on the Mizukage and gave a slight wave.

"Mission complete, no problems at all."* - Thu Oct 15 20:52:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) raised his hands again, bringing the two together now as he focused his chakra throughout his gut. Only holding it there for now. Meanwhile, his hands went through the motions, accessing the needed handseals for the technique in the same instance of course as he observed the area before himself. With those done, his chakra pushed forth, coming upwards throughout his mouth now, shifting from normal chakra to the Suiton nature. With that, he expelled a wave from within, letting it push forward and wash over the land ahead of himself now. "Similar to the Watergun technique, just expand the width and let it roll on out of ya'."* - Sat Oct 17 00:26:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) finds himself at a loss now, sighing to himself as he thinks about the absence of missions. He understood they weren't exactly everything to do, but they were a source of income and helped support the village. Elon simply began to think about some rather iffy subjects before bringing himself to a slow walk. Eventually his speed increased and he was now walking at a normal pace from the courtyard, moving in the direction of his usual training spot.* - Sat Oct 17 20:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) now found himself being stationed in the usual zone of his training. A sense of doubt and pain ached Elon mentally. He was unsure of how to keep Kirigakure in tact, and definetly unsure of whether or not Kirie could regain the Daimyo's support, considering the state of Kirigakrue as of now. They'd only -just- begun to rebuild the more important features, and a majroity had still remained rubble. A seemingly dark thought passed over Elon's mind, and his chakra seemed to cascade throughout his form. Soon his skin was darkened by the Doton nature. Upon recognizing this, he seemed to calm, expelling the chakra.

Afterwards, Elon let himself nod and bring his hands upwards into a series of handseals. His simple focus on training his ninjutsu techniques for the simple matter of mastering them. Chakra seemed to course throughout him and eventually swell in the gut. With the completion of his handseals, he opened his mouth and expelled a rather large wave of Suiton chakra, sending it directly forward and out into the ocean that rested before his eyes. It was no longer settled once this explosive power came crashing into it of course.* - Sat Oct 17 20:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) continuing with his practices, Elon figure there was no problem in utilizing two techniques together in this training scenario and simply let his Doton chakra course throughout, focusing as an outer-layer of skin for himself. Meanwhile, he let a final source of chakra move into his gut and proceed to swirl around. With this chakra in his gut, he let himself access a set of handseals with his darkened armor over his form. Soon he was releasing yet another large wave into the seas around himself.* - Sat Oct 17 20:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) accessed his chakra once again, planning to enact the same practice. His hands remained covered, sticking to the hardened rock form. Afterwards, he proceeded to let his mind converge on handseals, putting his fingers into the different handseals as another source of chakra focused in his gut. Soon, he was expelling another powerful wave, letting it ripple throughout the ocean.* - Sat Oct 17 21:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) awoke, finding himself at the normal training spot he used. It seemed to Elon that he had no only been training rather hard, but of course, expending all of his time on such. A simple shrug and Elon made one statement.

"Without missions, it's only alright. Ain't nobody ever have a problem with some good ole' nature anyways."

Afterwards, he immediately began to focus chakra throughout his core. Within a few seconds, his skin was beginning to darken from the focus and Doton nature chakra seemed to settle as a layer of skin for him as he remained still. Afterwards, Elon allowed his vission to cascade over his hands now, letting his darkened taijutsu weapons access a few handseals.

Once he'd done such, another source point was found in the bottom of his gut, and it was easily filling with water of course. A point of action and his hands completed the handseal set and opened his maw, pausing only for a bit to cancel a few things. With that, Elon released a rather large wave of water out and across the ocean before himself.* - Mon Oct 19 04:27:56 2015
