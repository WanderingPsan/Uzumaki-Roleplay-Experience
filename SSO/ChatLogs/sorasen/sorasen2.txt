<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gekitai, Kyu'Mc(Sorasen) puts up a block as it seems he couldn't survive this one at all, Ace did try his best but it was a little too much for them at the end of the day, there was no way the duel could have escape death. It was best if Kyu'Mc had listen to Ace and leave the village while he had to change. Now facing death, his body breaks apart leaving the two personalities to have their final words.

Ace sighs and shook his head at Kyu'Mc before adding, "You..You changed over the years though you're still the little pussy I always had to save, you knew what you had to do, fight without depending on me as much but as recently, you started to rest on my shoulders for assistance, I'll give you my thanks for that but for now, I want you to remember this, we're one in a whole, as much as I hated you, I can always forgive so..See you later kid.."

Kyu'Mc reaches out as Ace vanishes away from his sight, everything was going dark before the pain hits, before Kyu'Mc knew it, and his body was running cold as his heart beat stopped. It was clearly too late for him to many a small comment to his partner in crime. All of this could have been avoided if he only listens to what Ace had told him.

"Y-You're right..I'm sorry I never listen to you..But..I..Hope we'll meet..In the afterlife..See you there........."

"Aceeee....."

Drawing his last breathe, he had finally passed on, leaving his empty broken shield behind on this earth.
