<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gekitai, Kyu'Mc(Sorasen) nods, he pulls his hands up as his eyes narrows down on the lad, "Alright, I need to train something so I'll hold back the power.". Of course he didn't want to attack the lad with full force since he wasn't sure how will rounded the medics here are. Quickly moving towards him-Showing a few feet work, he quickly comes to a sudden halt the moment he was almost in front of the lad.

He was about to attack then he heard Ace's voice once again, "Give me control, I'll end this quickly."

Quickly replying with, "No..This is only a spar, nothing serious."

During this little mind conversation, he lifts in the air as a blue aura swirls around both feet. Before you know it, the lad attempts to swiftly strike the fellow into his stomach using his feet. If he was not grabbed or he was able to move fighter than the fellow then his feet would have dropped and allow the other to rise into chin strike. Ace suddenly adds this during this proceed, "Don't fuck up because if you do, I'll be there to take control."* - Thu Oct 22 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gekitai, Kyu'Mc(Sorasen) found himself blocking as he was also being pushed back the lad's water however he knew he wasn't the fastest around, well, not yet anyways so it was certain that he would have find another way out of the water. Ace's laugher echoes through his ears as the voice made a comment and a command, "Getting your ass handled already? HAHAHAHA, just kick the ground and force yourself out you pansy." By merely following what he was told to do, he speedily kicks the ground to the side; he used his chakra from Aura strike and raw strength to much himself out of the current.

Once outside of the water flow, he quickly launch himself forward into a low kick, attempting to spin kick the lad's leg, attempting to knock him down off his feet.* - Thu Oct 22 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gekitai, Kyu'Mc(Sorasen) notice he was going for another round of seals, "Move quick and stop him.", Ace hinted at him. He never failed him that much before so of course he took his advice again. Nippily cutting his assault short, he quickly block the water again with his hands as the lad runs up to attack him- If it wasn't clear already, he was a kick boxer meaning he doesn't need to use his hands at all. 

Switching legs stances, his feet raises above-Since he wanted to attack him head on then might as well he attacks back. With his lad still giving off that blue aura, he quickly tried to out speed the lad's attack by raising his leg upwards into a side kick as if he wanted to kick the fellow's hip while at the same time, trying to send his pulse through-out the lad's side if it hits.* - Thu Oct 22 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gekitai, Kyu'Mc(Sorasen) was able to hit his kick but still wasn't enough to stop his attack as the lad was speared down and now below his foe. At this moment, his will was a little weak-Ace took advantage of this and forcefully switch places with Kyu, putting Kyu in the back to sit and watch him work, "N-No! Ace, don't!". 

His body slowly changed as it seems as if he had grown a little more, his body slowly becomes more muscular and his face matured a little more. With a devilish smile on his face, 'Ace' grabs onto the lad's hand that was holding the Kunai, "Let ask you this, you're able to bypass Kyu's foolish openings but can you really try to force me? Ace to give up? You must be out of your mind.", he said-It was even stranger that his voice sounds different as well, more deep than before. Using his own strength to try and move his hand away, his free hand shoots up with a new speed to attempt and lock onto the male's neck-trying to choke him off of them.

"HAHAHAHAHAHA! THIS IS FUN KYU, SWITCH ME IN MORE OFTEN!"

Ace yells out of pure excitement, at the same time he was choking the lad off of them. Lucky for them, they were able to literally remove him from on top. With a sadist grin, he started to bend the lad's wrist until he realized his opponent had already fainted from the lack of oxygen before he could have even started his rampage. 

"Fuck..This is boring now..Here, take back control, I don't want it anymore."

Accepting the switch leading to his body to return back to its normal state, Kyu was back in control thankfully. He sighs loudly then looks at his hands as if he could already figure this was going to be a long day.* - Thu Oct 22 04:12:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gekitai, Kyu'Mc(Sorasen) using his map and his bird on his shoulders, the quickly hikes through the wasteland since the village was literally empty. Listening to what Ace had to say since he had nothing else better to do, he realized that he was rather close to leaving the area. It was a little shocking for him since he expected to have to travel a great distance. 

"Look at that.."

During his little trip, he found himself surrounded by low level bandits. Since he wasn't in the mood for this, he simply took the bird to wait on him ahead with his map, switches himself out and allows Ace to take control of it. It was pretty clear he didn't care what Ace did to them, all he really cared about was that he would be able to arrive at the next village without having to any addiction injury.

"HAHAHAHA, SEEMS I'LL HAVE SOME FUN HERE? ONE, TWO, THREE? We have Five in total? PLAY WITH ME!"

Ace screams out from pure excited. His legs gave off a blue aura as he quickly rushes towards them without trying to look directly on their feet. With the first kick to the bandit;s chest, he quickly goes into a flip to avoid the other bandit's sword with his leg out to connect the next kick to his chin. During mid- flick, he place his hands on the ground and perform a round table kick to keep them off of him.

"Mmmm, Kyu! I think we might need some leg armor!"

Tossing himself back on his feet, he looks at the group with lustful sadist eyes as if he wanted to rip them all a new one. Kicking the ground into a dash, he quickly jumps in the air into a high jump kick into one of the bandit's chest before quickly switching his foot work into a low kick into the other's chest.

At the same time, he performs the same action over and over to the other set of bandits until he was forced them to withdraw. Certainly Ace wanted to fight them some more but the he also know the trip is worth more thus he sighs and return control to Kyu so he could have finish his trip.* - Thu Oct 22 18:34:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Chaos Commander2015) says: You seem to be having an issue with the fact you might die one day. - Fri Oct 23 02:41:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Gekitai, Kyu'Mc(Sorasen) says: I know everyone has to die one day...Just don't want to speed that up. - Fri Oct 23 02:42:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Let him talk. - Fri Oct 23 02:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gekitai, Kyu'Mc(Sorasen) sighs softly, finally giving Ace what he asked for, they both end up switching places. During the switch, the lad's body grows a little taller at the same time, a little more muscular. His face shows as if he matured over a few seconds while his voice seems a little deeper than before. It was like they were looking on a new man.

"Well then! Look who we have here."

Ace stated with an sadist grin on his face.* - Fri Oct 23 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gekitai, Kyu'Mc(Sorasen) says: Indeed. - Fri Oct 23 02:58:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: And I can take an unauthorize trip to Kumogakure, it's almost like I was born here. - Fri Oct 23 03:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gekitai, Kyu'Mc(Sorasen) says: Really now? What kind of shinobi are you? - Fri Oct 23 03:01:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) says: Perhaps we should teach these people a lesson. - Fri Oct 23 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) says: You teach him, and I'll get split personality here. - Fri Oct 23 03:13:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Meh, killed a rival of mine. - Fri Oct 23 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Ascended to godly hood. - Fri Oct 23 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: The Usual. - Fri Oct 23 03:14:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm. - Fri Oct 23 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I forgot his name, but he started a bar fight before he died. - Fri Oct 23 03:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hm, maybe I should head to Kirigakure. - Fri Oct 23 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: What do you think, Baen? - Fri Oct 23 03:23:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: That's probably where i'm going to be heading to. - Fri Oct 23 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gekitai, Kyu'Mc(Sorasen) suddenly smiled devilish. This was going to be his first time fighting someone without the main personality to interfere. Turning to the fellow, Ace simply walked slowly towards the fall while his hands were crossed, "Let's see how well you stand against me snow white!". Stomping his foot once, a light blue aura gleam. 

Without much warning, he quickly took his time and dash over to the white hair fellow even if he wasn't that fast when it comes to movement speed. Whenever he was in range, the lad would have simply leap into the arm as if he was performing a high jump kick however this was only the beginning.

If his attack lands in the routine he wanted somehow then his little combo would have revealed itself to them.* - Fri Oct 23 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: So what's going on between these two? And Should I stop it? - Fri Oct 23 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Let em fight it out. - Fri Oct 23 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Sure. - Fri Oct 23 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm, Baen you got any useful taijutsu techniques? - Fri Oct 23 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Only for someone such as myself. - Fri Oct 23 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Why you gotta be so boring? - Fri Oct 23 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: You can't learn it. - Fri Oct 23 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: It involves too much shit. - Fri Oct 23 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: You'd die. - Fri Oct 23 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Are you talking about the gates? - Fri Oct 23 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Nope. - Fri Oct 23 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: I'd shit on the gates. - Fri Oct 23 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: So you're pretty weak. - Fri Oct 23 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: I'd say otherwise. - Fri Oct 23 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Top three strongest shinobi alive probably. - Fri Oct 23 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm. - Fri Oct 23 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gekitai, Kyu'Mc(Sorasen) eyes shifts towards the lad-He was still smiling sinfully which was still displaying his murderer's drive. Using range against him? Might be one of the smartest thing he could have done but he was forgetting one more this-He was not fighting Kyu, he was fighting Ace so certainly he would have come up with a re tricks on the way.

Decided that he was not going to use his other technique to free himself since that would have been a waste of chakra, the lad simply attempts to use his raw strength to rip himself out and keep on movement, no matter how slow he was going at the end, "Playing the cat and mouse chase are we?~ Don't want to come fight me like a man?~".* - Fri Oct 23 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gekitai, Kyu'Mc(Sorasen) licks his lip as he realized that the man was keeping his distance no matter how much he tries to call him out, seems a coward is smarter than a forceful shinobi-What a smart fellow indeed. It's going to be a matter of time before he would be able to pick up the pace but for now. He swiftly reaches for his Tanto resting between his back pouch and a Kunai. He already figured that he won't be able to move out of the way since the glue was still on his shoe so far now, let's play.

Using his own attack speed, strength and hopefully the weapons durability keeps up; laughing like a crazy fellow, he tries to deflect as much as he could with only the two weapons yet he figure he couldn't deflect them all, at the very least, save himself from his legs being disable or backly damage.

"Oi, Ace, you're, keep an eye on the amount of chakra you're using, just switching you in is burning us out!-OI! DON'T FUCK UP THE BODY TOO MUCH DAMMIT!", Kyu yells at Ace through mind telepathy-Or something along that line. * - Fri Oct 23 04:23:40 2015
