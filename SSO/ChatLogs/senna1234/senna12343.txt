<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Hm, that sounds like a hard job..Not trying to be Queen of the Obvious. - Tue Sep 29 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) taken by surprise of the working and stressed man, she smiled softly..Now looking back ,she takes a step backwards towards him . "Maybe now you are ready for me to take away all of the stress, yes?" she'd ask, slowly placing both her arms around his neck and shoulders, purple hues at a gaze.* - Tue Sep 29 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) looks around the room "H-here?.." she'd ask, assuming that Erebus knew she was not one to perform in open areas..But she wanted to redeem herself, her feelins were strong over such.* - Tue Sep 29 02:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) followed.* - Tue Sep 29 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) following Erebus, she blushed for a second "You wanted me to do the work, yes?...Just..Lie down and remove your clothes." she tells him, placing one single hand to the center of her chest, a small smile brimming on her face.  * - Tue Sep 29 02:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) coming up behind him, she'd position herself on top of Erebus, or rather, she sat on his knees.. Unzipping her dress, thus revealing her breast, leaning over as she'd push them together, gently she'd begin to tittie fuck the man while his rod was still under the boxers, trying to get his blood flowing before taking it out.

"You like what you see so far?..Lord Erebus?" she'd blush.* - Tue Sep 29 02:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) continuing her job to do as she pleased with her rbeast to his rod, she smiled once again, feeling it harden, she'd reach to take it out. Stroking it with a soft grip, she'd give it a kiss on the tip, teasing him about the blow job, she'd position herself to be on her knees but standing over his hip, her dress lifted and breast out for her to locate where it was.. "Please...Don't look down on me for screaming.." she told him, now lowering herself, lifting one leg up to be on a single foot for her own control, directing the tip of Erebus's rod into her anal area, going in slowly she bites her bottom lip , trying to hold back any screaming..She'd lift up the other knee to be flat on her foot , now in a squating like position with only the tip in, she'd attempt to push herself down on the rest, her inner walls ever so tight , she tried not to clench but failed once and once again..* - Tue Sep 29 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) moaning softly and quietly she opened a single eye and says his name heavily "E-erebus...You're too kind.." she saw that he was putting in effort and not just allowing her to do all the work, she'd spread her legs more, the lube from her own body surviving the two well, allowing for Yumiko to slide inthe rest of his shaft with some hassle and pain but enjoyment to her, once she had gotten him balls deep, pretty much looking like she was sitting on his lap. She began to rotate her hips around , lifting her body up with such motion . Her inner walls fully clenched by her and this being her first time taking it all in her ass. 

"Y-you enjoy-----" cutting herself off from some of the plessure she'd gain from such, the woman placed both hands to the center of his chest, now bouncing her ass up and down on his rod with little hesitation, moaning from such. 

"I'm pleasing master greatly ,yes??" she asked, her hole feeling like it was ripping slowly though .* - Tue Sep 29 02:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Yo-You're doing great.. - Tue Sep 29 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) brimmed a smile of confidence this time, she instead places her hands down on the legs of Erebus, her breast out in the open but he'd have to reach for them, for she was leaning back to gain a momentum as she bounced up and down on his shaft. Moaning at a medium volume she allowd her boobs to jiggle with each  thrust and impact. She could feel her pussy becoming wet , making her stop for that moment.

"You know...My other hole needs love too~" she told him before she'd slowly lift herself up, looking down at his rod to see how hard it had gotten. She felt redeemed that she was able to do anal, now she had to finish up the job, grabbing the shaft, looking to insert it into her wet pussy for her to ride him all the way out, leaning forward , the woman would gently bite Erebus on the neck.* - Tue Sep 29 03:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) bouncing her wet pussy on the mans rod, her nips were taken into grasp by his fingers and hands, she smiled and moaned greatly "AHH!" thrusting in all the force she should and rotating her hips to put him balls deep into her, with her hands now on his shoulders for such, the climax was nearing! 

And it arrived! Her juices bursting out and her head held close with her arms wrapped tightly around his body. Her body being slammed down upon his rod with one final thrust and one hard tighten of her inner walls due to the climax.She blushed brightly , she felt he was to do the same.* - Tue Sep 29 03:35:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) panting, she'd back herself up, giving him a ride once more with a twurl of her hips, she smiled knowing he already came. Lifting herself up, now backing away to rest her head on his waist , licking his rod from the base up.. Thinking to herself <W-what if I do become pregnant someday?..Would my child inherit this poison?..> it was a question she thought of , licking away she opened her mouth to start with sucking off the tip, but moments later she'd put the rest in, sucking away hard, immensely intending to suck whatever remained inside away . "Mmm~" she eyes him as she works.* - Tue Sep 29 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Good girl, good girl. - Tue Sep 29 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) sucking more and more, she'd stroke the rod a few times, it hitting her throats inside she looked to him "Mmm, Mhm~ " happiness can be seen within her eyes, pulling her head up with his cock wet of her saliva , her mouth having some remains of cum inside, she swallowed and began sucking again, sucking as hard as she could ..She was great with Wind so sucking was in her element. * - Tue Sep 29 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) felt the coming of Erebus, the woman tried her best to breath through her nose , feeling his seed go down her throat she couldn't comment on it for her mouth was full at the moment with so much. A light blush would be seen,  and as he came, she tried her best to swallow all of what he had to offer, he'd probbaly feel her throat motioning for such , trying to not choke on his rod from her swallows.* - Tue Sep 29 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) soon gave his rod one strong and final suck to get rid of any remaining cum , she looked at him with her tongue sticking out a bit, showing him what he did to her before she swallowed the last bit "You nearly drowned me~ " she teased, resting her head on his chest after she was caressed.* - Tue Sep 29 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) blushed and cheered "Yay~ " gently she placed a hand on her belly and dreamed of something..Giving Erebus a kind innocent look with her eyes.

"You must be proud..Filling all my holes."* - Tue Sep 29 04:26:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) looking to the child, she slowly nods her head "Yes...I would..Without mercy..As  I was molded to do.." she spoke as if she was back in slave mode ready to torment someone..The woman then tied her hair back into a pony tail.* - Tue Sep 29 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) looking at the boy, she'd reach into her dress , taking out a long hunting knife with jagged ends, walking up to the child , the first step of torture was demostic abuse, so she grabbed him by the hair, thus kneeing him in the face and tossing him down with what ever strength she had before using the hunters knife to pinn him down to the ground, striking and pushing it deep into his arm and the bone of his forearm deep into the ground, the metal clearly gazing each bit slowly..

"We don't talk in the torment room...Only scream." she said with a cold stare in this attempt.

* - Tue Sep 29 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) eventually she reached and leaned down to open her jaws and bite into the childs shoulder near his neck, this was no game she played, while she bit, she'd taste the blood before she'd ripp away , chewing what ever flesh she managed to bite off in front of the child face, all while digging her two fingers into the wound she'd create..Soon after, she'd just simply devour such flesh, much like her old slave master, her diet had humans meat involved so she took this torment thing to her advantage.. "I've missed the taste of young flesh being my only option of lunch." chuckling lightly, the womans bite brought more than pain, but her bodily vemon seeping into the child, causing him to suffer more to a non lethal amounth.* - Tue Sep 29 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) looking at the boy with a cold stare , she would take up a secondary knife from her stash as she said "How does it feel to be both tortured and eaten alive?" she took his arm, with a small grin and lick of her teeth she bit down into his muscles AFTER she'd pierce that arm with the thick knife as if it were a Sui-Kbob . 

Not too long after, she pulled out the taser, activating it upon the iron of the knife to send such charges towards the boys body, mainly the bone being the target. While she chews away on the skin she ripped away. She casually smiled at the child.

"You see...I'm just so hungry..Just..So...Sooo hungry..If you were someone else, I'd devour you, starting with the face..Those cute little ears..And eventually, the muscles that makes you function." she giggles "But I wont..Because you asked nicely to torture you." she states, some of her old self coming back to her, now standing up to not only kick the pinned child but stomp his very stomach with the heel of her foot, over and over.* - Tue Sep 29 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) stomping on the child over and over again, she soon cocked her foot back to swing her leg and kick him POW right in the kisser, kicking the temple of his head before tossing all her weight down upon him with the very knee of hers .

Standing she;d begin to focus on her Kaze Boru which she'd deliver strong punches to the boys stomach.* - Tue Sep 29 06:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) soon came to a compplete stop at what she was doing after one final bite of food from the child, biting into his ribcage once lshe lifted his shirt a bit. She chuckled lightly and told him "Well that's all I can do for tonight..You better rest and heal up.." she told him, if he couldnt renegrate then she'd use her novice healing on him instead if he desired.* - Tue Sep 29 06:34:14 2015
