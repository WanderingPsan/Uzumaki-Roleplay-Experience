<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) seeing that it was her time to shine once again with the efforts she had made over these years, the woman tore off her sleeves which covered her arms while taking out a kunai for herself to use AFTER she began to perform a few or mor ehand signs for the great breakthrough in order to summon out a large gust of powerful winds towards the direction of Zetsumo! She soon began to make her way towards him! She had poison so she knew that using that at a long distance wouldn't work.* - Mon Sep 14 20:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Well that was dumb. - Mon Sep 14 21:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) simply she TRIED to leap over the mud wave in the attempts of her feats to try and dash towards Zetsumo, <I gotta get closer> she took out one poison bomb from her pouch to throw at him , if the tigers manage to dodge as well if she was lucky, then it'd be best for the group.. She knew her wind barrier jutus would not work but it was a shot!* - Mon Sep 14 21:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) could sense the change of flow within his chakra but could she avoid it again? She began to perform a few hand signs for later, to use a basic jutsu of her own before trying to counter the mud with her own Great breakthrough jutsu once more, this time tossing in some poison bombs which would explode midway to make her own verson of the poison fog ! Hoping it'd be enough to stop and get by the mud to make way towards Zetsumo! Trying to make an opening for her  team mate.* - Mon Sep 14 21:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) soon began to make her way at Zetsumo with what little speed she had to offer, her weakness was long range fighting, she knew she needed to close in if her poison was going to work! So she allowed for her team mate to do some of the work , meanwhile she performed hand signs for a later jutsu.* - Mon Sep 14 22:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) continued to try closing in on Zetsumo <I am trying to support her the best I can..I'm useless..." she thought while trying to whip out her kunai in silency.* - Mon Sep 14 22:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) coming in from behind she attempted to use her kunai to try and stab Zetsumo in the legs while looking to try and inject her poison from the source of her own being into them in her own attempt to slow him down for Amai to bring in her fair share of abilities.. <Please! Let this work!> she thought!* - Mon Sep 14 22:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks: How much fun it would be if I took control of zets. - Mon Sep 14 22:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) using her sensory prowess she attempted to atlease halve the power of the kick or try deflecting it, assuming it'd be possible but certainly not at her level of power, it was still a chance though she could not miss out on! So releasing the grip of her kunai not only gave away her advantage but gained one as well, using the wind around her in this attempt to send the kunai flying towards the lower section of Zetsumo's body, aiming for the abdonomal area. (excuse my spelling) Yumiko was trying to buy time but was kicked in the process.* - Mon Sep 14 22:45:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: I'm fine..I need to learn a new jutsu of wind or poison somehow anyway. - Wed Sep 16 22:56:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: I've only seen her the other night. - Wed Sep 16 22:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Okay. - Wed Sep 16 23:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: What jutsu lord Zetsumo? - Wed Sep 16 23:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Oh. You've awakened. - Wed Sep 16 23:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: You are a close-ranged battler, yes? - Wed Sep 16 23:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Mhm. - Wed Sep 16 23:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Yes. - Wed Sep 16 23:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: So what kind of wind flow is this.. - Wed Sep 16 23:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: So what form of wind is this? - Wed Sep 16 23:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: I told you already. Chakra Flow, you're going to be taugh to make a sphere of wind in your hand. - Wed Sep 16 23:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: To improve your close ranged ability. - Wed Sep 16 23:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Ah I see, this will be great then. - Wed Sep 16 23:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: I could use them on my kunai. - Wed Sep 16 23:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: ----Oh on my hand. - Wed Sep 16 23:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) immediately she began to concetrate her chakra into a single point, but she was not too sure how she could do this without harming herself, knowing that wind was meant to slice things, she relied heavily on her natural chakra control and her wind elemental training that she was well trained with but not too well trained on.. So seeing that her close range fighting can range from taijutsu to kenjutsu, she just remained focus on the abilities at work for her Nintai tactics..Looking at Zetsumo ,failing this initial attempt. But this not stopping her from her very next attempt to coat her hand in not a complete verson but just the idea of what she understood..She knew that from there if she managed to do this, she might even learn more from Zetsumo.* - Wed Sep 16 23:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) nodding her head "yes, I am fully understanding to the common properties of Fuuton.." she listens to what he had to say, taking note to these instructions that were given to her before she continued on .

Even so, she paid much attention to what he did, and she followed through his example with her mind focused on the goal "Mhm, oxygen and chakra shaping into a blade, forming a type of manipulation in the process ,yes?" she asked while attempting to do such once more, making sure she was not wasting any efforts but to succeed in what Zetsumo was trying to teach her.* - Thu Sep 17 00:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) looking to her master she widens her eyes the moment she was hit by the sheer power of his wind elemental ability! This causing her to be sent flying back of course by the amounth of force used, and the sudden attack catching her off guard, nearly made her enter the berserker state of spirit, but she learned what a proper wind blast felt like..She was not going to let her weakness of fear get to her again today, she needed to show more bravery like she did during the war.* - Thu Sep 17 00:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) nodding her head she answered to him "Y-yes my lord..I'll give it my best." she told him while standing up now in the attempts to concetrate her chakra towards her hand in order to obtain the very same effect that the one Zetsumo had used upon her. So now as she continued to focus on this jutsu, she decided that two hands were better than one since she was new to this, lookig to create some form of wind much like Zetsumo did.* - Thu Sep 17 01:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) nodding head head once again as she maintains her true and key focus about on the abilities of this very jutsu. Molding it and even formulating it from time and time again when she may of failed at using it. Though two hands were better than one, who could say that the drain wouldn't be even higher for that fact? It was a chance of success and failure with this girl but it was not like she was not intending to continue trying.

<I can keep up with them if I try, I am smart and I can learn just about anything..> thinking the positive while Zetsumo stood before her.  The young Sarutobi kept a great head on her shoulder, her family, her clan were known for their skill in Konoha or so she'd like to believe..She would keep such a name strong and continue training with her beliefs of becoming better for a higher purpose.. With this in mind she tried to create different ways of which she could utilize such a jutsu...

<Keep the quantity down and create the quality by shaping the oxygen and compressing it torwards the very center of my hand as if it were one whole unit focused upon a single point..> she thought to herself, perhaps even in the future she could make up her own versons of this very skill but with poison in the mix. She pants from being fatigue though, sometimes her chakra contorl was not enough for she lacked chakra and did not have the high reserves that the others did..

With her, talent relied in skill and mind, though she had little to work with, she had her poisons and he rclose combat abilities. So it was not like she was going to make herself stop any time soon. Many times she attempted this up until the point of finalization, the grande finale of which made her skill with this jutsu come to be what it should!* - Thu Sep 17 01:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) forming a small smile she replied "I plan to continue learning all I can about wind and poison..I can heal ,but only because of Zenaki's books and experiments that it is possible..If I keep learning from you, will I achieve the honor of making you proud? Lord Zetsumo?" she asked with a bow tot hank him for the time he took to teach her.* - Thu Sep 17 01:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Yes, I understand. - Thu Sep 17 01:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: And I will continue in aiming to do so. - Thu Sep 17 01:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Excellent. You may take a recess or continue to practice the technique, I suppose. - Thu Sep 17 01:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: I will continue to train this one ability after recess. - Thu Sep 17 01:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: My chakra is limited. - Thu Sep 17 01:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) standing around as she recovers her chakra, she soon began to train her abilities on the arts and skill of the Kaze Boru of which she was hoping to get down a bit more easily before Zetsuo had returned, though she was but a novice in her control of chakra, she looked forward to impressing her master.* - Thu Sep 17 01:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) looking at Zetsumo ,she answered with all honesty "Because, you've both spared my life, and even though you've made me a slave..You've also given my happiness...And I..I hated and feared you..But I can not remember why..Even so, I am loyal because of the word you have kept..And all that has been accomplished..I am forever thankful." she said with a small smile.* - Thu Sep 17 02:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) lightly she laughed before saying "I bring flowers around to the villagers when I am not being a slave or experiment..Many believe that I am a sex slave, but I am not..Mistress Zenaki gives me freedom from time to time, and I forbid myself to ever betray such trust.. I like to see those I work with smile..And those around us who support us happy at the least.." sorta explains why she has been trying so hard to get Zetsumo to smile but that was becoming futile.. 

"When living, one should not live without a form of happiness. It's what I made myself believe during the five-six years I've spent with the Zetsumo people." turning towards the man to examine the death filled eyes he possessed. "Even Death smiled once, when he met life." she claims. * - Thu Sep 17 02:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Do you happen to have exploding water shockwave, Lord Zetsumo? - Thu Sep 17 02:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Negative. - Thu Sep 17 02:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Ah, I can teach it then. - Thu Sep 17 02:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Perhaps later. - Thu Sep 17 02:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Thu Sep 17 02:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I can drop you a scroll. - Thu Sep 17 02:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: I'd probably check to see if you're any good with it. - Thu Sep 17 02:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I did say during interrogations that I had met Tethys outside of Amegakure in my training spot . . . Which was already pretty close to the village. He wanted to give me this jutsu . . . I figured I might as well and take advantage of that. Didn't change my answer to him though. - Thu Sep 17 02:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He did want me to leave . . . I refused. - Thu Sep 17 02:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Amusing. Indeed, however. This would be a potent skill to add to my own repetoire. I will accept you offering. - Thu Sep 17 02:41:04 2015
