  The sisters made their way to the arena, as they got there she turned around to look at her sister with an eyebrow arched. "Yeah yeah yeah. I am willing to learn, anything to defend myself... and potentially kill someone if they try to bother me... or something... maybe rip their heads out.. like that bird that I ripped its head off back then..." her eyes started to get a bit creepy while she did a ripping a head motion with her hands. But that wasn't the point as of now, Mirai being a good sister wanted to help her youngest sister, Madelyn how to defend herself properly. 

 Now that Madelyn knew how to use the Byakugan, it was time for somethin else.. something more advanced, right? Mhm. "Alright! Let's just get this over with, sis." Madelyn took a few steps back before closing her eyes and reopening them. "BYAKUGAN!" there were veins popping out of her eyes, while staring at her oldest sister. They were twins, yes, but Mirai was born first and then Madelyn like a minute after.* - Sat Oct 17 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) | Noticed her sister walking towards her, seeing her chakra from her Byakugan, it gave her access to do so. But that just meant that Madelyn herself had to use her Byakugan to strike one of her tenketsu's. "Ugh. I don't want to do it but whatever, if you insist why not?!" Madelyn closed her eyes before sending a palm heel strike towards her sister. If successful, she would try to hit her point's in-order to get technique going on. * - Sat Oct 17 21:49:00 2015

"If you dare to touch me, give me a wedgie.... I will destroy..... your soul." Madelyn spoke in a very creepy way, she took a few steps back and walked out of the arena. * - Sat Oct 17 22:33:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) gasped, feeling the arm over her shoulder. She turned around, smacking his hand away before taking a few steps back. "Y-You better not do that again..... I will... do what I said...." her eyes widened, accidently bumping into Tetsumi. Turning around. "DON'T TOUCH ME!" she yelled at the poor teenager, whom was Madelyn's fault by the way. The crazy girl turned around and continued her walk. * - Sat Oct 17 22:36:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) looked around, all of them were talking at her....it was confusing her.. one of yelling, the other one was trying to stop her and the other one called her a bitch. Madelyn placed both of her hands on her head before falling down to her knees, smacking her head on her own. "Leave me alone, LEAVE ME ALONE. LEAVE ME ALONE!" she yelled pulling her hair out while staring at the sand. The only one who could stop her was her sister, whom was AFK.* - Sat Oct 17 22:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Tch, what is this now? Someone hold her still. I can handle this. - Sat Oct 17 22:49:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: But..It can't be helped, I know how it was for me. Things made it worse when people attacked, despised my very existence. - Sat Oct 17 23:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: ...Fucking...this won't make things better. It'll just worsen em'. - Sat Oct 17 23:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) | This is the reason why she never wanted to come back to the village, her sister was crazy popular and had all these friends.. who were very mean to her and she didn't know how else to react to it! Madelyn continued to slap herself while listening to all those words that the others were saying. Listening to Tetsumi as he got closer, Madelyn looked up before crawling away from them. Madelyn has never had this type of people speaking to her, all at once.. they couldn't help her but somehow it calmed her down. 

 "I...I just want to be alone, I deserve being alone.. m-my sister... is disappointed in me.... she never loved me... my parents never loved me.. I was all alone...." her voice slowly breaking off into tears, standing up from the sand with her logs wobbling a bit. Madelyn turned around to face the others, her hair covering her face as if she was some type of looking grudge ghost or someshit. Cracking her neck, she spoke calmly but in a low voice. "I just... want to be alone..."


Madelyn was used to it, her family didn't want her.. it was the reason why she arrived at this time. She was in a mental hospital for godsakes. * - Sat Oct 17 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) shook her head, grabbing her head while hitting herself, slapping herself before staring at the others. They were trying to calm them down but it wasn't really working. She knew what they wanted.. and it was probably to just be friends with her because of her sister. They were friends with her sister, but probably felt bad for Madelyn. That was something that she didn't want... no one liked to be around Madelyn, so why pretend to be her friend because of her sister? That wasn't something good.

 "N-No! I don't ... I deserve to be alone...." she started to cry slapping herself once again. Madelyn slowly looked up at Tetsumi, noticing his hand, she reached for it as if going to grab it but slapped it away. Didn't attack him, just slapped his hand away. "Please let me go.. I don't want friends.. I never had friends so why start now? You guys all just probably.. P-PROBABLY WANT TO KILL ME!"* - Sun Oct 18 00:43:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Relax. You don't need to take action. Going to let you go, but chill. - Sun Oct 18 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: If I don't take action, she'll keep hitting herself. - Sun Oct 18 00:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Maybe this'll stop her from hitting herself also.. - Sun Oct 18 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I'll take the abuse, it'll be worth it in the end. - Sun Oct 18 00:54:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: What. . You're interested in me? - Sun Oct 18 01:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) | "I..I just think that I deserve to just be... dead..." 

 Madelyn started to cry a bit more, looking at Tetsumi as he got closer to her, his arms wrapped around the girl as he started to hug her. She let him do that but didn't really hug him back. A second passed, she pushed him away, not really trying to hurt him or anything but there was nothing else for the girl to do, all she was doing is to cry. Sniffling and listening to those around her, Madelyn ran her fingers through her hair, cuffing a string of her hair behind her ear before speaking calmy. 

 "I-I'm..... Madelyn..." she backed away from them before scratching her arm, blood started to slowly draw on her arm because of how hard she was doing it. "I.. hurt myself to calm down..."* - Sun Oct 18 01:18:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) noticed Tetsumi doig his work with the iron sand, she took a few steps back, shaking her head as if not wanting to do anything with the guy but he wasn't going to hurt her.. they said they weren't going to hurt her. And if they were going to help her around, then she will need all the help she could get.  Though, she did notice the sculpture that was made out of iron sand. Madelyn got closer to Tetsumi reaching out for his gift to hold. 

 It was the sweetest thing someone has done for her.. it was -- well the only thing that someone has done for her or given to her! "T-Thank you.....I like it , hahaha." she completely forgot about her arms being all blooded but focused more on the sculpture and then her eyes going back to stare at Tetsumi. "Thank you..... I... will promise......to be friends with you all."* - Sun Oct 18 01:49:39 2015
