He looked down at his holsters, checking for his weapons, all of em were there except for his kunai. It didn't matter though. It might have been possible that they wouldn't get attacked.

As the four moved on to the village, known as Kumogakure. It wasn't that much of a long way just a few days away for them to actually be in the village.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyric(BoyVaporeon) | As the four continued their travel to head towards the Kumo village, they didn't expect to be taking so long for them to go to the village. It was going to be interesting, especially when it was Lyric's first time ever going outside of the village to do a mission with his fellow comrades. If anything, they had to be prepared for what was coming. Knowing Lyric he wasn't that prepared or anything.. he prefered to talk to those who want to fight them, reason with them but instead he'll have to fight in order to protect their guy, the blacksmith.

Lyric and the others continued their walk to the village, that was when they stumbled into a few rogues. "Shit...."  he bit his bottom lips, taking a few steps back trying to run away but instead he was caught in the battle. The rogue quickly rushed towards Lyric with two kunais on his hand. "Shit... shit.." Lyric tried to out-run him but instead fell down, spraining his wrist. [1st roll]

"AAAGH!!" yelled the feminine shinobi, looking towards the rogue that was about to slice him with his Kunai but Lyric was kick enough to kick the rogue down, making him fall on the ground. Lyric quickly stood up from the ground, taking a few steps back to see his wrist being sprained and it was hurting like a bitch too. The others had their own problems to attend too, but Lyric didn't really know what else to do. This was his first real fight, actually doing something.

Lyric closed his eyes, before opening them again, focusing his chakra as he took out a few strings. Thus, attaching the shuriken on the end of the string to manipulate it with his one hand, the other was hurt badly. Lyric waved his hand around the rogue, attempting to slice him with the shurikens in hand. "Come on!" this was a first thing to Lyric to do.. especially when that Hideki guy, was the one who teached him.

The Rogue was quick enough to dodge a few of the shurikens but that didn't stop Lyric from trying to get him. Though, the rogue was quick enough to send a kick towards the feminine shinobi, sending Lyric flying backwards, rolling on the ground as he sprainted his other wrist. [2nd roll]

Lyric yelped in pain, slowly standing up from the ground to see both of his wrists sprained. He wanted to cry but instead held it in. Turning his head to see the others already taking care of their own fights. Lyric looked at his opponent, he was far more stronger than the others. The Rogue quickly made a few handseals, making a fireball as he shotted straight towards Lyric.

"AGH!"

The feminine shinobi quickly rolled to the side, avoiding the fire. "C-Can you guys help me out?!" Lyric yelled at his comrades hopefully they would be able to help him. The rogue laughed, quickly running towards Lyric attempting to send a straight punch towards the shinobi, but Lyric was quick enough to send a knee to the gut. But the Rogue was very durable that he smacked the feminine shinobi, sending him straight to the ground.

His comrades would have to help him, or else Lyric would be dead. * - Sat Sep 26 21:03:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyric(BoyVaporeon) was carried like a damn doll, but thankfully to Lyric they actually knew what to do. "Ugh, just let me down!" the feminine shinobi spoke, letting himself down before turning his head to look at the two tourists. "Alright..... so they are lovers and now we need to take them.. to look around the village, great. Sure." Lyric nodded his head, towards the two tourists before speaking once again. "It'll be a quick, tour, no worries brother." he smiled at his older brother, patting his back before turning around to walk away, motioning the tourists to follow him.
 
"Okay, so this will be simple as baking a peanut butter pie. We just need to take them around, perhaps showing them the important parts of the village and BOOM!"

He threw his hands in the air, turning around to face his brother before sending a punch towards his chest, which it wouldn't do anything because his brother's chest was pretty muscular and Lyric's fist weren't very heavy or whatever. "So, where should we go too now?"* - Wed Sep 30 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyric(BoyVaporeon) | "Alright. THIS WAY!!" yelled Lyric pointing downwards to the restaurant as they started to walk towards the square of the village. "This is where people mostly hang out. You know? This is the statue of the first Hokage... and let me tell you something, I heard that he wasn't the best either." he shrugged his shoulders before continuing to the west. The clothing store, the favorite store for Lyric. "This is the clothing store. Trust me.. girl. You would love to come here, they have so many cute stufff.~" 

Lyric giggled, continuing to walk with the tourists behind him, hopefully his brother would be walking with him too. If not, well then Maloth was being a mean brother not helping out Lyric. "Alright. It is my brother's turn now." he nodded before turning around to look at Maloth with his arms crossed over his chest. 

"Alright, Maloth. Your turn to guide them to the mansion, just to see how it looks and all. That is the most important place to go too in this village. I think."* - Wed Sep 30 21:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyric(BoyVaporeon) | "Wait.. what?" giggled as her brother was showing the tourists around the village. It was pretty funny to see him doing something that he doesn't really do, all he does is fight. Though, it was nice to see him doing something new rather than always fighting. "Alright! So, now that you did that to the tourists. We can go ahead and continue our mission."

Lyric was now taking over, turning to the tourists to follow him over to the hospital. "This.. lady and gentleman. Is the hospital, where most medical shinobis come to learn how to use their techniques and what not. And you know, the whole hospital things they do it here. It's pretty close to a beautiful lake, down south." 

And with that, it ends their tour. "Annnd there you have it.~ This is the most beautiful village to stay. Just the whole... you know... it would be nice to have a few people around. Bu-- nevermind. Oh and we have a spa too with a water spring. Jacuzzi and what not. So yeah!" the feminine shinobi threw his hands up, before placing both of them on his hips. "That concludes today's tour. I hope you guys have a nice stay and mhm."

Lyric turned to his brother, grabbing him by the vest and pulling him away from the tourists. "You seriously need to learn how to talk to people." he said slapping his brother's arm before crossing his arms, rolled his eyes towards his oldest brother. "So, what should we do now?"* - Thu Oct  1 00:05:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyric(BoyVaporeon) | His brother was indeed a very good fighter by taijutsu, though that didn't stop him from actually showing off his skills in-front of his baby brother. Lyric was amazed by his skills. 

"Alright! That's enough ...." he skipped over to the woods that were on the ground. He grabbed the woods, picking one by one up before making his way towards his brother to give him the heavy lifting, since that's what he liked to do right? "Alright. We should take this back to the village and then we will be done with the mission!"
