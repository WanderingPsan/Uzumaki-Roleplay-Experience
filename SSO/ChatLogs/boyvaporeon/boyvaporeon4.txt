<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) was lifted up by the platform made of iron, her eyes widening because it was such a cool technique that Tetsumi did. "WOAH! I always wanted to learn how to fly!" she laughed while staring at Tetsumi with a bright smile forming on her face, something that she hasn't been doing for the past few days. Thanks to Tetsumi, finally, did that for her. As they finally landed ontop of a house, the platform goingback to its gourd, she turned around to look at Tetsumi with her eyes widened still.

"This is where you usually come to meditate? SO COOL! I'm glad I met you, Tetsumi. You make me happy and is not that annoying like some people around here." Madelyn promised her sister to not be so mean to others, she was going to do it but even if she wasn't there was no way for her to be mean to Tetsumi. He helped her. Staring into the clouds, Madelyn playfully elbowed Tetsumi. "First me? What do you want me to say? ask me anything, haha."* - Mon Oct 19 20:43:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) | There was something about his stare that made her obviously very nervous.. she didn't really know what to do or -- well act. This was her first time to be speaking to someone close other than her sister and 'family'. As she was playfully nudged back, her cheeks turned pink from the blush. "Hahaha. Sorry sorry, sheesh." she giggled, folding her arms over her chest before getting serious, he spoke about his family being killed... it wasn't such a good feeling either.

"I'm sorry... about your family....I just... I didn't really know that I was going to meet someone like myself. I felt like an outsider, my sister may care about me now but she didn't in the past, neither did my parents. They took me to some mental hospital... and thought that I was crazy. I'm not crazy.... I just.. I need help...." Madelyn spoke with her voice slowly breaking as if going to cry but held it all in. Though, her heart couldn't stop beating, what he said.. made her very very happy. It made her belong somewhere. "T-Thank you so much..... for taking me here and for being so nice to me!" she said, walking closer to Tetsumi, attempting to wrap her arm around his neck to give him a hug! * - Mon Oct 19 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) | "There's something about you... that .. attracts me so much...." 

She blushed slightly as the two held closely to each-other before feeling his lips pressing against her forehead. Madelyn smiled hugging him tighter, not wanting to let him go, but she decided to.. make the first move right? Yeah! "I've fallen for you too...." she whispered back at him before her head leaned forward closely to Tetsumi, attempting to give him a kiss on the lips. If allowed, both of their lips meeting with each-other, it was something very very new to her so she didn't really know how to do it.. and it was her first kiss after all! * - Mon Oct 19 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) pulled away from the kiss, smiling at Tetsumi before kissing his cheek to hug him tighter while whispering; "I like you a lot and I have fallen for you. You showed me that.. I can still change! And please, never leave me." Madelyn said while hugging him tighter, kissing his neck before burying her face on it, tears started to slowly come out of her eyes, why? Because she was happy! Yeah, she was jealous of her sister having a boyfriend... Madelyn always wondered when someone was going to like her for who she is... and she did find someone! Someone who understands her.

"Never leave me.."* - Mon Oct 19 21:23:24 2015

I .. tried to kill a little girl... and I ended up hurting some others... and I almost got myself killed. D-Don't worry! I am doing my best to not be like that anymore!" Madelyn smiled at Tetsumi, but the smile was a nervous one... just because she didn't want him to think of her as some psycho. "I also like pain, it's something that calms me down.. so most of the time I am either stabbing myself or something."* - Mon Oct 19 22:38:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) | "Oh? Not a spider? Aww, good. I don't like spiders..." 

She giggled to herselfas the two were now lifted up by the platform iron and going far away from the village. Madelyn didn't know what was happening exactly but whatever it was.. it wasn't that good, especially when they had to leave the village for the others not to see it. Now, arriving to their destination, where is the second place where Tetsumi usually goes at to relax. Madelyn got off the platform while staring at Tetsumi raising an eyebrow. "What's wrong...?"

Madelyn stared at him for a second before noticing his whole... chakra changing. His body was changing, everything.. he was a monster. Her eyes widened, covering her mouth to not yell loudly but... her love that she had for Tetsumi was stronger than that. "No....." she shook her head, taking a few steps closer to Tetsumi, attempting to reach for his monstrous right arm. 

"I'm not... leaving you. This may be the true you but I won't leave you. You are... my love... and wether... you turn into this.. or not, I don't care! I won't leave you. I think, it is actually pretty cool. And I am happy... that you showed me the real you.." she nodded, a few tears coming out of her eyes before wrapping her arms around him to hug him tightly!* - Mon Oct 19 23:22:01 2015
