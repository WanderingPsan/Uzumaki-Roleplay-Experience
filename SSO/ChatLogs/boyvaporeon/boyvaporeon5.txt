<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) let go of Tetsumi's ear, turning around to stare into his eyes with her own, but anger was totally all over her face. "I... cannot believe you stood me up! Y-You are a very very .... stood up person! You stood up your girlfriend and I was waiting for you at that spot for hours!!" she pouted cutely while yelling at her boyfriend like the crazy girlfriend that she is. Madelyn reached for his hand, attempting to bend one finger to the back, just to cause a bit of pain on his fingers. 

 "I thought you left me!! I thought I was never ever going to see you again!!!" Madelyn started to cry while bending his finger, if allowed that is. It just wasn't anger, but she felt sadness because of her worried emotions.* - Tue Oct 20 21:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) | Actually knew that the Iron-sand would protect him but she didn't really say anything as the matter. She wiepd her tears away, feeling his free hand wrapped around her waist, getting pulled closer, Madelyn wrapped her arms around Tetsumi's neck to pull him closer to her lips, as they both kissed passionately. 
  Pulling away from the kiss, Madelyn sniffled. "I'm sorry.... I just don't know what I would have done if you left me... I don't think I would've been the same... I love you, Tetsumi. And I don't want to be alone anymore..... but... maybe if you leave again, I can come with you? You know, I can help!" she nodded before kissing him once again on the lips and then laying her head on his shoulder while hugging him tightly, the love for him that she had.. it was endless, Madelyn whispered.* - Tue Oct 20 21:25:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) | "Yes, I am sure about the pain.. you know I want it..." she bit her bottom lips, feeling her body being pushed and turned around as her back was arched and her ass popping out. 

  Madelyn blushed slightly, wondering what Tetsumi was going to do but she didn't question him or anything.. he was the man. Since Madelyn was wearing a skirt, he could see a bit of her short pants, she had on short pants because like some women walking around with skirts and just panties on, revealing their stuff. Madelyn wasn't like that. 

-WHACK-

 Then suddenly the whip hit her with enough force to not just make her wince in pain, no no she loved the pain. But enough to make her moan Tetsumi's name. Madelyn rose her skirt up while turned around giving a nod to Tetsumi. "Again..~" she took a few deep breaths while biting her bottom lips, loving this. * - Tue Oct 20 22:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) bit her bottom lips, loving the pain that her lover was causing her.

"God, I love you so much."* - Tue Oct 20 22:34:40 2015
