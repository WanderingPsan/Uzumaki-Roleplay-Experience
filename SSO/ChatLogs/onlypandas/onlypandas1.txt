Of course it was not completely eye wrenching being they were doing it with the covers. She tilted her head, and asked "Can I play the game too?!" and before she knew it, she got a mouthful from her Mom, screaming at her to get out and she'd be dealt with later.* - Thu Dec 10 08:10:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: The fact that Sunagakure remains to be your only fighting force. - Thu Dec 10 09:11:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shina(Only Pandas) clasped her hands together and focused upon the water. She began kneading her two energys together, drawing out her elemental energy. Although she had little control of her reserves, or much training on her jutsu she was able to pull and tug on the water to draw out another doppleganger of her!* - Thu Dec 10 15:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shina(Only Pandas) had contorted her fingers to shape the bird handseal whilst she sat on the ground, legs crossed one over the other in a rather tranquil pose. Undisturbed while she was mixing her life energy with the water before her. The girl made the waves shift back and forth and even controlled the water up a little with a few more seals. It was noticeable that there were strange wet patches around her.

Immediately her ears perked up someone called out to her in such a meekish tone. The young gir; lean back and stare at the boy; blinking for a moment as she stared with a neutral face.  Quickly he lips picked up into a smile, and an almost mocking giggle.

"Hiyaaaaa.~"* - Thu Dec 10 16:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shina(Only Pandas) seemed to make an indifferent face for a moment. A bothering thought sent to the back of her mind as she gave Kai a patient smile. The girl looked over, then back to him as he seemed to stutter some more. A tap of her foot as she gave him ample time to fumble through his words. 

Where she would normally joke around with people; the nervous display from the boy was unsettling enough that she was not able to bring herself to mess with his head. "Uhhh ... Yeah, I guess.." she murmurs while staring down at the water. Seemingly she ignored the Hokage's announcement with a lack of a headband on her could give him an idle hint.* - Thu Dec 10 16:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shina(Only Pandas) shook her head at the strange boy, she had never encountered such a person before. Only has she seen a person like him in one of her childish movies, the kind that needed to gain more courage. But, she had little to no clue how to go about that. "Uhhh ... You're not...!" she retorts while going through her seals again she mixed her energy to summon the water, making it raise up and dance a little to no avail.* - Thu Dec 10 17:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shina(Only Pandas) tried not to show how annoyed she was how sheepish he was. With a lesson in empathy she tried to give some understanding to the boy with very patient smiles, and deep breaths. The water shaped up into a head and then what looked like shoulders before falling down, whatever she was doing it seemed to fail!

"Yeahs. Uhm ... I'm Shina. Nice to meet you."* - Thu Dec 10 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shina(Only Pandas) was happy to see more progress to warming up to the boy. A few handseals more as she listened into him while focusing on kneading her life energy, and bringing out her affinity. "Closer look? Sure. Why not ... Just don't tell anybody I can do this, though.." she asked while making the water rise with less chakra then she'd normally put into the jutsu. The water shaped into a a partial person as it rises up, but it did not have enough chakra to sustain itself and fell back in .* - Thu Dec 10 17:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shina(Only Pandas) shifted her lips a little in confusion, and distrust. "Uhh .. No, I suck at this stuff .." she murmurs while forming another set of hand movements, ending on the bird when she did. She'd raise up a little and pour a little more into it making a person rise up and this time reach out for Kai in an attempt to splash him in the face...!* - Thu Dec 10 17:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shina(Only Pandas) giggled out deviously as he made him slightly wet mostly in the face and hair, but probably his clothing to a point too. Then she realized how worried he was, and when the apology came she just felt terrible down inside, a pit in her stomach eating away.

"H-Hey .. It was just a little prank. All in good fun, okay?"* - Thu Dec 10 17:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shina(Only Pandas) was use to this whole water training thing, so she came prepared with a white towel held out to him to clean up as he needed. She'd add a small giggle while feeling the mood lighten. The water continued to rise as she got increasing a little more frusrated with how hard the jutsu. Before she knew it she had shaped an entire perso out in water, but it was unable to keep her form before falling apart.

"Ahh ... So hard to control it with less chakra ..."* - Thu Dec 10 18:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shina(Only Pandas) nodded a little. "Still not right ... I wanna use less chakra..." she murmurs while grabbing the towel and sitting it between them .. Just incase a water exploded on them or something. "One more .." she murmurs while trying to do the jutsu proper ...!* - Thu Dec 10 18:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shina(Only Pandas) nodded as she was egged on for another try it seemed, she clasped her hands together and moved her hands through precise movements, kneading her energy into the water as she added a bit more it slowly rise up and shape into a person this time it condonsed and shaped into her. A successful Water Clone with less chakra.

"Ahh! I did it!" she beams.* - Thu Dec 10 18:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shina(Only Pandas) sighed a little as she slowly pushed up onto her feet. "Ahh .. Stuff like this can be pretty taxing on your head ..." she murmurs. While raising up onto her feet she'd move around the Mizu Bunshin as it seemed to do to her bidding. "Wowee! I did it, I did it!" the two cry out in unison. Truly it was amazin'* - Thu Dec 10 18:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shina(Only Pandas) crossed her fingers as she focused on the chakra, it was enough to cancel the bunshin as she murmured. "Kai ..." and within moment all of it fell apart and it returned to the water from once it came.

"I suppose. I was taught Ninjutsu to defend myself... I just suck at it."* - Thu Dec 10 18:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shina(Only Pandas) let out a small "Pshhh .." in reponse, not entirely agreeing with his words. "Still suck at it ..." she murmurs while picking up.

"Welp. I'm hungry and stuff. Don't know about you."* - Thu Dec 10 18:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shina(Only Pandas) says: Yeah! Let's. - Thu Dec 10 18:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: R-Ramen..? - Thu Dec 10 18:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shina(Only Pandas) says: Uhhhhhhhhh .. - Thu Dec 10 18:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shina(Only Pandas) says: I don't like ramen, but they have other stuff I can eat at that shop. - Thu Dec 10 18:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shina(Only Pandas) says: If you want ramen. - Thu Dec 10 18:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mm...No...We can g-go some place e-else... - Thu Dec 10 18:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shina(Only Pandas) says: They have good dumplings and stuff, so I don't miiiind.  - Thu Dec 10 18:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shina(Only Pandas) made som strange faces as she looked down at the ramen she decided to look at the Menu. She opted for a kids meal of sorts, to expand out they offered other things. A hamburger, and decent amount of french fries would be done in a few minutes time.

She'd tap on the bottom of the ketchup bottle and set aside a puddle to dip into...!

Casually she'd begin munching upon them. Om nom nom.* - Thu Dec 10 19:00:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shina(Only Pandas) did the thing where she made the handseals and kneaded the chakra up. Drawing out her affinity for water, she'd so focus her energy into the water while holding the bird hnadseal. As she did the water began to wiggle and raise as she attempted to shape it into a person!* - Fri Dec 11 10:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shina(Only Pandas) clasped her hands together and focused upon the water once again. The girl began kneading her two energys together, drawing out her elemental energy with vigor. She was slowly getting better at her jutsu making her an expert at her level! Shina pulled on the water and made it rise up into the air, trying to condonse it's shape into a human look-a-like of herself.* - Fri Dec 11 10:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shina(Only Pandas) allowed the water to drop as she let out a sigh, the training had gotten tougher each time to perfectly control her chakra with this technique. The girl raised up the water and began to bring it together, attempting to form herself with the water. The head was easy with this little chakra, but the body .. Not so much ..!* - Fri Dec 11 11:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shina(Only Pandas) held her hand on the bird seal once again, the water churned as she focused and raised up at her command for another attempt. The waves brought together were moulded into a person as much as possible, before falling apart..!* - Fri Dec 11 11:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shina(Only Pandas) sighed a little when it all fell apart, saddening it was to see such failure before her. Kai's words donned upon her as she focused in her chakra with a few handseals, ending on the brid as she churned the water and made it raise up. With great focus she attempted to form a whole water clone with more control...!* - Fri Dec 11 11:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shina(Only Pandas) clapped her hands together as she carefully made a few handseals and motioned her chakra into the water. As she tried to gather it up she poured a little less than normal, as she was trying to improve with this jutsu, and get it to expert levels as she was taught.* - Fri Dec 11 11:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shina(Only Pandas) felt the jutsu failing as the water rippled and fell apart, returning to the larger pond from where it came. It frusrated her so, but she was determined enough to keep going with her training. Another few seals, and a cast later she went right back to shaping more clones.* - Fri Dec 11 11:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shina(Only Pandas) was already starting to feel better with the jutsu! She successfully made a clone rise up out of the little chakra she was putting out, already approching good levels of this jutsu. She continued to do try and work with it, controling her clone around as she tried another cast.* - Fri Dec 11 11:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shina(Only Pandas) continued her work with her jutsu, carefully doing moving her chakra into the water to sprout it upwards into another clone, the water held her shape before condonsing and looking like her. Then she relased both of it allowing it to return to the water...!* - Fri Dec 11 11:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shina(Only Pandas) huffed a little as she was sure she could get better. "C'mon Shina ..." she murmurs to herself while she brought up her hands to center. She went through the quick seals required for the jutsu and used her elemental chakra proper while attempting to better herself with control of Mizu Bunshin..!* - Fri Dec 11 12:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shina(Only Pandas) looked over her shoulder, than around her. She was sorta hoping someone would come by again, but that seemed to not be the case. She was also trying to be a little secretive about her training. Another few sets of handseals and she went straight back too it.* - Fri Dec 11 12:11:15 2015
