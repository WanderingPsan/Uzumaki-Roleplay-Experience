<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [That is true.]
<br><font color=green>*Kunsaku, Damien(Prince Robin) says: (I will make a Blind character
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [You would have to, realistically.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I have to make Head Contact )
<br><font color=green>*Kunsaku, Damien(Prince Robin) says: (to troll the Genjutsu users
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Head contact?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I mean, I'm going for the blind fighting passive.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [What?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I don't target anything other than the brain )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [To target the brain with your eyes..]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [You'd have to look into their eyes.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Yea, make it realistic.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Well, that's where my stopping comes along )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Because, the only path to the brain are the optics.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [True.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Chain Clones is a way to do that )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [There's another thing.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I can sacrifice them to make them stuck )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Like their neck then their chest )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [If you're going up against a physically strong person.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [They'll bust through the chains.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( No )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( My chains are unbreakable ICly )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Lol. )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Wut?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [No, they're not.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Admins can't approve of something like that.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( They are. Read the jutsu )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Because, it doesn't allow for a defense.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( It does. )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I just can't tell you why xD 
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( You'd have to figure it out yourselfs )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [No, if you can't break them, there is no defense.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Trust me, theres an easy way. )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I mean, since it's just an illusion.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I won't give you hints though )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I'd just use Kai to get rid of them.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Or, you know.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Out run them.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( You can't use Kai on them )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Well you can )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( But )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( You won't know it's a Genjutsu )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [...]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Yeah I would.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( My Illusions are invisible )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [*sigh*]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( My chains aren't Genjutsu )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Then they're breakable.]
<br><font color=green>*Kunsaku, Damien(Prince Robin) says: (Illusions aren't illusions if they're invisible though
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( After the clone, it transforms into Ninjutsu xD )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Everything in the physical realm is breakable.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Oh really?]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [My caln would totally beat that then :3]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [And, I could just..]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [You know.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [clan*]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Nope. )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [*substitution*]
<br><font color=green>*Kunsaku, Damien(Prince Robin) says: (Anywho
<br><font color=green>*Kunsaku, Damien(Prince Robin) says: (I'm logging for the night
<br><font color=green>*Kunsaku, Damien(Prince Robin) says: (I'll see you guys later
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Guys okay. Who wants to OOC have a discussion on the fighting style with me? )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [But, Raito's chakra absorbing would beat my new fighting style.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [:'(]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [:3]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I'm totally going to do it then.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Chakra obs- Omg lol )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Good thing I'll have two other styles to rely on.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( My jutsu is a chakra observers too )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I'm going to have that good clan.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Bro. Do you want to read my scroll? )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Sure.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Nope. lmao )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( It contains my weaknesses xD )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Eh.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( In the very bottom )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [But, I need to get some weights.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Work on my mach speed and my strength perks.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [But yeah, those 'chain clones', I'd be able to beat them.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( How do train x3? )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I RP.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [A lot.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Oh okay Raito. )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Like.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [AFter I get the weights.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I'm going to RP sparring.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [With someone.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Physically.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Me? :( )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [So, that erm...what is that thing?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [It would have to be 100% taijutsu for my stuff to work.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Zakku train me pls )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Where you look into the person's eyes.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Am genin...u am Jounin... )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I don't have to look into a person eyes )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [And, I'm going to persuade the admins to let me get up to B-rank nin/gen.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( That's optional )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Since, atm.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Then what must you do?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I can only get up to C-rank.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [With up to A-rank Tai.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Although, I think my new fighting style might be S..]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Since it combines ninjutsu and taijutsu.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I can look into a persons eyes...or stab them with my chain and get some blood....I can force you to look into my eyes...
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Dude, before the fight. You won't even know who I am or what I can do )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I would be looking at your eyes regardless )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I'm your comrade, but okay. :o]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( And my skill allows me to keep it all hidden )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [It's not like we're fighting or anything.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I'm saying as if it was an enemy xD )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [And, if so, if it was ninjutsu, I could tell, if they allow it atleast.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( That's why you need to train me...so I can ya'know...get stronger )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I don't play this game much...and when I do...it usually shuts down... So I need help )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Because, I'd also have a Dojutsu, a very basic one, but Dojutsu at that.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I wouldn't want a doujutsu.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [People would covet my eyes.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [You know what..]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [It's useless without my clan, trust me.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I should get a transplanted sharingan.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [lol]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [It's only really basic stuff.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [That'll eliminate my mach speed tunnel vision.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( My doujutsu is passive....They always stay the same...so no one would know it's doujutsu unless they got into my mind and saw it through my eyes... )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( It's just look like Genjutsu )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( And they will be doing Kai and it won't work...because it's not genjutsu )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( lol )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I'd know if it was genjutsu or not with my Dojutsu.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [If I get this thing approved.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Well, it would be a passive too, I think.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( So you're gonna make a jutsu that will go against your comrade? Okay lol )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Nope, I had this in mind before I made.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I -was- going to do this in Sunagakure, but then it got destroyed.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I was going to incorporate sand into the fighting, but since I'm not, I'll just 'up' chakra-absorption a bit.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I used to be a sand manip.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [At one point in the distant past.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I was a wind user along with it.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I made an S-Rank.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Sand Tornado.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( It's just that you don't understand.....My doujutsu....is literly like..undetectable...You know that jutsu people used to find Special eyes? It wouldn't work against me...because it literly is a normal eye....it's my blood that is making it do all that weird stuff...It's like aids...if I put my blood into yours...Then in a matter of days...You would have the same eyes xD )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( You would have the same eyes as me )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I'll brb.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( mk )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I'm saying, it's not the eyes I'm talking about.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Gotta ask that first..]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Mkay )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [It's the chain-clones, or practically most ninjutsu.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Sand Tornado as an S? )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Chain-Clones aren't all about sticking to the enemy and stopping them xD )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [What od they do then?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Chain Clones has 2 parts to it. )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [do*[
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( They can touch an enemy and stick and stop them )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Mhm?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Or...It can dissapear and turn into chains that only I or any other La Mare member can pick up lol )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Okay, brb.
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Yea, I'm saying, if that was the case, chakra-absorption would be able to beat that.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( So maybe someone will come and try and pick it up, then while they struggle....Bang...I hit them with a chain spear to the back )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I wouldn't need to pick it up.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Okay, how would chakra absorpation beat it? )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Simple, I have an idea for my clan's ability.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [To turn most things into chakra, and absorb it.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [MOST things.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Tell me... You have said it's an idea for you clan this entire time e.e )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Ohhhhhhhhhhh )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Yeah that would probably work )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Yea, you see what I'm getting at right?]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Oh, and I also tailored it a bit while we were talking to aid your clan's abilities.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Only if when you turn it into chakra my chakra spikes would absorb most if not all of it )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [So we could be a team.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Copying and pasting from my scroll )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( -Chain Absorbers: Chakra Healing/D Rank - Allows the user to plant small chain spikes on solid surfaces and allow them to absorb chakra from any living source that would allow them to increase the users Chakra uses so that they would have no limit to how much chakra they can use up. Only cooldown limits. Up to 5 can be planted. If they are planted on the user they have to peirced on their skin so that the chakra can travel into their chakra stream. If this is enabled then the chakra gain would increase by 2 from the normal planted spikes. )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: if they are planted on the user they have to peirced on their skin so that the chakra can travel into their chakra stream. If this is enabled then the chakra gain would increase by 2 from the normal planted spikes.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( (: )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Lol. I'd be able to absorb from those chains, so we'd just be sucking off each other.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [It'd basically stay the same.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( The chains chakra isn't stored....it's instantly consumed by me )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Sorry, spears.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( The chains aren't items...they are apart of me
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Copying from my Scroll again )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Yea, and I can absorb on contact.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [If you have an extension from your body, I'd be able to absorb probably.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( -Chain Bones - Enables the user to form chains around both their forearms. Allowing them to make chains come out their palms and use them as chain whips, Chain Swords or completely release a chain to manually use a chain as a Whip or a Staff(Stiffened).  )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [You have money on you?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Only 20 yen lol )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [How much does a scroll cost?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I don't think admins would allow you to instantly absorb someone just like that, sorry. )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [What?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( That's too OP )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [You can do it, no?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Me? No. )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Then what can you do?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Have you not been paying attention this entire time? )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I don't mean absorb you, I mean absorb your chakra.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( You won't be able to find me )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Copying from scroll )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Your spears would be in me.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [And they're an extension from your body.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Very unlikely that my spears can contain that much chakra )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Only about .5 of my chakra will be used on them lol )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [They're sucking chakra from me.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( And if you take them I can just take out more )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [So I'd just suck the chakra back.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( My Chakra would be infinite...The only one that would suffer is you. )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I wouldn't suffer.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( You would. )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [How so?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Tell me how you physically can suck in chakra )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Absorbing chakra off the back while doing nothing, is too OP and admins wouldn't allow that either )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [On contact, I'd be able to absorb chakra, like that Path of Pein, only less efficient.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [No, it's not doing anything.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Then my clones would simply get you )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Done. )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [How?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Cause while you're focused on me or my Spirit Clone...A Chain clone would be attacking you from one side, the other in the other direction and I would be blinding you so you can't see any of them. )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [...]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( You would probably absorb 1 or maybe 2 but then the rest would give direct hits )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( And Fatal ones at that. )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Aren't they illusions?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Only the spirit ones...But you wouldn't be able to tell if they are or not. )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( They all look -exactly- the same. )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Only way you can see the difference is if you were a sensory type )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I already said, I'd get a passive that would act as a semi-sharingan.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Which you wouldn't x3 )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Only full possesive Sharingan can see through Genjutsu xD )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Actually, not completely true.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( It is true. )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [No, I've seen it many wipes before this one.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Then they have been doing it wrong....Only lvl3 sharingan can see through Gen jutsu. 
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [...No?]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Sasuke could've seen through genjutsu with stage two.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( He couldn't )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Yes, he could have.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Anyone can guess if something is Genjutsu )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Stage one is enhanced reflexes.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I.E. Bunshin no Jutsu.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Stage two, enhanced reflexes and the ability to see through genjutsu.
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [He saw through them at the chunin exam.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [And, at that time, he had stage two.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( If you say so. )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [It is.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Stage  Three, epic reflexes, ability to see through genjutsu and cast genjutsu with the eyes.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Alright. )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Here's what I was talking about earlier )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [And, since I'm chakra-absorption based, I'd have to focus on chakra.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( -Chain Defence: Defence Technique/A Ranked - A Jutsu that surrounds the user with an unimpeneterable chain shield that disallows any physical harm to the user. Elemental or other specific jutsus -can- harm the user regardless of if the jutsu is enabled or not. )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( lol )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Oh, I wouldn't physically fight.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [That would be my weakness.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( That wasn't for you )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I know.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( That was for Zakku )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I'm just saying, my clan would be VERY inefficient with Taijutsu.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Eh, I can find a way around it.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Plus, I've got the body perk for a reason.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I'd punch like a little school girl :p]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I'm built to take damage.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [More so than you guys.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I know balance, trust me.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Oh, and Amy. I have two fatal weaknesses.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Don't tell me )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [One, I'd just told you.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [The other, well..]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I won't give you any hints to that.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [HOWEVER, if I was somehow Genius like I was before, then I'd have one weakness.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Doesn't matter...Not interested. )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I was a Hyuuga genius once.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [And became the Hokage, at the age of 16.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [It was all IC.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Because the old Hokage died, and I was the second strongest, so...]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [lol]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I was Kage level at 15 once.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [But, I was a Jinchu..]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [So..I had an advantage I guess.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Done writing in my scroll )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Huh?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I was fixing some stuff...grammar..etc
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: Do any of you want to train with me..?
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: I'm contemplating at the moment.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: I need to find a way to increase my speed..
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: Train...?
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: You can carry me on your back while climbing a mountain?
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: I'm not even a ninja.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Heavier.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: I'm already quite fast.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: Carry me and..uh..this man?
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: What?
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Uh, still not enough..
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: I wouldn't even agree!
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: That's insane.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: You can rip out a buliding from the floor and put it on your back as you carry two trucks filled with sand on each foot
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( omit )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [LOL]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: More..
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [omit]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: I can give you more~
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Omit..ew.. )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [It's only wrong if you think it that way.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Woah, wasn't expecting that.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( -scratches head- I'm used to late night chats with my bf )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( lol )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Usually perverted conversations )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [You dirty, dirty, dirty person.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( And yugioh )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I love Yugioh!]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Wow really? )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Of course.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Do you have any decks on DN or DMG? )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Nope.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I played in a tournament once.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( DN = Dueling Netw- Okay I'll link you to it )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [It was fun.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( http://www.duelingnetwork.com/ )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Make an account and when you're in the lobby...tell me so I can guide you onto what to do )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: Hmm..
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: How about I chain some boulders onto your limbs?
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: I wouldn't be able to pick them up..so..You'd have to put the near you...after that I can just stick your arms and legs onto some boulders...and you can go and climb a mountain while your upside down...
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Them* )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: Seems good?
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: Are you insane? Why would you expect to him to handle such a large workload?
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: He'd die trying.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: Well, i'm not forcing him...it's an option..
<br><font color=teal>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) whispers: I just want to see what he says..
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Too bad I can't read minds.. lol )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( That'd be cool )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: Well Zakku...how 'bout it?
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Hmm.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Took you awhile lol )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: That might work.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ...huh?
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: But, that's going more toward my strength aspect than my speed..
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: I wanted to develop my speed before my strength.
<br><font color=yellow>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) glared at Zakku in shock,"Uh...I guess you can try running up the mountain then..?*
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: That would develop chakra control more so than speed.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: Hm...then you can run on normal ground with boulders then?
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Now, we could chain the boulders to my legs...
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: Fifty thousand laps around the village, aye?
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: But, eventually the boulders would erode from the friction to the ground.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: I was thinking about a hundred thousand, but you're right.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: I better start out light.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ....wow
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: Uhm....
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: ...You're going to kill yourself, I swear.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: I specialize in taijutsu.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ..Alright..I suppose...Lead us to a mountain so we can break the rocks
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: If I can't overwhelm my opponents, what's the point?
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: Let's go then..?
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Hold on.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Let me set up my computer to burn another dis.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Do you think I'd even be able to do that?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [The boulder thing, I mean, how much do they weigh?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I was thinking a boulder the size of the average car )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Hm.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Is it possible?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I mean, how much do you think Rock Lee's weights were?]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Oh, do you guys remember Yoroi?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Yeah.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [The guy Sasuke pwned in the Prelims, right
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: ?]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [The guy Sasuke fought in the Chunin exams. I'd wanna' be more like him, but advance.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [advanced*]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [At Genin level, I'd wanna' be like him.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Just that simple technique, which over time, develops.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Rock Lee's weights.. weights 1 ton )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Each weighed 1 ton )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( or 500kg each )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [You sure?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Hm, with the speed perk, would I be Rock Lee fast?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Or faster?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [The average boulder weighs..]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [150 pounds per cubic foot.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Well.. )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [So, a boulder that is 8 cubic feet.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( You'd probably be like 13 year old rock lee )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Eh, I think I'd be the equivalent of Gai.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Nope. Remember this is only speed.... )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Gai is around Monsterous Speed )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Yeah, I know.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [There are only two speed perks.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( There is? )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Speed and Mach Speed.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Then your the rock lee one )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Mach Speed is considered Kage level.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Gai is able to be Kai, just there's a few people infront x3 )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I believe Speed would differentiate between ranks.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Kage* )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: Well let's get going 
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Speed for Jounin > Speed for Genin]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: One moment.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Duh )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Well maybe. )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [So, we have to find a boulder roughly the size of..]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( There are mountains up there ^ )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [a fridge.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Raito, you there broski?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( You can punch the mountain, and large boulders will come down...we'll rp from there )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I don't have the strength perk O.o]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Oh, I'm here.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I was just reading some manga.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Come RP with us!]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [M'kay.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Alright, let's go
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Wait for Amy..]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Oh, Zakku]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Yo?]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Do you have any money?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Like 30 yen, why do you ask?]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Well, my hope was to buy a scroll with some sponsorship.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I already have 35.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [How much do they cost, anyway?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Perfect.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Now, we need to find a boulder..
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: So, here you go MrIncredible..
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Something about the size of..
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: A bed.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: Then break it
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: ...A boulder, the size of a bed?
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Yes
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: Are you both insane?
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: I'll be over here so that nothing falls on me...
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Hmm..
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: Me? 
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Do you think I could..
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: I can't even carry twenty pounds..
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: I'm not sure if I want to watch a man -die-.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [LOL]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: I'm not going to die.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: I'm a Jounin for a reason.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: I got here by taking risks you know.
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: Oh, a Jounin you are?
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: Well, I'll just have to wait and see then.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: When you get the boulders down, I'll fix them up so I can attatch them to you
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Perhaps I could use a fire technique to..
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: No..
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I got it.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I'll rp seeing a boulder the perfect size, running up, and pushing it off.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( You can do that. I'll wait down here for my que )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I'm gonna kick the boulder off.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Using this.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Oops.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Wrong one.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( o-o wut? )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( no rp? )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [lol]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I'm typing one.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( k )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [It's gonna be sort of kinda long.]
<br><font color=yellow>*Zakku(Zakku) stared up at the mountain, attempting to spot something that would work for his endeavors.  It took him a while, but eventually he found something.  It was perched on a ledge around one hundred feet from the ground, seemingly waiting for him to come take it.  Smirking, he focused chakra into his feet and stepped on to the mountain. 

He began scaling the mountain, quickly coming up to the ledge.  The boulder was pretty impressive, slightly larger than the average bed, and it just so happened to be in a spherical shape, better for mobility.  He did a few stretches, attempting to get limber before pushing it off.  Feeling himself loosen up, he stopped.

Standing a few feet away, he charged toward the massive rock at full speed.  At last moment, he jumped up, aiming a kick toward the center of the rock, yelling, "DYNAMIC ENTRY!!"  It was more than enough, and the rock flew off the edge and began plummeting towards the ground.*
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Good enough?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Ohsht )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( reading )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [You guys gonna RP trying to run away or something? or watching?]
<br><font color=yellow>*Raito(LigerSlash) sat down on the dampened grass, his moist hair drooping in his face, slightly covering his visage. The soil was now turning into mulch under his pants. Unattentive to the dirt adhering to him, he watched, his hands planted on either side of him. He waited to see the capabilities of such a man, a Jounin of his village. 

He waited impatiently as the man looked for a rock perfect for his 'training', Raito would rather call it suicide. He yawned, looking nonchalant though he was thinking, "This man, he'll die...a ninja is powerful, but not that powerful. I'm not sure if I could actually see death, be involved in a man's self-destruction." Raito's gaze never stopped until the man's exclaimation and jump-kick surprised him enough to make him blink. As he opened his eyes, he saw the boulder that the man had been eyeing falling to the ground, helplessly waiting to murder the man, he thought.*
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Not yet, wait for mine.. )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [LOL]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [My god, that was good.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Nice one Raito.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Just funny.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [So, would you guys say Sandstone is heavier than just your average rock?]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Huh?]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I'm not sure...]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I've never actually 'felt' sandstone in my life, to be honest.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [For the sake of making this realistic.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [We'll say the boulder is taller than me.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Alright.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Hm, how do you find volume on a sphere?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [4/3pi * diameter?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Or something.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Volume is equal to its length, height and width multiplied.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Simple.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [But, it's a sphere, so hold on.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Oh, right.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [4/3pi*r^3]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Alright, let's say..]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Okay.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [It's radius is 4 feet.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Making it 8 feet tall and 8 feet wide.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Let me calc.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [What about its density?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [For the weight, we'll use..]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [100 pounds to cubic foot.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [No no no.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [50.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Alright then...]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Damn, that's large.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [13.4k pounds.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [..I don't think I'm strong enough to move that.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [:O]
<br><font color=yellow>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) was sitting on the floor while Zakku was focusing on getting a boulder fit for training down to the ground. Amy was staring at the rain fall down and heard everything that Zakku said up to where he yelled out,'Dynamic Entry'. Amy didn't know what that was but she thought it was a way for him to influence himself and gather spiritual strength. She heard as the kick hit the rock and began to fall near Amy and Raiton,"You'd better move.." Amy softly said as she stood up and again swatted some dirt off herself.<br>
Amy began to walk a few inches to the side and again sat down. She stared at the rain fall down and focused on the boulder pummel down. Once the huge rock hit the floor, it slightly ricocheted a few centimeters away from Amy. She leant to the side of it and rested her head on it. Everything was precise and she knew what everything was going to happen from all the sound.<br>
Amy stood up with the support of the boulder and looked up,"Hey Zakku...Get down here.." She waited for him to get back down and focused on starting. Asoon as he was down, she approached the middle of the rock and Zakku,"Okay.." Amy grabbed her forearm...sort of looking as if she was pinching it and pulled away from it, as her pinch slid away onto mid-air, a black chain began to form, almost as if the chain itself was in her arm. She kept pulling on it until there was enough for her to use. She stuck one end of the chain to the boulder, completely sticking to it and consealing the entire form. Making it unbreakable. Amy then approched Zakku and got down to her knee's...She grabbed Zakku's ankle and tightly squeezed it, eventually letting go. Amy got up and the chain was now attatched to both Zakku and the Boulder,"Ready to go, Zakku."*
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Oh fail )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Thought it was HTML too )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( mk )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Hm, I've never been chained to a boulder.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: I can take it off whenever you want.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: Just becareful not to hurt yourself.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [We'll just say my boulder weights 4000 pounds.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [That seem reasonable?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( For when I heard the Boulder fall )]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( No lol )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Then, how much should it weigh?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( A boulder the size of a bed? At max 800kg )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [1.6k pounds?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Yep )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Nah./
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [That's what I got too.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( If you want you can ICly go get more )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [It'll weigh more.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [If it weighs..]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( You'd think so...but you'd be surprised )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I looked it up.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [120 pounds per cubic foot.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( It really depends on what type of rock this..lol )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Let's go with a light rock.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [It's 6ft in diameter.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [So.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [It'll weigh around 6k pounds.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Just for the sake of keeping the RP realistic, we'll go with 1 ton.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [That good?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( That's not possible...but okay lol )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [What's not possible?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [1 ton is like, 400 pounds more than what you suggested.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( -that- )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( 1 ton is 2000lbs )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [What?  Walking with a boulder?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( You're running with it o-o )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [LOL]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( You said 50,000 laps )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I was joking about 50k laps.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I'm only going to do sprints with it.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Then you better tell me ICly )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Hmm..
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: I think I'll start off with some sprints.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Perhaps..
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: Sprints?
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Yes.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: Sure, go ahead.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: It's your training.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: A full-speed run for about fifty meters, turn around, repeat.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: But uh..
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: The boulder doesn't have brakes.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Can you make it so that..
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: It's chained to the mountain and can only go fifty meters east or west?
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: So it won't tear my legs off when I stop and it keeps going..
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: Uhm...
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: For that...You'd have to be ontop of the mountain...
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Hm.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Ah well.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: The top is pretty flat...so I could center it in the middle.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: And...The Mountain is huge..so...
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: I'll just stop the boulder in it's tracks.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: Yeah 50 meters in both directions woudl be possible.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: ..Or try.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: You sure?
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Yeah.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: How much do you think it weighs?
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Probably a ton.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ...Okay...well try lifting it.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Do you think I could even lift a ton?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Well, we're talking about the Naruto Universe here.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Naruto in Sage mode threw a rhino about 200 feet in the air.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Typical Rhino weighs..1.3k pounds.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [O>O]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [My bad.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Typical rhino weights about 2 tons..]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Yeah...I searched it up too. )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Sage Mode Naruto is already in Kage Level strength xD )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [So, we'll say that I can actual pick it up.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( RP it. )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [But, I'm splitting the weight in half and I'm not throwing it up?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( You're just grabbing it and lifting it up...then slowly putting it down )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( lol )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( 1 rep )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( ICly )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( RP it. )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [How would I make it stay on my hands?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Chakra control?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Like.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Put my hands on the side, and channel chakra into my hands to make em' stick.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Then pick up?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( No. Just do it raw lmao )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Death Lift it I guess )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [lol, alright.]
<br><font color=yellow>*Zakku(Zakku) looked at the rock chained to his ankles and thought, "Man, I haven't done heavy lifting in a while.  But, for the sake of training, I guess it's worth a try."  Walking toward it, he smirked, he was certain that he'd be able to pick it up, probably.  It was basically a matter of trial and error since he'd never lifted a boulder before.

Standing in front the rock, he squatted down and placed his hands in reasonable locations for a dead lift.  Slowly, he began to stand up while trying to adjust to the weight of the rock.  It wasn't too hard, but it still required much effort on his part.  He kept rising, until eventually, he was standing straight up with the boulder in his hands.

Pushing some chakra into the boulder, he made his hands stick to it so that he didn't drop it.  Now came the hard part.  Using pure arm strength, he started to lift the boulder above his head.  It was gradual, but eventually, he was holding the boulder completely above his head.   He looked at the two who had accompanied him and said, "Wow, I wasn't sure that I could do it." 

Feeling his arms began to weaken, he released his chakra, and tossed the boulder about two feet from where he was standing.  Raising his arm, he wiped the small amount of sweat that had accumulated on his forehead.*
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [There, I lifted a boulder.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [React!]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Sorry lol, I was watching porn )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( lol )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Are you serious?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( No. It just fits in with -right now- thought it'd be funny )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Guess not )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [///\
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [....]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Lol]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I didn't expect it]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I'm just reading manga )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: Wow impressive...
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ...Now...Do you think you can stop a Boulder that weighs that much....At -your- full speed?
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: comming straight at you
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ?
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: ..
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Well, I don't work well with velocity.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: And, I'm not aware of how fast I actually am.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: Well...
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: I mean, I've never put a numerical value on my speed.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: Do you think your faster than average?
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Much.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( You're* )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: Hmm...
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: I don't know.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: But to keep on the safe side...You should run in circles with the boulder.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: A large circle..
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Hm, I'll try.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: I'll just run around you two.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: The once you get tired...You walk closer to the center, eventually the boulder will speed down and stop.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Raito, you there?]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Mhm.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [You should, react to me lifting the boulder.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I was.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [But, I got a bit distracted.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Then finish :D]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [lol]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I'll wait for you to finish.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [You don't have to, to be honest I'm having block because I'm kinda' tired.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Oh man...I wish I had friends like you Zakku )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [What do you mean?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I seriously do. All my friends would be cracking jokes nonstop 24/7 )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( They don't know when to stop. Sex jokes are a common )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Their so immature )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Haha.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( But when I'm with mature people...Idk I feel so calm )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I don't make sex comments.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [At least, not anymore.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I used to, but, I sort of grew up with time.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I try not to...but...I've done it too much )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I still do.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [But, this friend of mine, she gets kind of angry at me when I make sexual jokes.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I'm up to the point where sex is just stuck to my mind...I don't react to it though.. )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( lol )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [So, eh.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Not me )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Everyone praises me if I make a good sex joke )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I'm not typically the most mature guy.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( When I say Everyone...I -mean- everyone...Even my parents )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I'm pretty calm, that's weird, but I occasionally get a little hyperactive.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Yeah me too xD )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( You have no idea )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( But...you also have no idea how mad I get )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I don't get mad often.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Like wow....Me and my bf have been in a conflict.. )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Well..he's not my bf anymore )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Ah, I see.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( He's my Fiancé now )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Cool.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( But...a few weeks back )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I got sort of emotional off the back 0
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I was like..idk..maybe it an advanced 'special time of the month' but after it lasted a few more than expected I was like maybe it something more
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I went to the doctor...and my doctor said that it's from built up stress...he said that when people build so much stress...the tend to let some out through emotion, and there is nothing we can do about it.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( They* )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [That happens to me.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Well my emotion was let out by anger )
<br><font color=yellow>*Raito(LigerSlash) stared at Zakku; his eyes widened in stupefaction as the Jounin managed to heave the large rock, which seemed to take one-hundred men to lift, above his head. As he awaited Zakku's reaction of struggling and shaking, he was somewhat dissapointed, yet at the same time amazed by the man's sheer strength in lifting the boulder. He clapped softly, applauding Zakku for his deeds, "Well done, you've defied many odds against your body. I'm amazed at how you can do that..." He couldn't help but smile, as such an astounding feat was accomplished in a few seconds with what seemed to be average effort for the man. *
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I disrespected people...I accused friends and was mean.. )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I even told my bf I didn't want him anymore )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( 3 times as a matter of fact )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [:o]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( But he understood the situation and was by my side )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( It's why he's my Fiancé now... )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: To be honest, I wasn't so sure of myself.
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Oh, you guys said you don't get mad often?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I don't really.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( For some reason I think that avoiding him would be for the best...I haven't physically seen him in 2 days...that's a start.. )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I do.. 0
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Like.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I'm slowly becoming insane, I swear.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I really don't.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I have two halfs.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Like.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [This one time..]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( You can anger me just for bad grammar )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Like I will throw a rage fit from bad grammar )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I was completely calm one minute.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I believe I'm schizophrenic]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Next thing I know, I'm about to break this guys arm while yelling at him.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( lol? )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Like, I blanked out.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Like, this one girl who really, really liked me, I'd already expressed my feelings of distaste for her.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [But she kept on bothering me...]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [One day, while we were in class, she was bothering me. In my head, I'd just sat down and ignored her,  but in reality, I barked at her, "I'll kill you and rip out your throat. Let's see who says "Hi." when you're being fed to ravenous dogs.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [LOL]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I swear.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( wow...a bit far-fetched...don't you think? )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I'm not lying, honestly.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Nah, I'd believe it.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I mean.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Wow that's mean..seriously )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I thought so too.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I swear, they just told me about it last week!]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I was like ":o"]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( lol )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I'm aware of what I do.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I would flip if someone told me that )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [But, when I was angry.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I didn't think to stop yelling.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I'd transform into the hulk lmao )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [It wasn't until my anger-rant was over that I realized..]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( xD )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I just raged.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [LOL]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [What did you say?]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I'm getting insane, mainly becuase of people annoying at me constantly.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [How old are you guys anyways?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I'm 15.]

<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [As soon as I say them, I sound like a jerk.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [And, yeah, you did.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Oh, anyway, how do you get people to hate you?]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Like, REALLY hate you.]

<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Kick them in the leg as a farewell.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [There are three-four girls who, when I tell them I really hate them, soooo much that I wish they weren't even BORN, they just laugh and take it as a joke.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Why do you hate them?]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [They be bitches.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Are they fat?]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Nope.]

<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [OH!]

<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I think i'm in the wrong conversation xD )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [And EXPECT me to greet them too.]

<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [:I Not like these ones.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [If they didn't, they wouldn't say it in the first place.]

<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [If I don't tell them hi every time I pass them, they'll constantly harass me.]

<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Over and over AGAIN.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I abhor being touched.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Dude.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [What?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Just look at them like a pedophile and say, "I like it when you touch me."
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [They won't do it again.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [LOL]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I might, but that may be sending out the wrong signals.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Not if you say it the right way.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Actually, any way you say it..]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Would work.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [They just bother me by existing, honestly.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [One of them actually tried to go out with me, the nerve of that wench.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Lol]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Are they idiots?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Like, in the academic aspect.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Two of them in the honours program.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [One of them, yea.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [The other is just average.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Honors doesn't mean much really.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I'm in it.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I know, but, they have really high GPAs.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Still doesn't mean much.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Grades are easy to make.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [That's academics though.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Which makes me a bit of a hypocrite for saying that, since I'm making a 67 in English.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Then again, that's just cause I'm lazy.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [It'll be an 81 on monday.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Is it over yet? )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [No, I've got to ask.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [What?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [What specific trait about them just makes you want them to not exist?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Other than their existence or annoyance.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Well, I usually evaluate a person's aspects during our first conversation, everything about them.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [From their body language, their ideas and views...]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [And, if this was a test, they'd all fail miserably.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [They're some idiots.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Ah, I see.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [They lack the common sense area of intelligence?]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [YES!]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [They need to be spoon-fed information.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Hm.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Like.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Like little babies, but every time I say that, they think I'm calling them my baby.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [LOL]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [And they say, "Love you too."]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I get sooooo angry.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Say infant instead.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I start swearing.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [But, uh.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [And that's when they take me seriously and one time, one of 'em touched me.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I almost slapped the conciousness out of her.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [You react so much differently than I would, it's pretty new to me.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [How would you reacted?]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [react*
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Dude, I'm a pretty creepy guy.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [lol]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I'd have said, "I bet you like touching me, don't you?"]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I can't control myself when being touched.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [If they said yes, then I'd have felt creeped out..]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Not even my own mother touches me frequently.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Why are you so against touching?]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I don't know, I just simply hate physical contact.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Just thinking about them gives me a migraine.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [So, you're not going to be a wrestler are you?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [LOL
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [A wrestler? HELL NO.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Back )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( You guys still going at it? )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [We're talking about touching now.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Not really.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [What are your opinions on being touched, in a non-sexual way I might add.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [In a non-sexual way?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Well, I tend to touch people, just to creep them out.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [But, it's normally just on the shoulder.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I don't mind a person touching me on the shoulder, or a pat on the back.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Alright, now that is you my friend.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [But, if your hand goes below mid back, you'd better be a female that I have at least mild interest in.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [If it was me, to anyone who touched me on the shoulder, and I mean ANYONE, I'd scream, "What the fuck are you fucking touching me for you damned idiot?!"]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I swear, I got suspended for that once for shouting that at a teacher.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Ugh...I just saw something I shouldn't have seen... )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [What did you see?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I saw a guy piss on a girl right after sex...and then the girl came after the guy pissed on her.. )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [..I thought you said you weren't watching porn..]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: I was watching those things like 2men1chainsaw ))
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [So you ARE watching pornography!]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Not porn >_> )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [..]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I'm not personally a fan of porn.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Well technically it's porn...but the type of porn no one wants to see )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [...]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [That's just weird then.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Like 2girls1cup )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( That's porn. )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Because, if I don't want anyone to touch me, why would I touch myself in the hopes of ejaculation?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( But no one wants to see it....Atleast I hope not )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [And, I don't like looking at other people have sex while I'm not having it.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [And I simply won't have it!]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Raito..what are you talking about? )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Masturbation and pornography.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Of course.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [So.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [How do you have sex, if you hate touching?]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I don't mind it if it's in a non-sexual way from a woman that I have interest in.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [sexual*]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Good enough.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Not non-sexual, I hate non-sexual.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Okay.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [And I say woman, because I do not take too well to girls.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I need advice.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Which is?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Female friend loses her best friend.
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Yes...?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [And, she tells me not to message back.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [And, I'm like.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Do I not message back or what?]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Not to message back?]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Whaaat?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [She says the conversation will never end.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I don't know how to react!]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [What conversation?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I might message her back anyways.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [You know, I shouldn't be asking for advice.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I'm not a math book!]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I'll solve my own problems]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Okay )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Hold on, I may be able to help.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( So...are you guys done? )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Uh, no?]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [He's having girl problems.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Can I help? xD )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I was just about to ask you to.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Wait...does it involve sexual relations? x.x )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [No.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I'm not sure.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Oh okay )(
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I'm a virgin, what are you talking about?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Then I'll gladly help )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Again, private information is private.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Well Virgins are actually the ones who want to do it the most... Atleast that's what I remember )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Not really.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Some don't even know they do lol... )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Trust me. )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I don't have a problem waiting for it.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( It's like a ticking time bomb )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Trust me, don't wait.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [If some random hot girl offered it to me, I'd deny.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [And, why do you say that?]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Waiting doesn't make anything special.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [It's more like, a rotting egg.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [LOL]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( ew... )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [But, I want it to be with a woman I have more than just a simple interest in at least.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Really, and you can get rusty too.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I don't usually have a problem approaching women.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Zakku, that's sweet and all.....but.... )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [But...?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Sex isn't about love lol...asmuch as I hate to break it to you )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [:O]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Sex is hardly ever about love )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [As much as I'd like to disagree, it's true.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Though, I try to make it about love.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Sex is mainly about pleasure and feeling good. Letting out stress with your partner )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [The interet, it has lied to me for the last damn time!]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [GAH!]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( They say sex is about love to make it sound a bit more civil )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Men especially don't make it about lol... )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [And another thing, I don't feel the need to go all kooky with this styles now-a-days.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [The standard missionary style will suffice.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Okay, let's not talk about that >_> )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [..Are you saying my whip won't make it any better?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( So Zakku, what's the problem? )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [lol]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [jk, lol.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [But uh.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [The problem is.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [She's really hurting, and I don't know how to fix it.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [She lost her best friend.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [And I'm like, gah!]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Lost as in..? )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Friend no more.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( As in..? )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Like, a break up.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Only, between friends.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Hm...]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( First of all )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( They'll get back together. )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( True friends always get back together. )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Well, I don't know how to deal with this, as usually I don't make any emotional attachments after what's done has been done.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [No, true friends never greak up to begin with.]
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [I guess that's just me.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( No )
<br><font color=green>*Raito(LigerSlash) says: [Brb.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [break*]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [But, then again.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [That's me.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I don't lose my really good friends, ever.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( A true friend would lose a friend just to see if the friend really wants to be a friend )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( lol ^ )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I said friend 4 times )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [That's not the case in this situation.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Ik, i'm just saying )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( First of all, never say 'it's gonna be okay' )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I didn't.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Okay. )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I'm not stupid.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( You have to get her off it )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [How?!]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Tell her...uhm.... well idk what to tell you )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( lol. You know her better than me )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( You should know how to get her off it )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Well..]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [She tends to be a bit..]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [More emotional than the average person.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I want to say,"You should tell her that you'll be there for her no matter what." But don't do that. That's creppy.
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: creepy*
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ()
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I actually was going to say that.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [But, she might have expected it.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( This isn't a drama lol )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Eh.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [She's just an emotional girl.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Is she? )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Yeah.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Go down and ask her if she wants to hang out )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Wait, that may sound wrong.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Well, it's uh..]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [4:42 AM..]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Not now lol )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [And, we both already have plans for tomorrow..]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Er, today.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Well when you get the chance )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I think I'll get her a mountain dew and give it to her at school monday morning.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Tell her,"Maybe I can help you fill in the spot of your friend" <-- In your own words...this way is to direct lol )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Hm, nah, I believe she'd take something like that the wrong way.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( This is how I would say it,"How about we go watch a movie or get some ice cream to get her off your mind? Maybe a few convserations will track you off" Remember losing a friend isn't like losing a partner )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Unless she's extreamly to the maximum lonley. )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( If she -is-...then you should do it the way you think in your mind )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Those type of girls usually fall for anything )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Honestly. )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I'll uh, figure something out.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Maybe.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( However, if she gets attention...I'd probably advice you take it easy and try your best to act more supportive rather than possesive )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I believe I'll leave her alone for tonight though..]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Lol Zakku....Don't tell me you are bothering her in the middle of the night...-facepalm- )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Nah.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [She's usually the one that bothers me.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Not really bothers.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Then be an ear to her. )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: Respond to every question, back up her conversations...and really act like your digging up into her feelings )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Girls -do- like someone that listens xD ...Probably the only truth they give out in TV Dramas lol )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Well not entirely )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I typically listen.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I won't respond to everything.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Girls like it when a guy they like listens )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [But, I'll respond to the stuff that matters.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Zakku )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Yeah?]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( I'd advice you respond to everything lol )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( It's only advice though )
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( You can do whatever you want )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Hm, we'll see.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( :) )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [But, I'm going to have to leave her alone tonight.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Because, I'm tired.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Yeah..you sort of already said that )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [And, it's 4:50 AM.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( For the 3rd time. )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I like to clarify, a lot.]
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( Yeah.. I know...You told me the time too (: )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [:O]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I see that.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Did I really tell you, or are you reading my mind..?
<br><font color=green>*La Maré, Amy(EmoSara) says: ( -rubs my face on my legs- )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [...]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [What?]
