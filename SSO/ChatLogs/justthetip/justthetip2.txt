<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Manami(JustTheTip) nods her head as she begins to focus her mind and her body. The young girl begins to try to meditate towards herself. "Hnngg.." He groans as she was putting a bit too much physical into this meditative state. After a few moments she begins to get a headache and stops for a second. "Ugh.." She goans before going back to focusing, but not trying to focus as hard.

"Alright..Less head hurty.." She thinks to herself as she begins to focus once again. This time the young girl's focus isn't as tight, it isn't as hard either. She begins to feel her body begin to relax a bit. She quickly feels her physical energy lax out as it begins to flow throughout her body, actually making her feel slightly relaxed and soothed.

"I got it I think..I feel tingly.." She says out loud to her father.

The young girl continues to do as she had before. This time, she fels a bit of energy beginning to run through her body. This energy though feels different than the last energy. "Hmm.." She thinks as she allows the two energies to flow quickly and freely. In no time, her body begins to glow brightly. "Oh no!!" She cries out as it begins to rapidly flow through out her. "I don't know what to do!" She states to Sanoke.* - Sat Dec 12 02:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Manami(JustTheTip) simply nods her head as she releases her focus. The girl's chakra cloaking dissappears. "Oh..Okay!" She states smiling.* - Sat Dec 12 02:20:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Manami(JustTheTip) nods her head at her father talking about control. "I think I know what Sanoke means." She thinks to herself as she begins to focus once more. This time, the young girl's chakra is summoned up much quicker. She draws her focus to various parts of her body. As she does so, her chakra begins to flow slowly towards those positions, almost as if it were mostly frozen.

"Oh! I think I'm doing it!" She says as she begins to change the point of focus, her small amount of chakra responding appropriately. "Wait Mama! I think I got the Byakugan!" She says smiling as she begins to change her focus to her eyes. The girl does this by seemingly focusing her sight upon something in the distance.

As she does this, her sluggish chakra begins to move slowly towards her head. After a while of waiting, she could feel her chakra quickly beginning to conglomerate there. She raises her hands to her mother. "Momma I g-I go.." She begins to say as all of her chakra suddenlly flows through her eyes.

"I got a..BYAKUGAN!" She exclaims as veins bulge laterally from her eyes, her barely discernable pupils becoming completely invisible as they fade in to the milky whiteness.

"I did it mama!" She cries out.* - Sat Dec 12 03:39:40 2015
