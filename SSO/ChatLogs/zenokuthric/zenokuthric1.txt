<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nanabi(ZenoKuthric) | | Chen wobbled to the furthest edge of the room. A single lever had been pulled and the walls caved inwards. The beast erupts out of the room, squirming through the narrow confines. Chen herself evacuates the premises whilst the beast rampages around. The beast's eyes land on the three before it. With a screech, the beast lashes out violently, with the tendency of a caged, confined animal.

It had taken its toll. Years of confinement, years of imprisonment behind bars, and years of experiments on its body. The Nanabi's tail whips out, a single tail aiming to sweep across the arena. The tail would bring up large amounts of debris, aiming to scatter the three combatants. If it contacted them, severe damage would be done.
