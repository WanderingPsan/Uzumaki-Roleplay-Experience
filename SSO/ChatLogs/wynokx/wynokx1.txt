Geo kicks off the ground, the first two gates flaring open within his head. He appears directly behind Booty Hulk and quickly sweeps his body low aiming to knock the man off of his feet.

In the next moment, the young man aims a massive punch directly into the Booty Hulk's midsection, aiming to smash bones and damage major organs. The Booty Warrior's clones would then appear around them, shortly after his attack was completed.* - Fri Dec 11 23:53:32 2015

"Die..." He states as he then reacts with a -massive- punch aimed directly at Booty Hulk's head, neck, and chest area. As he does so, a -massive- burst of compressed wind explodes from the source of the punch, aiming to not only kill the individual immediately but to knock him flying away.* - Sat Dec 12 00:44:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) had taken his weights off while Hiroshi did as well. He drops into a strange stance which Hiroshi would not have seen him take before. "Prepare yourself." He states as he drops back away from Hiroshi's initally high kick. Because of this, he was better prepared for the other attacks. He umps over the kick towards his ankles before bringing his arms up to counter the kick towards his gut.

The young man is pushed back several steps before chuckling and rushing back in towards Hiro. "Let's see how this works for yah." He states as he quickly gets in close. Geo aims a quick punch for Hiroshi's face, then a punch towards his gut, followed by one to his legs. All of the punches seem to be pulled as they get in close but fall short of damaging Hiro via physical means.

"Bang."

As Geo says this, the air directly in front of Hiroshi in all three of these spots compresses before slamming into him. They'd deal damage to him equal to about half of Geo's ability to deal damage as well aiming to knock him back with the combined force off all three of the attacks.* - Sat Dec 12 21:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) whispers: You remember how I was gonna get Dempsey Roll? Apparently it's B-rank now..D'ya think I should spend the 1500 to get it..OR should I just get a perk and wait till next friday? ) - Sat Dec 12 21:36:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) sighs. Somehow he had missed every single one of his attacks. The young man smiles despite this though. As Hiroshi dodges and leaps up above Geo, he chuckles. "Thanks for this." He exclaims as he suddenlly spins his body around and performs a technique which would no doubt catch Hiroshi off-guard despite his intense want to not get caught by it, as he lacked mid-air combat training.<4>

"Shoooryuken!" Geo exclaims as he leaps upwards to uppercut Hiroshi cleanly in the gut. As he does so, he releases the air compressed from this attack. This would no doubt knock Hiroshi high into the air as a result of both the punch and the compression more than likely connecting in this massive uppercut.<5>* - Sat Dec 12 22:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) leaps upwards under Hiroshi, floating behind him utilzing the creeping leaf shadow. "Hey Hiroshi...I'm sorry.." He states as he opens both the first and second gate together, focusing his energy throughout his body. "I have to do this..To prove to myself...That I can..." He states simply as he extends his arms, beginning to focus his energy throughout his body once more, preparing for this technique.<7>* - Sat Dec 12 22:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) whispers: Dad's big ass is back my nigga lmao) - Sat Dec 12 22:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) whispers: He walking to the finals of the winter cup ova errybody lol) - Sat Dec 12 22:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) chuckles as he drops out of the creeping leaf shadow. "This is what I'll do." He thinks to himself as Hiroshi begins to fall towards the earth, no doubt unable to move around in the air becasue of a lack of mid-air ability. "Sho..." He states as he begins to focus his energy as well as his body. The young man plummetting towards him, if he was a sensor, would notice that the young man's energy was rising dramatically.<8>


As Hiroshi gets closer, and closer to the target area,"Ryuukeen!" He exclaims as he suddenlly leaps up. The young man moves to meet Hiroshi mid-air with a massive uppercut towards his chin. Assuming success, Hiroshi would feel quite a bit of pain as he is launched back into the air, rather high up. He wouldn't be as high as he was initially, but that was because this was just a setup.<9>

Geo then quickly leaps up into the air again after having landing. He moves to wrap his legs around Hiroshi's midsection and his arms around his shoulders as they begin to plummet once more. This attack would be similar to the Front Lotus but there is a major difference in the movements of this technique. "I'm not going down with you..." He states as he begins the spin as if he were using the Primary Lotus. <10>

Before the two of them even get close to the ground though, Geo lets go and backs off, floating off through the air, his centrifugal force from the rotations causing his movement and not mid-air combatant training. As Geo floats away, aiming to watch Hiroshi hit the ground he chuckles. "What a technique.." He thinks to himself as he watches his handy work.<11>* - Sat Dec 12 22:25:13 2015
