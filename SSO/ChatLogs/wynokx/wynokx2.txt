<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) chuckles as he tosses his weights back towards the wall. The young man nods. "Aye aye Kinami-Sensei." He states with a wink before suddenlly taking off at top speed. The young man wasn't going to show Kinami his new stance yet, first he wanted her to get some of her aggresion out. He quickly aims a punch towards her midsection. The follow-up strike would be aimed directly towards her midsection.<10>

The young man's secondary attack was a quick knee brought up the moment after his second punch. He quickly aims to knock the wind out of the woman, hoping to knock her back a few steps. Assuming success, he'd then follow up with a sudden kick towards her midsection. His kick was powered up and intended on knocking her a distance away.<11>* - Sun Dec 13 01:40:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) slips his body backwards, avoiding the incoming uppercut towards his chin area. "Huh!" He exclaims as the girl suddenlly spins around. He takes the kick towards his midsection and is thrown backwards quite a bit. "Hnng...Kinami-Sensei you're getting better..." He remarks as he rushes forth once more. The young man quickly leaps upwards as he comes close to Kinami.<12>
<br><br>
As Geo gets in close from his upwards leap, the young man flips his body over suddenlly. He aims a massive kick to the back of Kinami's head attempting to knock her forwards towards the earth. He then continues to rotates as he aims another massive kick towards her head, this one intended on knocking her face-first into the sand. After the two kicks are performed, Geo contines forth and lands upon the sand on all fours.<13>
<br><br>
The young man stands up and watches his sensei. He knew she was in a bad mood and the current spar which they were going to have would cause them both to be able to work out quite a bit of aggression. It had been a while since they had their issues, but he knew that if they didn't work hard, they'd still just pop up again. With this in mind, Geo quickly rushes towards the girl, aiming a spinning heel kick towards her from her position upon the ground.<14>* - Sun Dec 13 01:55:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) thinks: Awh~ lame~... Now I have to wait to learn stuff. Guess I'll work on something else? - Sun Dec 13 02:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Let's go, - Sun Dec 13 02:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: . . . .Right. - Sun Dec 13 02:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Well while you to do that.. I'll be around. Be back later I guess. You guys spars take forever anyways - Sun Dec 13 02:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: . . . Right. . .  - Sun Dec 13 02:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) stares down Hiroshi. He begins to hear within his mind his fight song. It was speaking of overcoming limits. Doing the impossible. Fighting against those limitations and going beyond.."Row Row...Fight the Power...." He thinks to himself as she suddenlly kicks off of the ground. Geo's speed was at maximum as he dissappears for a moment before reappearing directly in front of Hiroshi. The young man quickly moves to kick the young man in the midesection.<15>

His follow-up would be a simply front flip which would end with his legs on either side of Hiroshi's head. He'd move to hold on with his legs as he pulls himself up. Geo'd quickly go in for a massive series of left and right, jabs and hooks. Each one would be aimed at knocking Hiroshi back a few steps, his punches being delivered with a great deal of force.<16>

Geo then would let go, assuming success up to this point, with his legs and flip backwards off of Hiroshi. Landing in a three-point stance. He'd then suddenlly throws his body forward. As he does so, he moves to tackle Hiroshi hard in the midsection, hoping to not only knock the wind out of his lungs, but he'd make every attempt to flatten the young man against the ground.<17>

"Ground and Pound." Geo thinks to himself, the climax of his theme coming on now. He'd quickly, assuming he got Hiroshi down to the ground, begin another series of quick left and right jabs, aiming to punish the young man with each of his strikes. He was a boxer, and a damn good one at that. Each of his hits was quicker and more powerful than the last. "ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWAH!" He exclaims with his final attack.<18>* - Sun Dec 13 02:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) chuckles as he takes the knee and the kick dropping backwards. The young man quickly rolls over backwards, his body coming up into a standing position, the roll completed. He faces off against Hiro once more. The young man suddenlly rushes him at top speed. "I guess I don't have to pull punches." He thinks as he activates the first gate.<19>
<br><br>
Geo quickly gets in close and slides to a stop. He quickly moves to punch Hrioshi in the solarplexus with the hopes of knocking the wind from him. He'd then quickly aim a quick low sweep towards the young man's legs aiming to take him off of his feet. Shortly afterwards, he'd flip his body over aiming to slam both of his feet into Hiroshi's midsection, Bruce Lee Style.<20>* - Sun Dec 13 02:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) 's body lowers as Hideo comes towards him. He quickly begins to weave left and right, his body rapidly moves in what can only be considered a figure eight pattern. "Rooooolllu!" He exclaims as he suddenlly comes out of the figure out pattern with a series of four quick punches. One each to the left and right. Each one was extremely hard to follow and even harder to avoid as it was aimed at an angle which would strike the opponent across the chin with the intent of incapacitation.* - Sun Dec 13 03:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) keeps his shoulders dropped, this technique was more easily used in his new fighting stance. He activates the second gate, his stance being already taken. He quickly draws his arm back as he leaps upwards and towards Hiroshi. "Can ye feel it now Hiro!?" He exclaims as he performs a massive punch towards his midsection, aiming to not only end the spar but to create someting of a crater in the earth, possibly breaking a few of Hiroshi's bones.* - Sun Dec 13 03:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) wasn't at a distance, he was directly over Hiroshi but that's cool too. The young man chuckles as he closes the two gates and stands up out of his stance. "Huh? Oh yeah.." He says sighing. "My bad. Kinami got me all worked up."* - Sun Dec 13 03:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) thinks: That sounds wronge - Sun Dec 13 03:24:44 2015

He's just going to get killed for no reason..." He thinks shaking his head before looking at Hiroshi.

"Silly fool...Letting Love Unwarranted cloud his mind."* - Sun Dec 13 03:41:48 2015
