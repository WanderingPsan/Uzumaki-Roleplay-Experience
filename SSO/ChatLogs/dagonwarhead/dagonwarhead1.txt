<br><br><font color=yellow>*Makaveli, Ichiro(DagonWarhead) proceeds to continue his rigorous training session. His hands land on the ground and he begins to execute push-ups. For a while, Sunagakure looked to have been filled with just bandits. Suddenly, there were new faces. That invigorated Ichiro to some extent, who had been singularly training ever since Sunagakure's demise at the hands of Zetsumo. He continues to work his biceps, exercising his muscles and working them down to the bone. 

"101. 102. 103." He recites the number of the push-up he was on, less he forget to get to his goal of five-hundred before transitioning into his mile run.* - Sat Oct  3 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Makaveli, Ichiro(DagonWarhead) sweats profusely from the temple of his forehead. He wipes the sweat occasionally with dirt-covered hands, not minding the dirtiness of the environment he was training in. He was going to have to get used to it for a real combat situation after all. Ichiro stood up briefly, to stretch his hands and crack his knuckles. He returns to the ground without a moment's breath, landing on his knees before raising them.

He executes several more pushups.

"104, 105, 106, 107." He mutters aloud, bending his elbows ninety degrees for each execution.* - Sat Oct  3 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Makaveli, Ichiro(DagonWarhead) had to execute his strenuous training. He wasn't going to foster some sort of guilt or foster lost hope because of the deaths of his fallen friends. Ichiro kept on training. Training was his bread and butter; it relieved him of the tension of the real world. Although Ichiro never fought anymore, he kept on training and making his body as perfectionist and fit as he possibly could in the time he had. * - Sat Oct  3 04:15:08 2015

"It's time to train." Ichiro stated. He kicks the air powerfully, before releasing a string of punches. "I need to make my attacks faster--that way people can't dodge them." He voices audibly.

He dashes forward Ryuga, attempting to grab hold of his face and bash him right against the mountain, perhaps even dragging his visage across the wall and having him carry clumps of dirt within his mouth at the same time. * - Wed Nov 25 21:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Makaveli, Ichiro(DagonWarhead) is struck once more by Hanai. Ichiro twists and turns. He attempts to quite literally knee Hanai right in the stomach. 

"You're weak. Your punches are light. Your punches are weak. You don't have weight behind your punches because you don't understand Lord Edge. You don't fight because you want to fight. You keep protecting them. You keep yelling stop. But you're weak because you're trying to protect the weak."

Ichiro shouted at him, attempting to burrow Hanai against the ground. Ichiro would axehandle him on the spine if possible, and perhaps down him some more. * - Wed Nov 25 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Makaveli, Ichiro(DagonWarhead) | | Incredible. He was being assaulted at all ends. He was hit by the punch, uplifted into the air. Next, he was tossed into the wall, resulting in his body flopping against it. Shuriken land on his frame and don't even budge him though. Ichiro emerges from the rock though.

"You can't kill me with that." He wipes off some blood from his mouth.

"You all think you could've done this? Beat me? Without the patriotism of -true- Sunagakure?" He weaves handseals and slams his hand on the ground, attempting to conjure up an Antlion Hole to remove Momura from the underground.* - Wed Nov 25 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Makaveli, Ichiro(DagonWarhead) | | Suddenly, Ichiro is bombarded by bullets. He is struck in the shoulder, once, his chest, once, his stomach, once, and his kneecaps, twice. He lands against the wall, pinned down and bleeding heavily. He lands on the ground, bleeding heavily. He spits on the ground.

"Thou shall have the first move. Hit any region you so desire." Roman stated, as he loosened his clothes to reveal his upper body; its ridiculous chiseled definition meant that physical training was Roman's forte.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Roman(DagonWarhead) had initial difficulty with relocating Yumiko. Yumiko's Shunshin was quick and high-paced, resulting in Roman's untrained eyes to be unable to locate her as keenly as he desired. Once he did though, Roman twisted his body and shoved  his buckler in front of his face, guarding his vital parts from a sniper-like assault she may have. However, she tossed the bow away; it made Roman question what style of combat Yumiko was now predisposing herself to.* - Sun Dec  6 23:40:48 2015

He exercises caution: Yumiko's determination and confidence was uncanny and Roman was clearly anticipating some sort of secret trump card being revealed at this point.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Roman(DagonWarhead) | | The chains rise from the ground. Suddenly, Roman's spear intercepts the chains. It is a reflexive maneuver in which he brings his spear upwards into the conglomeration of spears and he quite literally attempts to spin the spear around to block the chains from grappling hold of his body. Once the spear was in rotation, Roman struggles with repetitive rotational force to try and break free of the chains, before they could grasp hold of his person.

If he is unsuccessful, Roman remains under the bindings and struggles against them, occasionally pushing against the iron chains.

If he is successful, Roman returns to his stationary position and draws closer to Yumiko.* - Sun Dec  6 23:57:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Roman(DagonWarhead) | | It was tough to defend himself. Roman continued to spin the spear and crackled against the iron chains, denting them and smashing into them with the shaft and the head of his spear. The syrup trap was nearing him now and Roman had little opportunity.

He ducks to the ground, rooting himself closer to the ground and balling himself up, while simultaneously bringing his buckler down to the ground. By doing so, his buckler would divert the syrup trap and make it go around Roman instead of directly on him.

His reaction was probably because he had never seen the jutsu. He expected it to be some sort of attack to throw him off balance and have him be ensnared. 

Roman had little knowledge of the properties of the syrup. He only thought it was an offensive technique, so he had rushed to protect himself.* - Mon Dec  7 00:02:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Roman(DagonWarhead) | | Suddenly, the iron chains had all been but defeated. Roman's buckler was held out to block the syrup trap. Roman takes steps forward to advance towards Yumiko. 

After a few steps in the syrup, it became difficult to maneuver. Roman's feet would not allow him to move forward. Roman's head rears to inspect the glob underneath him: it had all been revealed to him now. He hadn't known of its properties and that had let to his downfall. He'd store this memory into his head for the rest of his life. * - Mon Dec  7 00:12:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Roman(DagonWarhead) examines the syrup with the tip of his spear. He realized that while he could penetrate it, it only caught onto his spearhead. Well, it was a gooey substance after all. He brings the spear back to his back and pulls his buckler back into his cape.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Pull out this spear from me? - Mon Dec  7 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Does he not see we are in the middle of something? - Mon Dec  7 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Why does Nori -want- to do it? - Mon Dec  7 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Roman(DagonWarhead) | | As soon as the shoulder bash had been executed, Roman rears his right hand back with the spear attached to it. Suddenly, Roman's shield blows upwards, attempting to divert the angle of Ryo's shoulderbash.

"A shoulderbash! Brave!" -Roman's eyes focus on Ryo's legs. Suddenly, Roman attempts to slam his foot on Ryo's foot and smash into his leg with the steel diaphysis of his staff.* - Mon Dec  7 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: But who? - Mon Dec  7 02:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: .......But why? - Mon Dec  7 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Roman(DagonWarhead) | | In a moment's notice, Roman's head backs off. Unfortunately he is simply not fast enough. He hadn't anticipated that Ryo would tank his blow. Roman's shield is brought downwards and his spear is pulled back momentarily. However, when his head was struck, Roman only returns a glare to Ryo.

Roman took that blow without an issue.

That haymaker certainly connected. Roman's right hand, which gripped the spear, quite literally attempts to smash the side of the spear into Ryo's side. If done, Roman's shield would be next, as an uppercut to Ryo's chin to try and knock his jaw up into the air. Roman would release a pummeling of shield-bashes henceforth, relentlessly.* - Mon Dec  7 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Roman(DagonWarhead) nodded. He draws his spear back and sets it on his back. He knew what he had to work on now.* - Mon Dec  7 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) whispers: Can you teach me how to use a spear? - Mon Dec  7 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: They're just going to execute that man as he is? A poor death. - Mon Dec  7 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: If he should die, he should do so on his feet, not grovelling on the floor. - Mon Dec  7 03:28:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Ever give a thought about that training? - Tue Dec  8 04:16:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Roman(DagonWarhead) approached the scene. Upon his person, there was a new set of armor. Roman looked to recognize Heiwa, from a couple of years ago. Since then, Roman had been training in the wilderness without a care on his mind. Now he was ready to return to Kirigakure with a new arsenal of techniques to fight with. Regardless, Roman remains stationary at the fence, waiting for Heiwa or perhaps his companion to notice him. * - Sat Dec 12 19:43:56 2015
