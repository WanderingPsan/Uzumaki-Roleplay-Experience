<br><font color=green>*Yusei, Akask(Sasuke237619) says: You didn't enter? WHy not?
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: Why should I? I would not have won, and there was a high risk of being injured or killed in it!

<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: Awww...

<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Hmmm?
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: Do any of you know where I may find training weights?

<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Just get some large boulders or somethin.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Tie them to your feet and body.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: and GG for everyone.

<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Well, then I don't know.

<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (I'm finna do that)

<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (Finna break Konoha's gate)

<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (Wait)
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (would I be able to kick through a fence with dynamic entry?)
<br><font color=green>*Yusei, Akask(Sasuke237619) says: The Hokage needs to assign spying missions....
<br><font color=green>*Yusei, Akask(Sasuke237619) says: Akask is rather bored....
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (ofc)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (but not through stone, cuz u has no strength perk)
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (But I have 1st gate tho)
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (So GG)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (oh ya)

<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (omg )
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (Akask)
<br><font color=yellow>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) seemed calm for a brief moment, as he contemplated on a way to obtain weights. He nodded to himself, then took a quick step forward. Pivoting on his foot, he turned around and jumped towards the closest gate as he led with his foot. "Dynmic, EXIIIIIT!!!" He yelled as he would break through the gate and run off, to either take the woman's suggestion of finding boulders, or finding someone in the village to ask.*
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (Mixin thangs up *nod*)

<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (I might go for it tomorrow)
<br><font color=yellow>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) dynamic entry's back in because he didn't actually feel like going anywhere OOCly.*
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: I am back~!
<br><font color=green>*Yusei, Akask(Sasuke237619) says: Sadly...
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: Hey, we can fight if you would like!
<br><font color=green>*Yusei, Akask(Sasuke237619) says: No thanks....Akask is rather terrible at fighting....
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: Then be quiet!
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: By the next Exam, I will be ready to win!
<br><font color=green>*Yusei, Akask(Sasuke237619) says: Free world....Akask may say whatever he likes....
<br><font color=green>*Yusei, Akask(Sasuke237619) says: Akask could win this exam....Does that mean your skill level is below Akask's?
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (Lol u just said in a semi-feudal era it's a free world)
<br><font color=green>*Yusei, Akask(Sasuke237619) says: ((Mhm))

<br><font color=green>*Yusei, Akask(Sasuke237619) says: No thanks...
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: Nrm, I shall leave, I think.
<br><font color=green>*Yusei, Akask(Sasuke237619) says: Cool.
<br><font color=yellow>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) walks away like a boss.*
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: Wrong way~!

<br><font color=green>*Highwind, Ken(Kyubisora) says: Uhh.. Hi!
<br><font color=green>*Yusei, Akask(Sasuke237619) says: ....Yo?
<br><font color=green>*Highwind, Ken(Kyubisora) says: What's up?
<br><font color=green>*Yusei, Akask(Sasuke237619) says: Nothin'....
<br><font color=green>*Yusei, Akask(Sasuke237619) says: Bored....
<br><font color=green>*Highwind, Ken(Kyubisora) says: Same.
<br><font color=green>*Highwind, Ken(Kyubisora) says: (How do oyu get your genin?)
<br><font color=green>*Yusei, Akask(Sasuke237619) says: Meh....
<br><font color=green>*Highwind, Ken(Kyubisora) says: Sigh.
<br><font color=green>*Highwind, Ken(Kyubisora) says: I'm probably gonna nap.
<br><font color=green>*Yusei, Akask(Sasuke237619) says: Meh...Cool.
<br><font color=yellow>*Yusei, Akask(Sasuke237619) sighed a small sigh, realizing the next exercise he had to do. He didn't break a sweat for the first exercise, but this just might do it. He lay on his back, and placed his legs up do that they were bent at the knees. Sit-ups were the second worst exercise you could do. Akask knew the first was next, but he had to focus on this exercise. 100 weren't bad compared to the previous days. As he made sure his back was flat, he pulled himself up to his knees, slowly saying "One.". He began to move at a faster pace, as a small bead of sweat ran down the side of Akask's face. Slowly feeling the cool liquid run down his cheek, he began to work harder. These exercises should be easier by now, so he pretty much increased his pace. When he completed number 50, he quickly hoped up to his feet. Fatigue was not in option in training. Any weakness meant extra, and Akask seriously hated punishment. Akask desired to be an over achiever, and set specific goals. If he failed one, he was surely going to make up for it.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Yusei, Akask(Sasuke237619) Akask looked up towards the sky, finally starting his training off for the week. If he was going to be epic, he might as well get stronger. Of course the warm-ups always had to come first. Akask stood by himself, as he fell onto the ground. Today was Akask's lucky day. Only 50 push-ups! He slowly placed his arms under him, sticking his elbows up. Slowly pushing his body up, he counted slowly. "1....2....3..." he chanted as his chest lightly tapped the ground. He breathing became heavier, as his body became slightly fatigued. After completing 50 he put one foot forward, and pushed himself onto his feet. Now for the next exercise....*
<br><font color=yellow>*Yusei, Akask(Sasuke237619) glanced at Natsu before beginning the next assignments. 150 laps around the area didn't seem bad, but they were killer on his legs, especially when they had to be run in 15 minutes flat. Akask usually gave himself a time limit to do his exercises. They not only built up stamina, but they also built up some pretty good speed. He gave himself a good few minutes to stretch, which led Akask to sit down. He reached for his toes, as he loosened up his muscles. The tightness in his legs began to slowly disappear as he sat up. He felt light on his feet, almost hyped up to run. If he was going to take his Daddy's place some day, he had to train with all his might. He put his right foot back as he waited for the signal.. He stretched one last time as Shoru shouted "Go!". He bolted as fast as he could down the side of the grounds. He made a sharp turn, being careful not to trip over his own feet. He was half way done, 10 seconds left. He bolted past the gate, as Natsu called out "20 seconds on the dot". Akask was at the perfect pace. If he wanted to make sure he completed the laps in time, he had to run faster. He pushed off his current back foot, pushing himself forward. He began to accelerate, slightly tiring himself. The laps began to brush by more quickly as he completed the 20th. His legs felt as if they would explode, but he knew he had to keep up the pace unless he wanted to have more work. The bad thing was that this was only warm-ups. As he reached the 100th, he felt as if he was going to collapse. His legs movements became more frantic as he attempted to bolt trough the final few laps. Just as he approached the line, he tripped over his own foot, causing him to trip over his own feet. He skidded across the ground, cutting up his arms in the process. He stopped a few mere inches away from the finish line, as tears strolled down his face. The injuries were completely blocked out of his mind. He had failed his task, so he had to re-do the exercise. Why was he so slow and clumsy?*
<br><font color=yellow>*Yusei, Akask(Sasuke237619) quickly hoped onto his feet, dusting the bloody dirt off of his arms. He would have to wrap them up later after the terrible training that was to come. He wiped a mixture of blood and dirt off of his face.. He quickly appointed himself to run 200 laps this time, double for failing the first task. Akask would be dead by the time he actually began to train. He quickly took off, not even wanting to rest. These laps didn't have a time limit, but Akask intended to finish in a quick time, which caused Akask to bolt down the side of the grounds. The sun was beginning to set, and Akask knew that he was going to finish, because he didn't feel like practicing in the dark. He had high expectations saying that Akask was only 12. He kicked up dirt as he ran, trying to build up as much speed as he could. Sweat was running down the side of his head, and a strong fatigue was overcoming him. At the 90th lap, Akask began to heighten his pace. His legs were basically Jelly, and he knew it had been way longer than 20 minutes. Luckily, the Sun seemed to be on his side. It was barely moving, but it wouldn't be there long. He was on his final lap as his shadow began to extend further out. The Sun would lose its last beam in a matter of seconds, and Akask was slowing down at a rapid rate. There was only a meter left between him and Natsu. He pushed through, crashing right next to Natsu's feet as he did so. He made ittttt. Whoo hoooo.... Now time for the real task to begin.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Yusei, Akask(Sasuke237619) looked up at Natsu, wondering what was in store for him today. He was already exausted from the warm-ups, and now he had an hour of more practice. The first order of instruction was to come at him. This had to be easy. As soon as he took one step, Natsu quickly formed a random sign, as his fighting spirit seemed to enlarge. Great. A hyperactive Natsu was always fun to fight. He set himself in his stance, charging at Natsu with a kick. Natsu merely dodged the weak attack, kicking Akask in the stomach. Akask dropped like a sack of potatoes and fell towards the ground, clutching his stomach. He began coughing heavily, as Natsu mercilessly moved in. While Akask was still on his knees gasping for air, his brother lightly kicked him in his side. Akask skid across the ground, bouncing occasionally if he hit a bump in the ground. His side went numb, probably due to a bruise. He merely fought of the pain, figuring that if he didn't fight back, he was pretty much going to be in plenty more pain. He stood up, ignoring the pain in his side, blocking it out for the time being. He slid his right foot back as he charged towards his little brother. He threw a fake punch at one before delivering a quick kick. Natsu merely caught his leg, and gave him a gentle twist, spinning Akask in mid air. As the kid let go of his foot, Akask hit the ground yet again. This couldn't happen. Akask refused to give up. He did what was supposed to be a sweep kick, but ended up being a light tap in the shin. Natsu merely laughed, as Akask leapt back onto his feet. He jumped about a foot off of the ground, sending a kick dead towards his brother's. Not expecting anything, Natsu was sent backwards, hitting the ground with a thud. Comeback Baby.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Yusei, Akask(Sasuke237619) slowly landed back on his two feet, looking towards his brother. He slowly got up, dusting himself off like it was nothing. Was Akask really so weak that his LITTLE BROTHER didn't even groan when he was hit? A feeling of anger pulsed throughout his body. Here Akask was sparring, and Natsu was treating it as if it was nothing! He charged at Natsu, attempting yet another sweep attack. The attack was quicker, but still pretty weak. Natsu laughed as he performed a late jump, slightly sending him off balance, the impact not strong enough to knock him down. He brought his foot back, merely trying again. This time, the Natsu backed up, causing Akask to seem as if he was doing a break dance move. He stopped moving for a second, trying to come up with a plan. He ran towards a stick, swiflty picking it up as he ran towards the annoying little kid. He performed a small swing before ducking down, and trying yet again to perform a sweep kick. Natsu fell fight into the trap. He anticipated the blow, which caused him to duck down. Just as he did, Akask was ready with his kick. He brought his foot in from the left, colliding with Natsu's side. He tripped yet again, slightly breaking his fall with his arms. He rolled to his side, looking up at Akask. "Not bad bro'. Shall we continue?" Natsu said with a smirk. The same dorky smirk that always irked Akask. Time to deal some damage!*
<br><font color=yellow>*Yusei, Akask(Sasuke237619) looked at his opponent, a slight bulge of anger. This was going to be the most exhausting fight of the day. His energy levels were pretty much depleted, so fighting his hyper brother was going to have great difficulty. Even though Natsu was weak, he was quick. Just that fact made Akask Akask think that he might lose. He loosened his grip on his stick before thinking of what to do. He couldn't run, that would be pointless. He couldn't go head on without getting tripped. Decisions Decisions. Akask inhaled, throwing the stick clean towards Natsu's head. While his brother focused on the stick, Akask kicked his shoe off in Natsu's direction. Natsu anticipated the stick, but clutched his face as the shoe hit him clean in the face. As Natsu held his face, Akask jumped into the air, extending his leg. When Natsu finally realized what was going on, it was too late. Akask's foot was firmly planted on top of his face. Natsu fell backwards, as Akask lept sideways to avoid planting Natsu's head into the ground. He landed on one foot, almost falling over. As he looked over towards Natsu, a feeling of confidence overcame him. Natsu laid on the ground, still holding his face. "Epic huh bro;?" Akask said with a giant grin on his face. The match was Set. Who was victorious? Akask of course. Akask: 1. Natsu: 0.*
