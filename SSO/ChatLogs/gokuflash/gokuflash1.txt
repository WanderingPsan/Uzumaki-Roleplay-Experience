<br><br><font color=yellow>*Darius(Gokuflash) walks up to same area the other man had been training and decided he'd attempt to train this technqiue as well. He recited the name a couple of times to try and remeber the feel for it. " Lightning Style: Earth Flash....Lightning Style: Earth Flash...Lightning Style: Earth Flash.. " Afterward he then went on to perform the technique.

Darius brought his hands together and then took a deep breathe while he closed his eyes for the time being. He slowly opened them and retracted his hands to bring them back to form the handseals " Boar ---> Ram ---> Snake ---> Horse ---> Dragon " He then shouted " Lightning Style: Earth Flash! " He could barely control this technique as he was so, he had no idea just how much of an output there was going to be.

A small stream of lightning erupted from his hands, he had held it for a quick three seconds and then he couldn't handle it any longer. His arm suddenly started to tingle afterward giving him a weird feeling as if his arm had fallen asleep. He then step back for awhile taking into account how long it lasted for better application during combat.* - Mon Oct  5 01:08:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Darius(Gokuflash) watched as the young male before him quickly weaved through the series of handseals only to realize that nothing was coimg from this attack. He quickly thought of it's origins " Fuuton! " He dashed off to the side hoping to evade the attack. Darius then ran forward aiming to get close and try out the young man's taijutsu skills. Darius wasn't very skilled but surely wasn't going to give up.

One of the air bullets had hit him in his lower abdomen as he went to duck the attack. He fell to a knee, soon after standing up and slowly removing his Tanto from it's hilt. " I have no intentions of using this Tanto in any lethal way. " Darius then cracked his neck leaning his head over toward his right shoulder and then his left.* - Mon Oct  5 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Darius(Gokuflash) smiled as he saw his oppertunity to surprise and show his true strengths. He wasn't going to try and stab the boy showing it backfired he'd have just killed the hokage. He rushed in toward him as he threw his Tanto up ahead of him but directly infront of the man and said " Just you wait....I'm coming. "

He began to form a chain of Handseals starting off with Boar. Darius had plan and whether it'd play out like he planned it too was completely up to the young boy now.* - Mon Oct  5 02:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Darius(Gokuflash) continously went on with his handseals "...Ram ---> Snake ---> Horse ---> and finally Dragon. " No way was Darius going to miss this oppurtunity to end this, but with it he might end himself as well. He then took his hand and reached out toward the muddy surface shouting " Lightning Style: Earth Flash! " He had done this skill before and found it leaves a similar sensation in his arm to the output which is given.

Darius was not going to kill the man therefore he tried to only to put out enough to shock him and paralyze him for awhile rather than charring him. Darius was fairly confident he had this one in the bag seeing how the man's fingers were touching the muddy surface aswell.* - Mon Oct  5 03:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) thinks: Theres those Tendrils again...Suitengu is a very strange person... - Mon Oct  5 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Darius(Gokuflash) quickly saw the threads reaching for him as they came firing toward his direction. He grasped the handle of his tanto which sat stuck in the ground and pulled it from it's uproot. He then placed his left hand of the bottom of the hilt and took on a familiar stance used for Katana sword play.

Darius had started hacking his way at the threads not allowing any to touch him and this was not his uprising moment it just happened to be his downfall. The sensation that Darius had all but forgot had suddenly struck his right arm had suddenly become paralyzed from using Earth Flash, He didn't expect to have his dominant fighting hand paralyzed therefore the threads had gotten a hold of him leaving him open.* - Mon Oct  5 03:18:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: I look at it like this. If i'm the strongest around, you can know -exactly- how to fight me. But it won't mean anything.
