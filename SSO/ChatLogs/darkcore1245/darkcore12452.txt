<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: But ran before they got captured. - Sun Sep 13 10:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: I didn't send Baen after you. His mission was to go scout the outskirts of Konohagakure. - Sun Sep 13 10:15:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: And I took advantage. - Sun Sep 13 10:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: So yeah Tethys, Other than that there isn't much to report. - Sun Sep 13 10:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I didn't get a chance to speak to Zetsumo himself but I got a good look at him. - Sun Sep 13 10:22:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: If I ever see her again... - Sun Sep 13 10:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: But that gives us another thing to work on. They'll need to either see us or us see them for their trigger. If we can somehow, make an attack on them while their view is disrupted. - Sun Sep 13 10:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: We would have quiet the advantage. - Sun Sep 13 10:28:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Smoke, or poison bombs... The numerous traps that all line the village, which I'm sure that people of their level can avoid but it slow them down. And, ninjutsu users will be great in being able to give sweeping attacks that won't need direct line of fire. - Sun Sep 13 10:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We should have more sensors... - Sun Sep 13 10:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: It might be a good idea if some of us that can go underground, scout the outskirts periodically. - Sun Sep 13 10:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Yeah, they could also notice if their in genjutsus or not with their abilities. That way it be a awareness and protection. - Sun Sep 13 10:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well. We can't sense chakra whilst underground, but we know everything that goes on above ground. - Sun Sep 13 10:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) thinks: Then popped out - Sun Sep 13 10:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: I was still talking about sensors, in our forces. - Sun Sep 13 10:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm, I know what you mean. - Sun Sep 13 10:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: ... It be nice to know if they have any sensors or medics. They could be pegged from prime targets... Sadly I can't expect that info so easy to come by. - Sun Sep 13 10:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: They probably do to be fair, though they didn't notice me until I walked by them all. - Sun Sep 13 10:43:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Also for those that don't know. - Sun Sep 13 10:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Zetsumo looks like a more evil version of Tethys. - Sun Sep 13 10:44:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Also me and you need to speak about those eyes, Tethys. - Sun Sep 13 10:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I need to know more on that, classified or not. - Sun Sep 13 10:45:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: But the same could be said about chasing after a foe, until they tire you out and turn right back on you. - Mon Sep 14 13:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Seeing as though Sunagakure and Kirigakure merged, they're considered shinobi of the Hidden Mist. Kumogakure has come to the understanding with us that Zetsumo's fall is necessary to the fullest extreme. - Mon Sep 14 13:31:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: So Konoha has no tropps? - Mon Sep 14 13:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: No, they don't. We're currently fighting Amegakure's troops. - Mon Sep 14 13:35:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: If they have nformation then we have to do something unexpected. - Mon Sep 14 13:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: We managed to take out nearly a thousand of there troops while only suffering fourty casualties. - Mon Sep 14 13:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: And this is from merely following their tactic and doing it better than them. - Mon Sep 14 13:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: We're going to continue on that path until we see an opening. - Mon Sep 14 13:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: And what would be unexpected is that we don't charge in and try the wipe them out after such a successful conflict. Bloated confidence that we can finish the rest one on one. - Mon Sep 14 13:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Appropriately confident. - Mon Sep 14 13:38:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Look at how they're fighting. - Mon Sep 14 13:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: I think we have the upper hand knowing they have to rebuild. It's best  to corner zetsumo. if we know he has little to no support. - Mon Sep 14 13:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: If they were stronger than us they would of attacked us outright and crushed us from the start. They'd have no reason to wait.  - Mon Sep 14 13:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Do you not think that maybe they have a plan for once we go after them? Do you not think that they just wouldn't think we might come after them. For all we know, their whole side is littered with traps to spring. Or prepared jutsus that will wipe out most of our men.  - Mon Sep 14 13:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: In war there are no ranking differences. It's a matter of what you can do and how well you can do it. I had a Genin on the front lines with me that took out half the amount of troops I took out. - Mon Sep 14 13:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: That's impressive. - Mon Sep 14 13:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Lets not even go beyond the fact, they might have a second force in hiding. Waiting to hit the village while we go after them, or flank us in any direction they wish. - Mon Sep 14 13:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Stop thinking of yourself as a mere Genin and think of yourself as a shinobi of the Allied Force. - Mon Sep 14 13:41:58 2015

However, his eyebrow twitched, finding his boot only to go into the water with an audible 'splash.'* - Mon Sep 14 18:35:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Namuko(Darkcore1245) nodded, and he grabbed the paper with both hands, closing his eyes. His chakra coursed into the paper with ease!

And..the paper rather, crumpled up into a smoking ball.

"..Lightning."* - Mon Sep 14 19:06:14 2015
