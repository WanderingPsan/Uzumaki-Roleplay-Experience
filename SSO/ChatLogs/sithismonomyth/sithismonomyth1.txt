<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's also intended to be a learning experience. I'm already overseeing some of the training of Nori and Yumiko. They will likely be coming to me for aid more than to their squad leader. - Tue Dec  1 01:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And I presume Geo Dude will be going to members of Anguo's squad more for aid than to me. - Tue Dec  1 01:07:50 2015
