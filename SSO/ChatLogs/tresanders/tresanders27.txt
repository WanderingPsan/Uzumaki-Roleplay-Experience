<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) black hues glance towards Kirie as she walked away..Fujitora did not know how to take this all in..But he did know that he needed time alone..AS Mmeories and the voice of Ushinawa his beloved brother only came up within his head much like how Hideki showed him the life he lived, Fujitora himself was going through so much day be day and yet each step into the light only directed him another shot into the depts of hells darkness.. He looks towards the sky, trying to ease his mind and open such a mind as if a third eye to the methods of which the cosmos would handle such..With that, Fujitora made his way to the western area district of Kiri, despite the bodies,m he'd find an inn to stay within and meditate for some time..This Fuji's mind corroded with bad memory ..

The old days of his past..He'd have to speak to Kirie another time or day ,not being able to do such now due to his honor..And his morals upon those with such eyes..To believe or think he had been fooled yet again.* - Fri Oct 16 22:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinking of the very clan he held dear to him, Fujitora had walked away to a near off area as he thought to himself <Why Am I so weak....I am pathetic to the clan to have not even awaken the basic of the eye...Kohaku..You've gained the sharingan...Hideki..You've advanced on to an entirely new stage...Ushinawa..You lead us all to beliefs of which we thought would be impossible..And I...I've done nothing.." he took out a kunai, stabbing himself in the right leg deeply, a self inflicted wound.

<Why....Why...Why...> he thought , now not only in both sorrow and depression but pain and agony..He took a deep breath to try and focus on the goal, taking out the kunai he said to himself.. <Overcome...And I'll achieve what I must?..Right big cousin.?> he thought of both Hideki and Ushinawa..Fujitora attempting to be at complete peace with himself and to overcome what difficulties he has gained over the years..FUjitora thought of all those that had gained the red eyes of the sharingan before him..Those who walked around with stolen eyes of his and other clans...Sitting on the tree branch with a stabbed leg of which he eventually heals after licking his own blood..Spoke.

"Then I'll surpass myself...Leave the old Fujitora behind...And bring havoc to the Gezo ...Shall I need to.." he spoke only to himself under the wind of his breath, panting , eyes closed and head leaned back against the tree due to the immense pain he inflicted to himself.. Eyes focused to the skies saying.

Phase Two..Complete..Phase Three Within Progress, the world shall know peace, a true peace of which I shall influence..>Sunagakure will be absolute...The world will learn...Ushinawa's death was more than enough for me to handle...Never again..> he thought to himself, eyes closed with the mans chakra at its very peek while he meditates with levels of chakra control and such to be added on to what power he was aiming to obtain within the future.

<No one shall know about the sacred duties of the Labyrinth Moon Cred...How we will shape the world and unlock it's mysteries...> he thinks calmly and by himself...While training what jutsu he was focused on , being his flamethrower and his fire run, Fujitora was lucky to have learned NEWER jutsu in his spare time day by day, wheather it was a gift from someone or taken from the Gezo themself! *Thats right, THug Life!* the man always made sure to keep such intell to himself and only himself of where he obtained his jutsu..

Now looking down towards the group of shinobi below him, he thought <I have no use for shinobi...But rather for those who wish to seperate themselves from shinobi to help change our ways and build the ultimate defense...> he held  a single hand sign during this training, one shadow clone per jutsu he was training in addition to himself being added on to the numbers as well..There was a lot of work to be done as well that he needed to focus on...For now , fire..Later..Earth ...And soon after, the other elements to train as well..Especially Fuuinjutsu with the level of skill he had in such a field..* - Sat Oct 17 05:31:05 2015
