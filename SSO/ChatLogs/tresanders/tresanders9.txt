<br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking to the tree, he gestured for Zenaki to come by him, taking out some shuriken of his own, he'd first throw the three he held within his hand, though it looked to be just three of them, it was really six, as the others were shadowed under the rest. He'd be rewarding her for the efforts of gathering herbs to better herself on the fields of medical, though for now, some marksmenship abilities would be most helpful as well "The only person I've taught this too was my daughter..I think you and her would get along just fine..Izanami knows how to toss weapons better than I do." he states while he waits for her to try as well.* - Fri Sep 25 21:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking to her once again, he'd repeat the jutsu this time with kunai as he spoke "It doesn't matter which weapon you use, just so long as you can conceal it within the shadow of another.. He was curious as to why she was coughing..Probably nothing big.

"Something in your throat?" he asked , expecting her to try and perform this simple ability.. As he'd show her once more again . "It's nothing my dear and gorgeous assistant can't handle right?" referring to the ability he was teaching her.* - Fri Sep 25 21:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) curious, the young man nods his head to this "Right.." only to try and focus on the main goal of getting her to learn this jutsu..Though he had one issue of keeping his lust under wraps when she was near him, seeing her figure and features, he attempted to just keep it professional as a master..Not trying to let her find out his weakness.. He soon came to see that she was working hard at what he was teaching her. .

But alas, the coughing came about once more, sturring up a feeling of worry within the mans mind "Zen..." he states her name , then grabbing her by the arm after she took what ever she had "It's just a bad season for you right?..All these natural chemicals floating about..We'll be heading inside soon for us to rest and study...For now, once after you've gotten this down, we can move on to one other ability I wanted to teach you, okay?" he tells and ask of her, patting her on the shoulder with a soft grin.* - Fri Sep 25 21:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) releasing her hand, he allowed such ..<Must be her daily medication...>  he asked "If you need..We can make more of those later.." he softened up for her at moments like this.* - Fri Sep 25 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes of concern glares at the direction of Zenaki, looking back towards the tree "Carry on then." he says, not truly wanting to be as hard as he was, but he was in denial that a medic like her could be sick or really need meds for anything too serious. "I want to see you try this now, known as the Manipulated weapon jutsu..Or shuriken, either way, it can be used with both shuriken and senbon..Probably more difficult, but if you place poison on a shuriken, it can be deadly..Now follow my lead, as smart as you are, this will be easy to get down with such focus and expertise at hand..So without much else to add on .."

He'd soon reach into his backpouch where he grabbed four shuriken to toss into the air, channeling chakra through the threads of wire to manipulate the shuriken around the tree, then surge his own chakra flow of fire towards it to burn, the man would have demostrated his own verson of the ability seperated from the basic art..Now doing such again so that she'd get a bette runderstanding of the basics, he said to her. "If you do not use any elemental jutsu, this would be good for you along with most other things I can possibly teach you.." he tells her with a small smirk.* - Fri Sep 25 21:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) shaking his head he says "I'll provide you with shuriken just incase such a time comes where you will need to make wire traps..Who knows, if you throw a senbon hard enough, it'll pierce through a target and leave wire behind within their body like sewing needles.." he said with a light chuckle..Lending her some shuriken with the needed material for her to practice with.. "The ideas this can be used for is endless..And if you wish, later I can show you a simple fire trick." he tells her.* - Fri Sep 25 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) impressed at her willfullness to try anyway when she had little to no experience witht he shuriken, he smiled and would pat her on the butt saying "Good job Zen-Zen... Now we can get to experimenting if you'd like... I know you'll need test subjects, so I'll be one for today...Or if you'd like, we can continue to work on your aim with weapons, take a break even.." he seemed to of been nicer to her for today..Was it because of Suitengu being away that he was trying not to get her any more dull than what she was.. He worked in mysterious ways.. But over all for this part, she learned the basics to shuriken manipulation.* - Fri Sep 25 22:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) nodding his head to Zenaki, he's lead her inside where they could begin the experimenting "I want for you to perfect your abilities to the ebst that you could..Even if it means using me as a test subject, you understand?" he tells her while they went into the home, forming the five seal barrier around it from the outside after all was locked. He placed a single arm around Zenaki to hold her close, as he embraced her being.* - Fri Sep 25 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) rubbing his chin he says "Well, sometimes when needed , we must take certain risk ,right?.. Once all is gathered, we can experiment first upon the bandits..When you've gotten a great understanding of it, then you can try some on myself." he tells her while they were in the house, lab equipment all over on the desk..

"Tell me though, any particular goals that you are aiming for?.. Zenaki." he'd ask, curious as to why she wanted to become a medic after all.* - Fri Sep 25 22:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) couldnt say much to it but he understood what she meant..He smiled as she leans against him, they sat down on the couch .. He looked at her and said "Well you've done a grand job so far..You're pretty much a scientist and medical expert..Which is why I wish for you to push yourself with such skills." he says.* - Fri Sep 25 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) rubbing her hair back, Fujitora then states. "You know...I do all I can because I care for you..I will always keep my promise to protect my dear Zenaki." he plants a kiss on her forehead before taking one of the tables to slide towards their direction, some medical tools upon it and FUjitoras blue prints.. "Though, unlike my cousin Ushinawa..It's sad that I have yet to awaken my very eyes that he himself has.." he sighed.. "Someday perhaps.." * - Fri Sep 25 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) nods his head "Yes, awaken..Doujutsu , is a bloodline trait, like those with silver eyes, but my family is different..We are the ones with red eyes and tomoe ranging from 1 to a total of 3 tomoes as my cousin explained to me...I am not too sure if I even possess the ability to awaken these eyes, as I have tried many times before..." he then looks to Zenaki "Something that he could tell her openly, he trusted her with such words.* - Fri Sep 25 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking to her to talk on the topic, he speaks "I've been through much in my life and the eyes never shown any form..Though there was one time in battle where I felt their power , facing off against a bijuu...I won that fight, but the next day I woke up drained...I tried concetrating chakra towards my eyes to see just how well it'd come but nothing happend..I've tried a lot of things to bring out my doujutsu..I'm starting to believe I might be one of the few that the gene skipped.." he thought to himself..* - Fri Sep 25 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I see... - Fri Sep 25 23:07:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) placed a single hand on her leg . Rubbing.* - Fri Sep 25 23:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon leaned forward only to kiss Zenaki on the lips once he used a single hand to turn her towards him. "And more than just close." he bit her bottom lip gently as he pulls away to release it.. His hand reaching down into her pants ,easily while he smirks at her "Surely you wish to please your master in more than one way hm?" he did not touch anything yet but his fingers were nearing.. "But what if master wishes to please you?" he asked while going to gently kiss her on the neck.* - Fri Sep 25 23:25:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) showing the woman a small sample, he made it into a quick change of form , taking his time to aim at the house he leaped and jumped towards it to deliver this powerful kick, with chakra added for strength and impact to the sudden speed gained from it.* - Sat Sep 26 01:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) standing there as he'd explain before turning around slightly "It's very simple, even a Genin could do i-----" before long he was kicked into the wall of the house <GAH> taken by surprise, landing on the floor with rubble all around them "The hell was that Kirie?!" he'd shout and ask, Hozuki maidens probably running in fear.. He would then dust himself off after such.* - Sat Sep 26 01:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) sighed from what he was told "If you're going to learn this ability, you'll need to practice it . " he eventually got up, "Though a spar does sound nice. But not day, I am too focused on finalizing the creation of a new jutsu.."he tells her ,trying to help her up if needed.  "However, maybe a nice massage from y' can fix me up for a spar hm?" he joked with her, playing the old perv card as usual.* - Sat Sep 26 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) nodding his head, the man said "Well I suppose I can if this body can endure a bit of extra damage." he chuckled lightly, taking position away from Kirie "Though, don't expect for me to be as serious as I was earlier..I might even use Ninjutsu this time to mix things up ." he tells her while holding up his own stance.. * - Sat Sep 26 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) face palming hard "Aye, Aye, Aye! Oh my Gawd....." he says to the destruction she was delivering to the home.  He knew that he'd have to pay for such damage later.. That was caused by her, he got into his stance.* - Sat Sep 26 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) watching Kirie come towards him, yelling the name of the ability she was using he thought to himself before shouting back "NEVER ! Ever! Ever ! Ever! Shout the name of the ability you're using! " before drawing out his bokken, a wooden sword used for training to better her combat skills against sharp weapons, he'd perform a powerful swing that would be powerful enough to possibly deflect her and the kick, thus knocking the woman into the air most likely as he thought to himself <Moon Art, Ryu Uprising > before using the crescent Moon beheading to strike with. Seeing how she'd react to his counter attack.* - Sat Sep 26 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) watching the woman recover from her fall , coming towards him with a sudden kick of the dynamic entry towards his face, he would use this reflex to block such with the palm of his hand while another hand reached out to try and grab her leg, as he'd be using the blocking hand only to grab her foot in his attempt to slap a Fuuinjutsu ability upon the skin of her, thus storing away his bokken into a lotus seal for now. With such focus on her, he did not consider the wires as a threat, but they were despite his plot.

He soon leaps back, trying to avoid the wire, but more than likely he had failed to do such..He did not try to resist much to this new jutsu but rather he tried to see what his seal would do from the direct contact he and Kirie had a for that moment.* - Sat Sep 26 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes focused on Kirie, the overheat sealing placed on her making it so that her body was looking to exceed the boiling point much suddenly from the way it was placed . Fujitora was held by the bindings of wire she placed around his arms and body . Smirking a bit "My...Lots revealing in this summer heat aint it?" he asked while attempting to back away from the wires, him trying to break free with his strength.

"You sure it was me?" he joked a bit.. "Sure you haven't been slacking and gotten out of shape?" trying to hide the fact that he did do something.* - Sat Sep 26 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon once she had fallen to a knee or so, he'd bring up a single hand sign, to deactivate the seal he had placed upon her "It still is...I was testing your durability against your own bodyheat.." he soon went to offer her a single hand to help her up "Do you want to continue? I wont use that jutsu again this time. " he tells her as he stands and waits. "Though there is something I do want to test...But I wont allow you to fight something like that on your own..So we'll stick to basic sparring.. " he tells her as he awaits for her to get in sparring position, round two. "Nice figure by the way." he teased.* - Sat Sep 26 03:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) feeling a bit guilty towards this, he kneels down infront of her "Yes...Yes that was Fuuinjutsu.. " he tried to get her attention. "Thought you'd be expecting me to of used that.." he figured she knew his specialty by now..Though with Fujitora, it was never clear what the man could truly focus in. "I'm sure you'll benefit from it later..Those who survive the heat and keep running are usually the ones with the most build up in stamina.." he'd attempt to help her up by placing one of her arms around his shoulders to stand. * - Sat Sep 26 03:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) nodding his head "Because ,there are some things that must stay within the family..It's why my teaching is limited to those outside of such." he tells her while standing about the other side, waiting for their spar to continue or not "It is becoming late..Should we be heading back soon." he speaks.* - Sat Sep 26 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) points to her left leg "It was there, but it's no longer there now that I've released it earlier.." he soon began to make way to central or his home where he could study both the creation and mastery of his certain few jutsu. "We should be going then.  You'll be fine though. The heat leaves just as fast as the seal did."* - Sat Sep 26 03:43:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon as he lead them all out to the destined area, the man would perform a few hand signs thus charging up the matieral chakra needed for his fuuinjutsu ability to be used. Seeing that there was not too many trees to find in Kirigakure but some rocks here and there along with other forms of matter, dirt included, the man would focus this chakra to bring it all in from below and aside, the tags spreading out to the trees and rocks. Clashing together they made a 15 meter golem at the command of Fujitora, he stood at the top of its head when looking down towards them.. He wanted to test the very durability of his creation.. Having mainly stone being made of it and wood for the limbs, he said as he looked down.

"How much can you damage it, before it can become stronger?" he asked, though this had a big toll on his chakra.* - Sat Sep 26 04:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) //Note that the tags ate in 3 areas, 1 on the head, other two on the shoulders.. Stregnth added up to 22 as well..Speed is lacking though.* - Sat Sep 26 04:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Making the war Golem would take up even more chakra...Though for now I guess I can meditate till they find their way up here to try and destroy the tags...That one though..Must hold a doujutsu similar to my family..Hm.. - Sat Sep 26 04:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) standing atop the golem , he took note that one of them had a form of doujutsu, he began to wonder..Just how easy it was for some to obtain and how difficult it was for himself..Fujitora soon placed such aside while he looks to see that Suitengu's attack was coming for the golem, looking to bring up a defense, Fujitora commanded it to use its arms as a shield, hoping it would block some=-------Mother fucking people keep writing him messages in the middle of a mission.

He took a second to read and write, being at a disadvantage, the man soon began to think more and more on some ideas, how he could make it harder for those around him to damage the Golem..He began to focus, a single hand sign, building up chakra for later, but for now he'd be commanding his golem to fight.

Once the damage had been done, the ebast began to regenerate, soon to bring up a single arm and slam it towards the ground before them..Fujitoras concetration assured some added speed to the attack of the massive beast..These attacks probably not so hard to avoid but tiring to do so..* - Sat Sep 26 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) spotting Koji and his great efforts to utilize close combat on the golem, Fujitora challenged the kids bravery "Show your strengths! Young one!" he declares while maintaining the hand seal he has held for a while, saying under his breath >But it will take much more than that from this point..< he finalized the concetration of his chakra, seeing that this was going to be even harder than he thought it'd be, he figured he'd test his theory out even more.

From the base of his feet, spreaded the fuuinjutsu markings to be formed around the body of the golem, adding and extra seal but different over the previous that was on the ehad of the golem, causing those seals to sink into the surface as Koji runs up the arm of the 50 foot beast.. These seals , during the attacks to come were all for the five seal barrier..Since the being at use as non living, this could be applied to such as an additional armor.. Fujitora knew that it would be a challenge even without his additional barrier..

But to react to Koji, the golem swong its arm around in a 360 degreee angle after it may have to regenrate OR May NOT have to regenerate from the attack of Suitengu.. All of this probably depending on the result combination of the two Fujitora added..

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: As we advance..They give me newer ways of how I should add adjustments to it...This thing being incapable of Nin or Genjutsu..Perhaps my own fuuinjutsu may help to such. - Sat Sep 26 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) // Note that the golem is 50 feet tall.

Head Attachments = 1 Golem Tag, over this 1 Five Seal Barrier tag-Forbidden

Left Shoulder= 1 golem tag, 1 five seal barrier tag.

right knee= 1 five seal barrier tag

left knee = 1 five seal barrier tag.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) standing by with his arms folded as the two would send out their attacks, with the golem looking to defend with his shield like arms against the two attacks, it'd suffer some heavy fire from both the flames that were sent and the kunai explosion, though these flames would result in some damage towards the beast.. Fujitora knew that it's not actually damage the earth too much but rather the tags he had placed for the five seal barrier to make the  beast almost impossible to damage..

When he saw their efforts he smirked a bit <So far so good..They are using their heads..But even if they manage to destroy one tag, this golem wont stop regenrating..> he thought as he'd continue to watch. The man was not using any jutsu but rather he was observing, even though he should of been, he decided against it.. But soon enough, the beast was hit in the torso or maybe the shields of his arms that he'd continue to hold up as a Obelisk to defend against the fire..Trying to use the effects of the five seal barrier to his advantage.

"I'll have to reward you two for your hard working efforts..But this golem wont be taken down as easy as you'd hope-----" though being new with the Golem, it did begin to become unstable at the right knee..Slowly regenerating. Fujitora took note of this flaw, leaving an opening for another attack almost depending on how quick the two could react..But to defend this weakness, Fujitora commands the beast to swing its massive right arm towards them.* - Sat Sep 26 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) having the two face off against his beast, the man watched with folded arms . Spotting them seemingly making a plan, he commands the golem to slam another fist down towards the ground, this time much quicker with focus then before in an attempt to counter the coils being made and short towards it, the beast knees were open , as well as his center, using both of its mighty fist from the cocnetration of Fujitora to lunach a series of wild rapid punches. <Do you believe you can dodge this for long?..Golems..do not get tired..> he thought while, one of the coils managed to slam into the beast torso!

Possibly being pushed back! or however the coils would effect the being.. Fuji stood by and waited for the rest to come.Wondering what would wind between the rapid punches and the two standing before it.. This concetration of chakra came at a cost to add speed.* - Sat Sep 26 06:09:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) stopping the motion of the golem due to the sudden smoke, he thought to himself <Maybe that was a bit much---> before looking to see a sudden lash of blackness coming towards him from the smoke, he figured that at first they were aiming for the golem..Fujitora had reached for his bokken, he had traced the long trail of such, trying to act on the defense only to be knocked off of the golem, landing about on the ground below him roughly and hardly sticking the landing..He looked over towards them and said "You've done a good job..I'm proud in the efforts you two have made.." he smilef softly as he performed a single hand sign which would release the seals upon the golem thus making the beast return to nothing but regular rubble.

"Mission complete..But I think that if you tried to bind it together, then you'd have an open shot, but you both played a great part in working together and managing to blind side me, hehe..." he tells them as he rewards the two.* - Sat Sep 26 06:42:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon would clap his hands together , focusing his sight on the trees and stones around him, since those stones were all near by, it would not need much time to gather that type of material.. He leaped back jumping onto the mountain cliff behind him, his hands still held together before slapping them upon the ground, with markings of fuuinjutsu spreading about, tags being formed from what he could provide after he had utilized the shunshin jutsu, thinking to himself. 

<Shadodow clones with such ease? > he thought , his chakra surging through the rocks as they formed to make the being of his creation, along with such came the size and durability of the very stone (12) that could be influenced upon it..He did not want for the girl to hold back so he'd let her take it all out on his new design.. The Golem which was at his command as he shouted from the trembling ground that came as it stomped its first step towards the clones.. Full body, four arms and glowing blue eyes.. 

His arms folded while standing on top of the 15 meter Golem..50 feet to be exact. "We're both students of Hassan...Let's not disappoint.." he states loud enough for her to hear.* - Sat Sep 26 10:04:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking down towards the woman or teen, the man would command the golem to take on a defensive, considering that it was dealing with fire, wind and earth, Fujitora would need to make a move for this one. He leaped down as the golem took guard, he made a shadow clone that would take place.. His clone began to dig into the ground while the golem took on heavy fire of all those elements..His clone looking to go under ground with the hiding like a mole jutsu in order to get near the target..Meanwhile Fujitora himself would have began to focus his chakra to form a genjutsu upon Lera after he ascended back to the top, this genjutsu being the Mist Servant Jutsu..

However he suffered burns from the heat, even though the Golem could regenerate and take heavy fire, the flames got by it.. Fujitora eventually got back to the top, adding a new trick to the beast, by palcing five additional seals upon it..Considering that it was a non living being, it could be treated as a building like structure to protect with his five sal barrier..Fujitora worked with his mind.. Though he had taken damage, he continued to keep the fight going. Having utilized much speed and reflex..

<She doesn't hold back a bit..> Waiting for the shadow clone to reach her location under groud, expecting it to be concealed due to all of the attacks..But once the attacks had ended and adjustments were made, the man soon commanded the golem to throw rapid punches towards the direction of the girl while making way towards her <Golems do not get tired like humans..> he knew that with such massive punches going her way and the genjutsu being an issue, she'd have trouble..Each punch shook the ground, looking to destroy some clones and cause indirect damage to her.* - Sat Sep 26 10:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) arms folded and a bit fatigued after using a genjutsu along with making a shadow clone to go under ground to try and utilize the ehad hunter jutsu on one of the three clones or more.. Since the five seal barrier had taken place, it would matter less if Fujitora commanded the golem to take a defense or not..It stood there with its single shield up in an attempt to try and block on time before it continued to attack..The shield, likely deflecting the lightning back towards them, as the properties of the Five Seal Barrier applies..But, considering it was lightning, it may of managed to still deal damage, still resulting in the golem regenerating slowly. 


Soon Fujitora stood atop, scanning the area, he drew out his katana, waiting till the real Lera had appeared, the genjutsu likely being rid of, no longer taking effect..Fujitora kept his katana near him.. Eyes closed for a split second, while waiting.. <This theory has worked out well thus far today...The Five Seal Barrier upon a moving non living structure..> he chuckled lightly. The Golem pausing all movements for a while, his shadow clone still under ground, searching just in case..* - Sat Sep 26 10:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) standing about on the top of the golems head, he looked around the areas, not being able to find Lera, he'd hold his sword aside him lazily as he said "Can't seem to find her-----" before he was shot by the wind of a single air vacuum which breezed and cut through a layer of his skin like butter, the man soon tried to slip dash towards the side in his attempt to roll on cover, using the golems giant head to hide his being, laying low he thought.

<Sneaky..> before long he'd go and place a single hand on the surface to push himself up..Now the golem would lift up its massive hand to slam about on the ground, not aiming to not crush but to shake her out of the ground which each force of impact, indirectly trying to hit her while the clone aims to track her down within the earth itself..Fujitora kept an eye out and open.. Performing a few hand signs for now, taking his time to wait.* - Sat Sep 26 10:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: She uses Fire and Earth..Then Wind..Much like myself..Hmm. - Sat Sep 26 11:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) finishing the hand signs needed for his jutsu, the young man soon went to command the golem itself to  try and punch its way through this cavern of an earthly prison.. Thinking to himself once he had the opening he needed, though it was not going to be soon for him to do so, the golem took its time to try and break through.


The shadow clone still under ground in a chase to find Lera, eventually found itself surfacing to try and rush towards her with the use of kenjutsu. Looking to strike and capture her off guard with his swift swings.

Once the real Fujitora had an opening, he'd release one big exhale from where he stood on the 50 foot golems head <Katon..Goukakyuu!>  aimed towards the girl.. <She has skill I see...Can she block it?..> only if he had the time to in the end.* - Sat Sep 26 11:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) somewhat blinded by the sight of his flames exploding upon them, now spotting that three clones were facing his single shadow clone.. The katana abilities of it had only gotten so far it seemed, causing the clone to be destroyed by the smarts of Lera..He commanded the golem to walk forward towards her.. The golem soon again began to raise up its hand and begin its attack..Eventually leading to another series of rapid punches down towards the area..

Fujitora though, looking to engage the girl in close combat would try to utilize his shunshin abilities to body flicker his way down towards her, his katana drawn out with the attempt to swing his blade of the blunt end towards her from aside..Looking to catch her and her clones attention as the golem closes in towards them.. He did not need to be on its head to control it with the link of fuuinjutsu and ninjutsu involved.

Fujitora aimed to deliver a swift strike to her hip.* - Sat Sep 26 11:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) // The golem continued its rapid punches to shake the surface and strike all those enar while Fujitora engaged Lera in close combat, looking to land before her, he was taken off guard by a combination of attacks coming towards his direction or rather the entire area..His eyes widened towards this as several to few fire balls were coming directly towards him, now taking his guard, the man thought to himself..

<One other trump card..> he'd think while focusing his chakra about his body only to formulate a shield of fire much like Hassans Wind armor, this was Fujitoras own and primary creation being the Fire Shroud , which he'd begin to focus all of that power to a single point in order to halve the damage he'd be taking from all of the flame..His Uchiha clothing being burned mostly, and having suffered some burn marks on his body..He emerged from the flames, still standing, his blade coated in fire, making his way towards Lera after recovering from the damage ..This being him now making much of a rush to place the katana by her neck which emitted much heat.. 

"Will you yield?" he'd ask with a tired voice due to the damage taken and the shield.* - Sat Sep 26 11:33:20 2015
