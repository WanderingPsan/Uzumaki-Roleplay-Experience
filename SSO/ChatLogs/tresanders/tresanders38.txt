<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) leading his son out to the very distant area of the village where they'd soon enter a cave deep into the underground which was blocked by a powerful barrier made specially by Fujitora at the time for this case, leading his eldest down to the lab room and the fuuinjutsu containment room , an Amulet stood afloat on the pillar which reeked nothing but Sinister chakras all stored away into it, and upon walking into this room , all of stored chakra leeked and flowing about, images of raging demons(bijuus) of the collected chakra remnants and excess would be noticed greatly..* - Wed Nov 18 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking back to his child he answered with a serious voice "As you are just finding out, with my title as the Labyrinth King came a discovery of a certain Amulet, utilizing it with my fuuinjutsu came the birth of a great supply of what came along during my years with my first wife..I used to track and hunt down the beast known as Bijuu, monsters that contain extreme amounths of chakra, with them I discovered fellow host as well...My most recent, the Ape Bijuu Host..He had died such a short while ago, but I keep a vast collection of his chakra within my storage...Soon I hope to have my Genecist and Wife Zenaki clone this chakra and make something of perfection to my research to help mold the world..To a better good, a flow of my ambition.."

He grabs the Amulet and holds it to where it would be at the center of his chest still visable to Ivel.. "And thus I bless few trusted with available chakras I have to offer that would not stop my current project...Though these are not the full bijuu alone...Their chakras are still a high threat just a bit weaker...Perhaps someday you'll find the Original source of the chakra gifted to you and take hold of it fully..." he nods his head as the chakra began to surge the amulet ..Fujitora looks to Ivel.

"I wish to bless you with the Ape Of Heat." he so calls it..* - Wed Nov 18 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon thrusted his right hand which held the Amulet marked of fuuinjutsu towards the boy as many scrolls marked as well were around them to support this arranged sealing, the man spoke to his son "And so shall you have it." he channeled his chakra into the orb to then seal the chakra of this ape (Yonbi) into the boys body , which in turn came to the steady formational use of the Eight Tetragram Seal which is Two 4 Symbol seal usages together made to have the chakras leek into the body of his son and even mix if such came to be, Fujitora used his Sharingan along with his to better focus and have an added control to the power of the seal..Eventually ending it with the beast likely being within his son now.

To support this he made sure that Ivel was kept still by restricting his movements ,knowing how painful it would be..Utilizing his fuuinjutsu to its very best.* - Wed Nov 18 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) finalizing the 8 seals with his chakra flurishing upon the boy, Fujitora stripped his own hand and amulet away from him, Ivels body likely glowing a bright red from the chakra for a few moments before it all began to mix in...He says to him .

"My son..You are now a Psuedo Jinchuriki...Someone of extreme potential and power..Let this be our secret within the family.." he tells him while looking to help up his son if needed, though for now , they'd maintain in the containment room so that Ivels body could adjust to the major change, for his chakras to mix and such to have him adapt to what just happend..If he fell asleep, he'd probably even notice the beast chakra but not the entire beast itself. 

"Rest..You've recently learned much, about the sharingan and bijuu...You will have much to learn in the future with fuuinjutsu as well..Maybe even one day, you'll inherit the throne and title of the Labyrinth King." he explains.* - Wed Nov 18 06:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) upholding the chains, he said "However it's up to you to bring upon such an adventure..The Gezo seems to find these beast easily , Hassan informs me of them and I go after them for their flesh and more, though one has gotten away , I don't think that it'd be too much if you were to be prepared by then..If you find what ya search for." he says.* - Wed Nov 18 06:24:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking to his daughter in silence, the death of Tetsumi had shaken him, knowing that it could of been anyone of them in the house that day of the explosion, as this death of his loved Step son brought up more of the hatred within him for the shinobi whom he did not know and the Gezo as well , the man shook his head to his daughter as he tells her.

"Like my father before me...I'll never die." he said simply brimming up a small smile upon his facial features, eyes focused on his daughter, he felt weak and out of place with this world now a days, how many grew in power, he remained the very same, despite his constant meditation on some days, his eyes have had yet grown since the time of their evolution, now looking to bring out the best of evolution eventually as Hideki guided him , he took steps as this man had an influence from beyond the grave with Fujitora.. The Mangekyou Sharingan...

Eyes of which Fujitora now wishes to obtain only to seal away with the rest oof the doujutsu of the world to strip the unworthy thieves of something so sacred to the bloodline of many..He thought of Tetsumi, how he suffered through life and how it lead to this tragic end, because of what? What drives people to kill one another, what makes it so worth it so joyful to take a life? Fujitora saw this as enough, nothing really crossed his mind at this second and moment but thinking of protecting his family of Ryu and his children.

"Even once a Phoenix Dies, It is reborn , comes back stronger than it ever was before.." he chuckled lightly.* - Mon Nov 23 03:32:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking to Izanami as he reacted according simply by swiftly and quickly drawing out one of his many katana or rare sword, springing towards Izanami as well as she did him, this was him attempt to utilize his advance speed and movement of the Crescent Moon strike to send her into the air through his strength and movement as he said simply.

"Don't hold back Izanami.." he says with eyes narrowed upon his daughter, trying to push her close and mid combat abilities, in doing so, if he succeeded in up casting her into the air with this strike, if she blocked or not with his attack speed of 19.5 base. He'd follow up with a leep towards her.* - Mon Nov 23 08:08:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking at her as he leeps towards her now in mid air, seeing Izanami rushing back after him with her own diagonal attack, he'd utilize his abilities of mid air combat to shift his weight and attempt at performing a flip over his daughter while sheathing the blade of his known as UP only to draw his main bitch katana, which was the Ryushini no yari, he did this in order to not strike but to leal int the air even higher, using his strengths to gain the distance with twice the leap into the air, awaiting for their battle to take place in the skies above.

"You'll have to do better than that Iza...You know the opponent you are dealing with.." he tells her as he levitates slightly in the air by going against the gravity from the previous leap. No flight just jumping high.* - Mon Nov 23 08:19:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) focused on his daughters movement , seeing but not truly moving from where he was as she flew up towards him with the attack, his reflex and sensory plus his focus on to her was enough to provide a good counter strike which was a simple block of his blade to hers that aimed to slide his side, he said to her "You're pretty fast.." he states, as his base may of been 14.9, he kept note of her jutsu from the previous spar, so he said to her trying to then push her blade back with his own by adding the power of that very same jutsu towards it.. In doing so, he'd blitz past her ,aiming to strike her with the blund edge of his blade to her left leg..* - Mon Nov 23 08:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking at Izanami he states "Your fire training has exceeded my own, I'm proud of this." he chuckled lightly towards the situation, he soon went to hold his sword aside him, the two pretty much hovered "Perhaps we should end this for now..A huge display of skill only leads to those learning your most sacred abilities from you.. " he whispered "A capability of the sharingan..." he tells ONLY Iza as they wer ein mid air high up.* - Mon Nov 23 08:37:32 2015
