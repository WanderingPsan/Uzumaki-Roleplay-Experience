<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking to Marrisa he replied "You as well huh?...You're growing from the previous Marrisa I knew eh." he'd look at the ramen that was ordered..Not too used to trusting Kumo food though..So he stared at it and ate one of the vegetables.. * - Thu Oct 15 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) placing a single elbow on the table as this FUji took a gaze towards them "Friend?..Always assumed he was your brother or something along the lines.." he nods with a near emotionless stare, taking the cup of tea ordered only to mix it to form a tiny whirlpool..<Yet my ways have changed as well...Ushinawa..Nae, all of my relatives have suffered, and in death people have taken their eyes for power...Those eyes are not rightfully theres, they are of the Ryu and Ryu only..> he ponders when considering the new resolves taken..Eyes soon shifted up towards the other two.

"So why have we really came here aside from the triple date eh?" he joked .* - Thu Oct 15 03:42:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) mixing the tea still he answered "A good resolve to suggest..Though no one really likes me within the village aside from my own kin, because of the authority to give missions and teach new jutsu..I've learned to seperate myself from such attachments of fame and continue the duty of what I currently have...Honestly , I retired a long time ago but..." 

Sips tea slowly and with caution..

"I keep getting dragged back in..It's so silly...Like puppies they'll run to you when they know they can benefit from you, yet I only teach those I select to partake in my Labyrinth.." he said coldly...He cared little for leeches and those he couldn't use or gain a form of trust from.* - Thu Oct 15 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: When Kastya died...They only cared about what happend to the bijuu....When I nearly died..They only cared about my functioning as a shinobi...When I've  lead them to safety, they only followed because of my power.... I care little for shinobi now..My resolve is around my clan and those dear.. - Thu Oct 15 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes shifting to Ortho for a moment "Just don't tell her about the teachings..However I wont be able to seriously teach anyone with the arts of Fuuinjutsu for quite some time..Need to study ancient arts...Nina is a kind kid, a generalist like me with an open mind...She'll be trained well even if she does not succeed in the Labyrinth.." he says calmly, a gaze now settled to Marrisa.

"All of which depend truly on ones perception of what they can truly learn from someone, who's trying to strain away from the daily life of conflict and strife.." * - Thu Oct 15 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) refilled his tea cup , letting him have the time needed to think..For he had decisions to make. To take teachings within the future and lie now..Or to never take teachings..

Fujitora spoke "And as for the fishing trip..Well, we are still preparing..I've amassed over hundreds of certain seals needed for this.." those being both the jutsu related seals and the traps for when ever they came to face the mighty Saiken..Already having an idea of its power, he knew they couldn't approach it head on.* - Thu Oct 15 04:32:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm...Okay then.. - Thu Oct 15 05:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) mixing the tea as he looks at them the man spoke "I wasn't always -from- Suna..I'm actually from a far away place you may know as Amegakure..I grew up there as a child..But eventually me and my family left and arrived in Suna...When we got to Sunagakure, honestly I hated it there and everyone in it...Wanted to destroy the village for how things were, so unfamiliar with my ways being from another country, the heat did not help at all too much either..But eventually I became  a Genin there...Was not long till I met the Kazekage...Kastya..She was beautiful and made me soften from my ways, though I still tried my best to seperate myself from the village and focus on the shinobi world itself...As I trained and progressed hard and alittle quicker than most others...I found myself challenging Kastya to a spar...Heh..I didn't think she'd take me so lightly..But because of such I outsmarted her..."

Took a moment.

"And from that day, we only grew closer to one another...Eventually ended up going on a date an such..However, I felt pathetic the way I was..Not being as powerful as her to defend her from danger...Knowing she was forced into the positon of Kazekage, I tried my best to rid her of such..She was so focused on her work and wanted to help others... "  he skipped the part of which she turned into a bijuu..

"Eventually though, we got married...She was my first love growing up..The only person who tried her best to make me feel at home in Sunagakure at the time...However..One day she got ill and passed on.. From that day on, I've had a void in my heart..However such a void was taken care of seeing the daughter we had together grow day by day....My father Hassan used to train both me and Kastya, hehe.Those were the days.." * - Thu Oct 15 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon sips his jasmine tea "I've long since made peace with this..But what about you?..What's your story dear Marrisa?" he asked as he tilts his hat up.* - Thu Oct 15 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) listening to the words of Marrisa.. "I see, do you miss anything of Konoha?.Now that you are with Sunagakure?" he asked while mixing his tea. Shit just never ends, gotta mix it and put some more sugar cubes into the bitch, then mix that hoe like there was no tomorrow after tossing some honey into it as well to make it even more so naturally sweet.

"You have an interesting past with such an adventure within it..When Suitengu was alive..I was his guardian..Even though the boy was the son of my enemy Zetsumo who wanted to kill both me and my wife Kastya...I passed aside all hatred and forgave..The boy grew on to me, trained him as much as I could before he left to take his own journey..Swore to protect both him and his aunt ... When the day came of hearing about his death..I was shaken..Suitengu met the very same faith as his father because of what he had been born with.." he ponders now <Those eyes..>

"Though me and Zetsumo were great enemies and had many chances to fight and kill one another in battles and war..Our encounters were only talks to one another...So I had no problem taking his child under my wing as an oath of new resolve.." he said..Fujitora had many of those changing life experiences..* - Thu Oct 15 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking at the two , seeing Marrisa speak in such a manner, as it has been forever since he met someone who spoke on those very terms of which Kastya talked to him as, with a calm and yet self controlled motive..Bringing Fujitora to believe that there was some hope in shinobi, but mainly in the students he had selected..

Finally the tea was done with the mixing, he soon would lift it up, taking a sip..Thinking of what was said..What could of been hinted as Marrisa had changed for the greater, and wanted for Fujitora to do the very same..Closing his eyes for a second , thinking of all those who chase him to be the teacher he was, for those to chase him for what he possessed.. Fujitora simply thought of it as leaving all his worries behind and just simply but finally...

Letting go of it all.. Taking the time with the two clan members of his to be at peace with himself mentally, as stress had done nothing but build up over the years.

Let it go.* - Thu Oct 15 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: An old monk ..Yukio used to lecture and teach me about the good..To think that his words were so meaningful to me at this day.. - Thu Oct 15 06:00:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) lifts tea cup "To the Ryu." he says to the clan while drinking the small cup of tea..Being at a calm state of relinquishment and so on.. Fujitora was just at a Zen like state right now with how at peace he was being away from Sunagakure and letting go of all the stress, the vengence and worry because of what words of Kastya arrived in his head.* - Thu Oct 15 06:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) now looking towards the two as he sits there to think for a moment, about how he should be to seperate such attachments, to just let go of thepast, the vegence, the hate and so on with this time of peace to be alone with those of the Ryu and be at complete meditation with himself and the other two.

"I'm glad I took the time to leave Suna..Thank you" he says simply with a soft smile upon his facial features.* - Thu Oct 15 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) nods his head towards Marrisa, being at Zen, this was probably a place of peace much like the monks temple..Fujitora took advantage of this time to place himself in a deep mode of zen since he was here, sitting on the pillow with his eyes closed and only to open slightly to look over towards the two.. Thankful, he sips the tea and eats the ramen..His hat was placed aside for the time being.* - Thu Oct 15 07:04:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) waking up wthin the keep of his home only to walk out of Sunagakures  mansion as he thought to himself < Last night taught me a lot about myself..Not that I must kill my emotions..To live the life I walk, to access that of which the universe has to offer, I stand here today in my meditation , complete with zen ..To finally let go of all the pain, vengence, suffrage to grant myself this serenity..> he ponders to himself within a zet state , Fujitora was meditating on the very mansion roof top itself...Eyes closed as he tries to open his very mind alone, deep in meditation, deep with the focus and balance of Zen he himself was maintaining..

He had seperated himself from the flock this day, as he was on the roof, sitting on a mat with old fashion symbols and markings upon it, a single cup of tea, the container and a leaf of Amegakure naturals before him..The Green tea as pure as ever from the leaf..Fujitora took in deep breaths to clear his mind and move from this point on.. Holding up a single hand sign, the tiger seal.. Which soon would break, resting his hands on his knees..To look up towards the sky.. Thinking of the very future itself to change from where he was currently and where he was going.* - Thu Oct 15 15:35:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon would knock on the surface of the mansion as he said "What do you think protects this building?..Sheer design and structure?..No..Barrier Ninjutsu does. And Fuuinjutsu, one of the most basic yet very powerful ones.." he spoke in a calm voice , this Fuji looks to Kilm saying  "Certain proerties of Fuuinjutsu can be counted as Barrier Ninjutsu...Much like Space and time, the most basic property of this art is to summon of course, can range from animals, objects, insects to human beings..Who knows, maybe even gods and bijuu as well.. To get down the basics.."

He sips his green tea.. 

"Take this scroll..Try to summon out whats inside of it.." there was no weapon inside this scroll but a giant Gorilla statue, this was Fujitoras method of testing Kilms learnings and chakra control to summon out a 10 foot Gorilla statue...Also so he could drink his tea and eat his rice..* - Thu Oct 15 17:15:56 2015
