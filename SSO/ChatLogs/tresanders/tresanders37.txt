But for now he worked on his twist and turns when in mid air, that way he could not only perform the basics of mid air combat but be able to do what was needed to be done..However so for now, he also maintained his abilities with the movements of flicker fighting, trying to be able to move at swift paces from area to area all of which he needed to go, couldn't just let himself resolve on combination on just running, if he knew he were going to be taking high risk, he'd need to be quick with all that he could do and not just some rookie..So his chakra control would be worked on as well...

Though he was a rookie at flicker fighting, nothing would stop him from achieving a greater goal of what he desired to aim for..Since he did not really make a secondary profession too much officially yet, he knew that one day he'll be able to surpass just the novice and advance on to the higher ranks of flicker fighting abilities to better surprise his foe and keep on his own toes with all that he could do with the use of his sharingan eyes...His mind was set on being a flicker fighter since he was young, so he was going to be someone to complete such a dream..With his high levels of control, he knew it'd be helpful to do..So for now as he practiced both his flicker fighting skills and his mid air combat skills, the man relied on his high reflex and sight to determine his very movement of just where he'd be going to end up eventually and how he would be getting back from point A and B...* - Thu Nov 12 00:47:47 2015

<Last time someone got ahold of good files,, they probably were duds anyhow but a thief is a thief and threats are threats right...> he ponders once more, the man began to hum as he went through his work, thinking about all that has happend during the very course of the week, something he was relaxed with unlike many other times where he was stressed, he kept a level head, trying to think about just how much he needed to act on enforcing law upon others and the village to keep the place safe, though he has changed many times over the years, he maintained a STRONG Lawful mind, with destruction or none, but some people just didn't pay their loans off..He shook his head.* - Thu Nov 12 01:02:17 2015

As such was being done, he said "Solemn Judgement, Penalty Of A Common Shinobi..." this pretty much meant that they weren't going to be nothing more than what they currently were..However this was just a title, it was something formed to highly cripple the target..As the boy sat binded, FUjitora left his judgement to be the deliverer of such work to be done..
