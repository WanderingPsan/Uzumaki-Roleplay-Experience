<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) considered that after this, he should change his identity once again for some time as he created a shadow clone to help make this seal more than easy to complete. Looking at the Hokage while leading her to a more private area, where no one can examine Fujitoras work. There he will begin to study this seal that was placed on her, before he even began he requested "Please don't eye me like that..Makes me lose focus with something as fragile as this." the man then just resumed his work, using his high focus to add on more power to the breaking of this seal formula.. <Noriko's signature seal...Must of been a reason behind it..> he made sure to keep an eye out, this being the work of the clone anyhow.. * - Tue Sep 22 13:02:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) whispers: (or has seen, such as terrain or people) - Tue Sep 22 13:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) whispers: (You'd probably know it keeps her from speaking or writing about certain things, or hand language, etc) - Tue Sep 22 13:07:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) whispers: (He wouldn't determine the exact restriction, but he'd be able untwine the seal and breaking it.) - Tue Sep 22 13:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: (pretty much) - Tue Sep 22 13:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looks at the Hokage and sighs "I'll have to take you to my lab." he meant his room of sealing so that he could focus more and talk in private with those others. So they'd be escorted.* - Tue Sep 22 13:08:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) made sure to get direct contact upon the seal, the time it would take to completely break such probably would be around half an hour as Fujitora made small talk "So Konoha managed to obtain a new Hokage I see..Much has changed after the death of old man Z I take it..How is Ame?" he asked while performing this task. "And what can you tell me from your own point? How my unsealing you would help a revolution to Sunagakure?...I may not care too much of that place but I do need answers in return for such actions.." he just maintained his focus, both as a clone and more.* - Tue Sep 22 13:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: I will say, though. These seals? - Tue Sep 22 13:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: They're entirely responsible for the war. - Tue Sep 22 13:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) chuckled lightly "Haha..You're lost of what I ask?..One of those friends of yours threaten to kill refugees if I had not unsealed you, so that he can make a revolution for Suna..Makes little sense but eh...People go to war over so much, it's why I've retired from the shinobi world with my final act..." he spoke, the seals power being diminished from the being of Katsune.

"Killing seems to be a big thrill to those of this world..Sickens me to think of such..." he had yet to kill a single soul. * - Tue Sep 22 13:20:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Orakuru and Kitora hm?...I knew the two..But I was not. - Tue Sep 22 13:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I figured you all had some form of bloodlust. - Tue Sep 22 13:27:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) //Upon landing, he'd look at Zenaki before letting her down once they've reached their destination "Still didn't answer my question but..." he'd cut himself off.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) drops his head .. <Damn...Am I going to get anywhere like this?> then lifts it back up and looks her directly in the eyes  "Sushi it is then..Then we'll do some experimenting later as I mentioned.." he smirks a bit while placing a single hand on the wall of the Inn infront of him, only for him to be closer to Zenaki .

"You see..I'm just trying to make ya a bit more happy.. And how come you wont tell me your name?..You know mines don't cha?"* - Tue Sep 22 16:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon but surely ,he'd retract his arm. Maybe he should of stroked her long hair back but he was not that type of guy to make a woman feel so uneasy. He held his hands to his side "If it satisfy your desires then fine.. Now..Tell me your name. " he looked at her with a good stare, before he'd lead her into the home where Sushi would be getting made. "And yes..Fujitora is my name..I am the Sannin Of Seals.." he answered.* - Tue Sep 22 16:11:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) sitting at the table, he had a spot for her to sit by or across from him, the sushi freshly made, he offered each , grabbing his own pair of chopsticks.* - Tue Sep 22 16:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eats one sushi roll as he looks towards her "So shy I take it?" he stared directly at her to test her confidence and bravery "I take it this is new to you? Sweet Zenaki~" he tested her more.* - Tue Sep 22 16:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) grinned softly before moving over towards her only in attempts to rub her shoulders "You know, you don't always have to be so short with the response.." he said as he activated the gofu kekkai seal around the house so that they could have peace and silence without interruptions.

"I can tell, this may just be your first date." he says or tries to say softly to her ear.* - Tue Sep 22 16:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) was hit with the first deny then a double deny . Trying to maintain himself he took in a deep inhale.

"Aw c'mon..What's wrong with being close?..If we may end up partners later, we may as well get used to it~ " he joked before going on "I don't think anyone should be so distant. Baby girl~" he tried his luck.* - Tue Sep 22 16:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) hesitates to make a move for a moment before just sitting down aside her, not too close but enough to talk "Did I fuck up?" he made a blunt question. Reaching for a pair of chopsticks to show his nicer playful side, by reaching to his plate to offer her a single sushi. "You can't be this way all the time right?..Eat.." he told her as he offered.* - Tue Sep 22 16:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) showing only so much emotion on the outside, on the inside he was like <YUS!> before placing the sticks down and pouring the two of them a cup of wine , red wine for the both of them. Though Fuji's taste of his own cup was like a Tea Wine mix, something he did not want to really make known to most of his unique flavor preference.

"You like wine ,yes?..Come, drink some. Some say its healthy for long life when taken at the right times.. " he smirks towards her with a sly expression.

<Got a date with a fine woman, so far so good..Patience be with me!> he thought. Making sure to keep himself from getting too close to her for the time being. 

"I think one of these days, you'll come to like me more than what you do now." he took a silent gaze into her crimson hues.* - Tue Sep 22 16:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) would only take a sip of his own wine first "Though my wine, I like to brew naturally, like tea.." he tells .

"I'd like to believe that with all the time you have, there's a possibility.. Dear Zenaki." he says in a near seductive voice .

"You and I are on a date after all..Surely you must of secretly desired this.." as he soon gently lied her on her back, of use from speed to open her legs to be knees past his own hip. 

"I'll always protect you, so long as you remain mine.. You'd like that wouldn't you?" he asked with a darker tone almost. It could be seen that some part of him felt bad for her and that he was hesitant with his glare for an answer.* - Tue Sep 22 17:15:18 2015

While he'd go down and gently give her a bite on the neck "DOn't you like..Alittle experimenting?.." he used these words and motives to open her up. Using alittle force as well. 

"You desire this, don't you?..You desire happiness." Fujitora's eyes met Zenaki's eyes , one other hand reaching to wrap behind her back and pull her body closer to his body.

"You know you want too~ " * - Tue Sep 22 17:30:40 2015

He figured she liked alittle pain.

"You belong at my side now.." he'd then use his strength to push himself closer to her "Don't be afraid of someone being close to you...Embrace it!" he demanded of her to do.

"I try to show you my promising care..And you pay me back by pushing me away..Embrace what I offer!" he tells her while using both  hands to open her legs now and replace himself upon her.

"Embrace the future we can have together as we travel this world..You've accepted the protection I offer..I wish to simply seal the deal." he told her.* - Tue Sep 22 17:41:45 2015

He waits patiently..* - Tue Sep 22 17:53:42 2015

Depending on what happend to the clone. Fujitora would then perform a series of hand signs for another jutsu. Holding his hand out,he was using a form of Fuuinjutsu to fire out his own large number of shuriken from a piece of sealing paper, all twelve shurken attacked to strings that he'd be looking to surround Izanami and Kirie with if she were int he area .* - Tue Sep 22 20:57:10 2015

Trying to swing at Iza only to stop an inch away to test her abilities.* - Tue Sep 22 21:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) keeping an eye on Izanami, he'd soon perform another back swing towards her after the full swing he just did was done with her managing to dodge and escape the hit..Doing this to fully test her skill and ability while this time he made sure to push her limits by using more speed to test her reaction speed.

"The mment you're hit, you just might be subjected to my sealing abilities." he warns her as he casually makes this look like sword dancing.* - Tue Sep 22 21:13:23 2015

Well nice tactic I would suppose." he tells her , taking a moment to perform his own hand signs to summon out a single monkey, anothe rjutsu he has been looking to teach his daughter for a while..The monkey held scrolls on his back, he opened one of them that was labled "Air" in japanese Kanji before it'd attempt to release a great breakthrough if Fujitora managed to summon it.* - Tue Sep 22 21:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) focused upon this act, he soo leaped towards another direction to try and avoid the combined fire power of the wind and great fireball..Fujitora landed on over to the opposite side before saying in a yawn, the monkey unsummoned "That was quite impressive today..Great work Izanami." he tells her.."But daddy, Is tired right now. and needs a breal..Study that scroll of the shadow clone jutsu for me please dear?" he chuckled lightly.* - Tue Sep 22 21:32:09 2015

" he went closer towards the boy , no hostile motion but his aura was a lawful one..Fujitora eyes the boy till he could look him directly into the eyes "Made a promise to your aunt..So, you two will be under my protection now, just so long as you don't go overboard. Eye to Eye?" he said eye to eye as a form of understanding.

"You may just recieve training from me if I can even provide such to benefit y'..Anywho, the names Fujitora." he offered his hand to shake, eyes looking into the boys as intense as any male would.* - Wed Sep 23 16:18:33 2015

My daughter will not be another Kastya..Kastya did not fail either..She managed to control more and more of the Bijuu during our training before her death, and when the time to train comes once again, I will be there training my daughter the very same way..If I managed to defeat a tailed beast twice, I will do so a third time..Even if I'll have to use its own chakra against it and partially become one myself...No matter how you put it..My duties as a father are stronger than those of what I had as a shinobi..Even if I becomea demon..So be it..I'll exeed the exile." 

Fujitora then reveals a hidden marking upon his left hand running up his arm, his own long term project of sealing remnants of the Gobi's chakra into himself..Not too much but Fujitora was prepared.

"We do not back down ...I'm sure you'd do the same ..As a father.."* - Wed Sep 23 18:24:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) reacting upon the actions of Ushinawa, the young man Fujitora would stand there as he emits a burst of heat from his body, along with this came the summoning of the Nuibari, one of the Seven swords he held, while some were given out by the will of Tethys, Fujitora held the rest at his choice.. He stood there ,possibly with the flames heat burning him to break him out of this potential genjutsu of better yet, defend him from the punch if it were real or not.. 

The Fire Rises.

For When you've been caught, you've been seen, murdering the next of kin, ate their eharts, drank their blood. Washing your face in blackened mud. 

A poetic thought that this man had for the Gezo, and those of Kiri on his list to take down and allow his lover to experiment on freely..

"Like I said..No matter the distance, I'll go..AndI will fight. " He noticed Hassan, he could nod to him but he was so focused on the topic at hand. The flames circulated Fujitora, but being careful to not burn Zenaki , Maybe not Mariana...we gotta burn that weave to reveal the truth. But he maintained it around himself as the armor he currently wears to prevent piercing, given by a blacksmith in Kiri.* - Wed Sep 23 18:47:53 2015
