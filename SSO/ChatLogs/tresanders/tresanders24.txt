<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes focused into Hideki, but alas a moment later he was caught within the Sharingans glaring genjutsu which showed Fujitora the formation of the ebast as if he was there..Walking about to see it all for himself, he himself looked up "Oh No..." he knew all too well about Shukakuu from the earlier years in Sunagakure..But to think such would have happend again in Konoha.* - Wed Oct 14 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes widened greatly under the mask , seeing the destructive forces of Shukaku strike the Konoha shinobi and their home. Fujitora fell to his knees and said to himself <I've failed my role as a step father...What could have triggered thi--------> his head shifts to the left, for now the man would be seeing the body of Ushinawa... 

This was a trauma that he did not want to have to go through , as the pain surges through his head both mentally and physically causing such a truama to his body and soul, seeing the very Death of Ushinawa at first hand by the sharingan genjutsu prowess of Hideki...FUjitora shouted a loud roar of painful agony as the volume ascends to the ground skies, his hands gripped tightly on his own head..

Seeing the dead body, the death of Ushinawa <Big brother!> as the child image of Fujitora would be sub conciously imagined to be running after the fading away Ushinawa..From the childhood to the veyr adulthood of the shinobi world, brought the man to shaking...Fujitora, his face within the mask, tears running down and arms shaking from this.. He was the mask they wear..It's fear they hear..Both spirit and thy voice..Fujitora was not expecting to discover the pain of such today...Heart in pain as if it were at such a stage of no longer, as if a hole would be there from the sorrow after.* - Wed Oct 14 00:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) having sight upon sight, truama upon truama with each heavy caused linked to one another, it would be felt that FUjitora was focusing his anger and hate to a single element within the memeories being played back, his new hate and resolve around those who had taken the eyes of the Uchiha, those who were not even blood connected, taking the eyes of someone who they new nothing about..Now FUjitora was so angry to wishing to take the eyes of the wrongfuly gifted...

Now seeing that Suitengu killed Seisuke made Fujitora a bit more calmed but stil having the killing intent within himself rising as the eyes of his beloeved relative were taken as weapons to those greedy shinobi.. To see that Hideki had stabbed the eye stolen from their brother made FUjitora smile, thus joy bring summoned upon his mentality , however rage remained for those who stole the eyes of his relatives, one could only imagine how poor Kohaku suffered, how EVERYONE in his clan suffered to be used as weapons only for their eye prowess and remarkable chakra..Fujitora tried to focus ...Focus... * - Wed Oct 14 00:42:14 2015

To have seen such go on, the man was pissed, but then he got on to thinking, that now it was time for another journey, he needed to follow in the footsteps of Hideki from this point on as a relative, to have gone through similar things just as Fuji did..The young man  focused his frustration, his desires..Goals and so on to these events..<Ushinawa..I'll inherit your will...> he refers to the sharingan, as he focused chakra  about his body directly towards his eyes, but seeing that it would fail..He just gave up and became Non dependent on such..

Instead he figured that for this, he wmight have to keep depending on his current skills before such...He had went through stages of Denial..Fear..Truama..Pain..Deaths..Acceptance...Accepting that he and his family lived in a corrupted impure world..Fujitora , decided that there SHALL be change.* - Wed Oct 14 00:55:53 2015
