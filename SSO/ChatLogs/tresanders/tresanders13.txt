<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) slowly began to perform hand signs of all types, no jutsu, this was just him being casual with a form of training , talking to them in the process "So, now that we're away from the crowd, which of you wish to go swimming, I wonder." he joked in reality, just to tease them about the fact of the situation being one man with two women. He gave off the Roshi laugh...

"I kid, i kid...But seriously, you two should probably train your chakra or something since we're here." he suggest.* - Tue Sep 29 02:48:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) just watches the girl train. <Maybe I should...> he performed the shadow clone jutsu to go out and perform the leaf whirlwind towards the very direction of Kohaku, with the attack speed of 12.5 base.. Simply doing this so that he may test her method of training.. Looking to Kirie after his hair was ruffled, wanting to do the same for revenge but he knew the risk was too great.* - Tue Sep 29 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) //

Soon the clone OF the clone would face off against Kohaku, holding a stance.. "You think you can handle the shadow clone of mine?" he asked now looking to Kirie "How about you train with your hand signs? " he suggest..Soon after the clone would pivet its way around the girl.* - Tue Sep 29 03:30:46 2015
