<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) going into the house, Fujitora looked on over towards the torture basement of whih Zenaki always went to and tormented people..He figured she was doing an experiment..Thinking about all that has happend, he went down stairs towards her, looking for her.. He had a strong thought process of this change when he went downstairs to tell her.

"Hello Mistress.." he said coldly in a dull gaze.. Eyes focused upon her as he walks ever so closer with his blackened hues.. * - Thu Nov  5 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes focused on her, they were then closed by him shortly after, though he sorta liked the way she currently was, he could not continue to allow her to constantly be palced at risk..And for such love to be carried on, Fujitora opened his eyes in order to commit the very change of thought , just as he acted quickly against the Gezo who attacked Hassan, he acted with his scroll unraveling and streching out towards the two, an easily manipulated technique utilized by the locksmith to bind the both of them from toes to shoulder and their very limbs, in doing so with his advance chakra control, it make the jutsu all the more quicker ...Fujitora soon opened his eyes only facing Zenaki with the sharingan eyes showing as he said..

"Within time, I'll ask for your forgiveness my love...You will continue your experiment but ...I will not be labled...You place more lives than yourself at risk...Terrible you've behaved.." he said this coldly yet not in an evil way but rather in a more Lawfully justice way..

"I can not be mad at you for....The bone...But, I can not punish you just yet..As you still carry -Our- young...Our offspring..You have been acting very..Very...Wreckless..You little demon...And yet, you declare me the villian?..How wrong you are..." he stated  before the cloth slowly began to wrap around her head as well..Fujitora was going to begin a new process of enhancing an old seal that would keep her more safe from herself than a threat..If she managed to escape from the grasp of his cloth binding technique, they'd begin chasing her down...His eyes locked on her chakra, he knew just how he would mold what he was about to do..

"You'll be yourself again...Once they are born..However..You've been caught..You've been seen...Murdering the next of kin..Ate their hearts, dranked their blood, washed your grin in blackened mud.. Now you use your power against me as you did?...Heh...You forget my power.." he stated.* - Fri Nov  6 00:05:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes focused at Zenaki with a cold gaze, this gaze became a glare of solemn judgement with him being close to her, he told her "Silence...Before I stich your damn mouth up...You damned fool.." he tells her before thrusting his arm towards her ,piercing through the cloth every so aggressively , his hand on the chest of hers..Dead Center with his eyes focused on the chakra within her , he continued to talk..

"You call me rapist..Yet you are the one who has eaten the flesh of many..THousands of bones , lives , eyes and organs lie dormant in your belly...You may say you do not want the children now...But months ago..You TOLD me how much you'd love it..And so, I am bringing that day time and moment back...Fuck your tainted aura, fuck your experiments, fuck your hatred, fuck your desire to eat flesh, Fuck your weave, hair and FUCK Your Memory! "

As her hair came towards him, he reached to his side, drawing out his passively blazing katana with the seals upon it activating, his eyes narrowed intensely upon her aiming to slice the hair from even touching him while the cloth would continue to wrap around her body thus aiming to prevent her from using any other jutsu...With his he aimed to use the seal once more, aimed at her mind he said coldly...

"Obey..." the good spirited man at this moment was serving a strict code of justice, acting upon his fatherly insticnts to protect his mate from herself and the children within her.. With this and his advance speed to react to her hair upon sensing the chakra ahead of time, even seeing it.. He told her.. "This time..You have lost..With my check mate..I have won.." he twirls his katana to forge his reverse grip, now stabbing it deep within the ground to spread such a marking around the room which was already arranged within the house...This was in order to help empower this seal.* - Fri Nov  6 00:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soverign...He stripped away his hand upon contact thus finalizing such a seal with a lock to such as if the old her of which came before this madness had returned when she refered to him as her lover.. Fujitora then said to her with narrowed eyes once more "Justice..Has been served..Obey..As this is the very law of The Judgement Dragon.." he told her , now slowly unwrapping from her body to ease her down.. Fujitora could of done much worse, he could of stripped away her ability to use Ninjutsu..But he loved her ad could not do such to her and leave her defenseless.* - Fri Nov  6 00:41:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) sovreign...Upon falling to his knees after this little fight, looking over towards Zenaki with a blank expression and stare off towards her, oh how she has changed yet he never once changed his heart despite his rethinking on how she currently was..The mans love never diminished but his hatred for the Gezo on the other hand only increased..He saw that he would need to change himself both mentally and spiritually if he desired to maintain this peace of this world..

Considering himself ready to challenge such forces of evil as he said to her "As much as you've changed..I've not..Is this true love?.." he asked himself , now going on over "However my duties as a father..Will always overlay such no matter the cost..I've thought it over, thought over my very future and I've decided to bring about this change..I'm Fujitora Muhhamad Ryujin..You've just tasted my solemn judgement.." he said feeling alittle changed mentally yet maintaining his old self.

 A form of hatred only building up within himself towards the very group that threatens him and the village..The Gezo..Though Hassan was different, there were many others within it whom Fujitora strived hard to surpass..<I need more power...And if I become a demon..So be it..I'll exceed the exile, all in sacrifice..To protect her, he and them.." he spoken within the basement of this house, standing up now making his leave, a new change to mind and a new hatred from an ember growing into a flame, the fire rises both slowly but surely.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) lawful at heart and lawful at both spirit and heart, the man continuing to live by his moral standards.. Thinking more about the path he has made for himself instead of the hatred beyond it , as he had done way too much to break his inner peace, the man thought about his place in the world as the Lawful good and now wishing to act more upon his place..Much like how Marrisa may of been Heroic, he would be going about his task to maintain law and maintain his mind and influence the very lawful good from himself on to others.. This was his new resolve and newer thought process through the week he had been through..As he had dropped the law upon Zenaki, he will drop the law upon the world.

"I am the Lawful Good...I will bring up a -new- law for our people to follow..And Maintain such..As this is my place is the world, my affiliation and my very way of life that has been so greatly developed..As I have done half a year ago for the days of which before Kastya and after she ascended to the pure world..I will continue to uphold this law..As both councilmen and a farmer... This is who I am..No better no lesser.." he thought to himself aloud , taking note to this little change or rather a suggested change for himself to better such a change..He was looking at the man in the mirror, asking him to change his ways...Asking him to return to his OLD ways and improve them.. Taking his step further into the world alone , though he thought of this through meditation and considering all changes, despite his hate for the Gezo, he was strongly against those who broke the law..SOmething of which he valued, that was apart of himself to maintain and balance... He will be the veyr Law of the Ryu(Uchiha)..* - Fri Nov  6 02:49:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) being with them , the Fujitora looked into the room as he felt the chakra of the man from earlier, one of the Gezo Privates, he knew this was bad news, and so the clone gathered himself to prepare at activating the Five Seal Barrier within the mansion, as the doors were shut tight and made so that it'd be near impossible to break, he said to himself..

"No Escape.." Acting on his lawful terms , he started to summon up a bit more chakra to call upon the golems within the village in order to try and surround this mansion just in case such would be broken, this Fuji would be able to help out more and more by maintaining the building and keeping it locked up, on a strict lockdown he said to himself <After all...I'm..Just a simple farmer.." he thought ,holding up a single hand sign so that such would be well focused with his ability... But mostly, he added an additional seal to the room of which that very man was located in order to try and trap him ONCE the time had came..However being 50% weaker, this held his strengths down a bit.

"If we can corner him, his speed will likely be closed, thus giving Tetsumi an opening..So all of you, work with me on this one, take four of these special tags and kunai in order to throw at this man..It's the goal..Formation Overheat Boundry Link.." he told them as he prepares for such, the Fuji (2nd from this one) held the kunai, preparing to enter the room, as 4 of the tags were handed to those willing to help...Since getting close felt out of the options. This was his attempt and theory..* - Fri Nov  6 03:37:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) sovreign, upon entering the room from the side of the door going in, he took out the scroll given to him by Trilliam , first letting out the 40 spiders given in order to try and capture this guy off guard, but along with the gifted series of spiders , came FUjitoras own sealing tags that he threw towards the man, a number of 6 seperate tags aimed for his general being,  he even aimed for them to wrap around the swords of this man, he simply needed for atlease one of the tags to land or two at least, he  allowed the spiders to do whatever Trilliam made them do with their ability to crawl and such, trying to corner this man...Not being able to use a particular jutsu just yet, he waited , as the other Fuji was outside..He prepared for the worse of this man, acting from his lawful duties ..Thinking about just how much worse it could get if this manw as actually holding back..

<All the spiders Trilliam can offer along with my tags of the Overheat Sealing..If we over slow him with abilities just as this and weaken his time to strike back, it should be a mission success in the thousands of efforts made to capture him!> he thought but now the other Fuji *as weak as they may seem* began to manipulate the cloth binding seal as a follow up, attempting to even try capturing this man in the cloth , probably as durable as his own chakra control...While one was capable of jutsu the other was not utilizing any but rather tossing tags and letting Trilliams spiders run at the target.* - Fri Nov  6 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) having the kawarimi take place now with the 2nd clone being placed outside, intell gathered on the ability of the target that they would not let escape, this clone went by Tetsumi, giving him a signal to take action while trying to maintain the cloth binding seal, this time trying to manipulate it in a fashion of which it'd hurl towards Machbeth trying to restriction him with the speed it was moving in...He shouted.

"Do not set them off!.." he mumbled "Tetsumi, now!" as the frontal barrier was opened as a -Pass- to allow things in and out.. Perhaps now Tetsumi could summon out his sand.. Fujitora had about 3 cloths now aimed and chasing after Machbeth through his control now that the other clone was destroyed, he could not allow a second lost.. Allowing in outside help..Maintaining such a focus he  came about a though process..

<For decades Suna has been tormented by you people, I will NOT allow you to fuck up our Law and Order! We are the LAw we are Sunagakure! We are the very people! And you are our prisoner! So bow down before us and our Solemn Judgement!!!> he thought with his sharingan active for an ehanced control over the cloths.

In this attempt to try and capture the man off guard as IF it were a death hug or roll, it'd be trying hard to seal off some movement of his or rather attempting to place onto him the overheat sealing,, Fujitora was trying hard to not allow his step son to be captured by this mans blade, saying to him "Damn you.." after whatever he may of done..But in this attempt of trying to mark the man of the seals, the clone TRIED using up additional chakra to sustain the clone for such to take place and not poof away the moment of...Though this was taxing on chakra, this was for the sake of fighting for the veyr law and fellow man, a self sacrifice... The barrier had too much time remaining before it would be sealed off again..Fujitora knew this and focused greatly on this great attempt to place the seals on the man... No matter what he'd end up grabbing..* - Fri Nov  6 04:54:24 2015

"Why do you allow him to be as he is.." walking up towards the two as some hand signs were made Before hand..His lawful duties being carried out , thinking to himself <This man caused us too much trouble, he broke the law, my ath of life, and how we should act upon it..The risk is too great, and I wont let such shit happen again with this fucking softy blocking us from victory!> he thought with the extreme look of hate in his eyes for the gezo..* - Fri Nov  6 07:14:20 2015

The clone soon activated his cloth seal in the attempt to try and block off some of the in coming damage as shown in the show, it could be used as a defensive!

Sadly..He could only help one...If all hoped had failed with the cloth as a acting shield wrapped around the area befoe them somewhat in a circle, he'd attempt the fire shroud to block away sme of the incoming explosives!

YOU SEE THAT SHIT! HEEM!   As Fujitora pointed at the Gezo Human Filth with his blade, he said calmly.. 

"I will go by the Law...I will grant such a man his wish of enternal slumber, who are you to stop his final request in his moment of solemn judgement?...I'll tell you who I am.." he took a moment to focus his fire shroud to the single point of his blade, holding the sword with both hands now, as the chakrams began to glow as dragons, his sharingan fully bright as he approached.

"I'm Rick James Bithc.." -omit this..

"I'm Ryujin..Fujitora.." he looked to Ketsuki, wishing to heal her but his anger and law of judgement surpressing such..."

He spoke "There's no way..We could of fixed this...And for that..I am sorry..Ketsuki.." he softly placed his hand over her head after a gaze into the girls eyes..Feeling some guilt for this, it was like she had died in his arms...Only because of his current ways did he care for one to die happy and not in pain.."Please..Rest in Piece.." he says to her as a final parting.

Fujitora looked back to the GEzo with an angry look upon his face, standing after placing the body at a palce of rest "And you preach of peace within a world of war?..These people..They know nothing of peace, only law can bring about such a boundry, who are you to say otherwise?..Law is what keeps order, peace can be granted but not by your methods of being ..So..Weak...The man..

<Solemn Judgement..> if Tetsumi were to complete his coffine with his sand..Fujitora would wait untill the time came to thrust the very katana of his into the sand and through the man..Flames condensed of fire and fuuinjutsu, Fujitora aimed to seal a certain ability of the mans away..To be sure that no such thing happend again.* - Fri Nov  6 08:20:03 2015

Fujitora not waited for Tetsumi to finish it off fully, enough for the skin to grind into bits of sand to nothing for blood to be absorbed..Soon after such, the sword was sheated with a small hilt spin.. 

<Solemn Judgement Completed....Rest In Peace...> he says , eyes fully reverted now.. The Law sustained and now he looked over towards Tetsumi with a small smirk on his face, the two made sure the law was not broken..
