<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) took a second to realize the girls youth after he had gotten close enough to spot the tomoe..

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: There is? - Sun Sep 27 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Like a massage? - Sun Sep 27 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Mhm.. - Sun Sep 27 03:12:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: It's just a massage after all. - Sun Sep 27 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Oh, sure. - Sun Sep 27 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Come, we'll get to a room...Hope you wont mind, first time massages are usually a bit funny at first..Feeling strange and all. - Sun Sep 27 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Come, we'll get to a room...Hope you wont mind, first time massages are usually a bit funny at first..Feeling strange and all. - Sun Sep 27 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: It's fine. - Sun Sep 27 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) leading the girl up north towards one of the inns or homes, the man soon placed a five seal barrier around it to prevent interruptions, looking to her he had a bed in there. "Hm, lay down on that...However you want the massage ,front body or back.. " he says to her, getting the lotion for it he thought to himself <Just a massage...Nothing more right?..> pulling his sleeves up, now waiting on her to get on either the bed or massage table..Was her choice.* - Sun Sep 27 03:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) nodding his head, the man soon got to the side. "But first, take off the shirt, leave anything below on though..Since clothing can get in the way." he waits while rubbing his hands in lotion.* - Sun Sep 27 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) slightly blushed from this, he replied while he'd begin to first rub her shoulders "Y-yes that okay..If it makes you more relaxed." he thought about something <Does she trust me this much?> he ponders to himself, using his strength to squeeze down on pressure points and tight tissues under the muscles of which she may of been sore, mainly around the shoulders..His hands well experienced with massaging, he used this to loosen up such areas above the shoulder before scrolling on down "So tense.." he tried to avoid the breast, his hands going down to the side of her body, as if he had a grip on her ribs when sliding his hands down to her hips and back up with a soft squeezing motion to loosen her muscles up a bit more..Seeing the pants he asked "You'd not mind if I remove these right?.." he needed her consent. She was young, he couldn't take those chances.* - Sun Sep 27 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) gave the girl a soft nod to assure such.. "You don't have to worry... I'm good with full body massages..So with those legs good and ready, you can sprint miles.." he says with a soft grin. His hands moving from her sides to rub the lotion upon her breast..He showed a light light light blush from his facial features..Hoping she was not going to be too alarmed from such.. 

Soon he'd glide his hands down to begin massaging her legs, softly he'd grip on to them to feel for any tense tissue, which he found all mainly to be on the back of her leg rather than the front "Turn over to your belly now.." he ask of her, getting more lotion.. A slight boner was formed from the man giving this one a massage.* - Sun Sep 27 03:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Keep it professional.. - Sun Sep 27 03:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) having the next set of lotion ready, he places both hands first on a single leg, sqeezing them tightly to loosen the muscle then applying some motion towards it he'd begin to do the same with the other leg..

BUT ALAS!

His eyes..Were distracted, looking at her figure from behind..He'd try to shake such off, since his job with the back of her legs were done..He had to go up from that point. He soon placed his hands on both her legs, flat. Gliding them up to get into her panties if she had those on , to give her ass a nice squeeze , having it being apart of the full body massage, he did it for a while..His manly grip upon them, his rod only hardening  he thought <NO!...NO!...You stay that ass down!> before pulling his hands away only to get to her back, or rather.Wait for her actions to see if she approved or not. Him standing directly behind her, now having her legs spread apart to get more in control of massaging her body.* - Sun Sep 27 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: idk when that activated - Sun Sep 27 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking at the situation he thought <She doesn't mind?..> massaging her inner sides of her legs..The man soon spotted the fuzzy bunny tail <DANGEROUS!> he thought, taking the age into consideration, but then remembering..His ex wife was married at 13 so to him, it could of been fine..He figured she was atleast 16..Thinking more on it..

Then finally..His hands went up towards her vagina..Her legs spread, he'd lean forward, looking to pull her panties aside from blocking him for this moment he said "This one is more of an..Oral massage...Hope you like it." he told her before he'd attempt to lick her pussy for once or twice to see how she'd react.* - Sun Sep 27 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) spott----he felt the hair, touching his chin as he licked her "You like it?..This is the first time I've done it to someone within my own clan." he says as he continued to not only lick her but rub her clit at well.. Massaging it slowly and with some pressure added to see just how well she could endure as his pants gotten tighter for him.. Eventually, one , his index finger was inserted in to see and feel her reaction.* - Sun Sep 27 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon and eventually, one thing lead to another with the two.. The man positioned himself on top of the girl, she had a nice ass it seems.. He pulled out his rod, hardened. He whispers to her in the ear <Sorry if this was crossing the line..> before slowly inserting his shaft into her, placing his hands on her hips , pulling the girls body towards him to push more in and gain control. As he began to thrust slowly and steadily.* - Sun Sep 27 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) gruntint from such he released a bit of a manish roar , he pants and looks down towards her "You're so tight..." he slowly thrust himself into her , fucking the girl before he asked "Just how old are you anyway?..16? 17?" he asked with a soft smile, pounding her from behind at a reasonable pace which wasn't too fast or slow for her. 

He continued , placing his hands on top of hers while he did this..* - Sun Sep 27 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) slowing down a bit he gave a gentle bite to her neck when she spoke. Then he heard the jail line "1-14?!........." he stopped immediately for a moment..Then he'd slowly continue <The damage has been done..> her walls so tight on him and moist, it was hard for any man of himself to say now.. He told the girl. "Brace..Yourseld.." gripping her hip to turn her around to lie on her back now , placing her legs around his hips as he began to pound her untill the moment or minute came where he reached his climax, doing so with some restraint for the girl, his rod throbbing near the end as he continued. * - Sun Sep 27 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: and shove them in your ass. - Sun Sep 27 04:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eventually as he was nearing the climax, having been experienced with sex, he pulled out as soon as possible, his rod rested on top of her between her legs. And like T-pain... Skeet Skeet.. the man reelased a last grunt.. Resting himself over the girl, he looked her directly in the eye before planting a kiss to her lips "Hope you enjoyed that.. I pulled out way before the end..So you don't have to worry about being a mother any time soon.." he told her before standing up to go and reach for his jacket and pants.* - Sun Sep 27 04:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: 9brb - Sun Sep 27 04:35:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon grabs her butt, bringing her in closer "Soon..Meet me by the water fall where it'd be safe..I think you've earned my trust for a certain Fire jutsu." he tells her. * - Sun Sep 27 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) nods "But first..Some business I need to tend to." he'd be waiting for her or to meet her at the waterfall..But first he had to find Zenaki about the experiments.* - Sun Sep 27 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Oi..How goes it? - Sun Sep 27 04:43:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) smiles at Zenaki, walking towards her "I'll be at the waterfall training Kohaku for a bit...Mind preparing that pizza for me while I'm at it?" he asked with a soft smile. Reaching a single hand out to brush back the bright hair of Zenaki.* - Sun Sep 27 04:45:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) smiling a bit, he looked over to Koji to see that he was mastering the leaf whirlwind jutsu that was tought to him a day or so agao..Fujitora now looking to Kohaku would stand about in the water.. Around him forming the fire shroud slowly.. "Because of you being apart of my clan..I can trust you with this Hiden ability." he tells her and only her with focus..The man emitting a natural heat "Though this is only the first verson, it can be molded into much more with much practice and training..You must swear to never teach such a hiden ability to those outside of our clan..My creations are sacred.." he tells her before waiting for the girls own attempts..Since it was something of C rank, it'd probably take her some time.* - Sun Sep 27 05:00:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) smirks a bit "Because she's just as creative as her old man..Now I hope you, as a member of our clan will do the same in your own way." he says. He was looking to create more jutsu in the future to teach his kid anyhow.* - Sun Sep 27 05:05:29 2015
