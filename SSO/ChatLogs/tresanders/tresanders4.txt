<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: So, I suppose the first we all should get down will be the Mist Servant Jutsu, to trick our enemy that our numbers have increased by more than the thousands. - Wed Sep 16 01:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon took out the scroll of which he reviewed first with his level of studious and intelligence to ponder on how just the very BASIC bits of this jutsu was done, not saying he was some expert but he did know how it works as genjutsu as a whole..The first one he passed the blunt to was Yan of course, each of them having to get the ability down..Fujitora taking his time , as the one leading this, he had to be sure he knew what he was doing as well.* - Wed Sep 16 01:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: The scrolls must make their way back to me at the end. - Wed Sep 16 01:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Gotta return these after all. - Wed Sep 16 01:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) watching as Yan had studied the scroll. He began to practice the jutsu himself a bit more , now that he had learned just the basics of it, he would be using Kirie as a subject for his testing, though his genjutsu power was nearly nothing, his intellegence was something.* - Wed Sep 16 01:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) was looking over the jutsu that he had obtained only so that he could read over them both the hell viewing and the interrogation one later. But with him doing so made the others wait a while longer..Now granted Fujitora ONLY did this to be sure that the mastery or detals of whoever inscribed the jutsu into these scrolls were fairly accurate and not something that will cost them too much chakra int he fields of battle, because no one had unlimited chakra, especially not Fujitora.* - Wed Sep 16 01:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Soo.... - Wed Sep 16 01:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: These jutsu are not very detailed.. - Wed Sep 16 01:42:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I think you both would want for me to master these first. - Wed Sep 16 01:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) just continued to meditate his time on the study upon the two seperate jutsu, learning two out of the three of course he found no issue learning the third one with how studious in the mind he was. This of course giving him a great edge to learn them quickly and without much hassle from these scrolls, now all that would be left was to unlock the power within each of them, while having to try and master them within the future as well so that when the time was needed, he could reflect the very image of his own creation upon the minds of others.. Though he was only learning to increase his source of information, he did it in a very beneficial way.* - Wed Sep 16 01:48:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) drawing out his katana with a basic spin to it, the young man soon began to go through the steps "Much like walking on water you see, you just have to be able to generate enough chakra which would flow onto the surface of any weapon according to that very element much like wind, water, earth and lightning, but sicne you are using Fire much like myself, you will have more of the destructional power rather than just slicing through things.." he said this and gave the man or teen an example of what he meant..It was something they all or most of them could learn from.* - Wed Sep 16 02:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Hmmm could I apply that to my bare hand? - Wed Sep 16 02:10:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking at Mizumi he replied "Of course, if you can focus well enough..With an arrow or shuriken even..Any weapon would be possible." he told him while he himself was training his fire eleemental powers, seeing as though he has been going so many years without too much focus into it. Now a days he had more of a reason for such, which was his daughter and a ability of which he wished to increase greatly overtime.. Though the fire shroud was not much in apeparance, it was very helpful against physical attacks and close range fighting, easily granting him the ability to scortch an enemy when called for..So now he just tried to train his ability, for today was a mission complete for all of them.* - Wed Sep 16 02:53:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes settled on the focus on the genjutsu he was practicing "Well, these clones can act freely..They are my very own shadows..Shadow clone jutsu.." he told them a jutsu that he used mostly for stealth and information gathering missions.."They are physical...Not elemental at any nature...These clones are just nearly as powerful as myself.." he spoke while he continued to train this jutsu of the illusionary arts..* - Wed Sep 16 03:09:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) did not intend to dodge but show Mizumi a well formed combonation of the fire chakra flow and kenjutsu skills that he himself had when Fujitora drew out his katana , coating it in fire to perform the crescent moon beheading jutsu which was of expert levels to him. The flame would fire back towards Mizumi's direction in a fire slash but no intention of hitting him, just gliding by and into the air.* - Wed Sep 16 03:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) lightly chuckled to the words used "Yes, overly so in the arts of kenjutsu especially..I'm looking to increase my kenjutsu ability in dear time to the best of my ability. To be able to attack much quicker when close up, since some may mistake me for a distance fighter..Because of my lack in strength." he says. * - Wed Sep 16 04:00:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Well, one thing with shadow clones is that you can use any jutsu with them. - Wed Sep 16 04:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Meaning multiple genjutsu perhaps. - Wed Sep 16 04:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I suggest creating a Water Reflection Genjusu. - Wed Sep 16 04:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Using the relfection of water as a trigger no matter how small or big, capturing the number of foe in the illusion of a false world. - Wed Sep 16 04:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: I could possibly even combine that with mist... - Wed Sep 16 04:12:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) arms folded with an eye to Mizumi "He'll catch up to ya." he chuckled lightly, Fujitora soon just began to train his genjutsu once more with the shadow clone he had working on it, making that one fade to gain whatever experience was obtained while another was formed an hour after he had rightfully restored his chakra.* - Wed Sep 16 04:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) training with the skills he had to master or atlease expertise himself with, the young man just kept calm and trained each of these abilities with what time he had on his hands along with going to fight whatever threats that may be lurking in the waters around irigakure, using this time to focus on the Genjutsu gave him the oppertunity to better himself and his skills with the arts of fir of course, that way he'd need not to focus on just one thing at a time, completing the previous task of the other month.* - Wed Sep 16 15:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) had to continue this certain line of training, where he would just try and master the first intial jutsu of the mist servant genjutsu along with one other which he just tried to get down to the best of his knowledge...* - Wed Sep 16 15:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) considering he was using his shadow clones to train with, the man with the best of his information of self would multiply those numbers by one additional clone so that he'd be able to work on these jutsu he had with him on his own at a much quicker rate.* - Wed Sep 16 15:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking to master his power over the arts of the enjutsu of which he was learning, the young man had to think to himself more about the times he'd have to use such a genjutsu in battle, that way it would not harm his chakra too much on what comes of the battle to come. With each ability he could place out.* - Wed Sep 16 15:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) made sure to keep his mind on the true objective whenever he trained, all for the goal of mastering the abilities of genjutsu that he himself had possessed , all to make sure that the major benefit would come out of it in the future with both his fuuinjutsu abilities and the genjutsu arts being mixxed in one go. But he also had his elemental progress to focus on later too and it would have to take more time to train.* - Wed Sep 16 16:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) kept a steady mind on what the goal was to be with the mastery over these certain genjutsu along with his Ninjutsu ability that all needed his work with on over time, since he was looking to master them all at a time going by, he could use all his time to work with them at the days he most needed to, and before any big wars were to come of course, this way he could be well repared and settled for what was to come, since he was in need of something just as powerful as whatever else he could find and learn about.. * - Wed Sep 16 16:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) making sure the hand signs were all well formed and right for his usage in the future, the man and his shadow clones continued to make their progress with the genjutsu ability, seeing that he also needed elemental progress as well, he made sure to keep all things to himself steady.* - Wed Sep 16 16:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking to perfect these abilities as his own jutsu, he went into his study for them more and more to make sure that his mind was a strong one and could deal with the power output of these genjutsu so that whenever he did come to fight someone with them, he'd be just as potent with them as any skilled artist would and possibly make up for any loss of ability with what power he could generate.* - Wed Sep 16 16:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) having clones out meant it was going to drain him more and more over the time he used to train with them so he took a break eventually when he could only to go and focus on meditation to increase his chakra more over time as well as his own control. Maybe even someday being able to increase other things as well since he was lacking strength.* - Wed Sep 16 17:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon began to work on his fireball jutsu more and more, eventually using his shadow clones as a benefit to increase his ability to gain progress with them over time. Since he was going to be using this more and more in battle, he had to atlease be over the abilities of a veteran and a amster of his own prowess which his family was known for, the element of fire. Something he was looking to control.* - Wed Sep 16 17:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) was now working on what was to be the moon beheading jutsu of the kenjutsu arts he has been keeping up to par with so that he could be able to create even more so devistating blows towards his opponent and make them fall back even more with his ability to deflect attacks that were incoming with his level of speed and reflex allowing him to strike at quicker times.* - Wed Sep 16 17:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) continued to do such with his shadow clones and the crescent moon beheading, all to make sure that his ability of such was well polished and not something he could leave behind on the list of abilities he was able to perform and get the hand of. All of which he was looking to master or get the veteran level of down.* - Wed Sep 16 17:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) though taking his time and having his breaks with the abilities of this jutsu, he made sure to use such time wisely and not waste his chakra as he trains with them along with the abilities of his shadow clones to come down to use all together much later in the time period, but for now, the young Uchiha would focus and maintain his abilities to keep using kenjutsu and his fire jutsu which he'd be training later on to create even more powerful traits for war fighting and tactics.* - Wed Sep 16 17:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) finding more and more time to train with these abilities, he also found himself having struggles with the formulation of such, not being able to continue using fire for a while due to the lack of chakra. He took a knee to recover such chakra for later so that he'd be able to not only continue his training but think up methods to build such control voer this element.* - Wed Sep 16 17:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) just kept his focus all on one ability for now, since he was training and dealing with many elements, it was time that he began to deal with the elements of water for now, the water gun jutsu he learned and copied from someone so that he could begin making something even more useful with the little chakra drain it has, he could take advantage of in the fields of battle..Using his time and talent, he began the process of training such an art by himself of course.* - Wed Sep 16 17:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) was just here standing around with little motivation but much time to train his own abilities so that he may catch up on whatever he may of missed over the past few days while training on the Hogo's island to benefit himself for the time being with majority of his jutsu all put up to date, his abilities of fighting increased and his mind set a bit different.* - Wed Sep 16 22:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) simply couldn't just stay still though, he needed a small thrill from his own training and self effort to increase what power he had to make it out to where he needed to be, to not slack behind anyone or anything with what potential he had to learn with..So many has said that he was not going to learn all that he did but Fujitora proved them wrong by this day when he learned to perform even Genjutsu and non elemental abilities..These were honorable feats in his own eyes.* - Wed Sep 16 23:01:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon began to perform a number of hand signs, seeing that the shadow clone jutsu even if nearly mastered can drain ones body, he figured that he would get to know the monkey of which he will summon so that their attacks and abilities will be well matched.. He summone dout a medium sized monkey that was armored in traditional japanese armor and held a katana much like Fujitora did with some tomoe markings on his armor to represent the Ryujin..Fujitora soon spoke with the primate , trying to come to an understanding of their levels of potential Fuuinjutsu training together with one another, trying to teach the Monkey what he may already know.* - Thu Sep 17 02:53:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Very well then...I'll make some adujstments to the field as all. - Thu Sep 17 03:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon took a stance , not drawing out his sword but rather preparing himself for what was to come , looking at Hassan the young man held out both hands at his side, seeing as though he needed to knead his chakra for what he was going to be doing. He utilized the first initial part of his tactic, seeing that his monkey summon was already out, he may as well use it, commanding the primate to go forward with his katana to try and distract Hassan.

Meanwhile the real Fujitora would form a single hand sign with both hands to create the formulation of seals he needed for what jutsu he and the monkey will be performing, considering with the armor on him, they may be about the sign weight.. 

Soon Fujitora attempted to use his Mist Servant Genjutsu . Thus testing Hassan while closing in on the man, taking a seperate route from the monkey since their initial jutsu had been placed for later.* - Thu Sep 17 03:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking at Hassan he nods his head while taking out some of his own shuriken as the monkey before him would take out the scroll of s special sealing formula made by Fujitora in its own attempts to throw that scroll towards Hassan as a distraction, opening it only to show the formula which was labled as -Flame- in runic wording, the rune glowing a bright red to release the blaze of one enhanced Goukakyuu at Hassan from the scroll that was released, not costing Fujitora any chakra but rather something useful as a tool and team effort between him and his monkey.. He kept note of how many times the flame could be released. <Two remaining..> 

It was true that he was indeed wise and kept a numbe rof handy scrolls which contained jutsu within them. Now for the real Fujitora, he took out his shuriken only to throw them towards the direction of Hassan, only to miss him on purpose during the tension of the fire being released so that the thick and durable strings of these shuriken could wrap around Hassan, for they were manipulated by Fujitora.. This being his method of ebing to hold his master down at a wiser cost.

Later on.
"Hehe, the wind armor eh?.." his eyes focused on the man immensely.* - Thu Sep 17 03:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking to see that not only his flame but shuriken were surpressed by the efforts of Hassan, Fujitora was then knocked back with little time to respond from the shockwave, however channeling chakra to the hand and tips of his fingers. He attempted to defend himself by generating a shroud of flame about the figure of his body.

Once hit by Hassan he'd try to glide his very finger tips or hand upon the surface of Hassans body , plotting to place something on him from that point on, trying to use his own shroud and reflex along with attack speed to an advantage from Hassans Three finger blow..Grunting from the pain while being shot back.

His monkey was also shot back from the shockwave but continued to take out another set of scrolls to use against Hassan when he had gotten back up from the fall. * - Thu Sep 17 03:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking out to spot Hassan as he and the man fought one another, the flames of his shroud protected him from some or maybe even most of the attack power that was given out by Hassan.. Now being charged at for another attack, Fujitora kept his eyes focused on the man, eyes and mind on this one target while the monkey was dealing with a ripped scroll and wind coming towards him.

Young Fujitora went to draw out his sword as swift as he could to react towards the strike of Hassan since this crescent moon beheading was known to be used in tough situations as this, and to follow up upon this, the blade was engulfed in fire control chakra so that it could be even more so powerful only striking with the blunt edge so that he wouldn't end up slicing the fingers of his father figure. Doing so to also try and strike him at the torso with his Nin-Kenjutsu fighting style, putting forth his fate into the flames he could produce.* - Thu Sep 17 03:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) now holding a damaged or destroyed sword , the monkey in the distance closing in came to a stop as he vanished off back to the summoning realm.. Fujitora looked at Hassans eye and answered "Yes...What happend for you to have gotten an eye of metal?" he was curious of this, causing his fire shroud to fall apart by scattering into the very sky, flames no longer.* - Thu Sep 17 03:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes widened as the chakra change summoned about the cause of Hassans genjutsu within the eyes of the young man. He suddenly felt heavier , watching Hassan prepare his next attack only brought him to the reality that he would not be able to move fast enough to block it, he knew from his own calculation of his weight that if he was even more so heavier, it'd stop him from being as quick.

Even with his resistance and intelligence, this may be a while for him to figure out it was a genjutsu as real as it would have seemed <Gravity Ninjutsu?...What is this..> he thought, being pushed away or standing by..His monkey was gone and it was just he and Hassan now, or so they both assumed.. Soon Fujitora once he was given the time to stand or react, would make a T sign of his hands. <If I can't place a single hand on him, Fuuinjutsu wont work, especially not the Overheat Sealing..Or my ROOT restriction..But I have this..> 

Once the three clones were all made, he'd have them act as he would, making the assumption that if 1 was not going to be enough, then three would at this pace of speed..He might notice that his clones might not be affected by the genjutsu.. But the clones all tried to shunshin their way to Hassan from different angles attempting to land a punch or direct contact of some form..

Only if he succeeded in making the clones..2 at most.* - Thu Sep 17 04:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) during the time the clones went in for the attack, Fujitora was standing there with his hands held in the tiger hand sign, waiting for one of them to land a concetrated hit on Hassan..If one managed and if or more likely he WOULD of noticed. A form of marking spreading about his body as it slowly began to heat him up from the inside. BUT this would also be stopped the moment Hassan spoke.

Fujitora releasing the seal, but letting it be known to his father figure what type of jutsu he has been aiming to land with his Nin-Ken- fighting abilities..Looking at him he raised an eye brow "You sure about that?...Phew.." he chuckled lightly as he walked towards him, the seal vanishing from his being if it ever landed.

"That was more intense than ever I say..From the first day you trained me here at thsi waterfall." spoken truly.* - Thu Sep 17 04:20:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking to train his jutsu even more in debt with the abilities he had within himself, training with multiple shadow clones by having them walk about and summon all the power that they could, made Fujitora wonder and realize more and more about his very own ability to fight with them at his side and not when they were at his side, a mastered ability such as this was going to be used quite wisely in the arms of this man. Using his time and effort to increase his ability with them over time as well for his other jutsu as well which could be used in co-opperation along side it.* - Thu Sep 17 05:09:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) leaving  home to arrive at the square or central of the village, young Fujitora took a look around before he would go out in his own way to go and study his Fuuinjutsu art a bit more in dept and detail, hoping to even advance further than the ROOT sealing if he actually needed to. However , with such training came more effort and more time to take..He did not know how long exactly it'd take but he was going to have to use such time wisely..For now he went to go and run some missions by himself or with others to accompany him now that he had the time.

He of course was going sea beast hunting , out on the other islands where he could focus on his fighting alone..Though training with clones was very taxing to his stamina and chakra, it paid off in the end, and so he planned to use such results to test his fighting skills with..

"I'll be going on a few missions, anyone care to join just follow me." he declares, not revealing the total risk or ran of the mission, but leaving them an open option to come along. This was also to benefit from training and increase their very chance of battle preporation as well by capturing such beast in the ocean to use against any fleets..

"We're a water village, we have the best navy right?" he chuckled.* - Thu Sep 17 15:30:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) taking all of whom he had to some along with him on this grand voyage to find and capture any sea beast they can run into within the ocean waters of Kirigakure, the young man Fujitora held his sword out which was the very signal for his fleet to set sail into the waters where the risk of danger only increased the more they advanced.. So with that being done by them, he said.

"We are to look for, find, and defeat then capture what ever we can find out here boys...You don't have to worry about this boat breaking or crashing, the five seal barrier I've placed around it , pretty much made it unbreaable for a limited time..And limited point I'd say.. First rule is to not fall off this damn boat...You need to do what you can to drag in what we capture and leave it up to our Fuinjutsu specialist to seal those bad boys away in the scrolls I've provided and use these scrolls for later as a contract summon for times of war only , since these are wild beast, we can not truly tame them..Thus the risk of this mission will be worth a single B rank for each fish, giant snake, or whatever we may catch that can be used for our front lines ..." he told them simply with much auhtority.* - Thu Sep 17 15:41:00 2015
