"First..Take the seat of meditation my child..Then close your eyes.." he said simply while doing the same for himself very much..Upholding a barrier of the five seals around the house, the man did not say much but rather he wanted for Izanami to follow along..What may of worked for him might work for her as well..He knew she had some deep innter hate within her mind, but as time was passing by, he could not risk it any longer to not try his best to help out..As a father..Though many were unaware of his caring heart for his kid. 

The man never hesitated to do what needed to be done..  

"Now Izanami.." he demands with a fatherly tone.* - Sun Nov  1 02:26:20 2015

"It was upon such long week of constant meditation did my sight change...I only wish for you to do the very same.." he explains as he gave a big example of what he meant exactly, sitting with a clear mind, nothing holding him back to such a past only to move on and let go to bring his mind to a complete state of zen and peace... * - Sun Nov  1 02:40:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) now within his fancy dinner looking at the three of them , he said in a voice of which every american president had used to explain themselves.

"Now hear me out here...I know I've not always been the -tender- kind of father to my sons...But I want you to know that I support your decision in marrige...But that you should also try speaking more to the family..Whenever I did try to talk to you, y' always flew off or vanished from sight..Even slammed a door in me face lad...It's a hard task fathering a rebellious kid y' know." he sips tea..Though some jokes were tossed in..He was serious as well.

"Eh..All I'm trying to say is.. Understand that my way of things have been in shambles for some time..So I'm alot more than sorry for making you feel neglected if that's whats driven you away."* - Sun Nov  1 23:02:49 2015

"What I've done thus far, I've done for the sake of my children..Not this barren wasteland we know as the shinobi world..I retired not for myself, but for my duties as a father.. It's what Kastya would of wanted me to do... " he states simply now looking to reach for a bowl of rice to eat it all..Fujitoras way of parenting was VERY similar to that of a mafia leader... 

"Would you of wanted me to be soft and tell you lies of the world being alright?..Because not everything will be alright..I can't offer you lies ..Only truth..I don't try to bring you pain, only joy.. But pain has reached you..And for that, I'm sorry."  he sips his tea calmly. Now looking at Tetsumi and the others..

He sighed "Sadly though...Untill this threat of war with Edge is over..I can not offer my other abilities to be taught, knowing of what can happen if he managed to get ahold of my forbidden arts.. For now we'll have to make due and wait, learning this one ability that will help maintain it..For now I wish for you to study on fuuin--Ninjutsu....Fuuin Ninjutus is an advance form of fuuinjutus as you know..It plays a crucial part in the jutsu I will be teaching you.. Though it is the beginning, it will be much needed..For now I will give you these untill then." he stated, writing a few scrolls of the Cloth Binding and  the Advance Sealing notes.."  

His mind on the situation gave him some paranoia to a bit of everything..As trust and betreyal was common in the world of shinobi..He looked to Index as one of his own little brothers or additional sons to his family..Ruffling his hair..Fujitoras aura was troubled at the time being..But he stayed strong for those around him.. * - Mon Nov  2 01:04:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes widen mentally, as words could not express how proud he was of the boys ability to utilize golden flames, something unique to his very spirit already.. But never the less, Fujitora the Yonkou kept his thoughts to himself, and expressed with his actions, placing a single hand on Ivel's shoulder and giving him a noble nod of approval..The Miyagi nod..

"That is very unique, something I've yet to see.. But within some time, I'll show you something that you yourself will inherit..Within time, you might even manifest your own Golden Phoenix  Or Dragon sort of form from such..Such will be up to you once it happends.. Our training will tae place soon..But for now, take the time to get to know the others in Suna..Though some might be asleep right now.." he said simply with a small smirk..

"Because soon.. I'll be taking you to train in preporations for something else..If you are into adventure..Then I have someplace that will truly test your strengths and limitations..An island of mine .." he explains.* - Tue Nov  3 03:48:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ivel(OmniKage) says: We can start tomorrow. - Tue Nov  3 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Yes, but be prepared for what might or might not seem boring. - Tue Nov  3 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I'll be here to guide you.. These are several steps..In which case, you might of already gotten two down. - Tue Nov  3 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ivel(OmniKage) says: What are the steps? - Tue Nov  3 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking to Ivel, he had to explain the following , so he started along with such..

"First step...You must of been born with the element of fire , those who adopt the flame later in life will only fail with a weaker verson, you are of Ryujin blood so you pass this requirement..It's a sacred ability, one that can not be taught but guided.. Since the flame has been within your heart and soul from the beginning, the process would be able to go on.."

"Second Step,  training of the fire element..The minimum is an acceptance as I have not truly trained too much in the arts of fire considering the change of my life for other professions..."

"Third Step, Meditation for Seven Days and Seven nights, atlease four hours a day and night of molding and maintaining the ember of flame within your spirit to bring it out to a surface..Because of this flame being so unique, you'd come to discover that it is much mre than just the fire element at work but your own spiritual manifestation as a Ryujin...."

"Fourth Step, bringing it to a reality, this is the most risky step, even us Ryujin are not safe from burning or hurting outselves from our own flame if our hearts are not..As I would say settled in sync with our minds..One slip up and you can risk burning every inch of your body, so its best to do this near water...Though it wont create the fire shroud until the six step..."

"The Sixth Step which is battle, to bring out that very fighting spirit within yourself...<But he does not know that the fire must be brought out by himself...Or enhanced with force by a fellow Fire Shroud using punching him at the heart to awaken it..But that would be the quicker way out..I'd like to see him struggle with maintaining and seeing if he'd take such a risk in the midst of battle..> This is the very final step which will determine the destiny of your very flame..From this step on I will be expecting you to mold this flame into your own aura..TO create your very own Variation...My Variation being the Mystic Sun Shroud..A shroud of blue flames and extreme heat, classified as an A ranking ability which heavily increases both Defense and ones Ninjutsu power ...However I only used this ability once and never did such again..But because of such I came to realize that many variations are possible...Weather it'd be a green flame or blue...You can make such possible.." he stated to his newly discovered son..* - Tue Nov  3 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: When I discovered this birthright..I was alone on the island I claim today as the Labyrinth.. - Tue Nov  3 04:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Under its moon I created and polished this ability to survive. - Tue Nov  3 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: The stronger your element, the stronger the shroud...If you are capable of amplifying your strengths of such an element to a single point then it'd become even more so deadly. - Tue Nov  3 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ivel(OmniKage) says: A shroud of fire.. - Tue Nov  3 04:33:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Though this ability is only a start at first..Not too powerful in increasing your ability, it grants you access to create an even higher variation.. - Tue Nov  3 04:35:12 2015
