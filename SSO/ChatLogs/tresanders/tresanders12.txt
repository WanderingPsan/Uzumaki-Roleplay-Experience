"You need to get faster...You also need to endure longer for fights...And sex." he teased her on that last bit while he lead her down to where they'd be going. Into a LARGE room which seemed empty, tiled floors, but many markings of Fuuinjutsu about in the entire area, while Fujitora was in a safe spot, he told her to step on in, simply by slapping her butt he said.

"Good luck...You better have the ability to stand within such heat ..This is a shot to get both faster..Gain stamina and durability...I will be making clones for you to fight against..Or rather..A bigger challenge being a single golem.." he points to the rocks and seals.

"You will have to dodge for your life...Elements of all natures will come towards you from each lotus seal..Each worse from the last..You have....15 minutes to go through it all and survive.." he tells her.* - Mon Sep 28 00:28:35 2015

Narration

The man watched this, from the safe point ..The heat on the meters were at 110 degrees..The girl landed on one trap but then was safe on another..Soon Fujitora waits for the right moment to activate one of the seals which would fire a lightning bolt towards the girls direction from behind,  while he waits to see her reaction, wondering just how long she could sustain the ehat and continue moving as swift as a cat.

"Keep pushing yourself without thinking of what will happen, and you might end up knocked out by the heat of your own blood..Ko-ko.." he tells her, holding a single hand sign for the trap.. He waits to see just how lucky she'd become.* - Mon Sep 28 00:47:21 2015

Meanwhile, Kohaku would be facing some charges for rolling a 3..How much longer would she be able to dodge the traps, some safe ,some not..From the ground , quickly spews a large quantity of gas like chilli power to irritate her eyes and throat if inhaled this would spread through her body..

"It wont..Ninjutsu is highly spriritual..And mental.." he spoke, now awaiting for Kohaku to dodge.. It was at this point where all of those seals stopped triggering..The heat lowering down to just 100 degrees..He held a single hand sign, the rocks assembled in order to form a standard 15 meter golem , 50 feet standing , the rocks emitted a light blue glow for the eyes..

"Now..You'll fight ..As if it were for your life...Slow down and you will pay greatly.." he tells her. She'd have to fight and learn the hard way.* - Mon Sep 28 01:15:31 2015

She'd begin to notice that FIRE of all things had little effect, though it shattered a layer of rock on the golem..She'd probably notice that it began to regenerate quite quickly, recovering from her attack. Continuing its own attack, each hit shaking the ground.

A trap triggered from behind, firing out a series of kunai towards Kohaku's direction.*)* - Mon Sep 28 01:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) holding a single hand sign from it all while he watches the girl fight the golem, he saw how much she was working to beat it. The beast took a defensive stance to block against most of the fire as it began to swing once again..But then soon enough the young woman managed to break some of the seals upon its body thus causing it to shatter apart from immense heat, though because of this, caused an explosion, delivering a shockwave to travel over the entire area to blow the girl back from her success of this training session, coming all out to be a mission complete!

"Hehe..Good job Kohaku." he says to her, walking into the chamber with the heat down to a normal degree.* - Mon Sep 28 01:57:20 2015

"My children, all in Suna..My former wife there as well..What do you think I should do? Hm? My dear Ko-Ko." he talked to her as a friend but his gaze said a bit more.* - Mon Sep 28 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) chuckling lightly, he only got closer to the girl to plant a kiss to her lips for the answer. Before he whispered "Before I go to visit Suna...Would you like another -massage-? " he asked before he continued "Well, once you have a teacher...Most take much pride in their work...It's nothing as simple as coming and going about, you must show full dedication. " he tells her .

"You know..I can bring plessure to you again if you'd like..." he whispered to her in the ear. His hand grabbing onto her butt before backing away a bit.."Forgive me..These urges are hard to control..At times.." he says.* - Mon Sep 28 02:43:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) chuckled softly and pats her shoulder  "Well, we'll continue training later.." his eyes gazed into the girls . "The more you train, the more you'll make kenshin proud I believe..." he gave the girl a friendly ruffle to the hair before departing.. "What I want for you to do now though...Is climb the waterfalls mountain, with one hand, up and down.." he tells her..But it was obvious that he was tired.

"Then again....Not sure how much longer I can stay up.."* - Mon Sep 28 03:06:27 2015

He thought of Berith for a moment before he continued, though he needed this distraction, he had to remember that he needed to become better , no matter the cost..He looked to Zenaki with a small smile, scanning over the jutsu, seeing that it took a good deal of chakra control..Something he remembered a lot of medics doing, figuring that it would be quite easy to do in the future.* - Mon Sep 28 09:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinking more about the medical jutsu, he looked to Zenaki "Turn around.." he was going to start by healing any wounds on her back that she may of missed that were still there and bringing some pain..Since he needed to redeem himself for all he did , both Fujitora and Zenaki seemed to be in a loop of a bad situation..He tried to think about Zenaki, and just her..Looking at her hair and features he said "I'm going to heal your wounds on your back..Or try to...Till I get it right." he tells her.. Knowing there must of been cuts someplace on her body..If not he'd have to make some.* - Mon Sep 28 09:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes focused on her back to see the cuts, all new..He'd figure the ones he made would of been nearly healed or done by now, he knew that this was not his own doing "Who did this?..." he'd ask Zenaki as he tries to heal her, the jutsu was finally learned, all that was left was for him to furthur develop his healing abilities into something better and swifter to use ..He was furious, someone touched his dear Zenaki! His woman! He was the master! No one else! "Who...Did this.." * - Mon Sep 28 09:24:28 2015

"Have you eaten at all this day?" he asked.* - Mon Sep 28 10:08:00 2015
