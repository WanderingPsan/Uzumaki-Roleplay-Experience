<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon Fujitora lead the way to a ship that will be taking them on this voyage an Air ship at that which will be going over the very sea itself to bring them to the long lost island across the globe ..The man was of no risk to himself seeing that he made his way on..But rather a risk to those coming along.. This journey was not going to be a simple one day trip, which is why with the less people it can turn out better than with a full group.. Fujitoras teaching was great but ..Many lacked the spirit to complete his challenge .

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) //

Upon coming on the boat, maybe even titanic looking cruise ship to the very island that was Fujitroas own to this day..The man walked to the high points of the cliff only to tell them all.. He pointed East...This was no mistake he pointed EAST..

"Your destination is up north...Be aware of how this island can trick the man of a human, be aware of the danger you ar eplacing yourself into..Usually those without the mind set for this place leave depraved as a Jashinist would be at times when coming out as failures...This island itself is proof to me that you are worthy of my abilities which derived from the very core of this island!  However there is one other thing, as a addition to loyalty, you'll have to survive..To see which of you come out to be my -star- student outside of family...And who will become the 2nd and 3rd class students ....Though I may of trained you before, that will be nothing compared to the training you will be recieving the next few days or weeks...This is where I have created several and learned several jutsu I have honed the abilities of today.."

He took a deep breath before declaring.

"On This Day! Consider yourself targets of this island! The outlaws!  Because you are here with no authority to the very forces of the wild here..What creatures you may stumble upon what people and beings..Could be the very end of you....Now..Make your way to the very core of the island..It is up to you to figure out..."

As he walked north it looked like the geographics had shifted thus him going east.. He left off..

East  was North

West was North East

South Was East

North West was South East

South West was West

As though it were some loop to the mind.

This Island gave a strange sensation to the body and mind. Clarity?..Depravity?..Neutrality?* - Sun Oct 11 13:38:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) //


Though Cypher was having what seemed to be a safe trip into the woods, he'd notice many off things..How certain animals which would be vicious did not attack...He was going to hear the random melody from time to time, sounding like a flute..A soft note of which could be ehard only by him right now.

Sanoke however was taken off course, going south east, which took him off the path of which he was going ,coming across a deep phantom like sound that plays , he would see a light..A stone tablet big enough to fit into ones pocket.. Shall he touch it, he'd hear a voice whisper into his ear as if he were right there with arms wrapped around Sanoke's little head..

<A Key~>  But like the wind that entity would be gone..The smell of the ancient dead dreading around Sanoke's figure now from coming across the tablet..The forest trees becoming dark if he shall venture along with the tablet , the slab..

* - Sun Oct 11 14:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) //

Kilm entering the fray would notice that when he first walked in, he had appeared at the beach once again with the ocean behind him..Strange it was but he also advanced right on in only to be taken off course and into a deeper portion of the forest north west from the other three, being exactly 120 meters apart from one another , as the more he'd advance, Kilm had became targets for the falcons who nested high up within the ravine which he had stumbled upon into.

These falcons, they shouted a loud cherp the cherp which was of a thousand birds? -Chidori? NOPE- this sound was never ending from them, as they found their target of prey, this was the Genjutsu, a SOUND based genjutsu which would ring over and over within the ears of Kilm, looking to force him at a pause  , causing him to see nothing but the forest becoming black an darker, while two falcons would soar down towards him in an attempt to capture him in its claws and fly off as a swift giant beast with its prey...The ravine was a deadly place to get off course in.

Meanwhile with Sanoke, the key he carried was one of the cursed items.. Which caused  many roots from the ground to sudden rise up, coated with dark chakra , a series of 20 necro roots of dead trees, natural energy enhanced to grab onto the limbs of Sanoke <RETURN THE SLAB!> a voice would echo from many trees.. The ghost of nature , of those within the Labyrinth, hunting those with a key down, those animals that did not seem vicious all began to target Sanoke now, as scorpions were very likely to crawl up his legs to sting.

Meanwhile with Cypher, his bites from the gnats were crucial, forcing him to stop for one turn, not being able to continue without an hour of recovery UNLESS he had a medical antidote!* - Sun Oct 11 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) ////

The roots of the swamp had been destroyed as the attacks paused for now, leading Sanoke to continue on as he pleased for one free turn, thus advancing on.

Meanwhile Kilm would be facing other difficulties with the flock of falcons..Their cherps getting louder to generate yet another sound face genjutsu, another set of the flock being blown away by his attack, while others continued to fly towards him, more viciously than ever ..They generated a loud war cry ..Kilm had angered them..

The falcons were somewhat wise coming from different angles around the ravine and high ground nest.* - Sun Oct 11 15:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: So I'd be. - Sun Oct 11 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: This shit definitely changes a man. - Sun Oct 11 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) //

Falcons flying high, soaring low and swift as some were being destroyed by Kilm, One or two even three managed to glide right in and scar him upon his back with its sharp claws while another literally pekks at his shoulder with the strength of a heavy lifting man to partially impale but mainly knock him off his toes to send him toppling down from off the ravine where he'd meet the threat of a cliff which a river below flowing with rushing waters, this river was 70 feet low and he was 70 feet high at the cliff of which he might fall off from..

Kilms options were limited,  the fray of what few falcons were left continued to chase him, would he take such a fall or continue to suffer with the beast of the wild?!  The Labyrinth was a terrible place...These falcons were vicious, swift and deadly with genjutsu but little durability was where they'd fall..

Now for Cypher as his journey would begin once more. His luck with the labyrinth turned on him as it would seem that he went full circle in the spot he was previously in, there was no change at all..Simply a repeat.* - Sun Oct 11 15:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) //

Eventually these birds stopped their hunt as they were limited to areas only within or near the ravine..The river was out of their element as Kilm descends towards it.. He would be guided by the river , damaged from such injuries he'd feel the pain of the birds attacks surging through the areas marked..

Cypher however would end up in a much riskier course which was changed, likely back tracking the set destination, he'd find himself near the very tribal people of the Labyrinth..They were all gathered by a fire, with many ancient stone around them in this gathering...They seemed peaceful, shall he try to talk to them at his own risk..These people had a tablet with them , a key of which could be used..But its own curse...If he allows temptation to take hold..However these keys being the only way they can complete the labyrinth.

Sanoke would meat a similar faith, his course , because of the slab..Took a greater risk..As he was visited by one of the three plagues, he'd feel the very air growing thin, with giant hornets flying towads him from the bee hives within the trees as the swampy mud becomes mukky, making it hard to run even with suimen..This was one of the more advanced plagues which made it seem as if being a shinobi did not matter...As the air grew thinner, it'd feel as if one were slightly breathing chilli powder..He could complete this curse and end it by destroying the beacon of light at the end of the swamp, there were 3, one of which risen from 50 feet behind him, another 60 meters north, the last 40 feet south. He had to destroy all three to negate this curse for a total of 3 turns.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) //

For now the course of events would all come to a stop..

The tribe members looking to Cypher as they would offer and allow him a place to stay for the night with their native tongue as the Labyians... The stone tablet center of their village..An Aura of temptation.. They explained to him what it was over signs , that it would be used as access to get to the core and worship the many gods of chaos and some of right, the one with them a tablet of lust...

As for the others.

They also had a freebe to devise plans..If they managed to map out the island well enough..

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) //

Some changing choise to the OPPOSITE direction..
Others taking upon the risk of the tablet with their doubles or nothings..This triggered the spirit not of forest to appear after Cypher had his free round or rather this being one of the many Gilgamesh within the forest, a very spiritual like being, it creeps up from the waters and assemble through the roots of trees , it  but this one was an Ice lord...A giant snake of ice and snow..

The area had gotten very chilly, one could see shards of snow developing, and like that, the beast sunt a mist of HIGH leveled ice particles which would begin to freeze most solids it would arrive onto, freezing the rocks quicly, human skin was another thing.* - Sun Oct 11 17:11:40 2015

This night..Those with the Sacred Tablets will be visited by Three plagues..Each Worse than the last.. The very land began to erupt, the ground shaking as if it were an earth quake, from the ground spews volcanic gas lightly throughout random areas of the island..

Be careful not to run into or inhale...

Along with such, the area around each of them became ice cold...

A being of an element arrived for everyone of them

For Sanoke , an ice succubus like create, a figure very womanly.

Kilm would encounter a being made of pure lightning ..A male figure..Bulky of an elemental.

While Cypher would have encountered something on both those lines..A being with a front face as a woman, the back of her head as a man..All of which had their own unique attacks..Pausing them fro stepping any closer,* - Sun Oct 11 18:21:39 2015

While he looks at the others he claps his hands and says.

"Well done I'd say..." simple and a bit blunt today , still struggling to seperate himself from this world emotionally..Why was he doing this?

Reading this book, he knew he had a better chance of changing the future with new weaponry than how he could change it with other means..He only read certain details, for guns for swords and even for shields..He needed to be able to provide, not just as a Sushi Bar owner by offering the buy one get one free on discout Rice ball Sushi roll tuesdays but as a member of the village despite being retired.. He'd soon glide a single finger across the edgy surface of his rice picking hat saying to himself.
