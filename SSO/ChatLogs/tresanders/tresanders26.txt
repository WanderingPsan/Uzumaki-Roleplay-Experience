<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking to Nina, the man would fold his arms , people always assumed teaching meant getting right to the point..Not with Fujitora , you had to wax on and wax off..The man said to her.

"Now...That same shuriken...use it to deflect the kunai coming towards you.." he said as he got out a single kunai to toss at her.

"But KEEP it spinning.." he didnt want for her to throw the shuriken but maintain the wind motion to deflect in coming objects..

"Wax on!"* - Fri Oct 16 05:34:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon reached into the pocket of his to now throw TWO kunai towards her with a third one behind to follow up..His attack speed was high so she would have to roll a dice to this in order rto test her true luck if she'd be able to defelct all of them..This was training with Fujitora to increase both reflex and precision.* - Fri Oct 16 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eventually would make it seem as if they had stopped coming..But then SUDDENLY a shuriken came towards her at full speed, will she block it? Dodge it or deflect it?! Or will she end up grazed by the ability..Fujitoras eyes were focused on the girl when doing such.. This was to test her reflex because in kenjutsu..That was needed greatly when facing all kinds of opponents.. Along with this, Fujitora tossed a kunai as well..

Roll Twice.* - Fri Oct 16 05:46:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) laughed a bit..What Nina did not know was that the cactus would strike back, countering her attacks with mildly speedy attacks towards her, on its top was Fuji's Kanji, his seal to control it, as it would fight for him while rooted to the ground, capturing the young Nina by surprise, the thorny ends liekly striking her shoulders.* - Fri Oct 16 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) // The cactus would sit as if it didn't even move..With each strike she will have to roll for a successful counter.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looks over to Zenaki with a small smile saying to her as he would sit down and meditate for a long period of time, focusing his time to a seventh chakra as if he were attempting to unlock his 3rd eye, talking to her saying " Your training is showing some progress,, But here we can train in peace right without anyone bothering us?" he says to her, eyes closed for now, chakras being focused as if he were attempting to unlock all seven universal chakras.* - Fri Oct 16 06:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) was currently sitting on the top of the Sunagakure manor as he would read over the very scrolls he had to get a better idea and understandong of the very jutsu he had obtained. The man wanted to be able to obtain something great, perhaps even from the Gezo some day at that to be able to gain a greater power to protect those he loved..He was able to seal away so much so far, but he also needed to be able to make up even newer abilities for such future to present times.. He thought about the Sharingan and what Hideki said..Fujitora thought of it as Sacrifice..And so he would come to the mighty conclusion of Hideki and take such a sacrifice just as he was, putting himself in the very shoes of Hideki to think of his actions wisely as he trained.

<The Sharingan...Why have I yet to obtain your blessing.> he spoke with his eyes closed. As he would continue to place himself in a deep meditation of compelte Zen...Thinking of the very self sacrifice to be made by him soon enough within the future..* - Fri Oct 16 06:55:08 2015

He did not mark him just yet, but was planning to for his own sake.* - Fri Oct 16 07:34:24 2015

He chuckled lightly, only to close his eyes thinking to himself <4 To go..But how can I help this one soul...> he had no intensions of using him, but rather helping him with the current situation, he tried to examine him via sensing to see what kind of seal he had placed on him for this unique chakra to have been formed within him..FUjitora looks off to the others.
"Gonna be helping the lad..."

"Fuji-Hana sushi bar closed today~ " he'd casually lift the boy over his shoulder, utilizing his shunshin or attempting to at a vastly large range, in an attempt to take this host to his hidden lab and containment room to keep whatever inside of him in check .

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) taking off with Zenaki as the three would arrive to the mountain which seemed like a dead end when it was not, Fujitora performed a single hand sign as it would be the Passing of the Gofu Kekkai seal to let them in before it would shut tightly thus sealing them off from the outside world.. Fujitora eventually had taken Mokutsu to the room of a thousand restricts...In this room had an entire floor covered in Fuuinjutsu markings, all uniqie and all to be triggered in case something had went wrong..Fujitora took the scroll of which he captured some of Mokutsu's bijuu chakra within only to have it stored away for now..Now looking at the boy..

Telling Zenaki to head out to another room for now.. Fujitora stood there with his hat on, looking at the boy now rested on the table..Because of this Fuji being a clone, he still had to be careful..He had him greatly restrained..Attempting to wake him up after stripping him of his upper clothing..  To try and locate such a seal upon him..

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) having his hand upon the shirtless boys torso as he would utilize such a 8 Trigram seal so that the chakra of the bijuu within him would leak on out, and from this Fujitora would seal away such chakra within his keeps, taking a mildly large portion of such, doing this , he might of needed to seperate the chakra gathered, he knew that this kind of chakra would rocover itself, considering he was a full on host alone.. Fujitora looks to him and spoke.

"It's for research...No life threatning situation..This new brand of seal I am placing on you will allow for your chakras and the bijuus chakra to mix if it did not do such already..Now bare with me young lad.." the man would say when using his uzumaki heritage to form such seals..The male Uchiha kept an eye on how his body will react..

His eyes maintained the very focus on doing such, taking about 10% of the chakra while trying to make sure that this chakra  within him would also be very well mixing with Mokutsu's own reserves .

The chakra leaking however, Fujitora took all of which for himself.. He did not strike the core, only that of which would be leaking out so that it would not take control and over flow him..This would keep a balance so he wouldn't go beserk at the now.* - Fri Oct 16 08:40:57 2015
