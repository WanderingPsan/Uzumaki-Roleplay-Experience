<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking towards the children once he lead them out to the training grounds, he told the two of them about this simulation mission "The goal will be to not only find me within the cave of the water fall but to gather information from me by force...On me will be two scrolls, you are to take them once you find me..Got it? Or rather, who ever you may find in there." he tells them before going on.

"Consider this a two man squad..And perhaps even a B ranked mission, the cave is sturdy but in there are traps..You wont know where till its time.." he eventually made his way into the water fall, a Maze like cave had been made under the ground and within the mountain to exit at the very top where they'd find Fujitora.* - Wed Sep 23 22:19:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) nodding his head to Kirie "Of course..For now, I'll be going..The mission begins now." he poofed away to the top of the mountain, where he'd be the nucleus of what would be going on for the kids to enter in the cave and make their way up through the three or four stages.. Fujitora had Shadow clones all through the cave to spectate from under ground with their expert head hunting abilities, just in case they needed to step in or make things difficult.* - Wed Sep 23 22:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) ///

The children and Clone of Kirie ventured through the cave, the gas spewing from the cracks of the ground up towards the clone of the first to be sent out to the cave was hit by the gas..Then the 2nd which advanced even deeper was hit not by knock out gas but this time by knock out darts of poison which could put just about any being to sleep.. The first two initial traps were handled by the clone.

Suitengu if focused with his sight could see several spots which contained light chakra , possibly seals that can be activated..Some chakra infused strings that can trigger a trap, but what he wouldn't see are the naturally made traps, unless one of them had great sight for such.. 

The clones concealed within the deep stone of the ground, watching them like cameras and providing information of how far they were for Fujitora while he meditates and waits.

They would see from a distance, a cross roads to this maze..Two seperate paths. One safe, one a room full of traps.* - Wed Sep 23 22:50:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) //

Izanami would spot out a few man made traps, some with wiring and some with basic components.. The chakra traps seemed to have been spotted and avoided with much safety taken for it.. Now all left was to decide on WHERE they'd go before time had ran out..It was becoming obvious as the entrance to the cave closed by rock fall..And One of the seals becoming brighter with chara upon activation. Sparking lightning.* - Wed Sep 23 23:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) //

The original Fujitora looked to Kirie and said "You worry too much. " but he was impressed that she manage to master the shadow clone jutsu, something for him that to this day takes a great bit of chakra.. His clones lurked under ground like Zetsu.. Watching the children as they advanced, though this cave seemed like a safe route..

There was one threat.. As they went deeper, they'd begin to hear a light noise,  concetrated sound waves being generated from a single scroll at the very end of the cave where it looked to be not a dead end but a change of paths, it seemed like an illusion, this was a genjutsu coming up from pure sound. Stored up within the scroll tor ecycle , the two children, maybe even the shadow clones that followed, would begin to see a number of Mist servants coming about from the shadows infront, above, below and behind them..* - Wed Sep 23 23:15:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) // The sound waves coming all through the tunnel grew slightly weaker when the sounds produced from Izanami's fire came about. The sounds constantly made way through the cave, echoing and bouncing from the surface to the ears of the targets to generate such illusions.. Fujitora's shadow clone watched all this with his ear plugs in, waiting for their reaction to this before doing anything.

But...From out of the blue came to be a figure, fist made of large stone, he'd punch forward, trying to destroy the fire ball ,causing quite the explosion while defending himself with an earthly armor..He could be mistaken for a golem, but really he was a village Chuunin Veteran..SOmething on the level of which the kids may face in the chuunins exams.

Stopping them in their tracks, the man of stone pounds his fist together and then into the ground, causing it to shake when he spots them, showing that he was not going to let them pass. The being rushed towards them, maximum speed for the guy being able to move only 6 tiles, he'd try to knock the two of them back with a lariot like attack from his tackle. The stone acting as his armor. He surfed upon a silluette of mud as the shadows attacked as well for a cover.* - Wed Sep 23 23:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: Tsk, tsk, tsk...Bored and you're here apart of a simulation mission?. - Wed Sep 23 23:59:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) // THe beast continued to rush towards them as if it were a bull rush, he did not stop, despite the wires passing by and the threads coming towards him, it seem as if his movements bound to the earth were not going to slow down any time soon without a major knockback to the kenetic force, from this his limbs were more than likely binded, it attempted to punch the ground so that rocks would fire at the kids with the intension of knocking them back some more..Once he'd be struggling to free his arms of the threads, he'd continue on towards them to advance. 

Fujitora in the meantime decided to poke Kirie out of boredom , over and over again..Making sure to not touch the hair. Or weave...Or hair..* - Thu Sep 24 00:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) //  Though the golem used his arms to defend itself from the fire shuriken, it was captured by its own shadow with the shadow immitation jutsu. Not being about to move at all, the beast stood there at the mercy of Suitengu but using such strength to resist and try to break free with the chuunin like strength.. The Seal at the end of the cave intensifies to a different genjutsu, this time being one of which the ground seemingly shaking but was not.* - Thu Sep 24 00:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) // The golem was kept under the mercy of Suitengu, leaving the seal available for grabs or to destroy.. The caves sound still echoing.* - Thu Sep 24 00:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) // The tag was burned to flames from the fire ball while the golemn remained in tact it slowly began to shatter and fall apart, the cave suddenly lighter than before, with a tunnel leading up towards Fujitora or so it seemed..This mission simulation becoming harder as they go, this first phase coming to be a complete success..They could use this time to recover and think of a plan for later on if they desired.* - Thu Sep 24 01:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) waited this next day for the children, perhaps they were planning..Meanwhile he'd lie on his back and talk to Kirie about the situation "So, how many days do you give them to make it to this point?" he'd ask while looking into the skies above. Hawk eyes , a settled gaze to the imaginative thought he had, planning the great influence to the future itself.* - Thu Sep 24 19:20:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) lead the way for them to go and gather those herbs ..Fujitora knew she enjoyed research, so he wanted to give her the motivation to do such.. Unaware of the new state to have taken such a turn, he thought it was just how she was after their day..He lead her to the opposite side where a few bushes were, pointing at them he said "If you ever plan to become even greater at medical ninjutsu and the art itself, you'll need to study herbs and all natural life you can..So, gather all you can from here..And don't bullshit me with wasted effort.. " he tells her with his arms folded after releasing her.

"My dear Zen..Don't let me down." he says calmly towards her.* - Thu Sep 24 21:19:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: A few toys. - Thu Sep 24 21:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes looking at Zenaki while she worked. He smiled softly towards her as he said "Why don't you show me that nice smile you have, hm?" he ask as the man took note that she was working as hard as she needed to increase her medical ability. 

He made sure to hold his scrolls aside just incase she needed to seal away some amterial instead of having to carry all of it back home, she could just use scrolls to make such much easier. "Keep up the work and you may even become the best medic I'd come to know, my dear Zen." placing a single arm around her, he'd grin. The man cherished this one..It was not easy to obtain her, which made him enjoy her company much more than most he'd be around.

"We'll be experimenting later once you are ready..Something you can gather much experience from. Instead of simply just gathering herbs." * - Thu Sep 24 21:55:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I've promised to protect her and him. - Fri Sep 25 08:13:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: We're just heading out a little further. Ushi is someone I know. - Fri Sep 25 08:13:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Then it's fine then..I trust Ushi. - Fri Sep 25 08:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) thinks: The man that wanted my father dead feels obligated to protect my Aunt and I?.. People certainly have strange morals.. - Fri Sep 25 08:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Poetic Justice...He once wanted my wife dead..I once wanted him dead, when we faced one another no blood was shed..Now that one is fallen, the other must take up the role and live ahead..This boy both the son of a former enemy and nephew of my new lover..I am a lawful man of my word. - Fri Sep 25 08:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking to Erebus "I've done you a solid, mind doing me one and keep the boy safe?" he'd ask this man he hardly even knew..For now he'd turn around to return to the others. Rubbing his head he now knew what Garp felt like.. OP reference.. * - Fri Sep 25 08:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Morning, my dear Zenaki. - Fri Sep 25 08:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) smiled a bit, as he admired the sight of Zenaki..To him she was his prized woman , someone he couldn't think of losing..He walked over towards her, in the house, a single bandit "You wish to perform experiments? Yes?..I thought I'd bring you a gift, this fugitive..." he had news but he couldn't bring himself to tell her...YET...He looks her right in the eyes "Why don't you smile?.." he sounded curious, it being something he'd like to see..He gestured for her to come with him inside to the basement.  "A prize...For my new found lover~" he spoke in a whisper as he hugs her from behind, releasing her after.* - Fri Sep 25 08:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: You want to do it don't you? - Fri Sep 25 08:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: To further your practice with medical? - Fri Sep 25 08:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) nods his head as the clone had taken the bandit downstairs , to place him on the experiment table, chained up..The Five seal barrier around the locked down house while Fujitora and Zenaki went downstairs.. 

"He'll be another doll..Experiment as you please..And I shall be here watching..Or if you'd like, I can leave.." he tells her in a seductive like voice..He had a table set up for her with all the herbs she gathered in jars, all the needles she'd be using this day and whatever else for the experimentation of her work.

"Are you not happy?..I've kept my promise and done all I've can ever since our date." he smirked a bit, backing away at the stairway..waiting for answers.* - Fri Sep 25 09:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) watching them with his arms folded, staring at the beauty that was Zenaki..He did what ever he could to try and make her happy. He heard that she never smiles, so he thought to himself, about all of what happend to her in the past, all of what Zetsumo must of made her do.. 

He kept his eyes focused on the experiment, soon enough to make things all the more intense ..He'd go over to his own bed where he'd lie down on a table..Telling Zenaki .  

"You may experiment on myself as well..As an apology for what pain I may of caused you..Only if it'd make you smile somehow.." he was willing torisk such, waiting for her, the bandit would believe this man was crazy..Insane even..But Fujitora waited, with a gaze to the ceiling, his torso revealed to be clean..Fresh and inexperienced to the meaning of torture..

<I am a virgin to torment and true pain..But a master..Shall please his underling..>* - Fri Sep 25 09:23:12 2015
