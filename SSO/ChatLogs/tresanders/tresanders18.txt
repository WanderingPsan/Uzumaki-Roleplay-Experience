<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Though do you know Fuuinjutsu? - Wed Oct  7 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(XenoKuthric) says: I do not. - Wed Oct  7 04:10:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Or a personal scroll.. - Wed Oct  7 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(XenoKuthric) says: Could you still do it, regardless if I didn't know Fuuinjutsu as of yet? - Wed Oct  7 04:11:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon reached out to grab the very end of the hilt upon Samehada as he'd wrap those fingers around it, his finger tips were pointed towards the chest of Suitengu "Don't move....Hands can be sliced off, thus the seal would be useless..But your body will remain in tact so just as long as you do not destroy the seal, it'll be fine..And if it is destroyed, then it's likely Samehada will appear in another area of where it'll be safe within a similar seal..What I am doing will not affect you at all kiddo."  he tells him just so he'd know what Fujitora was doing, letting the boy also know that he shouldn't die with the seal upon him as a broken link. 

"Do you accept?"* - Wed Oct  7 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eventually  transfered the big item into the boys core sufface , Fujitora had a large focus for this to be done right.. "All done." he tells Suitengu with a soft smile..Looking towards Alastor "I have no more interest in the bijuu..." coming from someone who has gathered remnants of their chakra of three different host while they were berserk..He still needed to be more advanced to use that chakra more fluently.. 

"You don't want to tamper with a bijuu...Trust me..Especially without a plan that can support taking on something with the power of annilhilated an entire village in one blow."* - Wed Oct  7 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: The Shukaku was stolen from my clan. I -will- reclaim it. - Wed Oct  7 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: No...A sabaku holds it... - Wed Oct  7 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: He is no Sabaku. - Wed Oct  7 04:22:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm? - Wed Oct  7 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(XenoKuthric) says: I know I do not know Fuuinjutsu myself, but I would like you to show me examples on how to unseal this one in particular. - Wed Oct  7 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Ah, I see... - Wed Oct  7 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Well, it is rather simple.. - Wed Oct  7 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Sit, sit.. - Wed Oct  7 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon took out a scroll, labled as his weaponry scroll, something that contained a vast number of weapons within it...SOmeone who had an idea of the basic structure of Fuuinjutsu could do such, and that was what Fujitora was going to be teaching Suitengu here today..

"You first must be able to apply your chakra upon the very seal itself, since this seal is the same as the one placed on you, it is basic to remember exactly how to do it..Once you apply this needed chakra, you manipulate the formula pattern as if you were reaching into another dimension, another world where it is a space or void..Something like this doesn't take too much training but it takes the ability to recall where exactly the item was stored and just how how much chakra will be needed to unseal this item..In your case ,its a large one so it might and might not affect you.." he says while he unsealed a sword about the size of Samehada..* - Wed Oct  7 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(XenoKuthric) says: Mm.. So its all about precision then. - Wed Oct  7 04:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Spot on, that's all to it. - Wed Oct  7 04:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(XenoKuthric) says: I see. How are you able to apply the chakra like that? - Wed Oct  7 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Well, think of it like healing and chakra flow. - Wed Oct  7 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: Mr. Farmer...A question? - Wed Oct  7 04:30:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: It is also possible to seal it away just as one would Ninjutsu...I'd only do such if I was forced to.. - Wed Oct  7 04:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: It currently resides in Tetsumi. If he agreed, would you give me half of the beast? - Wed Oct  7 04:36:28 2015

Fujitora the Farmer threw these shuriken out, concealing the additional four under the main four that hurled towards the direction of the plant, and once landed it showed to be all eight, hitting their very mark placed by the master.

"The art of concealing other shuriken.." he says.* - Wed Oct  7 08:40:32 2015

"Don't think of the target yet, think of throwing them in a straight line without one flying away from the shadow of another.." he speaks calmly as he takes his tea and sips it..While this Fuji was here with Sanoke working, the realm him was just with Zenaki and thinking about how he'll continue to be low key..He didn't go out too much but when he did for research, he made sure to gather accurate material.* - Wed Oct  7 08:56:44 2015

"Hey gorgeous, would y' do me a solid? Two at that.." he asked of her, Fujitora having a soft smile under his hat..His farmer clothes a bit too common.

"A mission from the civilians need."* - Wed Oct  7 09:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon reached into the very sleeve of his kimono , which he pulled out a scroll, handing it to her before he casually began to continue pushing his crate of rice, cabbage and more..

<...Complete this task and the reward will be as double.. There is a location that has been dug deep within the underground, bandits mining with no permit or any ties to the village itself, taking away diamond and other valuable minerals...This will be counted as a Double C because of you needing to be able to successfully escort one of the workers into the mines without being discovered as shinobi, the mines are 2 miles long, 10 to 20 feet underground with  a tunnel that leads to the mountain..It is said that there are 200 Workers..Conceal yourself and take down and arrest the main three bosses at the very end...If you are discovered , the risk might just increase..If not and you do not fuck it up, your skills of keeping within the shadow and away from the enemies eye , disguised or not will be honorably recognised...I'd also appreciate it if you use the very tag behind this scroll to seal off the mines so that no one else may enter and steal Sunagakures valuable minerals again..>
