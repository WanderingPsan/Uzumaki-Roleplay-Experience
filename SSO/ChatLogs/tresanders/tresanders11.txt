"Everyone!...We have came!..We all have came..To reclaim...What is rightfully ours! " he tells to those people who remained loyal to Sunagakure and all of the Kazekage..

"You two...Talk to me..Zen..You've been acting strange..What is it?" he says in a demanding like tone.

"And Iza...I know this may seem bad..But hold in your anger..We'd of died back there if we acted against what happend..And for such I am sorry, I've failed to protect your friend.."* - Sun Sep 27 09:53:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eventually drags Zenaki into a near by home , locking the door he stood there before her, holding her at the collar "Why wont you answer me?..." he continued "Why....Why..." he pulled her in for a rough hug, her head likely by his chest.."What did I do...Zen..Why wont you speak..Why wont you smile...For me.." he glared at the womans head, nothing else to glare at..* - Sun Sep 27 10:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) holding her tightly he did not really notice the senbon, but knowing how well Zenaki could possibly use those things without hassle.. Fujitora was stabbed in the leg. "GAH!" he grunted , his grip still upon her, he'd utilize his fuuinjutsu to spread about her body as his way of preventing her to move until he was answered, though he was in pain he continued to say.

"And now...You bring harm to me...Why..." he then looked her into the eye, making her face him directly. "Fucking answer me!" he shouted! The senbon bringing pain depending on how deep it was.* - Sun Sep 27 10:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon placed a single hand to her soft chin..Then his head to hers to be very close to her "I'll ask again....Why...Wont..You..Answer..Me..Aren't I your lover?...You once called me master..I guess I did something to trigger such..So why not do you treat me like the enemy??! " he used the interrogation genjutsu to bring out answers from her at this point, forcing her to speak.* - Sun Sep 27 10:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking down a bit to the side he thought and said to her while reaching to take out the senbon "I did not intend to rape you....I thought you enjoyed it..Did you not?..I was not aiming to brain wash you but atlease convince you that I was not or ever your enemy.." he paused for a second.

"I never knew I was on your brothers list ...But know this..Zenaki..I swore..To protect the sister of an old enemy..And HIS Son..I've kept my word..You just can't see it...Can you?.." he'd push her body to the bed... 

Still using the jutsu to get answers, all one but the final.. 

"Do you want..To kill me? Someone whos promised to protect you and your nephew?"* - Sun Sep 27 10:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking at Zenaki he  says to her "....I'm not sure how to respond to such, he positioned himself over her and said "I want to know..Now...Have you ever been truly tortured?..." he asked before he took her down to the basement, where this would be a place to make her submit .

"I care for you deeply..Yet you wish to torment me.."
Taking out a knife, he'd lightly glide it upon his chest..He figured he knew what her definition of love was..Slicing away the clothes on her , he whispered .

"After all, you've had a hundred test subjects...You..don't see me as an equal, but scum.." before planting a kiss on her neck, he placed the knife, with his blood upon the blade to her left leg..Returning the favor and stabbing it before he went to grab the other leg, placing a seal upon it..The overheat seal..His method of torture.. 

"This night...You will be visited by Eight Flames...Each worse than the last..Taking your body can handle about nine from the inside..The ember will rise from the tissues heat, thus starting your bodies boiling point..Without me even trying..You will suffer...Untill you see why is it that I care so much for you." he tells her..He faked the stabbing though...That was to test her. * - Sun Sep 27 10:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes gazing into hers as he demands an answer "All those times..Even though you were pleased by my hard efforts..You could only see that as rape?..How..Evil you make me feel.." he smiled at her softly, planting a kiss to her soft lips..Zenaki's features being one of Fujitoras weaknesses as he would back himself away in this house, shielded by his barrier of the five seals .

"Why did you, treat me so well if you hated me?..Wanted to torment me?..My love?" he says as the overheating began to take place..Demanding an answer "You should speak..." spreading er legs, he knew that he was going to have to convince her, the hard way..* - Sun Sep 27 11:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispering to her , he tells her "You've never been tortured...All I did was gaze into your eyes.." he lied obviously, but then he'd go to lick her down from the neck to the legs.. He grins softly " Because you refuse to answer...You have yet to see me as an equal.." when he was going to try and make her submit purely by heat, making that very heat have an effect on her very mind of thinking as well..He waits for her to answer him.

"Did you..Or did you not enjoy our time together?...Because..I did..I cherished it .."* - Sun Sep 27 11:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon positioned himself over her as he demands more answers "Be honest! Were you not happy, were you not pleased?!  Remember the words I delivered that day..I will protect both you and your nephew...I've kept my promise and you dare try to betray me..Like some dog, not even a worthy one! A Mutt! Even though I've promised to do my part.." he  says more.

"The days of which you happily cooked for me , the days of which I gifted you with test subjects to make you happy..NONE OF SUCH WAS AGAINST YOUR WILL! YET YOU CLAIM I'VE RAPED YOU!?  " he shouted more.

"WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK I AM TO BE??! WHY DO YOU DENY ME?! WHEN I'VE DONE ALL I CAN AND MORE , GOING OUT OF MY WAY TO MAKE THE LIKES OF YOU HAPPY!

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) would continue to let it heat her body..Giving her the look , mimicing the words by lip "What I am?.." the heat began to increase more and more to dangerous levels , before long Fujitora would make it ease down to nothing as if it was not there ..When it still existed within her , so that she may here him, being over her he commands  "As I said before...LISTEN!" he shouted. Trying tog et these words into her head.. * - Sun Sep 27 11:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes glaring at her, he'd continue to shout at her "You will listen! For your own damn safety dammit!..." he would taunt her . "Maybe its because I need to please you again.." he said , kissing her neck, his right hand had a grip on her ass...He said softly "Listen.." he began to realize that he was going to have to use more force..The man literally not biting on the womans shoulder, marking her as his own.. The bite mark being deep.. <Don't you enjoy this?...Will I win you over if I continue to hurt you?> he thought , reelasing his bite . 

"Listen...I will continue to protect you...Just listen...I'll make you even more happy." He used such words to try and beat into her head..* - Sun Sep 27 11:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking at her he said "Who's the real demon....When I've killed no one.." he said ,biting once more softly knowing as tender as it was..He leaned down , pulling her ripped pants away "I'll have to it seems.." he sighed before going to lick her body, going down to lick the womans vagina for her "Isn't this what you desire?" he used his fuuinjutsu to  try and bring such words directly to her head "Listen....." it repeats over and over.* - Sun Sep 27 12:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) taking a break to stop and place himself over her once more, using his abilities to make it seem as if the words had only gotten louder the more she did not listen "LISTEN!" was like Shia Labuff shouting <DO IT!> to someone..Fujitora could not afford to lose his ZEnaki and so he continued to do this up until she was ready to finally listen! He held her close, "Am I not your lover?!" he shouts "WHY DO YOU DISOBEY ME?! WHEN I'VE DONE NOTHING BUT GOOD FOR YOU!?" he shouts once more, using this repeating process, till he was able to mentally break the woman.* - Sun Sep 27 12:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon held his hands to her head , the words suddenly stopped for this moment he'd talk "I don't ever wish to kill you Zenaki...I simply wish for us to be happy once again.." soon after the overheat sealing were all focused upon her head, she seemed so hot ehaded after all, he knew if physical pain would not break her down, then a combined mnetal and physical would, as the words of <LISTEN> repeats just as rapidly as the heat increases to a point of which all would seem like a dream..The sealing not going to kill her but rather place her in such a conditional where Fujitora was pushed to use pure force.* - Sun Sep 27 12:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: What has happend to you..My love...To make me use force as though I were as much as a villan as him..Zetsumo.. - Sun Sep 27 12:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eventually, he'd let this continue.. <I didn't even stab you yet...> he thought to himself, sitting up, now making such only intesify with the overheat, she'd probably start seeing things now.. He used this to his advantage <I am sorry..> he thought while this would go on until she had totally lost it..He knew she was going to just ignore him, so this would continue for as long as it needed.. "Stop being selfish..." he said simply, watching her take on such agony.* - Sun Sep 27 12:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking at her with his arms folded, the man would decide to do one final thing, before the genjutsu finally ends, placing his hand upon her head, he released her of all the seald but altering one specific seal, which he would purposely  force a single finger into the womans mouth knowing she'd choke a bit to place his marking, his fuuinjutus signature to the area above her throat , a seal that would be unfound unless someone were to slice into her skull..This seal to be used for the future just to keep her old self surpressed.. Fujitora pulled his hand out, as his final act of torment, allowing her to stand.

"Yes...You are mine..You are safe forever with me.." he tells her with a small smirk.. Positioning himself over her to deliver a final kiss to ease her a tad bit. His mission was complete..her mission..Was complete.* - Sun Sep 27 13:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) would keep the woman down.. "First..You must heal yourself..And recover.." he tells her, perhaps a medic came to heal.."I will have to learn to heal someday myself..Oh..And what was that Pizza made of?..I'd love another..My Dear Zenaki.." he tells her.* - Sun Sep 27 13:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) smiled softly towards her, rubbing his chin, listening , all was going well with the ingredients up until he ehard human meat..He paused...He was silent..Everything was all clear now or so it seemed! The world stopped! To Fujitora, all timed and motion stopped! His eyes were wide open <...I ate..Human meat...She..SHE Ate Human meat, as if it was casual too!....Oh god..Izanami! I think she ate that pizza as well!!!...> he took a second to look up to the ceiling with a blank expression wide eyes. <And....AM I ...AM I IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE WHO LITERALLY EATS AND DRINKS PEOPLE!?! Is that why her eyes red?! Why Zetsu had me on his list?!?! Was I their next meal?!?! WHAT THE HELL!!> he was feeling a light headed feeling to his head, and a weak stomach.. <But...Alas...It was so good...What do I do?...I ate someone...I..I fucked someone who eats people....> he was so...

Fujitora...Was slowly beocming a bit depraved! * - Sun Sep 27 13:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: W-whats your normal diet?.... - Sun Sep 27 13:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Hm.. I eat this. It's delicious, isn't it? And a lot of other recipes. Why do you ask? Master? - Sun Sep 27 14:00:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Well....No harm in it ...If its bandits...Right?! - Sun Sep 27 14:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon hugged Zenaki, once she was healed "I love my dear Zen...Don't you feel the same way about master?" he asked..He had finally won the battle..His arms gripped her shoulders tightly, a glare towards her as if her demons had leeched on upon him.* - Sun Sep 27 14:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) chuckled lightly...And nervously..He felt as if she were any stronger, she'd turn him into her next meal...So he kept his cool, and considered such, thinking that it was how she survived.. He looked at her, placing his chin gently by her neck, hugging her tightly..He says "Now I wonder...How..Your blood may taste.." he was becoming curious..Trying to understand things from her sight, at the previous bite mark...Was he truly daring enough to sink his teeth into her for the taste of blood.. <A new world was formed...In Fire and blood..>* - Sun Sep 27 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) smirking, he opened his jaw only to bite down on her flesh upon her shoulder near her neck <Your punishment for threatening me..> he thought to himself, biting harder only to break the flesh for little to some blood to come on out before he stopped..Now glaring towards her with some blood on his teeth. For that moment she was his test subject number 1...* - Sun Sep 27 14:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) listening, then licking his own teeth the man replied "Mm..." he went to lick the blood upon her flesh, sucking a bit at it..But pulling away.."I--I can't...I wont..." he did not want to become a man eater, but Zenaki's blood was making him into such..And her cooking..Damn her good ass cooking with human meat.. "Taste sweet..." he licks it up for her a bit more, naturally, licking helped the ehaling process.. "You even please master with your blood." he tells her.* - Sun Sep 27 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon, holding her near him, he pulled off his uchiha clothing, his hand out as he tells her "You...You can bite my arm...Masters blood is something you'd like after all right?" he tells her with this offer. Teasing her even by placing one initial cut.* - Sun Sep 27 14:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) sitting down along side her, he smiled , in some pain, he was glad to have satisfied her with his blood. He would then say "Now heal it..And from your ehaling I'll learn to heal as well..After all, some days I might just need to ehal you..Today you did great in healing those around you during the battle.." he said to her , now waiting to learn what he could about healing if she perfected it well enough or could use himself and herself as a training componnent.* - Sun Sep 27 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: How'd her teeth get so sharp for such a little person?! - Sun Sep 27 14:55:08 2015

"I do believe I told you to never leave my side...You fail to understand that this shit is not welcomed...You know..I had to walk, ALLL the way to Kono fucking Ha..And you see...I'm just so sleepy and worried.." he cracks the whip.

"Don't worry...By the end of the day, you'll be helping me..Remember? " he refers to her torturing him to awaken his latent ability if he had it..For now he'd only discipline the woman..He slapped her with a back hand.

"You ignored me a shit ton....You said a lot of hurtful things.." he then pulled her close towards him "And all of those evil things rubbed off onto me.." before he'd toss her over to the side Zetsumo style.
