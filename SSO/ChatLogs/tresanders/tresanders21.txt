"I've only wished you knew sooner...But your boyfriend..Seisuke was killed..By the hands of someone with gray purple eyes and two rings.." he says as he'd summon out Samehada but was referring to the rinnegan because he knew the killer before his death.* - Sat Oct 10 07:14:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) now within his lab deep within the underground as Fujitora went out to his room of classified storage, something hidden from all in Suna, and those of whom he had worked with..He thought to himself , looking up to the very shelf of which he contained the chakras of Several different Bijuu, being the Gobi, which belonged to Kastya, with a LARGE supply of chakra from this one enough to split between four different people and have those people reach a high level of transformation..Now looking on to his next Vile to see that it was the vile of the one tail Shukaku , remnants which were collected from Tetsumi during his rampage, though this number of supply was not to high in quantity as the rest, it was a good bit a great bit considering the recent attack of Shukaku now that one would think of it..  Good enough to split between two people...Now finally being the bijuu chakra of Koeki which was the least he had, only enough for one person at that...Fujitora kept this collection secret and hidden from everyone, sealed away so deep within a vault that he could not trust it with the world..

Now Fujitora spoke to himself <I'll need to find more loyals who can handle such chakra just as I could...That way we can change the world bit by bit..Over time and slowly..These people will be my Pseudo Jinchuriki of the great Five...The Farmers Creed..Or rather..The Blood Moon Creed..> he thought to himself, always trying to change the world for the better..Thinking long hard and focused upon such that shall come.. <Rule one to gathering the chakra of a bijuu...Never fight it directly..It's chakra always scatter..It's body is made up of sheer chakra..It is only time before one can do as I and take the many remnants from the beast directly or indirectly..> he thought , now thinking about those he met in Kumo, he'd have to go back and check on the place itself.. He couldn't just stand around all the time, he needed to collect research worthy data for his own studies and gain to change this realm.

However for now, he'd begin the painful process, making a shadow clone or two to grab the large supply of Gobi chakra gained from his former wife in order to use the Four Symbol Seal upon himself to place this chakra inside of his own body..Though it was very painful,, EXTREMELY painful the man shouted but tried to maintain his focus on the goal, even if the pain was intense, he needed this new power not only to use for himself but to balance out the amouth of chakra he will be giving out to his loyal followers later on..If it was anything he learned from his rival edge it was that people needed power, they desired and lived off of it..Fujitora was going to shake the world and turn it upside down..With that, he'd need power, even if he ran the risk of becoming  a demon, he needed such power to fight off certain battles he might of not been able to win alone..The pain had him screaming a terror of high volumes..Kicking even, it was hard for the shadow clone to maintain itself along with Fujitora helping with the seal as well..The man kept his eyes on the goal..Focused...Trying to relax..Trying to be calm..To accept this demonic chakra into himself...The Blood Moon Creed would some day become strong..To make the world tremble..To make all evil tremble in fear to Fujitoras plan and his wrath.* - Sat Oct 10 08:25:36 2015

A small smile brimmed across his features.. <Kastya..I take up your curse to put myself in the shoes of our offspring...Ushi..I take upon your will to lead an influence to our clan and this world..> he chuckled lightly..He seemed tired...As if he went through hours of torment.* - Sat Oct 10 08:39:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon would prepare his formulation process, placing his hand flat on her hip as he began to channel his chakra to a single point of which would seal the samehada within her..HOWEVER! Just in case something were to happen to Lera or the Seal, Fujitora would have a certain trigger to activate which would destroy such access and bring the blade back to his own Fuuinjutsu Dimension..He trusted Lera enough to know the risk of carrying something so prized and potent..As it eats away chakra..

"No one is to know about this seal..If they ask, just tell them it is to maintain your fire or something.." he tells her..Removing his hand to have his very own signia of Fuuin upon her which was a mix of the Uzumaki symbol and that of Uchiha .* - Sat Oct 10 20:45:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) examining Lera's figure so that he would be able to give her the described tatto upon her skin. He began to channel chakra to a single finger to begin the process, so focused so that he would not mess up all he asked of her was .

"Do not move too much..It might burn alittle.." he tells his sister as he waits for the chakra to be fully charged before he could perform the operation with the finger carving seal.* - Sat Oct 10 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) focused on the task at hand, Fujitora soon completed the seals , though they had no effect, he figured he could be able to add on to probably increase her use of fire when in danger..But he was unsure if he was capable of such..However knowing of the overheat sealing he could place on her for her own protection..He didn't want to take the risk just yet, it may somehow spread to the wrong person in reaction to a spar or such..So FUji just kept it simple with his rune writing..These seals possible able to glow brightly during the times she used the Fire Shroud..* - Sat Oct 10 20:58:14 2015

"Take it you are from Kiri? What's your name?" he didn't bother to fold his arms as he usually did, instead he just rested a single hand on the sash around his hip.

"I like you Paine.. Enjoy your stay within Sunagakure.." she was one of the only friends of Zenaki aside Katsune to gain his favor..Others not so likely.. Fujitora then turned to Zenaki.

"But I still have something to discuss with you..For your actions.." he was going to punish her lawfully for not listening to him during the situation with Beth, though this time it was clear he was letting her off easy. The man gave off a feeling of authority and lawful goodness...Though at times , Zenaki gave him chills up his spine with what he knew she was capable of doing when given the power.* - Sat Oct 10 23:33:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: .. - Sun Oct 11 00:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) sorta shivers to the words of Ai, last time he was dragged to the girls basement he did not have any means of escape..NONE but now he'd go and lead Paine, Zenaki and Ai out to the area where Suna had the most durable of fields to train at, he looked at Paine once he'd step in.

"First step.." he channels chakra through the entire area of runes...

"Second step..." those runes would ermerge with minerals , likely diamonds that he had gained from all those people doing his work for him as their missions that he rewarded them all form to prevent the bandits from stealing such from Suna..

"Third step.." these runes would vanish after their initial glow.. Looking to Paine as he said to her.

"You're opponent wont be me directly, but something else you can also go all out on..Not sure of your fighting style but you seem strong..And have gained some of my liking towards you with your polite ways.. So, I have this ..My creation."

He'd clap his hands together , Fujitora at the center now rising on from the ground up as forms of stone, maybe even those harder crystals would begin to come together up under him , forming what looked to be a giant sized Golemn, his normal work is 15 meters and so he'd advance on to another, making this golem the size of 20 Meters tall, not as bulky for the safe of speed and well shaped with the stone that had been unsealed from the storage of Fujitora..Standing on the top of it's head, this Fuji said to her.

"This experiment is a test of my creations durability...Take advantage of its regenration.." he says as the beast lifts a single arm up, smashing it into the ground , the impact caused a bit of shock, causing a trembling feeling those near by.* - Sun Oct 11 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: ...Meh, fought against worse. - Sun Oct 11 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) standing on the very top of the Golemns head, this Fuji would look down from his view only to notice the quick movement of Paine to have suddened appeared as though from thin air to land a kick upon his golem .

<She's fast..> he thought to himself , the beast being knocked back by the kick, probably gaining a chip or such in the very diamond due to her current strength that was delivered.. The shock of impact delivered from the kick caught the golem off guard, it stumbled back a bit but now Fuji gave it a command to make it all the move challenging..

<Strike..> Was what he commanded it to do, the giant beast lifting up its mighty 4 limbs, as it started to send a series of punches, though for its size these were rather quick..Fujitora stood there with his hands in a single hand sign, concetrating the chakra within himself, now that the beast could do such on its own.  The man was thinking of something else to do in order to make this more challenging, his focus on one key thing now.. 

Within every punch, came a force of imapct to the ground that would deliver a minor shake to the very ground itself, all aimed to Paine to test her very might.. If she were to be hit, then she'd be knocked back into the rocky wall behind her, as the golems punches were both quick for its size and consistent..Could she challenge them, or would she avoid them?* - Sun Oct 11 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: That looks intimidating... was that the object Fuji was refering to at one time? - Sun Oct 11 01:30:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes peeringto Paine as she battled against the golem of Fujitora, the beast sending out punches but some being deflected and tossed down by her smart choice of action, he commends her for this by delivering a smile on his face as his arms fold..He continued to command the golem as it would walk on towards her until it had gotten in the range it'd needed to be, though it had taken damage, nearly falling upon its own leg due to the force of impact Paine was able to provide.. 

The golem of 20 meters went on with its command.. The four arms rising again once more, this Fujitoras eyes focused  on Paine as he'd command the golem to toss a series of long punches both rapid and strong to chase her down across the mountain..This was Fuji's way of saying <Golems...Unlike us humans do not get tired..These punches are endless..> he wanted to see just how long Paine could endure and get away from such, with each strike aimed directly towards her direction, giant fist of stone and diamond crashing against the mountain..Dust all over from each punch to crash into the mountain..

However each punch was slightl pulled to be sure that he didn't crush the girl, he needed her alive.. However the punches were aimed to send her flipping across the mountain if landed close enough from their sheer force and impact.

Meanwhile, Fujitora meditates on the head and concetrates ...<Later I'll make this more challenging..> This was his way of training those with taijutsu..If they could manage against a regenerating golem, they could do such against most other things.. <Is this the end of her power?..>* - Sun Oct 11 01:35:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) //
Though the punches and damage, most had been deflected by Paines amazing efforts to fight off the beast..
With the golem coming at her with more punches non stop as if he could go on for years to come, another punch directed towards her would descent from the heavenly sky as this moment would probably reveal the veyr plain that Paine was devising up at the time..

Aside from this another punch was made into a hook like strike, since this was a ountain, it needed to to more than just jabs and strong rights, but rather mxing up the choice of moves.

Fujitora waits patiently on the golems head while he meditates..* - Sun Oct 11 02:21:39 2015
