<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking at the two, well three, Hiroshi, Ivel and Marrisa , sitting down on the sand on a blacket made for a picnic that he unsealed..The man soon began a small process of placing the right markings on the fan of Marrisa. Just like how she had the ability to increase her wind power during the Labyrinth, she'd have the same ability but slightly weaker than when she had her amulet placed in, Fujitora then began to explain..

"When I was a kid, about a few years older than you are now Ivel, I was strandad on that island once, however now getting to far within it my first day, I was both lost and hopeless, not knowing where to go..But the natives, they guided me , as the many monsters on the island threaten to take my life, I was not only forced to survive but create my own abilities to better face off against such beast...You  see, because of the Labyrinth , I developed my inner ember, ,fighting so many monsters, demon like beings , only summoned out my very fire shroud , the first stage...I was on that island for several months...Eventually I got to the core which is now my base...But ebfore I could even reach it, I had to fight an even stronger ebast..Not bigger in size..But like a human...When I fought it..I was owned..Utterly..But trying again and again, day after day, I discovered its weakness...I got past the seven plagues and sins , over through the beast and sided with the natives to be recognised as Yonkou of the land..To eventually get to where I needd.."

He continued to work on the fan, putting a certain pattern for her wind or whichever ONE element she chooses chakra flow to be better amplified much like how his sword was with his Ryushini No Yari, a blade of which was of passive fire at little to no cost for the likes of this man.. 

"In return...I've gained something prized of the core...An Amulet..That has helped my greatly through my journey.." he spoke so casually.* - Thu Nov  5 06:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: How did I get stranded?..I was sailing for kirigakure, and got stuck in a tropical storm...Winds took me so far from the mainland, I ended up on the Labyrinth ....And as for the amulet..Hm.. - Thu Nov  5 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: That all depends on how well prepared you are.. - Thu Nov  5 06:09:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) closing his eyes to better see his sons chakra through his sensory, he'd go and thrust his right arm forward so suddenly to his sons chest aimed t his heart to send this surge of chakra to such a chakra point where it would inspire his fire within to be quicker to bring out, this very same thing was done to Lera..Izanami and everyone else who had to develop the fire shroud because of it first needing to be influenced to their dormant potential.. He said.

"For Thousands Of Years the flame lies dormant..Only Thee can disturb its rest..And bring upon its eternal light." he spoke , this punch would be faint to his son, not knocking him back but he'd feel such a sudden surge of chakra as well..* - Thu Nov  5 06:20:09 2015
