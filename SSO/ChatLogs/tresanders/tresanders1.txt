<br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) simply he continued on to train with his abilities of barrier ninjutsu which were his practice derived from Fuuinjutsu, so he tried his ebst to be sure that he was atleast an expert with the five seal barrier so that he could be able to decrease the chakra needed for such a jutsu.* - Mon Aug 31 18:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) not only kept note but he made sure that when he worked on the five seal barrier , that he would make sure it was going to be more stable than what it was before. Seemingly enough though, he had some skill more than enough needed for what he was doing.* - Mon Aug 31 19:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) had little to work with now so he had to make even more notes for the purpose of his training so he could be able to perfect the barrier at a minimum of his talent and not struggle with anything more than such.* - Mon Aug 31 19:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) making out to the well being of his own training he thought to himself "Maybe I'll be able to form a stronger barrier if I focus on just this one simple area, considering the size and the things needed for this.." he thought to himself.* - Mon Aug 31 19:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) simply continued his own training considering that so much may have been missed he thought more to the options that could benefit him to the situation.* - Mon Aug 31 19:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) Meanwhile the young lad stood by at the mountain side where he began to focus on his usage of chakra with much control in the attempt, trying to hone and increase the reserves of chakra he had stored within himself, though he was only going to be a scout and swordsman, he needed this, it was essential for his selection of abilities.. While doing such, he would try to focus on the flow of which to make his chakra flow like a river of water even if he was a bit distracted, this would help him control the form of the five seal barrier.* - Mon Aug 31 19:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) taking the time to process himself with the fuuinjutsu art, he thought more about the mechanics to it and how he could not only upgrade the use but make it better for himself as well. He needed to be able to perfect everything he could do.* - Mon Aug 31 19:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) just kept on reading through his own studies to practice this one possible outcome.* - Mon Aug 31 19:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) was on the track of training still, making the seal bigger than it was before so that he could repeat this process over and over again, making sure that he was able to do so.* - Mon Aug 31 19:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) began to finalize his abilities with this barrier to make it even more so perfect.* - Mon Aug 31 19:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) gave Yan a good ass thumbs up with his smile brimming, he'd do the same as he shot the water out and away in the form of an expert when said the jutsu mentally <Waterrgun>* - Mon Aug 31 19:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking over to Dravae with a soft grin he said to him "I've just been home, but I see Yan here has improved greatly with the jutsu I tauht him of the water element. " he was impressed by the progress, he as a teacher always enjoyed seeing many progress well and good enough to become great fighters one day.. Walking over towards Drvae, possible with Izanami at his side he just said to him "Maybe al this new change has changed the way people view the shinobi world and ways." now curious to other things as well.* - Mon Aug 31 19:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) nodding his head he agreed "Well, since we do have smaller numbers we can use that to focus more time on the students to have them learn more with a class of ten than what a class of 50 may learn since we have much more time and focus on few." he mentions.* - Mon Aug 31 19:53:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: Shadow Clone jutsu...It allows my clones to use any jutsu and gather information for me..I did this to keep an eye out as I study and go for walks  hehe. It's not a very complex jutsu..A split of chakra as all. - Mon Aug 31 20:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) standing about around the village with not much going on, he simply stood within his house where he would be training about with his own skills and abilities, mainly just his shadow clone jutsu that he has been working on for quite some time, now that he was around more often to train his daughter Izanami and his other two kids, he said to himself "My peek is near, and I am to be the one to guide the newer generation as a teacher, though my power is limited, I can always do as much as I can to help them all grow..So I wil continue to learn as well.." he said while he trained his shadow clone jutsu along with his root sealings.* - Fri Sep 04 12:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) keeping his mind at bay with what he was training on, the young lad had to be sure. That each formulated seal was used properly along with his shadow clone jutsu so that he would be able to study it more and more easily so that he may also be able to make his way with the ability so he can progress quicker later on and not hinder his skill and abilities.. As old as he was right now being in his twenties. he had to keep up no matter what.* - Fri Sep 04 12:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) having to check on the abilities to seal, he needed much measure, all to be sure that he'll be able to absorb certain ninjutsu into his seals and be able to create other forms of sealing as well , since he contained one mastered and created jutsu of his own, he needed to be able to create other seals as well and other buffs so that he can adjust his abilities.. In the future and the current times where he could use them with little hassle.* - Fri Sep 04 12:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) being the rank of a Jounin he was, he needed to improve both his skills and his widths to create even more devestating attacks to be able to manipulate fire more fluently and easily without the hassle he'd have on the regular, since Berith was not as busy as a shinobi as he was, he had to be sure that his skills were just as fine as Kastya when they were married, so that he would not have to worry about being strong enough to protect his family. Utilizing his shadow clone jutsu and his sealings of the root to be able to become the finest of sealsmen.* - Fri Sep 04 12:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) keeping his mind at ease and focused with his training to be able to create those certain seals he needed. So to be sure he was going to make the roots well and nice, the young parent was going to keep training, he felt that what he lacked in power, he'd make up for in inteligence and such.* - Fri Sep 04 12:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) continuing his training so that his skill would be increasing slowly over time, he thought to himself more and more about the fact that his skills would not be just as good as most, so he had to make it so that his skills were as great as he needed them to be So he continued to work on this root sealings.* - Fri Sep 04 12:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) making sure that the seals were well shaped the young parent just root sealed his sand away so that his abilities were going to be as sharp as ever, meditating his skills to be more than just well focused on his winnings and focus on mastering this skill which was a B ranking ability.* - Fri Sep 04 12:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) simply standing there he decided to not waste time just staring off at nothing, if he was going to stand around he may as well be focusing on his damn chakra control, so that was what he did, generating chakra from a single hand seal he made in which case he'd make a few several shadow clones to concetrate with him, one to be precise on this thing of controlling his chakra, so that he could better train a single skill and increase the ability of his shadow clone jutsu, despite the big drain it had, he decided to do so anyway along with his root sealing.* - Fri Sep 04 12:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) keeping his eyes set on just the one goal of his shadow clones and root sealing, he continued to train the two arts, thinking about his family, and how he had to hone his abilities just for his kids and village sake to be able to later teach these abilities to others of the generation. Easily he was able to focus, but to make the clones worthy enough to train with was a struggle to his own stamina.* - Fri Sep 04 13:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking over towards his young daughter , he hugged her back with a warm smile while rubbing her hair upon the head. "Heya Iza my child. How has your training been going?..You must of learned much, yes?" he asked her as he'd scan the area just in case!* - Fri Sep 04 23:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) raises eye brow "What?" was oblivious* - Sat Sep 05 00:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) placing a single hand upon his hip he looked at Tetsumi "I was home, as you know, in my study..Why are you so upset, you live with me. I'm never far away and if I was, I'd tell you and your sister." he sighs before looking over to spot Dravae, a small grin came upon his features when called out by the dear friend "Dravae, my good buddy, how goes it? And I've been in my study, trying to increase what little skill I have of Fuuinjutsu to place a barrier around every major building....But the sad truth is that it takes chakra...Chakra of which I my self do not possess, if I even successfully managed, I would not be able to fight for myself..So that answers the theory of where the police head has been." he stated simply.. Nodding to Orakuru of him being the old husband of Kastya before her death..He was so lawful..* - Sat Sep 05 00:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) taking out a big ass book of which he summoned from a scroll, it was blueprints for this idea . "In the end of the event, It would still end off with my body alone being the very source of chakra..If I managed to do this, it would constantly drain my chakra, just like it is doing now with the few barriers I already have placed...However it is also the reason, I myself may have to stay set as a teacher and retire from the police force...The massive drain of chakra will hinder me, no matter what...Due to the abilities I use and the style of which I fight, if you were to give me chakra, It'd not be forever.." he thought about one thing for a moment, a forbidden scroll of Kastya's old tailed chakra remnants he had stored up, if he could use that as a temporary source... 

"So what I'll do is this...If you all can somehow gather the resources needed..Because the gofu Kekkai can only affect non living structures..Meaning that wall and only that wall alone will not be destroyed..BUT people can easily and possibly fly over or dig under...Even summon others into this village..So you must ask yourselves, what do we need more? A great barrier or traps?...I can set both, and pay for it all myself..I am very wealthy..But I will still need funding from others.."

When the Bruce Wayne needs cash...So strong, his face is.* - Sat Sep 05 00:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: How does a barrier around the village sound? - Sat Sep 05 00:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chiyari(Guujin) whispers: That sounds like an outstanding idea. - Sat Sep 05 00:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chiyari(Guujin) whispers: After Zetsumo's last attack, everything is needed. - Sat Sep 05 00:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: But I wiill need someone else who is a fuuinjutsu specialist.. Aside myself, due to the effects of this barrier I will create.. - Sat Sep 05 00:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: I will also need a unit of trap specilist. - Sat Sep 05 00:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: Because I have a lot of scrolls with many of my jutsu sealed off within them.. - Sat Sep 05 00:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking at them all he simply said "I'll need those experienced with my particular seals and those who can scout the wall just as well as they can scout the lands when placing mines...So Tetsumi, bring that guord here.. Dravae----" he wanted to see just who else he could bring along for this C rank assignment.. "Chi would you mind seeing it out that these who come along with me get a good reward? I am making preporations, and will be paying for most of this.." little known fact, he was rich..Just did not flash the shit. * - Sat Sep 05 00:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) nods his head as the shadow clone vanished, Fuji had been at the gate with a truck of scrolls, he looked drained as fuck with this shit, having traps made with Ai's help and her paper abilities, along with his own sealing abilities to have most of the wall already set, however this bitch was miles long. He felt like he needed his own way and fashion of making clones to get this all done easier, however good news came from the information gained from his clone that the others were coming and that Hiru was in town.. However..Time was precious. He was disappointed that he couldn't go say hello really quick.* - Sat Sep 05 01:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking at the two, he'd hand them both two seperate carts, each containing twenty to fifty tags marked with fuuinjutsu sealing sof the root sealing art and many other types of seals, Fujitora was skilled in many arts, so these scrolls all contrained jutsu of each basic element and some with even advanced explosions as he told them "Each of these are labled...Some fire a barrage of kunai and arrow...Some just elements of fire and even lighhtning.." he told them while his own was done, he had already spreaded and concealed his own..He now needed them to do their work..Fujitora seemed drained..Maybe it was the use of clones and his stamina at work. For now he'd begin to focus his chakra on making the barrier for later.* - Sat Sep 05 01:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) Ok, so what would be the drain if I try making a 5 seal barrier around the village gates?..* - Sat Sep 05 01:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) his hand in the tiger hand seal while the other two went ahead to do what he asked of them, a small smile came about his features "I need much chakra, so that this drain would not be as harmful.." he said while performing the hand signs for his five seal barrier to create some form. So to help himself out, he'd go and open ONE seal of chakra that was away, he opened it secretly, but this remnant bijuu chakra which was taken from when Kastya went on her rampage on multiple times, sealed within scrolls with his skill to use for later as he would focus on taking it all in..He said to himself "You have always left many gifts behind for me and them." he whispered while the chakra remants of the gobi went into him slowly only for a small portion to be used ..Some would probably mistake him for a Jinchuriki , this was just one scroll, others he kept locked away in a forbidden room of his own.. He was soon refilled with chakra, up to 200% maybe...Ready to finalize the seals needed for the barrier to create it up to a large span! 

This was an attempt!* - Sat Sep 05 01:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) is not shirtless and tatted up with his own seals. -omit-* - Sat Sep 05 01:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) how much chakra will Five Seal barrier drain for trying to cover the entire wall around suna or just in the front portion with a barrier?* - Sat Sep 05 01:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking at his child he smiled "So how was your spar?" though he was masking his ability by claiming to be normal.* - Sat Sep 05 02:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon drew out his katana, he knew what he was preparing young Izanami for, to become one of the shinobi police to be one of the very elites, a promotion after her own graduation, the young man soon began to flow chakra from his sword onto his blade which blazed a bright fire, he did the same with his shuriken and tossed them towards the tree , they burned right through! Igniting parts of the tree in a bright flame. "It's something I think you've seen me do many times, something I know you can do.." he told her.* - Sat Sep 05 03:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) waited patiently for her attempts, the tree ready to take hits of fire.* - Sat Sep 05 03:16:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) its because I will need a perk for it like how I have one for a small barrier.* - Sun Sep 06 19:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) made way to the area, wondering where Ushi went.. <There's no hope in following from this point..I'll have to talk another day..> he thought while looking back to walk towards the area of which he was standing.* - Sun Sep 06 19:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) made his way towards Aiyana to help her up on some port-medical bed with what few NPC's were around, looking around for Dravae.* - Sun Sep 06 20:00:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon went out towards the mansion, the REAL Fujitora would stay around to hold up a barrier for the mansion while the clone would be going with them, it'd make little sense for him to fight with little to more than half of his own chakra reserves draining away at him constantly to protect the villagers.. He wore a mask as a clone, and made sure to meditate for the trip.. To be able to atlease fight and use whatever sources of chakra from Kastya's old remnants he had left just in case to fool certain people.. He said to himself as a clone before leaving <War is sometimes pointless..> he thought..* - Sun Sep 06 20:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Tre sanders) whispers: Stay in the mansion or hidden tunnel witht the REAL me.. - Sun Sep 06 20:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Tre sanders) traveling along with them, the clone had been formulating seals for future preporations, seals of which were the lotus and root seals to be able to summon out his weapon traps from his attached tags to certain weapons, all while talking to Dravae "The barrier will be enough just in case someone strikes, the people can escape..For now we should strategize yes?...Your bugs can do much, It makes me wonder if they can transport my seals." he talked to Dravae in a whisper.* - Sun Sep 06 20:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Tre sanders) taking his control to those bugs given to him, he thought to himself as he'd begin to concetrate upon placing a tangible Overheat sealing upon the bugs of Dravae, HIS THEORY was that if his bugs came in contact with someone, the seal could spread on to that person for Fujitora, he only hoped this could work, aside from some bugs carrying these small written seals, he said "This just may work.." but will it?* - Sun Sep 06 20:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Tre sanders) hands Dravae a mask though just in case.* - Sun Sep 06 21:05:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Tre sanders) was focusing chakra to maintain the powerful tags he had under his cloak..
However in the meantime under ground with a few other shinobi as he traveled with the sensory shinobi possibly jammed only to not detect them, he began to think "If we pin point them out, we can strike with sand and fire..But for now we have to make sure we run into no traps..Our sensory types should be able to focus and find those.." he thought..* - Sun Sep 06 21:39:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Tre sanders) simply with the bugs he had with him, a gift from Dravae, he continued to make his way throughout the village, infantry type of work, to keep an eye out on the battle field while also making sure no innocents were caught in the cross fire, however he couldn't go too far, he had to watch over Tetsumi and Dravae along with the others, but being so deep under ground, it was hard to tell what exactly was going on.* - Sun Sep 06 21:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) is deep within the mansion obviously for barrier sake. * - Sun Sep 06 22:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) le shadowclone came outside "Hm, been a while Ed--------Oh....Fuck.." he said looking at the bandits that surrounded them. "Told those fools this would happend if they left the place without guards .." a sword drawn he looked at the bandits. Then he looked to Edge "How much further will you go Edge?.." he had only took a defense. Trying to talk with the leader of this assault or take over.* - Sun Sep 06 22:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) raises his hand to signal that those selected few people. "I do have a question for you though...Why did you disappear?..We could of talked things out, but you vanished..." he said to Edge while the men came out, probably his daughter as well only if she was still there..She'd of course be behind him. Knowing that the forces they had were all too little to nothing in power anyhow. He'd only have her by the door of the mansion of course.

"So what will you do now? Is what I must know...Because as we speak, Zetsumo and the others are fighting...You have won this land, and its people." he mentioned, as he saw it.. If the people chose Edge like this, and believing in Kastya's judgement from when she selected him as one to be Kazekage, Fujitora followed with the civilians he protected as well.. * - Sun Sep 06 22:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) having to try and remember back when this all happend, he came to the conclusion "All were blind by the actions that occured that day and moment..If Chiyari does return, then you will have all of Suna along side you, with the ultimate decision of -you- being the new ruler..No one else. " he said while paying attention to what Edge said . "I take it, that it was from the help of Eiko as well hm?" he knew of the plan to plant bombs around the escape systems, as he had helped with some of it but NOT all of it to know all of what Edge told him.

"Just what else have you done?.." well actually that was a well made defense plan. Fuji rubbed his chin. 

"What is your next step?...I know of you being a strategist but...This has taken strategy to a new field..If this had been a game of chest..One would be confused." he pondered.* - Sun Sep 06 23:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking towards the soldiers he'd only shut the mansion door for the civilians and his daughter to be safe as he allows himself to be taken by the soldiers as he said "I thought you said you'd leave the civilians and children alone Edge..What is this??.." he asked while the barrier kept up.

"You have the village..No council to oppose you, what more could you desire?.."* - Sun Sep 06 23:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) was coming to realize a small bit of what he meant.. He sighed softly, joyed inside that the civilians were well protected.. 

<Sacrifice the old so that the young can live..> was what he did today.* - Sun Sep 06 23:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) sighed simply as he heads back inside,  to disperse with the information gathered, Suna had survived to live another day. Now Fujitora had to plan a way for his family to survive. The wrath of what was to come.* - Sun Sep 06 23:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) simply began his dayly indoor training deep within the mansion where he was going to be highly focused upon the lotus sealing along  with his shadowclone jutsu that needed much work to improve with over the time passing by. So he decided to dedicate this time to those two skills alone, nothing else, nothing more, just his fuuin and his shadow clone ability so that he could use it better within battle when he needed to aand when it called for it much like how he did with this war to set out any plans he needed. So he kept put before making his way out to other places such as Konoha knowing the people needed him here more.* - Wed Sep 09 04:04:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) simply he went on with the same routine of his training with the shadow clone and his lotus formed sealing, to be better capable of sealing foes away when he was focused upon all other things, though for now he needed to increase his own control, maybe even his hand sign speed over all to perform all jutsu needed without having much of a threat to stop him, however, it was not like he truly needed hand signs.* - Wed Sep 09 04:09:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) keeping his mind set and focused on the abilities of only this one shadow clone jutsu, he looked back at the kage mansion from his window as he trained at home, thinking to himself at how he could improve the use of his shadow clone abilities, to better use them to travel from one end of the world to another, to be able to be in one place and another place just so he could handle multiple task as well..* - Fri Sep 11 00:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) continued to make sure that he himself wa spolished with these skills of training, also making sure to increase the very ROOT sealing as well, transitioning between the two and being able to use one and the other all to be very positive that his skills would be good enough to use within the times of battle and out, even though his times in battle were quite short, he could use such practice.* - Fri Sep 11 00:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) knowing the training would be vigirous, he had to push himself anyway and make sure that his power were all well polished to be able to use in and out of battle, he was aware of bijuu and figured many more were out there, however he didn't now HOW many exactly but he had an idea but they were all very powerful remnants scattered about the world, for this he trained endlessly on his ROOT sealing and his shadowclone jutsu, both to use when fighting and traveling.* - Fri Sep 11 00:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) training with the abilties he had in practice, he thought to himself about the possibilities that can come of it and his own potential with the arts of sealing being used in multiple forms and ways..He figured his root sealing would be strong enough to seal off demonic powers..Though as he transitioned between his skills, he made sure to be very focused on the formula.* - Fri Sep 11 01:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) showing little to no hace to his training, the young parent just kept his eyes on the ball, OF COURZSE HE WAS AT HOME when he was training, not looking to be one to waste too much time outside transitioning between the abilities he had, but making sure he was able to transition anyway, a lot of practice to be made and aimed for of course.. This being him highly focused on the skils of ROOT sealing and Shadow clones.* - Fri Sep 11 01:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking towards the location of where his daughter was, he just continued to train on his abilities as well as training to create the ability he has been working on, the very fire armor he was looking to create to enhance his attack power and his own defense , perhaps even somehow making it possible for himself to have ascended to flight but he had to focus on what his ability would benefit, what it would increase for what cost even...

"Welcome Back, Heros of battle." he said to them, but then he remembered the stuff Edge did, and how this would probably politically affect the times in Sunagakure, as if it was one problem after another..He needed a long vacation. But he stood by endlessly for the people, as they fought out there, he fought here..He was glad to see them but he could not find Dravae anywhere.. * - Fri Sep 11 01:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) forced the butt of his katana sheath to the ground , eyes closed for a split second , he knew Misa was the mother of the boy and that Edge was the father. Though Should he say that shit in the open especially with whats going on? Nope.. He just kept that to himself and ruffled the childs hair "Look like yer mother and uncle.." he said simply.* - Fri Sep 11 01:31:05 2015

"I'll be perfecting the fire armor." he whispered to her.  Lawful good father out of the building.* - Fri Sep 11 02:23:08 2015

Focusing on the very ninjutsu power and defense to the ability, since it would be a shroud of flames, naturally it'd have a potent defense against physical attacks, while his own physical attacks of course would be enhanced by the power of his own ninjutsu and the fire around him.. Thinking to himself <Perhaps since it will already provide a defense, I should focus my chakra on my own speed and strength to make it even more deadly..To be a blitz of fire..> he ponders on the ability of the Fire Shroud.* - Fri Sep 11 15:11:08 2015

" he told them as he was in charge as the acting Kage or permanent Kage for now, however he did not like this death trap of a position one bit, he was always bound to be next in line and could not avoid it any longer.

" he said to Dough Boy Flexus ,of course expecting him to complete such a task.. Meanwhile he'd be formulating a single hand sign. "But be warned, there are traps..So one slip up can result in you free falling." he tossed in a good pun . 

Roll Le dice for safety per turn when coming down.

1-2 SAFE

3 -Rock Crumbles and breaks, you better grab ahold of something!

4- Fuji tosses a kunai at you, better DODGE!

Reading about it being about some sort of entry, something used for taijutsu, though that was not of his profession, hand to hand combat has always proven to be useful in times of need when one has little to no chakra.. So as he waits for Flexus to descend, he trains himself with these ability by mental focus, much as he would do witht he ROOT sealing.* - Sat Sep 12 23:52:06 2015
