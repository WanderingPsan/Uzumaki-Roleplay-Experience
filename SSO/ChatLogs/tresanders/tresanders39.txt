<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) leading Lera outside the village where he would stand some meters away from his sister and look towards her after opening his eyes, a moment with them shut, his eyes lay rest to her figure as he said "Hope y' ready . " he replied while holding a single hand sign, the guards held their watch over them for any strange sightings, meanwhile Fujitora kept his own focus on the seals and objects he might need to bring out himself.

"When y' ready sis."* - Sun Dec  6 10:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon took went to take out the scroll of which he summoned out a premade gorilla statues, all of which were made to be golems for combat, one only  to be about 15 meters tall for mininal use of chakra purpose, after such the man would begin to perform other hand signs for later use, that was when he utilized his speed to head on over towards the direction of Lera directly, not her clones which were flowing chakra of fire.. Fujitora's sharingan  made his fighting expertise all the more better for certain purpose, though this was an attempt to get close to get, he was preparing to draw one of his blades..* - Sun Dec  6 10:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking towards Lera, he went to try and stop her next motion of movement by utilizing both his advance attack speed to subdue her own reflex by striking at her legs and torso with the katana known as UP using his crescent moon style slashes , a total of three seperate strikes at her with his kenjutsu abilit this was to try and stop her use of ninjutsu , this UP increased his attack speed by +3. 

It was noted about how strong she had become, he kept his eyes on her to predict her very movement and up coming strike, trying to prevent one as well.. His golem however suffered greatly from the combined attacks made by her clones, though the seals on it were damaged the golem was still capable of regenerating from damage, in which case it gave them more time to destroy as it recovered, meanwhile FUjitora was fighting Lera head on with amazing speeds. * - Sun Dec  6 10:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) reading her movements and build up of chakra, Fujitora would go and try to then purposely attack the Samehada with his Fuuinjutsu in order to try and make such a seal upon the blade During the moment she had brought it out, this being so done with his attack speed and reflex ability..

Now pushed away , the man had picked up the two clones coming up from behind, they entered his sensory range, from this, Fujitora attempted to then use his chakra built up in order to push himself towards Lera again this time from the other side trying to avoid the clones or if lucky, blind or burn them  by making this sudden burst of speed back to his Sister by purely flame, attempting to make direct contact with her by grabbing her shoulder and pushing her off balance or tilting her..This was an attempt..But his speed had gotten greater from the one jutsu.* - Sun Dec  6 10:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) // The golem was indeed destroyed by the two clones because of its seals and form being burned away.

Meanwhile Fujitora had the real Lera to deal with, his movements were quick but could his reflex keep up with the wind jutsu?! He had to make a break for it as he held up a single hand sign of which he used to perform the root seal that was made off his successful direct contact to her , he aimed to restrict the very use of her Right arm, being a single limb she wouldn't be able to use, the man still had the jutsu to deal with . He tried to shield himself with the fire shroud, seeing the wind come at him , he knew they'd atlease be weaker with his flame around him.

He went to try and dodge the strike but took on some hits to the body , shielding himself for a moment he thought <Dammit..> now using the advance speed of the Fire ability moving at the speeds so blinding so try and strike her once more from behind with this direct contact with the aid of the Great Fire Propulson..This time more concetrated than before when doing such. * - Sun Dec  6 11:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) pausing for that very second he spotted the chakra, though he had an idea that it was a form of explosion release, it was not..This was something he had yet to see, he widened his eyes to this as she stopped "Why did ya stop sister?...Though that chakra mixing to form whatever element that was, certainly caught me off guard..Not knowing you were capable of such." he stated now sheating his blade and releasing the seals placed on Lera..* - Sun Dec  6 11:11:34 2015
