"Young one...I know of Susumo's actions...Our law and Solemn Judgement has taken care of his crime....I want to know, is this why you are acting with robbing a blacksmith?...As reported by your teacher here.... I know a lot about Susumo's actions but we placed an ultimate end to it...We can not continue to lose prized shinobi..Now tell me..Or rather..Explain to your teacher here.." he says simply with a calm voice.* - Sun Oct 25 06:33:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) rubs his chin gently while looking at the gir------ancient woman in the form of a girl..Fujitora did not say much but he came to a deep understanding to what caused her actions. He said to himself in deep thought <She is apart of this vilage, though we can not just leave her or force her to forget...I can erase her memory or atlease parts of it so that she'd have a new start...But if she remembers she'd go right back to how she is now...However I can't just leave this alone...She'll end up hurting the innocent.." he looks to Saeza..

"Kid...Do y' wish that it all never happend..That you could forget it all?...I  feel for what has happend to you, you are apart of this village just as everyone else...Susumo is long gone now and you have your very own path to go upon..I ask you this.."

"What do you want now?...How can I or we help you?" he asked with the stare into her eyes.* - Sun Oct 25 06:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking to Saeza as the answers were being given with his own interrogation art..He simply sighs , ordering one of the very loyalist to bring him a blood bag of AB+ blood type from what intell he has gathered, this was his gesture of him understanding.. 

He soon began preparing his own seal for her very sake of memory, a single hand placed on the top of her head , looking to Marrisa waiting for the answer..So in such a case he kept his hand away till they figured out what they were going to do with her memory...She wanted an end..But could Fujitora give such to her?...It was an uneasy thought process  to go through, considering she was apart of the very village itself...

<Solemn Guidence... This seal I will place on her should be enough to erase or seal off a large chunk of her memeory and herself..To start off a new as an actual 16 year old but with some knowledge to her old kenjutsu abilities...I can not take her life...This I refuse...But I will give her a second chance...> he thought while preparing the very ROOT combinated seal for her, a special Locksmith seal of his own , a mix with ROOT and his own pattern , knowing where he was going to place it. 

IN WHICH CASE He was paused...

"Hm, then what should we do then?...Sealing away memories..Perhaps even destroying them?.... What we do here and now, will have a major impact on the society we live in..And her as well.."* - Sun Oct 25 07:14:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) now standing behind young Saeza, he closed his eyes, out of her eye view before saying to her "As you wish...I'll relinquish you of such ties of the old you with the troubled past..." with his eyes closed , he soon opened them once his hand wa splaced on the very back of her head, nodding to Marrisa with a single tomoe of his eye swurling into form that will show off his red iris...

The man focused on such, he wanted this to be perfectly done and for such he needed chakra control...The Sharingan provided just that. Who knows, as this pacifist struggled to go through such with his thought process to protect those within the village at all cost... <However long it takes...> the seals would be placed on  he rehad AT FIRST then by his sheer focus and sight on her chakra and bodily parts to place this seal deeper within her head, aiming for the very brain of hers to bring about the Locksmith Dragon Seal at the center of her brain, well placed.>Focused to increase power and endurance to be infused with the arts of his Uzumaki sealing as well to erase the old her...

She'd be a 16 year old girl, no memory or any chance of such to her past self...She'd reember Marrisa as her teacher , master and protector...Fujitora would just be the old farmer with such .. He kept his mind focus to make this seal as empowered as he needed it to be..<Hideki...Lend me your sight...> he had hoped this would be what he needed to advance on to the 2nd and 3rd tomoe..However it probably was not..He kept his justice though even without such a process to be met.. * - Sun Oct 25 07:33:07 2015

He had some business to be settled after these said experiments were to be done..

"Give her what little time she needs...But know that your time Zenaki... Is dimishing.." he says coldly..* - Sun Oct 25 19:34:11 2015

"Long Sword Style..." he said coldly before taking it upon a reverse grip only to stab the sword so far up the ass of Bernadotte that it's tip would be seen coming out of his very skull...Soon after such, seeing that Beth had already given him the finishing bloe..Fujitora would channel his flame chakras through the blade to make such a flame infuse with the oils of his body, slowly burning him away to nothing but Ash after the death had been given.. Fujitora felt he did his justice by sticking his sword up the ass of a type of man he'd despise..* - Sun Oct 25 20:25:23 2015
