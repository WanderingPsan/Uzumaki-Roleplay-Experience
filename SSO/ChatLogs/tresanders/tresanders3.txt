So keeping himself in as intel, he knew one thing for certain, he still had a case of Dravae's bugs to use as a weapon against these people, saving it all for later of course in dear time.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) //As he took the two to the waterfall, the man would stand by with his sword sheathed and laced to his hip with eyes focused upon them "Consider this a team mission of training and graduation, Izanami...You know I've purposely held you back from the title of Genin for a reason, now it's your time to show me that you are prepared for the shinobi world.." he told his daughter while looking over to Flexus "As for you, I wish to test the limit of your skills as my teacher did me, to see if you are worthy of learning more from me.." 

"The goal is to survive and think..The qualities of a shinobi.." now waiting for them both to prepare for the spar to begin.* - Mon Sep 14 20:17:55 2015

Once close enough to the both of them, he'd attempt to just deliver a simple DYNAMIC ENTERY! Towards Flexus.* - Mon Sep 14 20:24:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) coming in hot with the dynamic entry, he was captured by the grip of Flexus which he'd allow when going threw this process. So Fujitora , with the preporations already set, he'd reach to simply place a single hand to the surface of whereever Flexus had grabbed, doing this only strained the chakra of Fujitora but he did not mind it..

As he was taken down , the man would poof away, the hand signs he did earlier were all for the kawarimi, sustaining it for this moment to only vanish away and appear within another area near by, they'd have to find him though..Or he'd come to them ..BUT the log that he replaced himself with was not a normal log, it had a few explosive tags placed on it, but would they know?

The man appeared up aside them where he stood earlier..Looking to perform a few hand signs for later , taking in an inhale only to exhale out a giant fire ball towards them, the Goukakyuu.* - Mon Sep 14 20:41:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) standing by , the man waited for a response for his actions towards the two as he ehard a mighty roar only for a wave to be stomped towards him without much warning, he thought to himself <Well shit....> before attempting to leap back up towards the mountain in order to avoid the inflicting damage that can be given BY the wave while keeping his eyes focused on the area of which the two were standing..Now testing hi student and daughters strength to work together by increasing the power of the overheat sealings to see just how far Flexus could go .

Meanwhile he'd take a moment to examine the both of them "You both did well so far. But how much longer can you endure? " he asked them , standing on top of the cliff, challenging them to meet him at the top. 

"I have a waterfall...With this , I have the advantage." he began to perform a number of hand signs all for the Mud Sillhoutte Jutsu which he'd use to make one strong mud river rush down towards them, though after this he'd be patient and wait to see just how well they could react to this.* - Mon Sep 14 21:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) standing on the top of the mountain as he awaited for the flame to come towards him, Fujitora whipped out a scroll as he prepared himself, seeing it being a line of chakra linked to the user at high power and control. He thought to himself <But can you take the damage you dish out?> he soon utilized the perks of root sealing to seal away the flame by the amounths of heat their were all to keep within the scroll and only to unleash it later on when he was ready..But for now he'd keep his guard up. Though this was an attempt, it was simply Fujitora putting his skills to work.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking at the situation he was in with Izanami tossing wooden weapons towards him and hitting his head, he took note that if those were real, it'd of been good game for his ass, but then as he was about  to strike her, he noticed that a giant human boulder was making its way towards him. So the samescroll that he had sealed the fire away into which was labled as Fire.

He'd quickly lay it down and leave it to do the work to release all of the absorbed fore power into one big burst to counter the attack coming towards him all while Fujitora himself would perform a single hand sign to utilize shunshin to land his way at the edge of the mountain at another side.. He took a second to concetrate his chakra to a single point.. <Fall...> holding focus on this seal of the overheat to finally make Flexus fall to his knees from the overheat sealing while Fujitora would be focusing his chakra  into his hand signs of a surprise jutsu..But for now, he focused on keeping Flexus down.* - Mon Sep 14 21:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) now having his daughter left to deal with the man made his way towards her however he had her own fire prowess to deal with, this being the fire dragon bullet he taught her, he'd attempt to dodge some of them but not being able to do such for all , taking a hit to the leg and one nearly at the shoulder, he attempted to simply keep going until he was close enough to draw his katana out for close combat.  

"What will you do with close fighters hm??" he tested her in this attempt to close in.* - Mon Sep 14 22:07:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) going forth at his child the man prepared to counter with just his katana to try and block her attack as he spoke, it began to cover the blade in flaming chakra "You've grown well in your ability to fight.." he'd say with this attempt, aiming to swing his katana once in contact with her bow sword to push her up the mountain..

From there he'd begin to release a form of heat himself "What if your target happends to have a trump card?.." he asked his daughter while a shroud of flame began to cover up his figure.. He maintained it only to see just how much she'd prepare..Or cower..Meanwhile the overheat seal on Flexus would continue but Stop eventually at the command of Fujitora only to slowly begin reverting, letting him know that it would be a father and daughter fight for now.* - Mon Sep 14 22:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) simply smiled at this as he deactivated his shroud of fire , looking to tap the water to signal his daughter that her part in the spar was over, trying to say before she went to do such "That's enough now..Hehe, you've proven to me that you are ready..I know I've been an high expectation type of person but you've proven that you can take on the world..Sooo." he took out a headband and handed it to Izanami "Congratz." he smiled before looking over to Flexus who seemed to have been waiting.* - Mon Sep 14 22:26:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) lightly chuckled at this, but for now he'd have to  gesture for her to go sit someplace else while he finished the spar with Flexus, being engulfed with fire he had his own defense and advantage. Looking to stand at the edge of the mountain while waiting for Flexus to make his move, Fujitora held a single hand sign to re-establish the seal that was already placed on the body of Flexus "Think you can do enough before your body gives out to the heat again? Or worse?" he asked while he waits.* - Mon Sep 14 22:36:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) simply continued to train on his own by the choice of study rather than just hard labor, making sure he would be able to practice these abilities on his own later without much hassle..So to support this he made a shadow clone which would go out and train behind the mountain in private to master the ability of the Dynamic entry and the Manipulated shuriken jutsu but MAINLY the manipulation of shuriken and to get it down and handled out of the new efforts.* - Mon Sep 14 23:31:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) continued to make sure that his time training as a shadow clone in the distance would not go unbeneficial to the original Fujitora whom was studying, being as wise as he was, what he lacked in power he surely made up for in intelligence to make up smart ways to train and not waste time doing the unnecessary. So training mainly on the abilities of the manipulated shuriken technique and the dynamic entry.* - Mon Sep 14 23:59:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) made sure over time that even with the shadow clones he was training with behind the mountain, that it would not take up too much of his energy to continue on, for each passing hour or moment, he'd have to either make one extra clone behind the mountain or destroy one.  As he tried to progress his abilities to fight with certain jutsu, he also tried to make sure they were all well polished and useable in any fight.* - Tue Sep 15 00:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) simply continued to focus on his clones training as well as his own training method which includes his shadow clones and his own training as well , all in order to make progress for one ability come to be.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) making it out to be as easy as he may of planned to be , the young man of the Uchiha bloodline continued to train himself and to be sure that his training would not go to any waste, all making sure while the abilities of his in both taijutsu and ninjutsu were kept up to par with one another since he was a quick attacker, he could use such to an advantage and capture his targets off guard when close up to them and in person. So making sure he could atlease perform a decent dynamic entry and manipulate his shuriken at a fine mastered level, he made sure his clones could follow along as well.* - Tue Sep 15 00:21:58 2015

It reminded him of his wife, though he had few remants of her chakra left over, he just kept silent and watched what would happen.* - Tue Sep 15 00:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) watching this, the man kept a close eye on what was to come, as he rewarded the other two for their mission against him, he now just stood by and tried to not think of the events of the past <Be careful Tethys..> he thought to himself while concetrating on the manipulation of shuriken mentally. * - Tue Sep 15 00:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) continued to spectate with HIGH caution! He was a veteran when it came down to this , which made him even more concern for the outcome of this fight, so as he studied his own jutsu, he made sure to focus upon his sealing abilities so that when the time came, he could support Tethys in slowing down the target with his ROOT sealing. Fujitora kept a focus gaze on the spar between the two, no matter the condition, anything could go from zero to a hundred really quick.* - Tue Sep 15 00:47:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) loking at the other two, he maintained his focus of course on the single hand sign which he made just in case he needed to generate a powerful root sealing jutsu to go and hold off the girl from doing too much destruction..In the mean time, Fujitora continued to make out his idea and his plans to use what source of information he had for the future in case the people of Kiri would need him to..* - Tue Sep 15 01:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) having some trouble to keep up with their movements over all, he maintained his focus on the fight, to be sure that no one on the side lines got hurt after all, even though Fujitora was a swordsmen, and a fuuinjutsu artist, he had to be on his toes for all things that was possible of coming out of this bad situation they may end up in.. So looking to study his manipulation of shuriken a bit more, he smiled at his daughter Izanami , wondering if she could keep up with other people in the future just as she does today.* - Tue Sep 15 01:04:38 2015
