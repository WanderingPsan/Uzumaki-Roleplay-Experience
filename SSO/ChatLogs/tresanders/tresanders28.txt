<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Sure. - Mon Oct 19 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) within the caravan as he and his apprentice would travel the long desert roads ,making their way up the many high mountains up until they have reached their destination point, going towards the monks temple, Fujitora thought to himself <It's probably a very heavily guarded place of peace and such, though through all my years of meditation, I did not achieve the very same chakra as he had...> he thought of Yukio along the ride..Now looking to Index, the young man would point out and speak.

"The monks temple is much like a holy ground for the people in this world..These people within such a temple train in a particular method, one of which I myself once adopted...So now I am going to visit an old teacher and friend.. Yukio .. " he mentioned while he would continue to ponder mentally about the scroll jutsu he had just obtained along with his other fuuinjutsu methods that will have to be put to great use eventually.. He then looks over to Index as he says .

"In the future, I'd like for you to look after my daughter Izanami..She's surrounded by a troublsm crowd of foolish Genin who'd try to drag her into trouble...I might need for you to be her body guard eventually... " he states as the man spectates the mountaisna and land throughout the journey.. Spotting many sights that can be considered as art..A painting by natures hand.* - Mon Oct 19 22:21:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Possibilities... - Mon Oct 19 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) chuckling lightly, the man replied to the young lad "Within time, you will gain the abilities needed..Since we are out her, I can teach you a thing or two of the Lotus seal...Which you should know is naturally above the basics..Beyond that are the Root sealings which are typically command seals..Then beyond that are the chakra sealings and such..Anything beyond this point can be known as dangerous levels of Fuuinjutsu, all of which are great to look into...And create various abilities... Now then, do you remember the Stone Tablet you carried within the Labyrinth?...The Fuuin markings were unique weren't they?..Those were Ancient Curse Inscriptions.. Which in a way provided something that lasted for more than a thousand years..."

He took a moment to think about other Fuuinjutsu abilities and traits.. "In time you will be learning some of my own fuuinjutsu creations, maybe even create your own one day which may be used for many other things..Space Time...Absorbing...So forth...I'd be surprised one day if there was a Fuuinjutsu that could revive the old shape of the world...Fuuin-Ninjutsu is what I call it..It's my style .." he says simply while drinking tea.* - Mon Oct 19 22:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) rubbing his chin a bit, the man asked "Do you use weapons of any kind?...Swords or guantlets?" curious of the fighting style of Index when it came down to close combat and such of the likes..So he would simply stand about the giant Iron Gate which was before the monks temple.. <I could break this down...But I shouldn't...It's sacred...> he thought to himself. 

"And what elements do you possess?"* - Mon Oct 19 22:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm, all but wind eh?..Very useful indeed... - Mon Oct 19 22:46:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eventually, he reached for his many scrolls to find and select the very one he was looking for, of the water gun jutsu..Water being FUjitoras 3rd Element aside from Fire his primary and Earth as his Secondary..The man would begin by first reading the scrolls directions out, and thus explaining them himself and even showing the jutsu as well..

"Kneading your chakra within yourself slowly to form the liquid chakra, you will be able to mold such into a beam which can be shot out from your mouth, if strong enough this medium sized ebam of water can even become a canon in somes own eye..This jutsu alone can be a great advantage over some earth and fire users, giving you the edge with the little chakra required to use it..." he instructs simply utilziing the jutsu before him, aiming at the river.* - Mon Oct 19 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) nodding his head to such "Good work..You're making progress step by step..Now to train your Fuuinjutsu..Seal the water away into a single scroll..This training suits welll the more you develop..As with me as I sealed away an oceans worth within my grand scroll as a method of training..Sealing takes chakra just like everything else..It's wise to train it as well to gain a better idea and control flow.." he states.* - Mon Oct 19 23:15:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: It's important. - Mon Oct 19 23:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Would you mind if I check out a bit early..? - Mon Oct 19 23:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Sure. - Mon Oct 19 23:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) standing before the monks temple, young Fujitora would sit and wait as he began another day of meditation to his Zen like state of which he would continue the process of letting go of all the events that has came by and across him within the time periods..So as he meditates to this, the man thought to himself <I'll be letting go of a lot of things if I wish to free and seperate myself from the shinobi life...Being a teacher...And the hardest two things I've let go...Kastya...And allowing my daughter to become a shinobi and not a monk or sage...>

As he ponders to himself as he continued to wait on his old teacher Yukio at the front gates of the monks temple, only not busting in just yet because of his high patience...Fujitora simply continued to meditate and focus his vision about the area both mentaly and physically.. 

Thinking to himself of his tragic past, lots of vengece still yet undone and fears yet to be dealth with , all of which always followed him from the past to the current. Even though Fujitora was only going to see Yukio as a visit from the long term goal he had placed, why not continue to go on about his days in these times of clarity and self peace..To have an inner happiness and balance between ones mind and self to be at complete zen and continue to strive for the very goal or a new goal of his true decision post time of letting go of all the trauma..
* - Tue Oct 20 19:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) having some trouble forgetting certain events within the past, days of which when he could hardly ever forget, this main memory being that of his enemy being himself that day when he foolishly allowed Kastya's words to reach him, thus letting her go , something he regretted greatly..FUjitora could not simply forget this or let such go, as it was a strong process to go through, something he could never forget...Nor forgive, due to him failing the role of the husband..This made him lose some focus within his meditation..

Now concetrating on letting go of all other worries, hatred, vengence and such, he thought to himself <Ushinawa had an enemy once..But he managed to get by such...Hideki...He showed me all that he has went through, and now I will follow in those same foot steps..To let go of the past and take greater steps forward..> he ponders greatly to himself and only himself, with his state of Zen being at use, he focused on just his mind and how he could see the world in a whole new sight..Because of what he was already capable of, he wanted to see much more of the world..With both his mind and might.* - Tue Oct 20 19:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) coming to newer conclusions as he thought about Hideki's past that was shown to him, and Ushinawa's as well..The young lad thought to himself before saying "Actually...You know what..I'll follow my own lead..But, within time., I'll inherit your flames along the way..Hideki, Ushinawa.." he thought of his older relatives who were both like brothers..Fujitora would not allow for more and more people to wrongfully take the eyes of their clan..He knew their clan was nown for their glory, others wishing to take such away by force or negotiations.

However though FUjitora wanted to follow Hideki's foot steps, he'd have to let himself go from such as well, being his very own person and being to this new state of mind with the way he had became recently.. <Day 2 , monks temple..> he thought of the palace he was within as he waits on Yukio..His flaming chakra being kneaded as a form of practice while he was here.. Not thinking of Zenaki nor Hassan his own father in Sunagakure, but rather thinking of himself and his own soul, one of the many Zen like properties that would lead him to what he was aiming for as a ratificated state of mind from his old self, and how his new self will come to be.* - Tue Oct 20 19:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) training along side this pillar with that time he had, focusing on the formulation of seals, only to come to an eventual end , in need of rest and recovery the man began to meditate once more as he focuses on his own chakra pools, thinking to himself of the very cost and methods that will need to be used when utilizing the four symbol seal and making it into a more unique seal all together.* - Tue Oct 20 22:19:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Well in any case...Wish to come with me to the monks temple?.. - Wed Oct 21 08:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I've been there the past week.. - Wed Oct 21 08:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Could use the company. - Wed Oct 21 08:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking at the clone being made, he was proud to see she was using them in wise ways.. He'd soon and eventually make way towards the monks temple with Marrisa , considering they usually traveled together for such he didn't want to leave her out on this sort of adventure.. "The temple is a quiet place... Like a holy ground." he mentions as they'd leave off.* - Wed Oct 21 08:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) nodding his head along the ride, he says to Marrisa but then also wonders "Wind huh?..Which mean not only has she obtained my gift, but her grandfathers as well..Hehe..Sunagakure's princess will grow to be strong because of all those along side her helping ..." as a fathe predicts, his child was indeed growing  to be a strong young lass, so much that some day she might even surpass her own mother and father during her teen years.. Since Fujitora would be at the temple for some time...He knew he could trust in letter go in his father restrictions upon his daughter and sons while he was away.

Once at the temple from the ride of the caravan, he would stand before the Iron demon gate which kept the monks safe "Now to wait on Yukio once again..." he thought and spoke among himself and Marrisa...But for now he would simply begin reading over his scroll over the Golem and the Cloth sealing.* - Wed Oct 21 08:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes glancing to Marrisa as he closes the book "I've decided that we might not really need to go on such a trip soon..But rather once we gather all of the right intell.." his eyes went to examine Marrisa ,appreciating their time along with one another since she did not beg him for teaching all the time like his other students, then being of the same clan as he was..

He asked her "You have been trying to create your own abilitiy and style, yes?" curious of her efforts.. Going to sit next to her on this trip so that they could talk more closely..Sitting on a meditation mat by one another.* - Wed Oct 21 08:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) approving the actions taken by Marrisa he said "That's most good.. My fathers wind armor is no easy feat to accomplish though, he's a wind master.." he placed a single hand on the book he was reading for a short while , only to then place that same hand on Marrisa's lap, to tease her emotions in the most playful of ways with Fujitora being as unpredicting as usual.. He pushed his luck a bit "So soft~.....Haha, only kidding..Don't slap me." he says before looking back to the book he was reading.

"Havn't seen young Nina around though, but more news to come..I plan on ending my teachings to most who come to me without promise..Some have learned enough don't you think?.." he was letting go of many old ties to people who only talked for power.* - Wed Oct 21 09:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) nodding his head to her "I see..I can focus on just my other few students and my daughter then...Can't go about teaching the world my sacred abilities anyhow.. Though I can still train both you and Index..It's the others I'll have to let go. Seeing that these are grown shinobi with masterful abilities trying to get my teachings.." he refers to Kilm and several others who in all honesty did not even need his training with their level of power.. FUjitora looks to Marrisa and asked.

"Hm...Not going to do anything?.." he refers to his hand on her lap, he was used to the response of violent reactions.. But she was calm around him, always.. He smiled at her, his student..* - Wed Oct 21 09:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) releases a soft sigh as he tells her "Some masters....Aren't like me. And well, sometimes, my sights can fool me and see you as a bit more than a student...But such temptations, I struggle to place aside.." he tells her as he removes his hand from her lap.  "I know you trust me...It's what empowers me to not let temptation give in..." naturally he was attracted to fellow Uchiha because of the long silky black hair and so on.. 

Fujitora  looks on over towards the clouds, trying to get his mind out of the gutter , eyes closing as he spoke "So forgive me if I ever push such too far...And do not tell Zen of what I said.." he states while eyes shifted to Marrisa after slightly opening.* - Wed Oct 21 09:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) within a deep practice of this Sato Zen , sitting as he would suspending all judgemental thinking and letting words, ideas, images and thoughts pass by without getting involved in them.. All such as the very past and future worries..The struggle of allowing his daughter to ascend to the shinobi ranks, making her a Genin was more than just a struggle for Fujitora but much more than just such, he feared she'd become just as shinobi were made to be..However, he knew that eventually, he as a father would not be able to hold his daughter back any longer, that day he gave her the headband and declared her Genin..But even to this day, he has watched over her from every angle..Fujitora thought to himself for this reason.

<She is growing to be a great warrior..Though I wanted for her to be a monk or Sage..She has gone on her own route..And I can't hold her back any longer..I've accepted and I've let her go for her sake to this journey of hers she has decided to walk upon...My duties as a father will never end, but I will have to let go and trust in time and her skills...> within the posture of zen , with folded legs and hands, an erect but settled spine..

The hands folded together into a simple mudra over the belly...Legs folded in the standard sitting style..A lotus is what it would seem for him to be...This was another day of processing for Fujitora, another day of mental clearing and letting go of all such worries to relinquish himself of hatred , vengence and all other stress or emotional anger within himself to go about the entire opposite of such, and continue this route for a period of which will extend to more than a week..Fujitora continued this focus  with much concetration.

Clearing his mind, thinking of nothing but his breath..Eyes Were open only for a short while before they closed. The monks walking about around the temple, while one other would sound off a traditional melody to the temple and those within.. Fujitora was shutting off all things completely for this time and moment of meditation, destroying those earthly attachments...Counting each inhalation and each exhalation until he had gotten up to ten and starting back at one again to prevent his mind from wandering off ..

This continued for more than 20 minutes per day, some days even an hour or more without any intruding thoughts, concetrating just on breath and abandoning the counting..Now just exploring the stillness within his very own mind..Eyes shut tight, hair within a long manish ponytail and his concetrationg solely upon himself and mentality upon the very soul of his..Meditation being a daily activity for him, only to think of newer more efficient ways to meditate on the day to day basis..

Though some time has passed, the man did not move a bit, each time and day he'd always return to that very same spot after lunch and the time he used to look up on the land scape that took an interest in his eyes.. These lands were that of Kumo but.. The clouds and the suns rays made this scene look like more than just a few rocks and land with water, but rather a elegant rainbow influenced feature..Fujitora smiled at this but before long he would go back to his day of meditation for now...Doing nothing but such to give himself full clarity within his mind and away from the stress of which would make him into something that will break his very code of Lawfullness...

He was a Neutral Lawful person..Having both respect for Good and Evil, but easily one to side with the good as it had means for his own cause and own ambition to better shape the world..Not for himself..Or for the civilians..But as his duties as a Father..He loved his daughter and was aiming to make this world a place of such where his child can be a child and play...But for this day, he will have to let such ambition go..For he was in a meditation so deep of Zen, that he would not be able to think of such but only let it flow by.* - Wed Oct 21 11:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) blade stabbed within the ground , fuuinjutsu markings glowing at full because of the very sun light glowing upon it... The crystal orb of chakra he had with him sealed away, soon to put the sword away as well...Suspending all weaponry and chakra he had along with him, though the time of the day was nothing but dawn, he had  all the time to make up for such and meditate to better such practice as well...Even if the method of improvement was limited, he had many options to go by...

Upon this day, he would seperate himself by suspending all usage of chakra..Such as training his ninjutsu or fuuinjutsu..This day rather than using his chakra, he'd focus upon it as a whole since it was apart of his own very spirit, he'd consider it as one of the many chakras to unlock within ones inner being thus going into an even more advance practice to his zen like state..Thinking to himself without a word but rather the very image of full completion being placed at hand.. Along with such came the responsibility of guiding those of the future as well to gain such an enlightenment. This Ryujins focus was highly maintained to not get out of the very grasp he held dearly to..  Even if it would take a matter of time to accomplish, he needed to come by such matters with how he handled his shinobi life but with a different approach to go along with it..

Even with a new approach, the results of such a meditation always ended the same, with him being at total ease, not letting any other outside force ruin such a concetration and being at zen with ones own meditation method, as the Uchiha continued to think more on letting go and relinquishment so that he could see the world in an entirely different way..Fujitoras aura and posture were well balanced..His aura that of a strong sense to justice and lawful deeds..Trying to mold and shape the world with his own view.. Casting such bigger worries aside for now..Being within the monks temple, still waiting on Yukio, he couldn't do much else but pass the day by with this form of meditation.* - Wed Oct 21 18:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking over to see Marrisa on the other end after his sesson of training with the meditation of zen and relinquishment, he says to the young apprentice "Oi, how goes it?" he asked her as he would sit by an old statue between the pillar right on side of him..Fujitora didn't speak too much for he refused to distract her too drastically..Now just wondering about in his own mental plain..* - Wed Oct 21 19:19:40 2015

His anger surfaced but he knew this was no place to show such to bring forth his very Solemn Judgement...A judgement of which was all lawful according to his own neutral standing..Hideki was a loved relative of his..He only would ask..

"You...Were with him?..At his final moments?..Where is his grave?" he'd ask them..Fujitora did not spend months of meditation for nothing but the rage couldn't be released just yet..He would only wait till such an answer came ..* - Thu Oct 22 19:55:56 2015

Labyrinth Judgement

This seal spreads about the activator thus causing a great change in their ability strictly according to their over all chakra amounth.. Those with larger pools of chakra would naturally have a greater time limit to use it, those with lower pools would have the minimum time limit..However the drawback to this is that it takes away half of the users current chakra as a fuel to continue such use..This gift of power is only granted to those who pass the Labyrinth challenge in 1st place and swear loyalty...This not only pushes their body past their limit but strains alittle as well if used to a power above the maximum it will affect ones stamina as well..

Time Limit= Control/3----    Chakra Amounth /1000

+10 Agility
+10 Ninjutsu
+10 Strength
+10 Durability
+5 Endurance
+5 Genjutsu Defense* - Thu Oct 22 20:32:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) being within the temple as he looks out and about to see that the dawn of day was coming to an end, his final motions of the very meditation came to his very mind when the man said to himself <The final relinquishment...> he felt the chakra flowing within his very head to his pupils which caused his eyes to go red , a single tomoe appeared upon his eyes , feeling such the young Ryujin thought of the very flash back of Ushinawa...Hideki and Niza.. All of his very family, soon to stand up as the fire shroud surrounds his body in calmess and a cleared mind..

<Big brother...Ushinawa..I've finally inherited your might...> he looks up towards the very skies however still having much let go..It would be a shame to have began thinking of those things again..However he did not...Now focused on the very power he had at hand which was obtained by himself alone... Looking to the very skies above... Seeing the face of Ushinawa, the loss of which he had to let go.. Fujitora says to himself <I will continue to lead the clan as you wished...As the new successor...And I will obtain the very new second stage of eyes Hideki has...> he thought while making his journey back to Sunagakure where he will meet up with the others..His eyes however were kept secret... * - Thu Oct 22 22:52:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes now on Beth he says "Of course...It's hard to sleep after having...Bones jammed into you...And bitten in very sensative areas aint it?" he says to her in a whisper, looking to the turtle shell he thinks <Hm..Turtles have a hard time getting off their backs..> a single hand would rub down Beths leg before this Fuji squeezed tightly with such grip to grind inner muscle tissue.. <Solemn Judgment..> this was just the beginning, only to then look to Zenaki to stand by the door..<You're next....For letting yourself be punished so brutally..> despite her weakness he knew she could fight.* - Thu Oct 22 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes on Beth , he would reach for the other leg as well.. Doing the very same to it as he hears her...What sounds like Kawaii words... He told her "Why are you acting ....cute?.." he didn't truly understand her enjoyment for pain.. He would eventually just squeeze tighter for a moment, only to release suddenly and wait for her response...She was tired..And he was tired but yet he had to fullfill the duty of delivering judgement...He smirked a bit only to lean forth and bite her upon the neck with his teeth, holding her hands down with a mighty grip.. He figured he'd play a bit.* - Thu Oct 22 23:25:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking at Beth's face he said "Oh?..I wonder how y' feel if..I bit here.." he lowers his body so that he would likely rip away the right pans leg only to bite down upon the skin of her inner thigh while looking up towards her, he knew she liked pain..So why not bring out a bit more? He had an idea but it was too much pain for anyone to handle..For now, a strong bite to the inner thigh near her private area would be all that he'd do for now..Being tired , this Fuji was low on ideas.* - Thu Oct 22 23:42:56 2015

He spoke as he needed some air now "Are you Positive?" the preporations were made..But he was not sure if she could handle such .."Hehe..Yes..I do play with my -food- a bit much...Though it's not every day you have pineapple eh?" he puns.* - Thu Oct 22 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) grinning alittle more as he sits up to look directly at her.. The markings from his body flew on to her belly and up to her very head and eyes "This night.." the room and aura of Fujitora seemed more than just dark "You will be visited by three flames...Each worse than the last.." he chants softly to her ears  the runes upon her skin, the pain SUDDENLY came as a burst of inner heat and oils heating up the body as if every cell within her was on fire slowly burning...This was all under Fujitoras control though, even if the seals weren't very visable, this was all him...

Each moment, The Three Stages got hotter!  Right now, it was at a controlled level but he was NOT going to kill Beth...He needed her alive.. He'd continue to lick her now showing private area, each lick being extremely painful due to the bodily and celluer burning.. * - Fri Oct 23 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) laughing a bit as he licks her, he'd soon go to lift up a single leg of hers, placing her foot to be on his back, giving him more sight to both her holes as he said to her "Nah...This is only the first step...Now here's the second.." the overheat seal would only increase in the burning rate, where on some parts of her body, you;d actually see red sparks, this being from her celluer friction going against one another...Fujitora soon jammed two fingers within both of her holes ,only to cause both pain and his own pleasure , roating his hand a bit  before reaching for his object with the left, with him he had a taze, using this to electricute Beth's figure a bit by striking her in the ribcage with the tasing object..As if it was not enough that she had the overheat to seal with but tasing as well..* - Fri Oct 23 00:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) chuckling even more to see Beth roll on off the bed..His fingers slipping out from her holes when she rolls out.. He looks to her and ask "What's the matter?...Giving in..?" he asked before he'd use her painfuled body to his advantage, taking off his belt to WHIP it across her back and ass saying softly "Do you like the pain dear?...Do you feel punished yet?" he'd lash that shit two more times up and down her back before he'd make her get on her knees by force at picking her up, slapping the belt agaainst her legs this time .. 

He'd lick his lips, holding the belt up as the heat intensifies.. "Maybe I should enjoy myself with your body a bit more...Hmm.." he says as this time the heat generated more of a chain of eletric sparks of pure heat on her back and arms, making it hard for her to even stand without falling limp..  "Maybe I should...Try something else hm?" he began to grind his lower half against her butt while looking to Zenaki "Does this please you?..." he wonders before he contnued.* - Fri Oct 23 00:39:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking down to Beth's private seeing it leek her juices he says "Oh my..Look at who's becoming wet..." he says before whipping her once more, on the butt cheeks this time..Her legs already spread he said "And you got some on me.." looking to his legs before he'd begin licking her private softly..Then eventually with much aggression as if he were a savage dog...It was not long before he'd go to look directly at Beth's clit and give it a nice firm bite knnowing the ehat from such a tinder area would surge greatly though the girls body, he squeezed her thighs ever so tightly with his face between her legs.* - Fri Oct 23 01:00:35 2015

"Mm..A overflow of pineapple.".His erect stood, the seal on Beth weakens a bit to keep her alive and going, now looking back to Zenaki, he says "Will you please your master even more?.."

His erect standing tall and strong , a settled gaze to her eyes.. "Then please me." he says.* - Fri Oct 23 01:28:44 2015

He sensed the being within the house earlier..Another experiment..

"Tell me..Who's presense is this I am sensing..Who's chakra, I can see?..." he asked..Under his contacts, he saw it all.* - Fri Oct 23 02:21:39 2015
