<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) leading them, he held up a strange stone within his hand, shining a luster from the very light core itself which opened forth his access to the western ice passage for them all to set sail, which eventually lead to the very island known as the Labyrinth..A place of which stayed constant in despair flow for 7 days and 7 nights, a moon that stood full for just as ong..A moon of which was a light purle and sat low in the skies.. It was the normal moon just that the colored zones in this peek of the earth amplified so much..

As they had gotten there, some would notice the strange feeling if they had a compass, it would spin rapidly..

North Was South East

South East Was West

West Was East

East Was South

And so on...This island..The directions were all inverted..

"Welcome..To the Labyrinth..The very island of which belongs to me.." he says.* - Sun Oct 25 23:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) nodding his head towards them, he answered "Yes...This is it..However you wont be able to simply walk by it as I..You all will have to get to the core through the dangerous course of events..".. He looks to his daughter, Izanami and ruffles her hair "Good luck.." this was no normal ruffle..He lended her some of his own chakra, being a protective father he lended her 4000 of his chakra..

Then he points out that it was a massive forest..Soon Fujitora walked south into the water..However the illusion on this island was so powerful, it was not water he walked into but rather the northern direction...He appeared at the core soon enough, FUjitora had his own stone tablet to make his way in..Now it was up to the other three to make their way in this forest of a hundred miles..

His voice can be heard though their minds "Be aware ...You all wont be side by side...YOu'll likely be seperated.."* - Sun Oct 25 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) // Upon walking up north to the forest of the Labyrinth, they would notice that it LOOKED like the typical rain forest, each tree having blue leafs and different colors to be added on to them by natural causes....Fujitora watched from the base he was in... 

The deeper theyw alked in the more risk, there looked to be no path, just grass, trees, and forest..Wild animals walking through the path they were on and ignoring them. Sounds of wind pass by as if they were ancient voices.. The Labyrinth's beginning was just met...* - Mon Oct 26 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) //  Upon going in deeper into the forest, those who stuck together and those who strains from the pact found themselves in a unique situation, as Marrisa and the others seperated, it was clear that the magic of the forest was now at work.

1-2 Change Of Course! Random Situation

4-5 Safe!

6-7 Unknown Risk...

These were the rolls..

Now the more they advanced, , whoever was leading a group of people would be the roller..Those alone would roll for every ten feet or so they move.. They'd all hear a fainth noise <The Three Plagues!~> with a few tribal clothed people running into the deep darkness of the woods.* - Mon Oct 26 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) // This was a rare case to of happen on the first few minutes within the Labyrinth.. As Marrisa advances on from the group, she'd of found herself FALLING into a trap hole which would end off at a ravine,  this made her fall down the very edge of the ravine down a large slope if she did not already stop herself, the hole she fell down within was generating a very powerful wind tunnel and because of this, it was very hard to even resist... Though she was spat out like a rag doll into such a deep ravine..There was no water for atlease the next 400 feet so for now she was rolling down a steep wall... 

However, because of the noise made, she'd find herself not just being in a ravine..But rather a giant nesting ground..Surrounded by giant falcons and crows, rigid beeks and sharp claws..These guys were all a casual 8 feet tall with a large wing spand.. They heard her fall down , and immediately made MARRISA their target of prey, all flocking down towards and around her like sharks of the skies..


Meanwhile everything else for Nina and Izanami was fine and dandy aside from the casual ghost whispers they'd hear..The more they had advanced considering they rolled a safety.* - Mon Oct 26 00:31:08 2015

The falcons of giants ravine surrounded Marrisa, some without a second thought hurled in towards her, their beeks looking to grab and peck at her body and limbs, some even going as far as to use their claws to grab her but failing resulting in scratching her body or limbs... They were trying to use her fall from the steep hill to their advantage, thus trying to get her to the large body of water, though it might not of worked, these were wild bird tactics..

They came in flocks from all over, 2 attacking from behind, another 3 from above, then  3 more from infront, another 2 from the aerial direction of her left.. She'd need to fight her way out of this..The birds beeks provided protection from the flame considering they were a solid, however they did suffered burns despite the yolo..

Now as for Izanami and Nina, their  course would be changed without their notice, as things seemed forestly, the place became cold all too suddenly , the trees began to freeze into ice,the water, the soil and ground...There was sun light at the end of this passage.. The end of the icey forest had a bright liht..What looked to be a stone tablet...A key to access the other parts of the Labyrinth.. Though it was just a simple change in climate, the one main risk was that there were a pack of wolves far, far within the distance...  * - Mon Oct 26 00:51:37 2015

--Marrisa would find herself able to blow away a large number of the birds, however with many cuts upon her back, one of the many birds attempted to grab her from behind with its massive claws in order to bring her to the nest of his.. What seemed to be her only escape was the the river 20 feet away from her, and with such birds flocking around her, this was already difficult to pin point her very location, what was up and down....  30 birds blown back...But 50 birds hovering around her storming in..Making like cherps...This was what Chidori meant anyways..A thousand birds..

But as for Izanami and Nina, another change of course happend! As if it was not enough that it was extremely cold, now the land changed to what seemed to be a swamp land.. Branches of what looked to be dead trees creeping up upon the two..From above and from below the very soil..At the end still lies the stone tablet, but it was a good 40 feet away and shining brightly.. This tablet , had a voice come from it or rather around it. <Labyrinth's Key..>   

<The key!>
<The forbiddejn stone!>
<The slab!>
<The key!>
<Our key!>
<My key!>
<Cursed Artifact!>
<Thousand Souls!>
<Tribal Stone!>
<Tablet of the old!>

Were the very voices they'd hear... The roots and branches that tried to lach on to the two girls from the underground , if successful it would pull the two away from each other and slowly drag them into the trees.. 

"BECOME APART OF US!!!" sounds of dead souls!   But the branches had a hard time with the girl being on fire..However Nina seemed like easy pray and this was obvious she'd be made the primary target if they seperated.* - Mon Oct 26 01:23:12 2015

A random little monkey came, and picked up the stone tablet, trying to run away with it after it picked on Nina's hair to check for lice...The tablet had no aura around it, but being the source of the swamps power and the pillar being the circuit..It was only a matter of time before things returned to be the same..The actions however all stopped..

The monkey dropped the tablet. Then the pillar slowly began to rebuild itself..But when the monkey picked it back up, the pillar fell apart again along with the tree demons around it.* - Mon Oct 26 02:22:04 2015

Nina had a near death experience..The monkey playing with her hair now in a tussle with Izanami's monkey, losing the tablet.. Soon to find out that this tablet eventually began to fall apart into an amulet which can be worn or placed in the pocket.. This amulet served as a compass for the labyrinth..Almost like a map..It had a strange glow, however carrying it provided a great risk...Which they will eventually find out soon..

"We'd be gratful if your powers could bring an end to the terror.." 

Now for Nina and Izanami..

The amulet they had emitted a dark yet light feeling.. There was a tricky cost for when ever they left the swamps..This was both a key and a map.. " The Key.." a voice echos...

As for Iza and Nina..

They'd see a river, a long line down from their location, could easily be used as a guidence.. However be warned..Water lands had the most vicious beast..Depending on how they take their route from the swamp into the forest once again..The howls of wild animals would be heard.


 Fujitora spuna round in his chair as he waits for them, looking at the far, far, far away native women with his scope from the base..Being literal miles away he thought <Well..Guess I can look around for them------> he was taken by the interest he had on the tribal dance of the people.. <Looks fun..> * - Mon Oct 26 03:21:48 2015

"This night...You will be visited by Three Plagues..Each worse than the last..Succeed the Slab.."  

This was for all of them..

"And so, the oblivious mind of the humans shatters it to remnants.." the skin on them felt as if it were becoming tichy, it was an illusion of maggots chewing their way out of the skin but in reality it was just a powerful illusion like a nightmare that felt extremely real..The pain felt real, the worms even had  a horrible smell to them..

These bugs were tiny so it was obvious they came in LARGE LARGE numbers , likely about 1000 per person ..  They came from all around..

However..On this night...A flock of 30 bird falcons descended from the dark skies and constant full moon down to Marrisa, flying fast and coming in hot..They made a loud flocking and cherping noise, their long beeks looking to pierce her armor and limbs to take her, however the fire shroud around her made this hard and painful for them..One bird had a innocent village in its claws..the man yelled.

"H-help!" and like that she was swallowed whole..Still alive inside being swallowed down to the belly but what would Marrisa even do about it?

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) //

 Knocking her back, feeling the effect of Samehada coming in contact with the sword made the tiger appear a bit drained..Never the less it would open its jaws widely to fire a large stream of fire towards Lera, as if it were a tripple sized Goukakyuu hurling towards her diretion with half the normal speed..But an extreme amounth of destruction!

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) // When the first goukakyuu came in contact with the mud wall, it exploded greatly causing the wall to fall into parts of stone, as for the second goukakyuu this one annililated the wall completely thus a wave of fire from the explosion came about, surpassing the very stone..The tigers own elemental training was that of a T3 .. The beast rushed forth towards Lera's direction despite all the smoke and dust around the area from such an explosion..It fired several (3 ) more triple sized goukakyuu at her direction in rage! It's stomping could be felt, its speed being so quick, it'd feel to Lera that she had little time to even breath..A sight so scary , the tiger wased no time in executed attacks in its blitz..

The AOE spreads throughout the area, the amulet however continued to shine its bright color,  <Into the weapon..> the amulet chants over and over, this would of given Marrisa a great boost in damage and chakra flow if she did likely being +10 for the very element she'd desire to use it upon, this was a very spiritual item that was obtained..

The voices echo through her ears LOUDLY  as if the boom did not even matter..The damaged Ifrits flame continued to spread, causing some forest fire..Trees falling down.. Once the Ifrit spotted her, it aimed its sword towards her as if it were a shot gun..Taking a turn to load and fire..He's a charging his attack.* - Mon Oct 26 19:53:23 2015

As for the Ifrit, the cannon fire had been charged, it lifted its mighty sword and aimed it towards Marrisa thus firing out a massive wave of fire towards her direction as a fire beam almost..How will she counter this with her own flame or try to reverse it back at the beast with wind?..It all depended on her skill and power...But for now..Fujitora watched this from afar.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinking of Sunagakure, the man ponders on the thought of seperating himself from such earthly attachments, yet he knew he would also have to place others before himself..By doing so, he'd continue his studies, striving towards a newer and more advance change of sight upon the world itself as he stayed upon the island of the Labyrinth with much mind and thought on what the true outcome would be..Waiting for the others, he suspected that Izanami and Nina eventually finished within time..Marrisa of course coming in first place, placing her priorities down..She had truly impressd her teacher Fujitora, and the man himself was very pleased by her success and actions to have made it so far..

Though for now, he went back to his main thing..Both his meditation and study, a continued meditation to open his mind and seperate himself from self ambition or rather, enhance his own self ambition to work towards such a goal at becoming as great as he needed to be.. Focused on  such to protect and maintain a world of peace around himself and many others who were willing to work for such as well..Though he was busy with the Labyrinth at times, he always told himself..To follow his own path but with the guidence he was given..Just as Hideki was ready to put his life on the line for Fujitora..This man, this father was ready to do just such for the life of his kin.. A gaze settled upon the sky for now , thinking long and hard about what he could become with such ambition, working towards the goal of becoming on par or simply just surpassing the causin who's will he took upon..Hideki.. The old Pacifist..* - Tue Oct 27 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinking about all that has happend..Fujitora left out from the base where he and the original Marrisa was, looking out to the full moon of the Labyrinth island where he took such a great gaze upon it.. A thought process not just on protecting others but acting on impulse as well..To fight for his fellow many rather than take the life of someone.. This was him trying to change himself as a person, to ratify what he was and how he'd go about life doing it..Isolating himself on this very island up untill he had fully changed the very thought process of his own to be on the level of which was Hideki's and Ushinawa..

Caring for others seemed much like something he lacked, compassion and true needs to protect those around him other than himself and his beloved child ...If he was going to shape the world, he'd need to show compassion for many..And such being thought of, his sight for such only grew with his own growth and wisdom of the world alone..Even if he may not unlock all its secrets, he kept his mind focused on all that truly mattered..As Marrisa, Izanami, Nina and Lera were all taking his test, he made sure that they did not meet such a fatal end by keeping a wide eye out for them.. After all, a Uchiha's compassion was vast for his own family members , some blood, some not..adopted or not.. His compassion remained the same , though he seperated himself from certain ambition, he kept his own mind on what was important aside himself.* - Tue Oct 27 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) now pondering back to the day of which he was forced to face off against his cousin Ushinawa in war, Fujitora had only remembered this because of the tragic flash back..Now Fujitora did not wish to fight his beloved cousin BUT because of the conditions he was in when on the side of Kirigakure and being at war with Amegakure.. He knew that on that very day and moment, he was going to hate having to fight his older relative, an uneasy thought to take in and process...This caused Fujitora to remember such , feeling as though that one day he will have to do such once again but with another as his opponent who wont be so kind despite blood relations..The thought of losing another loved one was not going to be on his list any time soon when he cameupon this theory...

It was at this moment that he made a self promise , a type of psychiatry thought that refered to the ideas or arrangements of ideas that could result in the very acts of Fujitora that will produce thoughts or the very process of producing thoughts in or OUT of battle depending on this very day, going out of the base to fight against one of the wild tigers , utilizing his kenjutsu to do such, fending them off at an impulse with a swing of his blade..<I have to ascend...I have to continue fighting..> he ponders as he uses his katana to block off the single attack made by the tiger , a slash of its claw when fighting against such, but alas, Fujitoras reflex caught up with him and made him fatigue almost, thus ending up with a cut on his shoulder, now  even more focused yet at total peace and zen with himself as he fights, to keep a solemn and easy mind on the situation..Acting on each move and instinct as though he too were one of the wild animals , but fighting not for himself but the youngins of the new generation...

Another Flash back came to mind, the day he was sent out on a mission during the very war against Amegaure, he crossed the seas ready to meet death when facing his older cousin Ushinawa, only to find out at the end of their short conflict that he was too well loved and valued by his older brotherly cousin to be slain or taken as prisoner..That day Fujitora met defeat like no other and will not allow for such a life lesson to go to waste..Thinking back on it all,  changing for the better at the end of the day, keeping himself within the Labyrinth untill such time came for him to leave the island and be something more than what he currently was..

As he fought the tiger, the man utilized his shunshin in an attempt to gain distance..In doing this he was training and working towards the very abilities of a flicker fighter, focusing chakra into his very jolts to increase movement speed..Though the dodge was fainth during the very flash back  in mid battle, he'd come to find out that his light armor was pierced from the claws, leaving a cut on the chest of his dead center.. <Damn tiger...Focus..> he thought, holding his katana..Sparking an ember of bright flames to burn brightly upon the very surface..Eyes of black luster settled upon the ebast, preparing for their next bout..* - Tue Oct 27 06:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) training with the methods of shunshin, fighting against such a tiger beast in the open parts of this forest..Fujitora decided to increase such a risk by jolting on into the forest with the speed provided from his mastered shunshin ability, trying to decrease the dizziness gained  from running so quick throughout the forest...
<p>
His sharingan activated to keep track of his sight and movement to decrease such odds of blindness to come about..Fujitora did not just go to the Labyrinth to test others, but rather to test himself again once more since the last time he was stranded on this marooned island , forsaken by the tribal people but blessed when he had saved them from the amuet's curse which now he kept on him at all times..Going into the forest, he lead the tiger in with him..
(Dice roll 1 for tiger)
<Dice Roll on Risk in Forest --5>
<p>
As dangerous as the beast was, it missed its intial strike that was aimed for the man, this gave Fujitora the very edge he needed to strike with a crescent moon beheading strike aimed at the torso of the beast..Fujitora did this with his great focus and eyes of the crimson and black tomoe.. Thinking to himself <I need to win, to get better...If Lera wishes to isolate herself here then I wont allow her to be the only one..> he thinks as the tiger only came after him more, this time with a higher chasing speed..
<p>
Fujitora leaps off to one of the tree branches, back jumping branch to another branch . He tried to maintain his stance and focus on the beast, but he was then distracted by what came from behind, it was a giant and wild gorilla, rushing through the forest <KING FUCKING KONG?!> he thought to himself but his facial expression said these words exactly..The beast made the tiger flee, this was already bad business to begin with...Fujitora ran off to jump to a near by bush to try and take cover..
<p>
The giant gorilla eventually captured the tiger and slammed it to the ground without mercy..Fujitora was stunned because he had just used shunshin to escape..Now peeking on over to the scene he thought to himself <Such a wild beast..I'll have to be careful if I want to-------> he stepped on a twig...Which made a flock of birds fly off into the skies, this was enough to get the massive beast to turn its attention to the direction of Fujitora..Though it only had one eye and was a casual 15 meters tall..It was still deadly if the gorilla was able to casually slam down a tiger like a rag doll..
<p>
Fujitora then kept himself quiet..He knew there was battle to come on this island once again..Clapping his hands together SILENTLY..In order to summon out several marked tags into his hands from a seal placed on the glove he wore..These tags he would throw towards near by giant rocks and trees..Peeking back at the gorilla he thought to himself <Golem Command Seal..> however this gorilla sniffed what was funny..Before the golem could even be formed it rushed towards his direction , not fast but the destruction could be a force to fear! 
<p>
 Fujitora had no choice but to change his style in jutsu for now,  reaching into a back pouch to toss a few smoke bombs at the face of the gorilla..He knew he was taking a large risk by being outside but he was not going to let it slide...After those smoke bombs were tossed, the man continued to jump from one tree to another...BUT THEN OUT THE BLUE  (Dice roll 2 ) the beast turned around too quickly and slapped the man right into the river..Fujitora was dazed from this very impact, it was hard to block in time , he recieved damage from the hit mainly and the water itself secondly.
<p>
<The fuck was that?!> he would clap his hands together, though in pain, he now had the lower ground out of sight as he concetrates on his chakra, only to shunshin himself out of the water, limping though, but now on the very giant and solid boulder he had placed the tag upon, this boulder became larger as many more amassed around it to create a giant golem..Fujitora panted  a few times.."Bring it now Gorilla Kong!" he shouted  to the beast, while his golem lifted a single slab of fist to punch at the beast..He knew the Gorilla might not see where he was coming from because of the smoke screen , however he knew that it would come back once it was hit! 
<p>
Once hit, the gorilla went flying down..Thenit got right back up, punching at the golem of Fujitoira (Dice roll 2) BUT HE did little damage or missed!  Giving Fujitora the opening shot *T2 Hand signs..* All in order to fire a goukakyuu at the beast, considering the fur around it..Fujitora knew this risk was high but he was facing all fears right now against it..Thinking and believing that he was going to have to win this one and bring forth the dawn of victory upon himself.. The golem would punch with this fire ball, making a giant fire fist to go along with such..Knocking back the gorilla..
<p>
The beast now frustrated it went to bum rush the golem of Fujitroa with a strong right and left, knocking it down and shattering most of the rock, leaving the goelm to regenerate as Fujitora leaped towards another tree , now behind the gorilla..He thought to himself <I'm doing this to win and make the people who look up to me proud..> the sword out now being held with two hands, channeling chakra through it, being boosted by the flames..Fujitora was training the very abilities of a flicker fighter with this..He charged his own attack but in the mean time..
<p>
His golem would work to sustain the beast with rapid strikes and attempts to keep the giant gorillas limbs in place..it was not too long after that Fujitora would utilize his jumping span to get up close to the giant beast but utilziing shunshin in an entirely different way..Focusing on his shoulder and arm jolts to deliver an extremely quick and powerful upwards cut towards the very spine to the skull and brain of this massive gorilla ..Fujitora mentally shouted <Labyrinth Dragon Moon Claw!!!> he shouted both mentally and verbally now..
<p>
Fire being generated into one large fire wave slash from the blade and Fujitoras concetration in fire chakra flow itself..Thus the mighty gorilla had fallen soon after, only to be turned into one massive blade, being burned away beyond the point of ash..The golem fell apart, with Fujitora limping and bruised up from the direct and indirect impact he had taken.. He thought to himself <It's over...Finally..> now making his way back to base to catch himself some rest ..To think of this event..To recover from the attacks taken, sheating his sword to go and rest..He had done his own LAwful justice..This night within the jungle.* - Tue Oct 27 07:35:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) was relaxing in the Labyrinth castle.. "Guess the testings done.."* - Tue Oct 27 09:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) reading and training within the island of the Labyrinth along side his studet one of the top four named Marrisa. He kept a focused mind on one of the very goals that he'll be needing to complete in accomplishing, looking through the scrolls of the old, coming across what was to be the Reaper Death Seal..Since this scroll was not given to him by a teacher or the likes of such, more so this being just Fujitora reading it as raw as ever with his mind on the very words and letters inscribed within it..Coming across the theory as he said "This very justu could mean death...Then so be it..If it means to put an end to what threats come to the very way of myself and my kin..." he says with his sharingan tomoe one activated , trying to get a better look into his own research..

<This will be my very own sacrifice to change the world at whatever cost that is needed...To sacrifice myself as a shinobi and father to bring forth a greater change to this land..And I wont allow myself to fallter from such ..My goal is to protect, and fight at all cost..For my daughter and children.. Izanami..Yusei, Yuusei, Tetsumi..And my new borns soon to come..I am going to exceed the boundries I've placed for myself at all cost to learn these jutsu and fighting styles to bring upon a great influence and change!> he ponders to himself with much thought, knowing how bad a self sacrifice could end at any means..He continued to go about with this new way of his anyhow.. Reading through all the scrolls of the Labyrinth to try and develop newer abilities for such..Perhaps even developing something very seperate from the Reaper Death seal and making his own.. 

<p>
Heaven To Hell Divine Judgement , which would consist in the formation of arms and chains of fire both light and dark being released from the very heart of a single person once fully charged and sensed to track their very soul down in order to seal away this being with the soul of the person using this jutsu for all eternity..However if the jutsu is not complete, it would not take the life of the user, making it a double edge sword only once it succeeded...This jutsu being classified as S rank because of its ability to track down the Original, even if there was a shadow clone, this jutsu and its life energy would be able to pull such a trick...

This was Fujitora theory of creation to make something worthy of the self sacrifice..However though this jutsu is not truly fire, it requires much chakra control.. He knew this..But he also knew that if this creation did not work, he'd have to come up with another plan of something that will be of use for him much later on..Something that can guide him through more than just his new ways of self sacrifice but strive higher for greater! * - Tue Oct 27 22:37:39 2015
