<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) standing before his wife he was talking to her with much happiness , though she joked around TOO much with  his emotions, he'd stand by her while his shadow clone was away training his abilities and skill, Fujitora was here with his wife enjoying the day..So when it came time to train Fuuinjutsu, it did also with fire in many attempts to seal away the mighty flame for the man to develop such abilities into something more, needing to get faster with his hand signs and so forth on from that point on even..

Now with his mind set on perfecting the abilities of sealing alone and nothing else, he made sure to get not only his chakra control in check but also the patterns for his direct contact sealing..He looked to Berith to answer her question of where the kids went out for their mission. 

"Out in the desert to another minor village by Suna.." he tells her while the clone was out training..The real Fujitora would ponder about some thing, since he needed to perfect the Fuuinjutsu art , he thought about newer ways he could utilize such power with the time he had.* - Thu Oct  1 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Did a shitt ton of RPs. - Thu Oct  1 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) /// As the shadow clone trains in the distance of an unknown area, probably under ground with the art of the fuuinjutsu being at work..Fujitora as the original was gathering some insight on this, looking to Berith as he spoke to her "If ya ever need my help on a mission, just ask me..I might no longer be a shinobi but I am still your husband, and I'll help with anything.." he told her while looking to his katana, the Kamishini No Yari, which he wanted to create a series of kenjutsu abilities as well later on, though he did or might not of needed to.

The young Uchiha just thought about his goals of Fuuinjutsu, how he will have to eventually come up with something strong enough to bring down a very powerful bijuu, much like the other days of such when he had to face them..Knowing that something was BOUND to happen again, he thought more of it and how his perfection with skills such as Fuiinjutsu will have to come and be..Sanoke had some very good Fuuinjutsu skills that took an interest in Fujitoras mind..He also wanted to train his own daughter in Fuuinjutsu, something to help her weaponry skill to the best potential he could manage to unlock.

So when Fujitora was training with such patterns, not only did he manage to decrease the chakra cost of his golem seals but the power increase was also boosted as well..Fujitora knew that eventually he'd need to create golems for war once more..Just as he did to take back Sunagakure with his father..Their names should forever go down in history,, and Fujitora forever redeemed .. But now he looked to change the formula of Fuuinjutsu, to become one of the best Sealers..Who knows, he may be part Uzumaki as well...With as much as he worked with Fuuinjutsu..* - Thu Oct  1 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) // Shadow clone training at his ebst efforts, the clone or rather the man Fujitora now sitting by Berith would open up a large scroll where he would begin to study and begin to create new formulations to him it was his own little art book where he could create new fuuinjutsu just as well as he did with other ninjutsu.. He said to himself and Berith next to him ..

"You know, because of fuuinjutsu, many have tried to find me for my teachings, my abilities and how well I could make things work...So with this jutsu I will soon be able to do much more than the normal means of such.. For now I will just try to make something new , something else..Another Art work of a master piece put together.." he says simply while the man took his time to make a type of barrier and more for such.. Making sure that his Locksmith skills were to be great and on par to his own expectations..

Making such a seal upon the scroll, this man began to mix up the change of chakra, looking to make something strong enough to restrain a single Bijuu at the power it could be at, Fujitora did not know what to expect truly with how this world and the powers wihtin it would be working out..So Fujitora stood up, looking off to the distance where he had a room deep underground in Sunagakure, someplace he and Berith could go to train..Knowing that those around him may end up following anyway, he could care less..The man was looking forward to train his own abilities, not anyone elses at the time really, unless he could somehow be convinced...He kept his secrets of becoming strong to himself , but he was open to those who saw eye to eye with him..

Though he could be cruel and cold, the man was still just as Lawful as he always been. Thinking about those who helped him out the the past was also a benefit to this sealing art..Dravae was a key part as well as many others including Berith in the past.. Fujitora made this Fuuinjutsu art his own, he made many abilities as his own from the help of others, though he lacked the Sharingan , and was having trouble with many, he still trained...Fujitora was probbaly the only Uchiha at his age to not have unlocked such eyes..BUT he began to not care and lose such interest, considering that he was becoming more adept with other abilities and skills to develop..* - Fri Oct  2 00:10:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eventually took his time to leave the area off with Berith , well considering he had already done that, his training began to take place in the location they were in , where as to Fujutoras point of view, he'll be training his own fuuinjusu while Berith would be in the room training her taijutsu.. So as she'd enter such a room way deep within the underground, well stabled and well made.. He would begin to focus his chakra on making the room much hotter, since this chamber had to run off ones chakra for fuel and not standard eletricity to go on with due to the change of natures within the setting.

He made sure to just keep his fucking focus on what he needed to get done.. Fujitora spoke to Berith "Be careful not to pass out, the heat can go well over 110 degrees, so this would be a double edge sword to your training.." he tells her while he'd begin to study his fuuinjutsu once more trying to make new formulaitons each time he drew something within this massive scroll of his.. Making sure that the formulas were all well drawn and well formed with chakra inscribed within them..

Fujitora soon began to enter a state of meditation, training his Locksmith abilities, though the area was sealed off by his own barrier, he had to maintain a focus on one major thing, both the chamber and the fuuinjutsu he was trying to create, something that will be aiding him in the effects of both space and time more than likely, trying to discory new fuinjutsu was much more than an art to him but a job, a talent and a form of a career, seeing that just retiring from the shinobi world could be a hassle, he had to make sure he could defend both himself and the village if he ever needed to..* - Fri Oct  2 00:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) felt it was time to establish some new ability and a new ruling to how he could possibly try to gain the title of Sunagakures grand Locksmith, someone who would be able to not only seal away things at a long run in battle but also be able to protect the village from a grand threat with the help of his fuuinjutsu and not just his Nin and kenjutsu abilities.

Fujitora looked to Berith and said to her "Maybe it would also help the kids in a long run within the future if they came here and learned how to properly use this place..Don't forget Berith, we are going to be SPARRING soon within this very same chamber, who knows...You might even get to see what I've been cooking.."because all know the true logic in this world with Fuinjutsu,..So can you smell what the Fujitora is cooking?! I'd say you can't because this guy was so focused, he was unpredictable with what he could do even..He made sure to make these formulas much more unique than the last.

Something someone would be able to learn at the use of Lotus sealing as well, Fujitora kept his eyes on Berith, expecting her to continue such training even if he was not looking at her directly or keeping his eyes on her, nope he wanted for her to train and not slack behind.. The man would make a type of pattern of Fuuinjutsu in the form of a rose, or rather this seal was more in the form of a plant or tree, not being the lotus seal but something beyond that of the ROOT sealing, something he could use for space and time within the enar future at that , so that he could also focus on the majority of his new potential skills and traits to develop, feeling that he would have to make preporations in such a case for all his new feats to achieve..

Though he was just a villager now, he had to also keep himself in check, to make sure that no one followed up behind on any past mistakes..So he kept out of trouble and maintained his time with the ehaling arts and his study on Fuuinjutsu.. looking to Berith once again, the man would enter the chamber with her and ask finally.

"Think you are ready for that spar now?" he asked with a cocky grin, because she was going to learn today, she was going to learn with a loooonnggg dick. He was simply going to spar with her and teach her a lesson or two about his own power and abilities, though the man lacked in force, he made up for it by combining both Ken/Tai and Ninjutsu power, something that many others have tried and sometimes even failed at..Fujitora was looking to become not just a Locksmith but somethhing more as well without many knowing..So he kept his training on the down low and not openly bring such out especially when he did not require for such to be seen by a large crowd of people, he was never out spoken.* - Fri Oct  2 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Berith(BoyUmbreon) says: We can spar now. Though, do not go easy on me. - Fri Oct  2 00:56:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking at his wife, getting into a stance of which he would take out his katana as he looked towards her, his gaze settled upon her, he'd take out the four shuriken or as it would only appear to be four shuriken..He'd toss them towards her as those four shuriken shadowed over the four others underneath were actually eight all combined..All of which were being manipulated by a wire Fujitora had attached to them for the sole purpose of trying to miss Berith and hit her with only a few.

While the rest were being changed in their course to try and capture her in such wires.. These wires were being controlled by one with masterful use and focus over such, wires that can not be seen without advance sight perhaps.* - Fri Oct  2 01:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) watching Berith with his eyes focused upon her, the man would soon dip down in his attempt to try and deliver a swift whirlwind kick with his attack speed towards her all while focusing chakra around his hand once he would be able to land a successful pat on her shoulder or the leg she kicked with, trying to do soemthing devious for the next plot he had.

This kick he used was his attempt to outclass her in terms of speed and reflex , though he did not have high hopes for such considering her taijutsu prowess, he waited to see just how much Berith would be able to withstand his fighting abilities, since she was close range and he was all around. He tried to counter her kick with his own series of kicks and fuuinjutsu.* - Fri Oct  2 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) watching Berith the young man soon got up on his feet again, watching her he said to himself <It's not time yet..> his plan was set but he wanted to test out Berith and see just how well she was going to be against his own abilities..So while she lands, he croses his fingers making a T sign thus forming a single shadow clone to take the hit for him..

Thus this clone would try to grab Berith's arm fully while the real Fujitora attempted to  back away to gain distance in order to only begin generating sparks of flame to send towards Berith  , while his clone tried to restrain her after taking the hit..He'd be aiming to catch her with fire.* - Fri Oct  2 01:37:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) saw the flames closing in on Berith, commanding the clone to try and take some of the hits to reduce Damage, as he was suddenly worried...He fucked up "Berith!" he yelled, rushing to her aid..* - Fri Oct  2 01:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) now before Berith, he kneels down , the clone vanished as he said "Yo--You okay hun?.." he felt as if he fucked up on this one, luckily nothing happend to the hair, otherwise...* - Fri Oct  2 01:59:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looked on out towards the distance, where he'd head out towards the gates of Sunagakure, only to stare out towards the distance and say to himself mentally <Big cousin...Where are you now..In our clans home of Kumo?..> he thought more about the man, thinking about the letter he wrote to Fujitora a long while ago, and what they spoke about..

Fujitora felt that he couldn't make his cousin or clan members proud because of his disadvantage, having yet to awaken the sharingan like many of his relatives..He began to tighten his fist, thus slamming his right hand against a single boulder next to him, thinking about how Ushinawa wished for Fujitora to continue on with the goals he had in life..Fujitora had all of those completed so far.. But now all he could think about..

Is a peaceful day with his cousin once again, a man who treated him more like a beloved little brother more than anything, the very uncle of his daughter Izanami..Even though Ushinawa hated Kastya, Katya and with great reason, the man willingly placed aside such hate for the sake of Fujitora..Despite the man being wanted and desired to be killed on many hitlist, Fujitora never once betrayed him or told those of the location of Ushinawa...

The young mans gaze towards the direction of Kumogakure was settled, his clothing of the Uchiha being blown by the steady breeze..His hair as well and with that, his eyes closed for a split moment.. "Though I may not have the eyes of our clan just yet..Maybe not even ever...I am still a proud member, and will continue to be the very best..Even without such red hues, I've protected my own and my village as well...Ushi...I hope you're reign is a long one..You've made our people proud..And I..Well my stories complete..So let's have another relaxing day of drinking sake once again someday eh?...Our childrens story is soon to become the main hit. Hehehe..." he chuckled with a hardy laugh of any war veteran man...

He took a seat down on the mountain, he poured himself a cup of sake.. "You may be busy as a new leader..But this one is for you..My brother.. Cheers." he says before taking a nice long gulp of the sake into his mouth. A smile brimmed upon his face, the distance of the desert sand and the skies clear, not blocked by the clouds of the distant land of Kumo..Fujitora thought more and more about this moment, feeling some joy for the completion of the story he began a very long time ago, that day he met his brotherly cousin, the day he met and reunited with Hassan.. Fujitora had his mind set on a lot..

"And Kastya...Our little girl is growing up pretty darn fast, already she has learned most or alll of her old mans skills in terms of fire..But that doesn't mean she's a slacker..Nah..With this one she is a hard worker..Don't you think so too?..You've been watching over the both of us since the day you've ascended.." he smirked, pouring another cup of sake, this one as for Kastya..

"I don't care what people may of said...You weren't some whore in my eyes, you were my wife, both strong ,brave and caring..You helped me become a shinobi of Sunagakure knowing full well that I was the very enemy you wanted to get rid of...But eventually, you convinced me...That not all shinobi were killers..That love was true in this world, and Kastya.. To you my first love, I thank for that.. Even if you are gone now..I am sure if you came back, I'm sure that if Izanami saw you and you saw her now..I'd do nothing but smile at how cute of an image that'd turn out to be...." the man was thinking of the past to the current time line.. Now standing up by Kastyas grave, for he was only leaning against the very stone he placed on it for her..Eyes now open once again, as they were closed for a long time as if he were talking to her very spirit with what small remnants of her chakra he had left upon him in scrolls..

"It was fun..But now, I have to get back to the others... She is your living chapter of a continued story after all..Mine as well.. " he then laughed a bit , his gaze going from the direction of the skies set on Kumo to the land behind him which was Sunagakure.. It was time to walk on back home, this man and his long chapter of a shinobi..When running towards the land, he thought about it..Or rather he imagined Ushinawa running at his side on the left and Kastya running with him on the right...Berith leading him along with the image of all three children...It was just something ,an old image that bring a single tear to his eye, his full desire to make a world of peace.. 

"This image...Is my true and ultimate Art..."* - Fri Oct  2 06:28:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) being known as the Monkey King, the young Fujitora found himself walking off towards a high mountain top with his armory and his trusty sword along side him.. Once he had finally reached the top, the man began to perform hand signs to begin his training, and traditional meeting with the monkey comrade of his.. <Kuchiyose No Jutsu!> summoning out a single Medium sized Monkey, something  or rather someone whom he'd be working with.

"Alright Kong, we'll be working on Fuuinjutsu and Kenjutsu once again today.." he says simply while taking out both his scroll and Katana, looking at it the man was soon to place some fuuinjutsu upon his sword, trying to mark it with some powerful seals for later on, something he'll be able to spread on upon many others who may come in contact with his sword or him in forms of kenjutsu, trying to be able to enhance the very power of the beloved blade he always carried along with him. Not thinking much about other methods that could be used, for he saw this one as another absolute art to be used on later dates...If he could mark Fuuinjutsu on the body of others, then he knew he could surely do the very same with any old weapon as he had done in the past.

Fujitora was looking to be a grand locksmith and work with much more than just things in his own element, wanting to use his sword to be able to seal away certain elements thinking <I'll be a sword of sealing as it once was before..So I will redo such seals.>  Now that he was doing such, he made sure that his monkey Kong had carried the fighting scrolls for him and study what he needed him to focus on..Fujitora and this monkey was close, some day the man was hoping to bring out the other monkeys of Kong so that they'd meet for days of which battle was needed..The seal given to the primate was going to be used to unleash elements of course.. With Fujitora training with such a monkey, he made sure to try and come up with many other Fuuinjutsu elements to fight with and bring out to use against those foe who dare go against him.. But eventually even though he was training with this monkey, he had to return back to central.. 
There he'd probably find Zenaki and the others there.. Fujitora seemed a bit tired from all the training and research he did, having a hard time in finding the perfect Fuuinjutsu ability, perhaps even he already had such an ability within his arsenal..The man had so much to look up at and so much to bring out to this world with the arts he'd study.. The Uchiha.. This was the life that he lead, the life that was left for him, taking the rode that was not laid out before him but rather creating his own rode by the day..Though will he cross paths with all those who have taught him? The Monk at the waterfall, the very people of his past.. All the more he could remember...He overheard the talk about Jesus, he did not mention anything to it..Sunagakure was a freely religion place, he was curious , but he wanted Zenaki to be free of choice in the land..As he told her once before, she was free here..* - Fri Oct  2 07:23:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Oh they're chatting, maybe the medical industry will benefit greatly from their work.. - Fri Oct  2 07:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) now aiming to work on the very control of chakra he had, Fujitora thought about it and how exactly he would have to end up working on it so that he could increase the properties of healing people, since he was only a medic in training one would say, he continued to look up and read ways of how he could heal people with natural herbs such as the leaf known as the Aloe Vera, something good for burns, something Berith should of thought of using, but did not because she ignored Fujitoras prowess with the medical field.. 
<p>
But no matter for such, because he continued to focus on his healing , trying to master such properties so that he could gain the benefit of trying to merge his medical details with that of his flame so that one day he'd develop it all into something even more deadly yet helpful, something he would be able to call the Mystic Flame, or some even would refer to the shroud as Holy Fire , since he was looking to give some form of healing property towards it , sealing off some chakra into this very form as well, to benefit his power and abilities whilst fighting with it.
<p>
Fujitora maintained a certain focus on both his healing and fire potential, trying to somehow mold the two into one element, since he was going to have to make this a Hiden jutsu to not have people leech his family abilities..This was best suited for those of the fire element who also searched for the path of becoming a medic, something late within Fujitoras decision, something he decided to become late within the years as he has healed some others and healed himself. 
<p>
He wanted to be able to heal himself with much more than just he average medical jutsu, so he wanted to create such a skill, something worthy of either B or A rank because of what it will be able to do <I will need to form these flames around my body as a defense, but as an offense only to those who are attacking..These flames will be a mixture of healing and destruction..Flames of Golden Light that burns away the wounds of the injured..I shall call it the Holy Fire Shroud ..> but for now he'd focus on his very chakra control over such and his medical research to look into methods of healing, methods that can be used with elemental jutsu and not just raw chakra transformations. Whenever he was able to create and combine such abilities in one, he saw it as another art.
<p>
Much like his Fuuinjutsu, he had to be able to master some abilities of fire as well, this shroud was one of them, since he influenced Izanami to create her own, he wanted to do the same and enhance his own progress with such, instead of the flames being just gold, they'd have to be a bright mixture of blue as well for his chakra, this being so that he gains control over it,  one main property for the flame to only burn him to heal, while the outside would usually burn others to deal damage ..

He was going to become the mighty Fujitora of the Sunblade..Some title he had for himself, to fight with for his town as well, this was his art, to heal others and create newer jutsu in the future for the next generation, this shroud being the Verson 2 of his own style..Something that he himself created to counter most who seek to destroy.. This being one of the major defenses for him...To be able to Increase his ninjutsu Defense  and Ninjutsu power both by a large and equal amounth, not even aiming to increase his very own attack speed but the power for his gifted abilities to all be enhanced..Maybe even so, he'd be able to enhance  his own attack speed even, so that if one could do the math , they'd see or notice his traits being divided such as.
<p>
Ninjutsu Defense +4  and the control of the user <br>
Ninjutsu +2 <br>
Attack Speed +2 <br>
Slowly heals surface or cut wounds.

THis was the type of math he had set for his ability , however he also knew that it was going to be one hard ability to even master, seeing that it was fire that could provide healing, he isntantly began to realize how strong of a jutsu it could potentially be, much like someone with the arts of the gates, but in his own right this was his abilities of fire and medical ninjutsu coming together, seeing that if one of his children were to pursue such a path, they'd probably inherit this trait of his to be able to do such once they were of a certain skill level.
<p>
.Fujitora sat on top of this mountain or rather on the balcony of his home, blazing with the basic fire shroud, trying to mold the two into one new buff for himself in the future, trying to create something more, trying his hardest to generate something even more powerful than the shroud just in case he needed to counter destruction and show his daughter Izanami that not all jtusu were used to harm people..But rather bring the potential to change such a world they lived in.
<p>
He took all he learned around the world , trying to place it all into one big theory, trying to gain the abilities he saw out, being whom he was, the newly made Medic was trying to already develop soemthing of newer properties..Trying more and more, harder by the day, as if he was the beacon of his people..Though he may of been average in trait, he grew to gain the respect of many and the attention of many to battle as well..He had became strong, he became something most of his trait would not in such a time line..Now he looked to train , only to develop new arts to pass down to those of his clan, to become a new leader of the Uchiha if he truly needed to for the sake of his own people..
<p>
Now that he saw the sky, there was no other limit for him, no excuse to not become great..And now that he was strong he had figured out how this world turns cold and blast at his soul knowing deep within that the world was never meant to be as cruel as Zetsumo mentioned.. <The world is cruel..So I will bring change--Zetsumo--> thinking back of when he and the man had their dangerous encounter..FUjitora was one of the only few to always cross the man Zetsumo and never have to fight him, their encounters were always to speak and get things straight for the other to understand..Fujitora had an enemy, and in time he found himself protecting the sister of that same enemy..Watching her now, he kept his judgement solemn..
<p>
Wisdom in his stay with the new change of the world, his chakra flow was steady with that of his medical ninjutsu , and his flow of flame now vanished from the loss of chakra from using something not yet fully created yet..He was fatigue yet again from intense work..<Damn..I need to cool it down with this..> he thought to himself , the golden flames reverted back to orange and his mind set on one other thing now, needing to rest and recover so that he could continue his training and develop his medical ninjutsu one step at a time over the days he will be spending in Sunagakure along with his people, he wanted to stay retired but he KNEW that the family curse would drag him back into the shinobi life eventually.
<p>
But who could say that he will have to face battle once again? Might be with his daughter, someone inside the village, a monster or someone outside, only time could truly tell for this one.. He kept an open mind to it all..Resting up a bit more only to focus on his healing once again, knowing that it'd have to be perfected eventually, even if it was just a novice healing art, the man looked forward to making it work for himself. He needed to be a great doctor after all, not just to heal but to fix peoples body parts, because he has seen way too many people get injured, and desired to stop such by being able to heal those people.* - Fri Oct  2 08:09:23 2015
