Then that's where he'd begin his operation, one hand holding her still just in case and empowering his own ability, he'd use his own form of ROOT to try and de-power and get rid of the current seal on her..Focusing to increase his power over such..But how strong was the seal?

<It's just my fingers...> atlease he was being gentle, trying to keep focus "You have a large lack of trust in me.

So he didn't try anything.

"Ladies first? " he'd hold the door open for her to leave . "Hopefully, your travels are safe and easy." * - Sun Oct  4 05:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) deep sigh. <I need to stop looking at womens bodies...I'm married..>* - Sun Oct  4 06:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) //clone of Fujitora vanished as if it was all a dream, looking to wake up and see the lad, bodies and such around..The mans eyes widen but he couldn't expect more or less from his former slave and lover...He looked to her softly and said with a sleepy tone of voice.

"Z-Zenaki..." he was bound.." but he waited for what she had planne..The room looked like the movie Saw..And they were going to  play a game.* - Sun Oct  4 06:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes shifting around the room the examine  "Where am I?...." he asked, confused by just waking up. Strapped down and restrained it seemed.. He looked to her with an questionable stare before he remembered.

<Shit...> he was such a virgin to pain..This was probably going to be a great amounth of joy for the woman. "Then...Begin your work.." he demands of her, not knowing what he just did..He figured it'd be nothing but whips .* - Sun Oct  4 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) was suddenly and without mercy! Shocked by eletrical currents! Traveling through his body as if it shocked every single cell, and being new to such methods, he yelled out in pain "AHHH!!!!" during the time he was shocked, and once the surging stopped, he lets his head down.

Panting and gasping for air, he probably did not answer fast enough due to being dazed "I---I love Zenaki a lot..." he says but was beginning o see the tast in torment she had..He couldn't even form a smile right now.* - Sun Oct  4 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) panting still, his head lifted up as he felt her finger to his very chin, eyes gazing into her own.. Thinking of her question, he loved Berith , but he was married to her..He loved her very much..But then there was Zenaki whom he loved as well..His answer was obvious to be a conflicted one .

"Because we swore vows ,I love er..But I do love you--------" and like that, he could feel his body surging in pain nerves! As if Zenaki was forcing each bit of her Yanadre love upon him, trying to force him into doing something he'd never..To betray the love of his wife.

A even more..Painful..Air gasping scream came about, he gripped his fist , trying to break free "WhAAA!!! FUCK! FUCKING HELL! P-please! Not my dick!" he demands, as if he was trying to make her follow orders..He forgets, when he took that pill...He gave away his ability to control her.* - Sun Oct  4 07:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon stopped his painful screams ,listening to her words over the sounds of his grunts , it was true he was thinking about Berith! And the man was in constant pain as if it was not enough for his balls to be stepped on by heels of all things! 

"P-please....Zen.." IS THIS HIM BEGGING?! And it was at that moment that he was shocked once more! The eletricity traveling through his arms ,had caused them to go in a random direction, piercing his wrist with the spikes of hers! Making his roar out a cry of pain! 

This was pleasure to Zenaki and Fujitora was fueling it without knowing..Once it all stopped, he then looked to the arm that was offered.."Y---Yes...My love.." he opened his mouth only to hesitantly bite down on it, eyes closed with much regret to biting human meat again! Not even clean! Rotting meat! He looked like he wanted to puke!

He gagged! Shaking his head while he bit.. <No..No..No! > he didn't want to do this! She had robbed him of his pain free life with a rough start.

"C-can..We....Go home now?.." Was he still thinking about his duties as a husband?! Or was he thinking of being free from pain?!* - Sun Oct  4 07:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) had little time to speak let along recover from the previous turn of events "Please...Zen It's true...I do love you----" he was whipped! Grunting loudly! "I'd  never leave you again!..Please-----" being whipped by these spikes whipped his soul, encoding Zenaki's words into them <Love me..Love me more!> beating into his mind, the man shook in pain, chilling up his spin! 

His clear...

His untouched...Unscarred Skin...

Being destroyed by Zenaki, her love...His torment.. <B-Berith..I'm sorry! > he began to feel as if he failed as a husband, figuring that if Zenaki tested him by hengeing into Berith, he'd fail..* - Sun Oct  4 07:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking at his lover/slave/ tormentor in pain, he said to her "I---When did I ..." he questioned to the being of him agreeing to be her test subject.. The man soon pleads "Please....Don't! Where are you going to-----Zen! " not that he was afraid of needles but rather he hated the idea of what was in it..

He was in too much pain to resist, one move and he could fuck up and cause himself even more pain to what she was about to do to him, with that being done and with such being said, Fujitora stood still. "Zen....I'll give you...All of my love..Just please, do not do anything rash." he was a man of his word.!* - Sun Oct  4 08:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) having to experience a very rough and painful torment method, he looked at her, feeling it not only in his neck and arm! "S-stop it!" he could feel the body of his either rejecting it or accepting it with a struggle towards such! 

"AHH!! I hate it! I hate this Injection!" he shouted while in extreme quantities of pain and agony! He soon would get the limp feeling of wanting to fall down to his knees! BUT HE COULDN'T! Being in a bind! All he could fill is unwanted cells!

The giant needle went into him, and she injected him with her fluids that were within its long tip..Fujitora felt violated! <M-my pride...> being injected with so much before he realized her statement.

"Wife?...Injection?...WHAT!? How can this possibly link to her?!" he questioned her! < Where is She?!...What's going on with Zenaki?!>

"Do you know where Berith is???!" he shouted painfully. The master was being subjected to the TRUE Pain.* - Sun Oct  4 08:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: You are such a bad husband~ Such a horrible husband! - Sun Oct  4 08:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes suddenly widens at this! The very moment of which Zenaki told him that she had killed Berith! Made him eat her! Fead her to multiple people as if she were nothing more but a pig! A worthless cur of human filth!

Furious yet shocked! He had many emotions running through him! He loved Zenaki but then he had his wife! And this situation! His eyes were wide open, pupiles shaking in worry and more as if he was experiencing post dramatic stress over and over again! He had only seen Berith once before she vanished! 

Zenaki lied to her master! She even called him a HORRIBLE Husband! 

"I---I kissed the lips..Of someone who ate my wife..I..Fucked the woman who slain my wife, and I ..It was all happening under my nose and I couldn't do a damned thing to stop it..I..Ate my wife..You-----ZENAKI!!!" he roared as if the rage of a berserker had surfaced! His body in pain , flames of anger bursting from his being by red sparks of hatred! Though it was conflicted Hatred! But will he be forced to love Zenaki once again from her torment?! WIll he be brain washed into her puppy of a master?! 

Filled with rage by the fact that he ATE the meat of his loved ones, he even enjoyed Beriths flesh! This made him roar in a mighty fit of rage! A single tear or two running down his eye, trying to break free, the man grinds his teeth, showing them like a vicious wolf. He imagined Zenaki as a woman with demonic wings, and the image of Beriths head being casually swallowed by her with a large grin, smiling right in Fujitoras face..He was Berserk...He was the rising fire..Heat emitting from his body across the room, trying to break free!* - Sun Oct  4 09:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) shouting and bleeding from the wounds inflicted upon him, the mans rage burned through the handles and binds that kept him down, the electricity phasing him but not as much as before due to the flame and his anger controlling his rage! 

He soon broke into a sprint! Trying to gain up on Zenaki and chase her throughout the house like a raging dragon after a human who had taken something away from it, in this case...His wife.. roaring at the top of the very lung capacity he held "RRRAAHHHHHHHHH!!" 

This

Fuji

Is

ON  FIIIIRRRRREEEEE!!!!

This Fuji is on FIRE!!

Nearly naked from the extreme heat bruning away what clothing he had, the chains , some or few still attached! He tried to capture her in an attempt to pin her down to her back to face him, to feel his heat, his rage! His eyes were filled with nothing but anger and hate!* - Sun Oct  4 09:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) succeeding in having her pinned down, the man soon raised his fist but first thought about what an old Uchiha said to him once... <Never hit a woman Fuji~>   but as FUjitora thought "FUCK IT!" he'd swing an arm to punch Zenaki on the right cheek and then her stomach "Give her back!" one punch to the belly! "Give her back!" he punched again.

As he mounted on top of her , he released the heat, no longer though steam still emitted his body, he grabbed the chain which dragged from his right wrist, beginning to use it to wrap across her neck and choke her "It's Friday..Friday! Choking a fucking slave on Friday!~" he was losing it, but then he closes himself into her to gaze into her eyes immensely! As if he was trying to find Berith within her. "Give...Her...Back!" he demands, lifting the chain, now using it to whip her body with as he stood atop her!
* - Sun Oct  4 09:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) having mounted her, with the chains slashing across her shoulders...Her belly..Her torso! Fujitora was shirtless , the flames emitting from his skin like a burning rage that was the very symbol of his soul! The very reflection of man! A man who's wife was devoured by his other lover..The battle was won...But at what cost?!

AT WHAT COST!?

Fujitora literally roared at her, and punched the ground , NEARLY punching her face directly but purposely missed, same with the other fist to have her facing directly into his hatred filled eyes, full of flame much from his soul, the very DNA of Berith, his wife of the Senju tride running within his body because of her torture method which happend to back fire..

He picked her up, and used his strength to throw her into the wall.. His mind lost for a split second, grabbing her by the very neck to pin her down once more on some John Cena shit but this was no act! FUjitora was furious!

"You!....I....." he knew his love for Zenaki would never fade, but she did to him what not even Zetsumo couldn't do..She broke him, she destroyed his life of being married.. He closed into her, looking at her eyes .. A pause ..Silence....No choking..Just him staring directly at her for a moment..Doing what he swore he'd never do..He wanted to kill Zenaki..But he didn't, even though he could have here and now.

"....I...Forgive you..." he had no other choice at the mentality he was forced to be in, but at the same time he was willingly doing so, despite his compassion as a Uchiha..He forgave Zenaki... "..You've...Won me....I love you.." he said..* - Sun Oct  4 09:50:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) panting , gasping for air, the man was forced to heal himself with the use of his own chakra of course, eating a healing pill...Why..Why was it that he forgave her?..Fujitora had a theory, as Ushinawa had always hated the killer of his brother Gintoki, and wanted to eliminate the bloodline of Kastya..

He didn't..And it seemed he forgave, he did not kill for the sake of Fujitora but rather continued his own path! FUjitora had been through much, eating the flesh and blood of his very own wife...Forgiving the killer...But still wishing to continue leading his clan as the new beacon...But how would he when he could not even inherit the very will of his older cousin whom was very much labled and seen as his beloved older brother that he followed behind... He was...Conflicted..But he did this..For the sake of the clan and his own sanity..

He yelled! Viciously! "WHHYYYY!!!!" from that day forth, he had to become more than just the very beacon for his clan but for man kind and serving as the very refliction of both anger and forgiveness ,an intense friction between the two like oil and water to never mix! He continued to roar! "GODDDD!!!" the echo of agony, pain and regret, hitting him like canon balls..Flames on the very decrease from their rise, fist covered in blood, body covered in scars...He fell down , his head rested on Zenaki's belly after he would only let her heal slow and naturally now once he healed a few wounds.. 

Dreaming of the horrid image...Of the wife Berith running towards him, but then a sudden knife popping out from her throat with a hand and arm following up behind it...Zenaki's image with devil horns and wings appeared from the shadows..Beriths eyes horrified, just as Fujitoras..Only to see the very head and heart of Berith devoured by Zenaki with a smug smile in Fujitoras face...Only for him to do the unthankable..* - Sun Oct  4 10:18:14 2015

Ushi<Yep! You've been one of us all your life, you're family..Always remember that Fuji..>

He saw images of how Ushinawa would train Fujitora with fire..But due to the pain of his riped open arm via WHIP by Zenaki which he struggled in a big loss of chakra to even heal..

<Ushi..You came to Suna! I thought you hated this place because of Kastya!>

The day his head was ruffled by his brother like cousin..Where his hate for Kastya was placed aside for Fuji's sake...
