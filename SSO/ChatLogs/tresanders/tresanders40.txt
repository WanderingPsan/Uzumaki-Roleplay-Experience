<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) raising an eye brow to this , he examined the woman, he knew he sensed another being inside of the house, this Fuji looked at her closely from the distance as his eyes narrowed, they become focused upon her.

"Who are you and what the hell are you doing with my child?..." he asked coldly while there was the body of the false Zenaki behind her.

"What did you do to my wife?..Where is Zenaki?...." he spoke now walking up towards the woman, his eyes even more so narrowed . "Release my child dammit..Or there will be hell to suffer." * - Wed Dec  9 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes too full of rage and anger "I will stand..." he spoke ,focused on the womans chakra he felt it was familiar but this could of easily been a fake..He was not letting his guard down, locking the door..* - Wed Dec  9 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) now in a swift motion, he held his right hand towards her as if it were a gun, it surged lightning as he mimiced this long ago and practiced it, he said to her "Don't play that shit with me woman...Who are you...Put my child down NOW!" he threats with a glare, as if he was ready to pull one mighty trigger.. 

"I don't have time for any mind manipulating bullshit...Where is the real Zenaki, and where have you hidden her, you might have leeched her chakra but you look nothing like her..Don't tell me? I'll shoot you in the leg...The Arms..My Child will see torment at a young age and for his mother."  he spoke.* - Wed Dec  9 01:32:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes slowly sloowly narrowed once again. "You answered wrong the moment you said...The Real Zenaki .." he spoke now aimed at her legs the man shot out his condensed bolt bullet towards her knees to prevent her from trying anything that involved shinobi movement...BUT ALAS!!! The child spoke of the word Mommy and the bullet curved upwards towards the ceiling.

"Damn...My emotions made me miss...." he spoke coldly while walking up towards her now, eyes closed the man then places a single hand upon her head, gripping as he spoke.

"Then answer me this..What happend for you to change your hair, your skin, your face...Everything that made Zenaki whom she was..Tell me..Or rather...Listen.." he spoke again this time being the help of his Fuuinjutsu to test if it was still there if she'd Listen.* - Wed Dec  9 01:42:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) speaking as he soon removed his hat to reveal more of his facial features.

"Bullshit....Contacts you cant fucking remove, guess you'll get an infection eventually and go blind wont you?..." but then that's where it happend, where she brought up the memory of Berith, then FUjitora paused for a second as he took a swing of memory passed the seal he palced upon himself long long ago, surely to be over due , thinking about the day he was even raped that came along, and the day of which she tortured him and laughed, and laughed at him about Berith being killed and fed to everyone including him as a dish of food as fucking Pizza..

Fujitora came to a realization, his hand slowly grips into a fist now, shocking of lightning once more but aimed to the ground, he lashed it out to the side, firing a string or direct bolt of lightning towards the wall that traveled up the ceiling.. The flash backs made him want to strike the woman but he did not, though infact, the other hand that was being placed on her head, his grip got tighter..

"You know...The trouble I went through...To forget that day?.." (Strength 17.93)  "You....Bitch.....You Just..Casually bring it up, as if taking lives mean nothing to you but shit.." he released his grip and he backed away at the mention of him scaring his son..He backed away to the wall..THinking long, thinking hard as the memories took its swing, he soon reached the door..The man leaving, unable to accept or believe this new reality, so he took off without any warning , busting down the door with a powerful flame.* - Wed Dec  9 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) being held in place..Fujitora thought it over, he looked at her once more, this time with his Sharingan eyes as he said "Because...Just like the others you left...I don't forget those who leave..But if you insist on being you and sorry for it then I'll try..To see you through your point.." he spoke now activating the Interrogation Genjutsu with the strength of his doujutsu to enhance the genjutsu as he asked "Why did you really leave?...Tell me all about this little -Trip.." asked the man... The father and husband.* - Wed Dec  9 02:06:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking towards his daughter , he noticed that her eyes had matured now, up to the level of his he said "You're making your way, hehe..Now you have to get used to them and what they may offer..Like Hideki said, these eyes are unique and all have very different powers...So..We will find out soon enough.." he saw Claudette walking off and he nods to her, making a distance between himself and his daughter as of now, he said to her.

"Now we'll see if your eyes are like mine." he states.* - Wed Dec  9 05:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) clapping his hands together he said to her "Tis will be something to see.." the formation of his hands to make out the kneading of chakra to this jutsu as his eyes also came to spiral , giving his daughter a calm and focused look as he said "Katon.. Goryuka No Jutsu" he said this one jutsu outloud as he focused the massive flames to spiral towards his daughter KNOWING the risk..

Doing this to test her metal, he knew she was a shinobi now and acknowledged it and for her to progress he couldn't allow fatherly instincts to block his own metal against her training to become stronger.. He  sent about three of these big boys towards her direction, the general amounth.. Trying to Manipulate some to hurl at wider ranges to see just how she'd respond.* - Wed Dec  9 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) now drawing his blade of the Ryushini No Yari , he spoke in reply to her words "You eyes can see but can your body react?" he then rushed towards her at great speeds after the flame made its explosion and he had taken cover . 

In doing so, the man also made a few other preporations by placing a few seals on the mountain by throwing them or atlease attempting to. But for now, he focused on getting closer to his daughter, to see how well her eyes helped her in close combat...This brought up memories of how he and Ushinawa would train with one another, when Fujitora did not have sharingan but rather just his child self, and Ushinawa's child self, training in hand to hand combat with bokkens..

<C'mon big cousin, stop holding back!>
<You gotta get stronger Fuji or else you'll just stay weak.>
<Grr..>>

Old days , a swing of memory as he attempts to strike Izanami on her blind side of the left where she needs to always be aware of if her eyes picked up his person or chakra.* - Wed Dec  9 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) keeping an eye on his daughters movement, their blades clashed, he smirked in an honorable bit of pride from this as he thought <She's learning..> he ponders before adjusting his own sight to the sword arts as well "Though this is only the beginning to what you are learning." he told her, there was much such as the Genjutsu sharingan and much more to go on with..Perhaps Izanami's eyes focused more on something else like reflective ability or Genjutsu itself..

Either way, Fujitora wanted to push this theory to see where he'd be going with it.. The man took it to another level, backing away to now try and use somehting else, leaping a step or few feet back, he took out a scroll, facing it towards Izanami he said  "Weaponry Unseal.." he spoke , now shooting out a good bit of weapons towards the direction of Izanami.. Ten Kunai and 5 Shuriken from the scroll of his, this was a test but he was capable of sealing much more..Though he ony let out a portion of his collection to test her reflex..

Along with this he waited on guard with his katana in his other hand only to put away the scroll once the job was done . * - Wed Dec  9 06:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) impressed by this the man soon stabs his sword into the ground to perform a few additional hand signs in order to  send out a mass of fire balls towards the direction of his daughter.. "Now times can get more serious.." he stated <Katon..Phoenix Flower Jutsu..> he ponders in this attempt to counter and fire a series of 10 fire balls at her direction ,all manipulated to move in random flying directions at her general spot to make them harder to predict  ..Building up alittle chakra for something else later, though now he'd grab his sword once more, trying now to close in along with the fire balls before him as distracting support.* - Wed Dec  9 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) closing in on her, he said "Just the flames of yours wont guard forever just as Tetsumi's sand did... Your enemies will fight fire with fire.." he said calmly now focusing his own flame upon his blade to try and slice through her fire wall and try to strike his daughter through it , the seals on his own sword acting as his own attempt to try and seal away the flames within that wall of fire during such, though this was an attempt he aimed to try and gain a quick glance of direct contact upon his daughter to test how strong she'd be without her flame..This attempt aiming to seal off her Fire Nature chakra after a quick and sudden burst of speed to follow up after her.* - Wed Dec  9 06:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) keeping a watch for the counter to come, he saw the girl forming an earth chakra flow to counter his flame, however in that time frame, he went to do the same not to counter but rather to prove his point of the eyes, copying her ability he cancled his chakra flow in order to make his own blade jsut as durable 20 x 2+5 or how the math went, he did this to still try and grab his daughters shoulder to place this seal and see just how much she had grown.. The reflex of the man being (22.12) currently and attack speed of (19.5 ) to all add along with it.. 

"That's new for me." he refers to the earth chakra flow.* - Wed Dec  9 06:30:24 2015

Fujitora watched as she flew off, the man thought to himself <She's learning fast..> she was his daughter after all, these eyes of course should of been natural to adjust to..He went to chase on after her once she got a good distance between them, using that very same ability , he said to her "You can't fly forever!" as their battle took on a new settle to air battle.. "You've yet to even practice mid air combat!..Guess now is that time!" he exclaims now gliding a single hand on his blade to slash forth this spark of exploding fire shots at the direction of Izanami who looked to be fleeing IF she was that far..This was just for dramatic effect lol.* - Wed Dec  9 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) having no choice the man tried to block this lightning bolt bullet that came towards him, probably missing in the process <That was one hell of a reaction..> he thought to himself, possibly shot or maybe even successfully blocked the attack..Either way the man continued to try and bolt towards Izanami, this attempt to close in on her all the while, but being delayed by the lightning brought her some time . He kept his eyes focused on her.. He was no transitionist so he couldnt be switching between his elements, but he kept his aim and focus on her.. Eyes trying to predict what was to come.. This time using the fire ability to fly aside her from a distance with his blade gripped in his right hand "How long will this chase last, hm?" he ponders.* - Wed Dec  9 07:34:24 2015
