"As I mentioned before... This is one of my creations..You may earn one just as well or better in the future if your skills rely on kenjtusu or any weaponry that can be unique to you and only you...Now lets start off with the basics first.." he'd stab the sword into the ground as it would turn the stone walls of the arena, spreading such flame as fuuin marks to create the ring of fire.

"You all will need to get the basics down first...Nina, like me you are a generalist..You will progess a bit slower than the rest, however the fruit of your efforts will come soon enough , as you might become one of the selected as well...But this training is only to prepare you for the Labyrinth..An island of mine which contains a series of task..An island of which many struggle to survive in with the beast upon it.." he nods before going on over to the rest..

"Index...You Desire Fuuinjutsu, correct?..And have already sworn loyalty?..TO gain power to protect your loved ones was the goal yes?.." he asked him with a serious tone..the sword remained stabbed in the ground to only be picked up and sheated..He just wanted to show them one of the few blades he had enhanced..* - Tue Oct 13 03:11:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) going forward only kneel down infront of them and begin to draw a seal formulation "Fuuinjutsu, when used in battle can take up much time, it can be harder to process as well..However, to make such easier for myself..I've always prepared tags and seals for certain fuuinjutsu myself long before any battle could begin when I was young..It was the secondary purpose for my training of sealing water into a scroll from the ocean..Since it is an unliving object, it was as simple as sealing weapons but chalenging enough for me t increase my own chakra over time...With Fuuinjutsu ,one can do much more than just summon objects, but rather .." 

He paused for a second as he looks on over to draw another formulation symbol this time for the Kuchiyose ..

"They can summon animals as well..Because of the Unique properties to Fuuinjutsu, one would say its one of the finer and more grand arts.. " his eyes peers up to Index and Nina.. He was in no rush to give such power freely but he also wanted to give them both a test of personallity as well..FUjitora looked to Index making such clear by saying.

"One can also grant power upon another with Fuuinjutsu...It is why you will be apart of my project, the Limiter Release Seal.." he pointed to Index lazily as he begins to explain what he planned but not telling him of the true source of power he will be gifted..

"To an point of which you have reached such a limit, this seal will begin to slowly activate, leeking your latent chakra into your body, thus granting you the power you might need to continue on, young Index.. This is the benefit of coming within First place of the Labyrinth challenge...However there are some risk...To you for this experiment that is soon to come..It is extremely painful.." he says with a simple stare.. Now turning to continue the lesson.

"So, now I wish to see your skills...Index and Nina.."* - Tue Oct 13 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) nodding to Nina "Correct...And yes Index, however no human is losing the power granted..It's a gift from yours truly..If you think you are ready for it of course.." he says now looking to Nina.

"The basics of Fuuinjutsu.." he gave her a marked scroll.. 

"I want for you to concetrate your chakra upon the very formula on that scroll, it is used for basic sealing so it shouldn't be too difficult..I want for you to be able to seal away objects so that you may get the idea down of how to seal away animals as well.. Seeing that animals are alive, it makes it harder to summon them, much harder than non living objects...Because of the space time portion of this jutsu known as kuchiyose to summon them..For example.." he'd perform some hand signs , with a blood offer of course, the man would slap his hand down to summon out a monkey from his own seal which spreads to a medium.


"But like I mentioned..Learning a bit of everything will take time..WHich is why majoring in one thing is vital to us generalist.." he tells her simply.* - Tue Oct 13 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) note that the seal he gave Nina was to summon a Gorilla Statue if she succeed.* - Tue Oct 13 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking at the two as he sees the success of Ninas focus, nodding his head "Yes, it's there for training purpose..Those who wish to be summoners must be able to get down a basic of Fuuinjtusu right?..So this is my way of doing such..To teach ya a little bit of everything, you'll need to know just how well everything works.. " he gave an example by using the basic seals himself many times..He unsummons his monkey, little Kong.

Now his ehad over to Index "We'll be starting with such soon then.." but first he wanted to make sure that Nina had learned something from all of this. "Now do you know what it is meant for?..To learn basics for such than for us all to jump to it eh?...I want for you to continue training on summoning..I do not wish to ruin your chances of finding something  unqiue to you and you alone..Which is why you wont be learning the summon of mine just yet, untill you've truly decided that summoning is what you actually want..One contract with an animal is good enough for most.."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) pointing out towards the south of Sunagakures boarder he told them .

"There are many wild beast lurking the sands, and just doing guard duty with the average shinobi is not helping the lands out at all..So I will need for the both of you to take care of the mess within the sands, however..It could be a giant scorpion or simle desert fox giant that is threatning the gates and our guards..The two of you are to capture these beast after defeating them..So that the sealing squad can take them into our keeps for later use and research..Be warned that they are vicious, you'll need your best of skills for such.."



How do this this? You'll have to rp what you see, determine the risk use fair dice rolls and place them into a scroll..Determine the risk will result in how good the reward is added with actual effort .* - Tue Oct 13 04:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Alright...Let's go then Index. - Tue Oct 13 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Right. - Tue Oct 13 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) leading Index out to the area of which was his secret under ground cave, the man states to him as he spoke "Normally I'd have this done on my island of the labyrinth, but it is not considered a village and I'd like to keep it that way..I say this because I am usually watched for what village I go to..I'd head on out to the village hidden within the water fall...But it's a long distance." he nods before he instructed Index to lie down on the table of restriction.

An entire room , empty but with one table and binds to keep an extraordinary human down, with many seals upon the floor for even more restriction.. He told the boy.

"It is for your and our safety...Please..Lie down.." If Index would lie down, the people in lab coats would tighten the laces and such on to his limbs.. Fujitora on stand by until such was done.* - Tue Oct 13 04:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm, tell me, what are your elements when you became Genin? - Tue Oct 13 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Er... - Tue Oct 13 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Fire, Water, Earth and Lightning. - Tue Oct 13 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Good..Any would do.. - Tue Oct 13 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Huh? - Tue Oct 13 04:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon looking at the young lad as he rested on the table, the lab doctors strapping him down tightly as they'd soon give the boy a pill as well .

"F22...This will numb some of the pain." pills made by Zenaki that Fujitora was putting to use..The man folds his arms now waiting for him to chew away the pill as this being soon went to search up the chakra he would going to be putting into the young loyalist of his.. Since he had both sworn loyalty and completed the Labyrinth challenge in first place..Fujitora neededa gift that would benefit him most.. As he had many stored away...How exactly did he do such? Well Fujitora has had this elite squad of Fuuinjutsu experts trained by him for years as well as some other outside hands to aid with such.. When ever there was an attack, or a possible metod to take whatever he could gather..Fujitora always waited patiently with his plan..To take remnants and large portions from the chaos and aftermath..

He selected this time.. The Sanbi remnat chakra, something that would be possible to work with from such elemental progress with water and other things...He was lucky to have caught this when Koeki was alive and such..So Fujitora soon placed a single hand upon the very chest center of Index..Another hand on the vile which was linked to him as he began to make the fuuin sealing formula on the kids chest, he could feel Fujitoras own chakra spreading about his body, but soon the kid would also begin to feel the chakra of something greater surging within him, this causes extreme pain to the kid as such happends.. Fujitora knew the laws of Bijuu...But now he needed to extend such research to pass on to this child , to see if he could master the power of such, for if the time comes again where the true Sanbi reappears..He could fight it directly and take the chakras of the ebast for himself..As Fujitora seals this chakra into him..He knew the transformations would end up weaker..BUT he knew that they were still a big ass threat..The restrictor seals within the room soon activated, As this Fujitora maintained a hard focus ...Index in the future would only go as far as to becoming a miniture Sanbi..If he succeeds..If not then he might try again..* - Tue Oct 13 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) having some of his own chakra within this seal as well, Fujitora smirked a bit to the success of which he had created a Puseudo Jinchiriki with the information and chakra life forms he had gathered..He soon marked the young child with a brand over the seal, this just indicating that he is one of the Labyrinth to have gained the gift Fujitora had to offer.. His plans for shaping the world was coming into play when he says..

"All is well, going according to plan.." he nods while gently rubbing the childs hair back, to have the medical team lift him up and bring him to a secure room to sleep in..During this slumber, he'd notice within a dream, the feeling of Fujitora near and the Bijuu within him, roaring to his soul as chakra leeked and infused with his own , maybe painful when he wakes, but it was the power he desired to obtain.. He'd also notice bandages wrapped around his head.. His arm and his leg.

These were simple injections to keep the boy going and well rested ..Nothing important..Or special...If he wanted to leave, the guards would have welcomed him to as long as the base was remained hidden.* - Tue Oct 13 05:09:45 2015

He enjoyed having the company of a Ryu along side him in the village since most were in either Kumoakure or Konoha..

"I think you'll have a challenge with the Labyrinth but pass it if y' use the smarts of your mind to get by such.." he says with a nod while reading and writing within the scroll of his..Trying to do research on the seal of the Iron Armour to see just how he could remake the sal with his Four Symbol sealing jutsu, to leek certain powers and chakra to a host..But Fujitora did not take his attnetion off Marrisa as he done such..

"Overall, I'm proud that you've came to Suna to train and stay. Not many people have that kind of love for home.." Fuji was one of those people..He respected that from others who loved their home..* - Tue Oct 13 06:35:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking towads the two he wondered about the shell..How heavy it may of been, before turning to Zenaki..  "How far have you progress with the experiments Zenaki?... You've had many recently..How much information have you managed to increase with over time?" he asked before one of the seals that were placed would activate..Causing her to lose function within her left and right arm for a few seconds.. She tried leaving without permission...Bad Zen..Bad...But then the seal slowly undid the restrictions slowly..Due to Fujitora being more calm today than usual..He seemed like he was thinking all too often...Plotting...Memorizing..For the very Creed in formation once he had went to the Labyrinth again.* - Tue Oct 13 20:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking to Zenaki he simply stated "All the times you left without permission as all..No need to worry about that today though..I stopped the flow.." he sips some random ass cup of tea..Both calm..Yet alittle vicious today, this Fuji sits down upon the table .. Eyeing Zenaki for a small second , thinking about his prized research as all.. Casually rubbing the sockets of his eye, outter layer of course.* - Tue Oct 13 20:28:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) sitting down as he sees Zenaki motion over towards him, emotionless he stares with his black hues focused upon her being infront of him..Soon to be kissed, he stood still without movement, a body as if without warmth, Fujitoras mind keeping him at a cold phase of which he cared little for nothing..He soon kissed her back by placing his figners below her chin to keep her close , only to gently push her away as he said  "What is with your sudden affection?.." his shinobi mind had got him into thinking too much about his collection of Bijuu..Or rather..His -Pets- and how he'd manipulate the use of them later on once all others were gathered.* - Tue Oct 13 20:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) hearing the worlds of Zenaki, he'd go and say "Oh..It's nothing, just work.." he looks back to her and would kiss her once again when her arms wrapped around him, a single hand going up from behind to glide his fingers upon the very surface of her back.* - Tue Oct 13 20:55:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) sitting down within the living room it would be assumed as Zenaki left, with Fujitora now alone to think for a moment, his mind began to focus on one major detail to his plan of which he would need to begin the process for later on and such with the plan would include that he send many people out on missions to collect much more than just diamonds for the sake of resarch to be involved..

Fujitora soon began to glide his finer on the very table, eyes following this figner , directing it to make a complete circle one of which was being used by his immagination, only to go and begin making a certain symbol, the very symbol of Ryu , the kanji of dragon...This was no finger carving seal, this was Fujitoras mind coming into play with his current self... 

<---Cannot Be Revealed Currently--> The thought of which caused him a great heachache to surface to his mind..Physical and mental pain striking him at the moment as he devised up a plan for the Creed..He tried to think back, to a memory of which he sealed off himself..It was the memory of Kastya..Koeki..Tetsumi and the day of which Kirigakure was attacked by a Bijuu..He wanted to place together all of the information gathered, he then thought about his students, trying to seperate the lacky from the elites..

Why? His plan needed such, but his heart would not allow him to go against his lawful code..His Lawful Neutral like self of mind..<I've done too much and  have been through too much to be declared as Good...I am of the Neutral stand points from this day on..> having to respect both good and evil..His heart pains came to a stop..Fujitora simply took an apple and ate it..Not really minding the current situation.. The Uchiha needed for Zen to become a Geneticist soon..Though such took time..He began to study...Taking out a scroll to read.* - Tue Oct 13 21:11:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon stood up from where he was seated.. Eyes shifted towards the two, he'd simply leave such alone..Spotting that Beth and Zenaki were likely going to be doing things. Having their fun. He'd go towards the window, looking out the man soon found himself going to the door.  No words to be said as he left, putting his hat back on, much on his mind about the days of both future and past..Seperating himself from the earthly Fujitora he known himself as for now..In his attempt to walk outside and take a gaze out to the night skies.. 

<Remember those days?... Thousands coming, no tears falling..Heh, the innocent times of my youth, coming here from the land of the Waterfalls...But certain paths lead to both brighter and darker ones...> he simple continued to walk, the door was unlocked though,,Someone better get to that. Fujitora began to read all letters he was sent..Pausing dead center..Flashbacks of the years as a Genin coming back to him..* - Tue Oct 13 21:41:20 2015
