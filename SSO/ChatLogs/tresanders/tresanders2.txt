<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) *Ryujin, Fujitora looking at all of what Yan was doing, he saw that some of his own abilities would not work on a vast number of people such as seals but he could use the power within his seals upon the army of men that belonged to Zetsumo, so without hesitation the man soon took out a scroll of his own , placing it aside him just incase these guys decided to use a big ass jutsu upon them. He began performing hand signs, taking his time to perform each ability.

"I'll be helping along.." <Mud Sillhoutte!> he charged this ability to fire it forward at the army in combination with Yan's jutsu all while opening a medium sized scroll labled Rushing water from his back thus opening it AFTER he used used the jutsu to increase the size and speed to their power, summoning with the ebst of his fuuinjutsu ability and hard focus! *)
