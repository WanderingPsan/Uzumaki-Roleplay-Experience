<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) /// It was at this point that a medium sized nute like monster had approached them from the waters , tackling the ship at its bottom half while shaking the water purely with sound as if it were a whale or mimicing one.. This gave them the advantage to take it down if they chose to act now.

"Alright blonde, show me what cha got." he was waiting on Seisuke to take out the beast or atlease weaken it to seal away while the other men tried using their harpoons at the giant monster nute.. Meanwhile this ran the risk of more monsters coming, this nute currently was worth a C rank.. But if more were to come, the danger could increase... Double or nothing it was this day.* - Thu Sep 17 15:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) // The monster continued to bash against the ship as it uses the very power and strength it possessed trying to flip the crew within it over , however being stopped in its actions the beast was hit by an unexpected lightning jutsu, thus shocking it in this large body of water, a very big advantage to something of a weaker element to tae high damage from.. Though it was new, it was enough to take out a C ranked monster of this size, leading the squad of Fuuinjutsu specialist to go and bind the monster for later use .

Not Fujitora spotted two other threats, another but larger monster along with one other that was GREATLY large (due to rolling that 6) resulting in a much higher risk to take on from. The two beast of the sea swung their mighty tail fins against the boat, shaking it and everything within the ship, causing most to tumble over and fall down..From this point these beast opened up their jaws only to fire an attack a giant sized water beam coming from the BIG monster and a Medium sized one from the lesser one which came by the roll of a 4 but still proving to be one big threat to the crew..Because not only were they in such an element, they had to avoid being hit by these water beams..

Fujitora attempted to dodge such by leaping out towards another end, not planning to use his own ability to fight no time soon, but rather wishing to see what Seisuke would do first..For now he was on stand by as his troops readied the harpoons aimed at the big one first.. Fujitora began to prepare his own type of jutsu the deeper they were dragged out to sea.* - Thu Sep 17 16:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon tried to utilize a form of Fuuinjutsu once the beast own attack had ended. the man opened up a single scroll which held the lable of a seal in Runic letters as weaponry , in which case he summoned out a vast number of giant shuriken that he tried to use to manipulate and bind the bigger monster, not worried too much about the medium sized one but more worried about this big one being too much of a threat so he aimed for the limbs in these attempts, next to this, he'd even try to tie to strings down on the base pillar of the boat while the men continued to fire their harpoons.

Little known fact this bigger one had slick skin and was not very durable to fire but was to lightning.. It countered the two attacks by Seisuke and Fujitora by blasting a series of water bombs towards the ship, simply giant water bullets while the smaller one would aim to attack the crew on the ship by hopping into it, aiming to strike their men with a swift tail whip aboard the deck .. This meant trouble, the medium stood at 12 feet while the big one stood at 60 feet...

The weather began to pick up, becoming even more stormy..The ebast empowered by the source of additional water..The risk increasing over time. * - Thu Sep 17 16:21:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) ///

The medium sized one was hit by the attacks of Seisukes, only to enter a berserk like state of which a chakra flow of water emerged around its body, rushing at him while firing a series of water bullets , though damaged now it still had a will to fight and take out its targets while the fishermen did not know what to do, they elft it to the shinobi.

Meanwhile Fujitora would assist in trying to hold the main big one down with his manipulated shuriken , telling Flexus "Cage it!" knowing how deadly it would be, he couldn't take his eyes off of the monster while the medium ran rampant, he would send out a shadow clone to help Seisuke at his command to try and use the great fire ball jutsu against the monster..

The Giant crab like beast glared at Flexus huge body only to fire at him a Hydro pumo beam of water at his direction , in order to knock him back of course in this stormy weather, the beast had a high control over the water element, using its brute stength to attempt at breaking away, causing the ship to shake, maing most lose their balance.

As if it was not enough for them at the moment, three more monsters came fro the waters, all looking to be Medium and large monsters, they fired both water and lightning at the ship, aimed at different targets between Fujitora, Seisuke and Flexus, they'd have to try at dodging these extra attacks, those beast slowly made their way trying to get on top of the ship and onto the deck.* - Thu Sep 17 16:41:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) //

Chaos this was as the beast all made their attacks, the medium now defeated from the combined efforts of Fujitora's clone and Seisuke, now remaining three other larger beast upon the ship, all of the lightning element like electric eels or something on the likes but in more of a bigger beast like form..

The giant crab was having a struggle with Flexus up until it was defeated by the giant punch delivered upon it, causing the beast to faint, the fuuinjutsu squad coming in to seal away all defeated monsters for the war that was to come, meanwhile they had three large beast left, all of which were accordingly B ranked monsters.... 

Though it seemed troubling, the three could handle it, if they all took on one by themselves.. The Lightning monsters then charged their attacks, sending out a series of lightning bolts from their being like a chidori Nagashi from three  to spread out to the water where Flexus was standing as well..

Fujitora would try to avoid this with hsi reflex, he and his clone was hit, causing him to grunt in his own pain from the jutsu or ability used..Faling to a single knee, but once he had recovered , he'd begin to perform aseries of hand signs..He needed his monkey to come and help this time..

<Kuchiyose No Jutsu..> Using the monkey to open up a big scroll he had given him to counter ONE beast with a vacuum of wind on the tier of the great breakthrough to try and negate some of the other incoming lightning. However the Giant crab was still struggling to regain the fighting power it had to continue on, they ran by the risk of it coming back.* - Thu Sep 17 16:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) helping in the finishing of this mission, Fujitora and his monkey would use another fire ball jutsu to add on to the wind power given to strike at the othe rlightning monsters while trying to help Flexus in support by commanding the fisher men to strike as well. THough this was the finale of their mission, it was all well worth the fight for the grand reward, capturing a totally of 1 A class, 3 B class and 3 C class beast from the watery depts, this resulting in the rewards they will recieve as well.. The monsters were all thens ealed away by Fujitora and the Fuinspecialist once it was all over, giving them the time now to return home as he declared..

"Mission! Accomplished! This Voyage is over!" he shouted as he stood tall and mighty , the crew left from the ocean back to home. These monsters they captured to be used for the future.* - Thu Sep 17 17:16:35 2015

So when he worked on the dragon fire bullet, he had also known that he was to work on his fire manipulation and control.* - Thu Sep 17 19:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) when trianing with the abilities of both fire and earth., he did think to himself about the things and motions he could use them in and by things he meant objects of his fuinjutsu mastery over such an art while trying to maintain his very focus on not only his elements but alll of which he could do as well, considering the time he took to practice with each shadow clone and how studious he was with each formulation and tactic.* - Thu Sep 17 19:21:10 2015

Looking to use it even more and advance it within the time that will pass him by, so focused on what he will be doing and all he could be doing as well..Not trying to surpass anyone but himself and Kastyas fear.. Making sure to continue training to become even more so stronger for himself and his family...His new wife at home with the children while he was out training..He was going to ascend soon perhaps in power and he did not hesitate to continue his training, keeping himself up and going as the time flies by.* - Thu Sep 17 19:34:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm, old fashion it is. - Thu Sep 17 20:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon would go about performing the basic hand signs needed for these two seperate genjutsu that he was going to be showing her, so that she could atlease get down the very basic understanding of such while he spoke.

"You'll come to find out that it's fairy easy to perform even though it may seem taxing on your chakra at first, the illusionary jutsu itself and the art has always been known to be high on ones own chakra... I think you're well experienced to already know that ,yes?" he asked her .

Molding his chakra nature to the Yin verson of it all, he slowly began to form the genjutsu to her mentality while speaking a bit more "Maybe during this we can build up a little -trust- you mentioned." he chuckled lightly towards the situation .* - Thu Sep 17 20:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) watching Kirie act accordingly towards the Genjutsu that was placed on her, seeing the woman walk by with a look of concern or something else of the matter in her eyes made him wonder what it was that she was seeing..Soon he placed a single hand to her shoulder ,speaking.

"Remember..This is only a genjutsu.." he told her while he awaits for her to either break out or learn from it. "It will bring up your worst fear, even so it will torment you with it.. This is something that would catch most off guard in the times of battle.. Something that is a rather cruel solution to a victory." he spoke while looking to add on to the topic "You do know the Genjutsu Kai? Right...The only way to break free of strong Genjutsu.."* - Thu Sep 17 20:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) nodding his head to this "I see you've come to your senses...Now do you think you can perform this genjutsu here and now?..Or do you think that you wont be ready?" he asked the woman with a small grin upon his facial features.

"This kind of training, we can continue since we are on this island, one of the old Hogo homes I'm sure we can stay in untill it is over.. But right now, I need for you to create this illusion..And we will go on from there."* - Thu Sep 17 21:01:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Genjutsu loses its effectivness if the person knows that they are in a genjutsu. - Thu Sep 17 21:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: So practicing it would not be as effective on the same person. - Thu Sep 17 21:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Correct..Meaning you will have to try much harder. - Thu Sep 17 21:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Yes. I know. - Thu Sep 17 21:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Well what are the handseals required? - Thu Sep 17 21:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: What do I need to do? - Thu Sep 17 21:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: You will be amazed by how hard I work. - Thu Sep 17 21:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: The Snake and Rat are the hand signs. - Thu Sep 17 21:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Then focus on making a set of wind rotate around the target. - Thu Sep 17 21:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: To first channel your chakra towards them and create the illusion hidden within their minds. - Thu Sep 17 21:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Genjutsu is something that I am not all that familiar with but then I still find it interesting. - Thu Sep 17 21:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: A learner like myself huh? You have quite the open mind then. - Thu Sep 17 21:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) sits down and waits for the genjutsu to be practice "Perhaps later we can do other methods of training, not too sure what you are capable of as of yet but I'd like to see."* - Thu Sep 17 21:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: We will see. - Thu Sep 17 21:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) was sitting down in peace when the genjutsu was being molded upon him, not sure if she was making it the way as she planned or not for it was only the beginning of a new skill she was being taught.. Fujitora soon began to see his nightmare.

His once wife Kastya revived under the control and arms of Zetsumo as a zombie of some sort, coming after him with a kunai in her hand and the Gobi taking partial control of her body..To Fujitora, seeing this was his worst fear, and traggic memory but he did not move ,considering he knew it was a genjutsu that would likely get to him.* - Thu Sep 17 22:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) nods his head, only rubbing a single finger against the kunai, trying to not think of painful times, before utilziing the Kai ability to break free "It;s just...Old memories.." he said soon to be more relaxed now.* - Thu Sep 17 22:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: They seem intense. - Thu Sep 17 22:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: I guess no one wants to have their demos materialize right before their eyes. - Thu Sep 17 22:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Ya, its a great weakness. - Thu Sep 17 22:16:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: What jutsu is that? - Thu Sep 17 22:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: It says Mist Servant Jutsu. - Thu Sep 17 22:29:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Though if you wish we can go for a drink now that we've gotten this jutsu down. - Thu Sep 17 22:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: That would be nice. - Thu Sep 17 22:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: You said you wanted to practice other things though. - Thu Sep 17 22:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Wouldn't that be better? - Thu Sep 17 22:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm, either would be fine. At the end of the day our work would continue. - Thu Sep 17 22:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: How about a close combat spar then hm? - Thu Sep 17 22:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Very well - Thu Sep 17 22:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: I could use some Taijutsu training. - Thu Sep 17 22:36:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) soon gotten into his taijutsu stance for sparring, eyeing the woman before him, thinking that she had a more wild fighting style of some sort compared to his own, his style was more like a simple one for practice use, nothing too special or advance for this sesson.. 

"Ah, You are more of a blunt weapon user, right? " he asked while he waited.* - Thu Sep 17 22:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Well. - Thu Sep 17 22:40:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) not being able to sense what she was doing but rather keeping a open eye for her tactics, he figured she was setting herself up for a normal taijutsu fighting tactic, soon he nods his head only to dash in towards her with the intentions of starting things off with a quick jab towards her shoulder , then a swift kick towards the left side of her rib cage. This was Fuji's way of testing out her reaction and reflex.* - Thu Sep 17 22:45:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) being taken by surprise at this, the man did not have much time to react, despite his amounth of reflex, his curious mind led him to be captured by the hair, eyes focused on Kirie from the result of such, speculating that she was some kind of hair manipulator..

But then the day finally came where he was hit in the groin, a spot where he never imagined to be hit, this made him fall to a single knee, expecting a hit to the torso or chin. First time for everything , the man grunted and spoke "M-ma balls!.." he said in a new form of agony and pain <Well...Luckily it was not a double tap...> one eye open while the other shut tightly, he soon began to channel chara to the gloves on his hand to produce a focused  channeling of fuinjutsu towards the hair and her body by reaching towards the center of her chest with his right hand. 

"T------Gaahhh....No wonder most guys fall down so quickly, this hurts!"* - Thu Sep 17 23:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) standing there with his attempt to reach the center of her chest with a bit of fuinjutsu had came to a complete halt <Dangerous!> he thought when his hand was taken in control by the hair that twisted around it , leaving him open and him spreaded out like a human experiment.

He saw where she was reaching "P-please no! I was not reaching sexual----" all of his spirit and voice was taken the moment she grabbed and she squeezed..And she squeezed like they were in a prison cell! Fujitora  ,even in more agonising pain released a quick and loud yell. "AHH!!!" from the dirty fighting tactics, he tried to talk "H---have mercy on my groins! " he struggled to break free from the hair, he could have a long while ago with the use of another jutsu but he felt that breaking free on his own would be more honorable.

"Didn't think a pretty woman could be so deadly..." he says trying not to break any words from the constnt pain he was in right now.* - Thu Sep 17 23:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) panting for a moment, he felt the squeezing loosening up but then suddenly the man was tossed into the wall near by , eyes widened by this, as an act of defense to halve damage taken by the wall, the man formed his shroud of flame which increased his defense against physical and spiritual objects , smoke being formed ..

One could easily assume he had taken the full damage, he walked out of the smoke covered and surrounded by fire which he soon reverted from and fell to a single knee, still feeling the pain from his balls being squeezed.. 

"Damn...That's quite vicious.." he speaks ,looking towards her "You had a rough past." to think she was raped only made him think more of how bad she had it.  He took his stance once more with a smirk "Let's enhance those fighting abilities then.." looking to help her.* - Thu Sep 17 23:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) nodding his head he told her "Deal.." he spoke with a soft grin before utilizing the speed of himself to rush towards and use the konoha whirlwind ability to try and catch her off guard "When this is over, I'm going to take a nice long slumber at home." he says in the heat of the moment, the one foot he was kicking with, having a chakra flow of fire surging from it.

He aimed at all front areas that did not include her hair. He could not afford for her to grab his balls once again. This time using much more speed than the last.* - Thu Sep 17 23:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: OH NOW I SEE WHY SHE REALLY HATES KATANAS! - Thu Sep 17 23:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Can't have anyone cutting the hair! - Thu Sep 17 23:51:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) thinks: Interesting. - Fri Sep 18 00:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) swinging from the kick resulted in him landing on a single leg, he tried to leap back the moment he spotted her coming in with a sweep kick, however he probably was hit anyhow though he jumped back, taking some damage and having to depend on the other leg for such.,

Once he gained a distance, he'd hold up a single hand sign..He saw that she was looking at him indirectly..He needed to see where her eyes were going to target and intimidate her with his own ability..So once the hand sign was formed he'd make it seem as if he was going to place her in a genjutsu as reports had shown of Ushinawa doing by looking one in the eyes, he'd mimic this and shunshin his way before her in his attempt to have his face and eyes an inch away from her own and a calm but intense glare .

"Will you fall for another one of my genjutsu?" he'd ask during this attempt. Then looking to try and give a good elbow to her stomach if he succeeded in distracting her.* - Fri Sep 18 00:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) stepping back a bit when the clone came about, scanning it he figured she must of just recently learned the jutsu. He smirked a bit "You know a lot I see.. Should be interesting." he could of told her that he mastered the shadow clone jutsu but where would the fun be if she knew of all his abilities.. Instead Fujitora would go and try to engage her and the clone in hand to hand combat once more as he focused his chakra into the fist he threw towards her .

Aiming for the center of her stomach this time and another punch out towards her clones body, looking to hit just about anywhere while he'd be focus on both his targets and his chakra control for his fuinjutsu to be used on the shadow clone. 

"Why wont you look me in the eye eh?" he tried to get her to look at him "It wont hurt, to look me in the eyes just once!" he declares this only to put the pressure down on her for this spar..To make it even more so benefitting for the both of them.* - Fri Sep 18 00:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) observing her movements, spotting that she still had some reflex to move from his attack, this pleased him but also got him in a blind spot ,having to take a punch to the rib making him grunt a bit. He said to her now attempting to grab her arm and opposite shoulder from that arm in his own attempts to hold her in place .

"How much longer could you resist and keep this up then?" he was trying to force her to look at him directly , he held a tricky smirk on his face while he kept his feet in place "If my feet aren't moving then how can you predict my next attack?...If I myself am not moving and is right in front of you, will you feel me plotting my next hit?" he asked while looking to try and use what grip he AIMED to get of her and take her into a genjutsu which he was going to use when he finally got her eye sight to match his own .. The Interrogation Jutsu.* - Fri Sep 18 00:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) now paused he deactivated the genjutsu when he heard her answer "A wise tactic but only someone with enough sensory and prediction skill would of been able to pull that off..Someone like a blind fighter I'd guess." he told her , releasing his grip on the woman .

"You fought well though if that was your practice of this art..Perhaps you'll become even greater with it. " * - Fri Sep 18 00:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes closed for a moment when it was mentioned what her goal was.. He had to take such into consideration, and what methods could of been best for the womans future "Femme Fatale?" he soon sat down as if he was going to meditate but not, just abusing the very position of seating, taking out  a scroll only to unroll it before himself and her, summoning out some food and refreshments, even some sake was there..He told her that some food after training would been nice.

"Eat...You'll be needing it for the next day or hour...You don't have to drink any sake if you don't wish..I'm not one to trick a woman into becoming drunk."  * - Fri Sep 18 01:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) sitting by he only ate as much as he needed to, eating dumplings as well that came along in the package when he asked "How close are you to successing in such a goal? " he then reached for the jasmine tea to drink, the young man ate like an king when he desired and had the mind of one. 

"Though I'm not surprised at how fast you are progressing, you're as your title states... Pretty gorgeous to add. Haha. " he played along with his words, eyes directed towards the woman. * - Fri Sep 18 01:20:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) keeping his mind on the topic as she spoke, the man replied "Only ten percent?..How much more do you really need to learn at this pace?" he'd ask and go on to what else he said.

"Well, out of those two guys, one can say that he honestly means it." he moved a bit closer to her holding a small grin on his face "You're unique, and that intrigues me more and more.. We're both adults, we can be honest, yes?" he said as he continued to talk.

"But if it is experience and abilities you seek.I think it'd be best if you continued to search for any information that can interest you. Learning everything isn't always good..I learned this during my voyage..When I was a kid growing up in Ame...I was told we'd have to move to Sunagakure, which we did , I learned nothing at home..it was not until I began traveling that I learned more than I could ever imagine..Making friends with a talking monkey even haha." he joked and rested on his back from this point.

"Despite the losses I've had..This voyage has been grand, I only wish that your voyage would be just as."* - Fri Sep 18 01:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) rubbed his left eye for a split second as if a bit of dust flew towards it "Yes, Amegakure is my birth village..My entire life has been involved with me traveling from one village to another, trying to find my true home..It came to be Kirigakure the day I went to the festival and found my cousin and relatives..But today I fear I will have to face my elder cousin Ushinawa in battle..For the sake of the village." he admits.

"A tip for when your journey comes to its climax..Never end it there, continue striving forward , eve if its a simple goal as finding peace..Though I don't think you'lll have any trouble with that. " he says simply, reaching to drink himself some more of that jasmine tea. * - Fri Sep 18 01:47:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) smirked softly "Wise words...I like women like that." he told her, placing a single hand on her own with how close he already was. "We do what we must to survive..Even an infant knows this much." black hues settled upon Kirie's features then over towards the horizon.* - Fri Sep 18 02:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) thinks: There is that one ninja art....but then again that would set fire to things. - Fri Sep 18 02:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes still settled upon the horizon of where the water would be, he said as he closed into her to break the barrier of space they had. The situation becoming more intense probably for Kirie as Fujitora's eyes shifted towards her. 
"I mean..You must be tired, yes?...How about we rest a bit more?" one hand went to try and shift her face towards his own gently, however as close as Fujitora got to make it look like he was going to kiss her, he stopped at an inch away if she allowed his actions to happen, only to have done knowing that his luck would of not gotten far. He chuckled lightly when he backed off to sit normally once more.

"Forgive me for that one..I'm not looking towards begging for mercy again with the hair trick." he joked.* - Fri Sep 18 02:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) taking an unexpected hit to the head, he recoiled back from the impact "Dammit!" the pain made him shout , trying to play off the pain by replying "I-it's fine.. Just some cold huh?" he said while rubbing the very spot where he was hit.

<Damn she has a strong hit--head---son of a...I can hardly think a word out right..> he thought to himself. Today he was just being abused by Kirie without her even trying too much it seems.. He then stood up "I think its about time we get some rest..I'll pay for an inn for y' if needed." he offers while placing his hand down from his head revealing a bruised area.

<So close...So far...Damn...>* - Fri Sep 18 02:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) tilted a head for a moment after she told him not to try anything else , he figured she meant like cutting her hair or something "Eh?...I wont cut your hair if that's what you meant..But I do look forward to tomorrow as well..So be well rested, because we will be using more than just taijutsu. " he says to her with a calm expression.

"Though if y' wish to visit my home some time, you're welcomed to." he says with a sly expression and pat to her shoulder. His expression was also a playful one. 

"But y' know..Not all us men are alike...Knowing your past, you did learn what you could to survive..I'm not one to make ya do anything y' don't want." he thought she also meant rape or something like it.

Overall he was clueless.* - Fri Sep 18 02:41:29 2015

Taking a good observation.* - Fri Sep 18 04:12:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) continued to keep up his studiies on his own D ranking ability mentally as he watched the two, being quite focused and very studious , the man created a mastered shadow clone to go and work on the jutsu for him as he watches his daughter spar the Hogo...Thinking about what she'd do next in a tough situation like this, dealing with those outside of her element. Fujitora knew her training might not be complete.* - Fri Sep 18 04:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) simply looking at them spar and though it might of came to an end later on, his shadow clone was away doing the training for Fujitora just as hard as he was. You did not need any special traits to be a hard worker and Fujitora had proven this, he was simply the average guy trying to advance his own abilities while taking on all new ones..When he was given the chance for a mission, he took it, and he completed it for the village council, a simple C rank was all it was for him earlier when he trained with Kirie, but right now, all of his focus was just on his clone training the one ability that could even be useful in sudden times...The Dynamic entry...Though his profession was not taijutsu, Fujitora took all close combat ablities into great focus and consideration..* - Fri Sep 18 04:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) only progressed just as well as he would as an actual person, being by the waterfall with a number of two shadow clones training for him with such a nearly perfected or very perfected jutsu..He was working on just the little things over all, all of which could be very useful towards him in particular with his fighting skill, looking to increase his very control over both fire and his chakra , that way his manipulation could be essentially easier over time..It was not like he needed to really leave any place for this training but it tired him the fuck out.* - Fri Sep 18 04:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eventually coming to an end, with his training on Hogo island, he returned to the lands of Kirigakure, the real Fujitora had merged with the experienced gathered from his clones and his own training..Looking at the crowd with longer hair freshly trimmed to look sharp..His eyes focused on the crowd as he said to himself mentally. <Atlast..I've ascended..> he thought to himself feeling a slight increase in over all chakra..Considering himself a grade skill higher than he was before from vicious training of his own methods and talents along with his abilitie to learn jutsu and carry on such mastery with them.* - Fri Sep 18 04:24:44 2015
