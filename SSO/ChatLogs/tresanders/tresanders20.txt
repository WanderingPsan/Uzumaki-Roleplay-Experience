Fujitora made way with this, pulling out a kunai as he'd first go to heal up the current wounds she had on her body, doing such in a way for them to all atlease be closed up as THIS Fuji was focused highly on such, it probbaly boosted his ability by alittle, though his Will also helped in such even if he did not know the girl much, it was for the very compassion of his clan member..

Getting some water so that he could make her drink it <Water can be used as a prperty to restore blood within the body..She'll need lots of it if she hopes to survive this..> now he was curious..What blood did Niza have..Was he AB- as well?..Fujitora didn't want to do it but he asked "Get the blood of brother Niza as well, come back and tell me immediately what it is.." he instructs.. Now having the time to mourn for the relative after giving  Marrisa the water which had pill particles within it to increase the creation of blood within her body as this pill was made by Zenaki for Fuji's use (T3 Pharma )  But instead, he used these pills to help others..He had about 7 more water bottles and a good bit of pills left over.

<Niza...How did this happen...You were always strong, even if you lost at times, it is still hard to believe that you died..> He thought about Ushinawa <What would big brother do in this situation?..> looking over to Nizas body, he turned back to Marrisa.* - Fri Oct  9 05:48:09 2015

Hm.. What to do, there are two methods I can use..But with time on the stand by like this..She's just going to suffer once she wakes up.." he thought about using his Fuuinjutsu,  <Maybe I can command her to swallow....Actually..Yes that can work, just use my damn command seals..> he rubs his chin. * - Fri Oct  9 06:03:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eventually, he'd pick the girl up to have her back against the wall aside her, soon he'd place a single hand on her head <No one will know this is a Fuuinjutsu atlease not anyone outside the room..> her hair was going to cover the fuuinjutsu placed while the links of the seal will connect to her brain for his attempt to apply the following command.

<Once a liquid comes in contact with your tongue, your mouth, you are to swallow without choking yourself, a steady drinking method, even if unconcious.. This is my command seal, if another does the same, your body will react by blocking your mouth with your arms..> it was not a complex thing to do but a last minute plan..

After such if Fujitora succeded, he'd try to give her the water along with the crushed pill within it. This to help the production of blood cells at a faster rate than normal drinking water.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes settled on Marrisas form as he soon reached for another bottle of this pill crushed water so that it would be enough to slowly reproduce the blood within her body by spreading and seperating off previous cells <Be lucky she atlease had SOME blood left to grow from, these blood pills and regrowth pills should be enough..> he then looks to Misa "Well... It's a little trick of mine , the trick of command..Flowing chakra into her brain stem, I can control certain movements from this point..Think of it as my form of Medical ninjutsu.." he says though he was not that great of a medic, in fact most of his work came from his assistant Zenaki , what he was using was purely fuuinjutsu and her pills mixxed in one . But he couldn't go about telling people he was a Locksmith..Already he had trouble getting certain people of the past off his case, eventually he'd place his farmer hat back on..

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes focused on the girl, he would see that she was waking up.. The pain was probably horrible for her..This was Fujitoras way of letting her learn a lesson for defeat..She dishonored them with this defeat, though it was a minor dishonor, he did not say too much but two very important words.

"Drink This..." he would give her the 3rd bottle of F-12 , since the human body needed large amounths of water daily, this was for the same progress to be made as the last.. <Human body is made up a larg percentage of water...This will be enough to settle with her body  along with the blood...> his theory seemed to be coming about greatly with the help of what he was given.. 

"We should carry her out then.." he says now done with his work..

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eventually he closed in once his hat returned with the blood of Max dripping from it only to rush towards the man and purposely clash his blade with his own as Fujitora spoke "Not dodging a simple hat, how unprofessional of a blacksmith , surely you must dodge the embering flames of your art and lifes work hm? " he took advantage of the time that was given to him, Fujitora gave a calm and focused yet relaxed stare to the man before he'd attempt to end it with a swift strike up towards his torso and front body by trying to cut through the typical katana.. 

"Katoishini No Yari.." the man said before coating the very blade in flames and swinging his katana in a very crescent moon like slash once he had gotten in range and taken the time that was needed for him to complete such..Soon to sheath  his sword back into the holder once again, his sword style of fighting, being draw cuts..Swift and accurate strikes.* - Fri Oct  9 09:52:12 2015

Fujitora knew she was in some way angry or saddened by this.. He placed a single hand on her shoulder, trying to ease the pain she had .

"Your master is here for you..Your master will always be here for you my love.." though he was not so keen to trying to come off with kind words, he tried his best to do so for her sake.. "The Kenryoku will have its Rebirth one day..Don't cha think so as well?" he asked.* - Fri Oct  9 11:19:15 2015

Eyes peering over to his lover he asked "Just how much studying have you been doing?.." he's been worried for her lately since the demise of Suitengu..Wondering if she'd even go as far as to make zombies out of the dead to fight with or revive the dead somehow to reunite with all the ones she had lost..The young Uchiha did not know what to make of it but he knew that she was in agony deep within from all of her losses...His eyes focused upon her, he'd just stand by and wait for her words..

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) within the house, this Fujitora sensed a familiar being within the house, as he would come within such an area, the room of which he could find Zenaki inside,, searching about as he'd probably come across the two within the same room, eyes glaring towards them as he spoke , a tone as dark as Zetsumo right now from the potential sight he'd see. 

"Unless this is another new toy for me, someone better explain.." this Fuji spoke while his hand was slapped upon the surface of the rooms wall. Soon a single finger snap would be heard, an ember of flame sparking from it..The Locksmith was not pleased.* - Sat Oct 10 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) eyes glaring directly towards Beth , hands tapping on the wall with a mind pondering on the situation..He steps forward.. Saying both bluntly and seriously.

But before that, he'd snap his finger to knock and burn away the alcohol Zenaki was given..

He spoke finally "This can go two ways... How would you like it?..." showing her both his indec and middle finger to count "Running, within the land owned by my father..Breaking his law and entering a house with a woman of mine...Unforgivable.." as he approached, this Fujitora created these seals within the flame, considering they were linked to his chakra, the house within his own domain, the five seal barrier..

<No Escape...This will be my solemn Judgement..> he looks over to Zenaki, wondering about how she felt about this "And what happend?...." * - Sat Oct 10 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) Chuckling lightly towards the said Hanae, Fujitora walked closer towards them, a single hand gliding about on the bed itself, as the area was becoming hotter strictly from FUjitoras own being when approaching her ... When close he said.

"Well...I wont kill a friend of my lover... However, waking up to the noises I heard..What I sensed..You've been a pretty bad one have you?.." soon attempted to glide a single hand upon the head and down the cheeks of Beth with a stare that was simply focused on her features..

THough he should of been angry to see such a sight, though he should of been  iching to kill, he was calm , relaxed and focused upon the goal as though it were a new game.. This FUji waits...As he waits for her answer, the fire upon his being rises slowly , as an ember of flame surfaces his shoulders, his being.

"Now I wonder if that said friend will co-operate with the master.." a glare was given of deep black Uchiha eyes.* - Sat Oct 10 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) hand gliding down upon her face gently from her head...All Fujitora had to say were the following words .

"Nothing you should worry about right now.." as the fuuin would spread from the top of her head, he only had a single command <Do not harm me in any way...> were his restrictions of a single action towards her, soon enough Fujitora pushed her to be upon her back, probably unknowing of the seal that had been placed..

"Let's say..We have fun, and play together.." he says with a sadistic loo in his eyes, though he was strongly calm and focused right now despite the inner rage, the man soon reached for the very clothing of Beth..It was time to reveal, he'd begin at .

"How about you give us a little show..And strip eh?.." he was not certain what Beth was, boy or girl, so he figured it'd be a fun way to find out.* - Sat Oct 10 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking to Beth , he knew it'd be a problem..So he looked to Zenaki.. "I'd like to see ya strip em for me as well~..Alittle help always does someone good.." he nods.. A single hand rubbing up the leg of Beth "Quite soft.." he gestures, now waiting on Zenaki and Beth to begin the process..

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) now sitting down upon the chair by Zenaki's wish, the man rested his elbow upon his knee and his chin upon his fist, a stare with a slim grin and eyes focused upon the two.. "Yes..Please me.." he says calmly and coldly while his eyes were focused from Zenaki's figure and body to see what Beth had in store for the two of them.

Of course the drins would be allowed at this point..However Fujitora did still wish for her to be a little sober to know of what happend this night. As she'd be visited by three of his stages ..Each worse than the last..Some delivered by Zenaki, and others delivered by the master himself.. The flames began to fade away as he cooled down..* - Sat Oct 10 01:24:54 2015

Fujitora said soon after "Don't worry...I've managed to make it enjoyable for all..In the end though..We're all satisfied~" he said before drinking some rum , now facing his lover.

"Let's find out..Hehe..How about we see how wet we'll make her soon after.." he wanted to see just how much of a man or woman Beth truly was.. Fujitora rubbed the surface of his pants.. Blood rushing but he remained calm.. Waiting for Zenaki to finish the rest, he waits patiently in the chair.. * - Sat Oct 10 02:08:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking at what was offered, he glides a single finger of his own across his lips..Only to stand up now, walking towards Beth and Zenaki, he'd smile coming up behind Zenaki as she was sitting on Beth now, Fujitora would lean down only to spread the legs of Beth "Do with her, whatever you like for now...I'm curious to see how your new sister taste." he says with a cold stare to Beths eyes, now on a single knee, he'd place one leg of hers over his shoulder.

His tongue on her inner thigh ,Fujitora was gentle at the least, another hand lifts the other leg up to be placed on the other shoulder "Let's just say its groceries~.." his eyes gazed at her private now, a single finger reaching forward to rub and rotate the very clit of hers as Fujitora teased her by licking from her inner thigh towards her private but not yet coming in contact with it.

Fujitora grins "Her skin is smooth..Master is becoming pleased.. " he says while a hand would creep up behind Zenaki in front of her to grab her right breast.. Something to squeeze on to as he looks to tease Beth.* - Sat Oct 10 02:34:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) now licking his way towards the very privates of Beth, licking deeply and aggressively as though he had all the time in the world to tease her, gently nibbing on her clit and edges, Fujitora reached with both hands now to Squeeze the breast of Zenaki, right before he'd rise up only to fondle them more up close.

This only meant one thing of course, if his chest would grint up on the back of Zenaki, his rod would slowly penetrate its way into Beth's pussy of course,  but only the tip..He had to get settled, her legs were spread wide and open for him, whispering in the ears of Zenaki  as she'd bite Beths nipples..

This was officially turned into a Zenaki sammich..

"Master appreciates your great work.." soon he performed the dynamic entry with his large shaft into her despite the poison, he wanted her to feel it with the heat delivered from his body.. Thrusting himself deep into her , going or attempting to by pass the term of "Balls Deep"" guy had stuffed it all in within a single go..Only to do such again. "If I can't do 50 thrust in 20 seconds...Lustful dance time.." he challenged himself ..Starting now "Don't lose to yourself.." his chest grinding uo against Zenakis as he grips on to her tits.* - Sat Oct 10 03:13:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) now coming to a stop with his thrust, the man looked down towards the two as he hugged Zenaki from behind ..He was as hard as steel right now, looking to pull off the pants of Zenaki slowly, he says to them "I'd like to see how well she can please the both of us..And how well she can ride her new sisters master.." he says in a focused stare..

Now laying on his back, he pointed to his rod "Ride it..." he didn't care with which what hole she chose to do it with, then he pointed to Zenaki, let master eat you out..While you can have a make out sesson with Beth.." the plan was to have Beth ride his dick and Zenaki ride his face pretty much to eat her out and have them two play with another above him..Fuji's rod was riding a good hard 12 inch now due to the blood rush pill he just took..His body heat sky rocketing ..Waiting for them now.

"Please, your master." he says.."* - Sat Oct 10 03:45:42 2015
