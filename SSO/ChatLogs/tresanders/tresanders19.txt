But for some reason, happy for Hideki to have carried on a will greater than that of what Ushinawa left behind as well as the clan..

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) looking at the time he had, the man was sure to take out a certain scroll within the safety of his own home. Looking to keep the seal for a certain blade in tact so that his keepings of such would not go undone.. He thought to himself <Another wielder down...> the sad tragic news that was taken by this..Fujitora had his own ways of keeping sacred items safe and out of enemy hands..This method of course did not take much effort..He wondered just how Violet was doing and how she was keeping up with the work of her own training, though she was not much right now, she'd be a problem later, and this was something the world did not see..Fujitora however saw the potential within all listed people..* - Thu Oct  8 23:43:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) standing alone for now as he continued on day by day to try and cut imself off from attaching emotions, reading over his scrolls and thinking about the future itself at hand. So Fujitora then walked on towards his sushi bar where he'd be running his business so that his time would be well invested, while his workers did their job, he'd be arranging much of their pay , Fujitora always tried to be a villager but the shinobi world always dragged him out and back into conflict for no to little reason..He sighed to this.* - Fri Oct  9 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Soo about teachong me the basics of sealing? - Fri Oct  9 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) being within his shop the man would study over his Fuuinjutsu, though he was a villager, he needed to work on all his sealing abilities so that once the day for battle had came and he REALLY was needed to join in, the man would be well prepared to come out as the Sealed Lotus group he was forming..Though now he'd walk on out of his shop as a shadow clone , since the original didn't really enjoy taking the daily risk, a clone was more suiting to go about and run errands for him..Going to town square as the original would be studying the Fuuinjutsu while creating newer ones and developing it further into something else.

Walking into central, this Fujitora heard Trilliam and told him once again "Like I said...Complete The Labyrinth.." he spoke bluntly..He did not like the way people asked and tried to TELL him that he should teach them certain skill..Fujitora saw his methods of teaching being earned, not given by his own free time to sacrifice, after all he made a vow never to teach openly again, never to act as a shinobi openly and more..These vows were important to his new way of life and would not allow anyone to take such away..He maintaine dhis sights on what was currently important, moving himself away from such emotional ties.* - Fri Oct  9 00:45:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) simply sighed , Fujitora was having struggles trying to seperate himself from the shinobi world and emotional ties, giving the lad a straight stare he thought to himself <I wont allow myself to get close to a shinobi again that is not directly linked to me from previous days...Not since that day...> he thought of all the shinobi who might of died by his mistakes..Fujitora folded his arms, placing his arms into the sleeves of his kimono.. He looks off towards the other area <Gifts wont bring upon my choice of teaching...Only false assumpsions...> he stares to the priest and then stares to his own scroll to read over..Words in shambles.* - Fri Oct  9 01:01:26 2015
