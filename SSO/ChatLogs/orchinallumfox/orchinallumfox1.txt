<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) undid her suit and began taking off her bra and panties. Setting them aside she stood there naked infront of Zetsumo and Dissida is she was present. Her body would be full of scars as there was one above her right breast were Zetsumo had inserted the thread when he gripped at her heart, her torso and arms were scared as well and her inner thighs also showed marking or scars that formed on them "Satisfied?" she asked him clearly displeased.* - Sun Aug 30 17:17:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) having focused her sensing abilities on the creatures near her she could tell that the weapons were coated with some sort of chakra "Oi, those weapons have chakra in them." she commented out loud for everyone to hear her as she quickly sunk underground using the chakra she had focused when the creatures first appeared. The ground bellow her would quickly turn into sand allowing her to easily sink and once her body was covered she began to "swim" through the ground having the ground where she was passing through solidify as her chakra stoped being in contact with it. Using her sending abilities and the magnetism abilities that her jutsu gave her she would keep tabs on everyone above ground within her sensing radious >What are these things?< she questioned herself as she "swam" through the ground in the direction where Zetsumo was previously standing in >The time of day is also the least ideal for me, what a fucking drag.< she thought to herself as she remained underground where she hoped to be out of harms way.* - Sun Aug 30 22:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) sensed the snot balls thanks to the chakra that the weapons had placed on said objects and decided to emerge else where as she figured that those things were not good news. She continued to swim only this time it was to the east where she hoped to get away from the commotion in order for her to be able to execute some abilities. After she "swam" a certain distance she emerged from the ground but not before sensing the area to make sure that there were no surprices for her waiting up in the surface, assuming that the emergion had gone off with out a hitch she would emerge from the ground and focused her chakra on the ground infront of her as she executed the snake handseal. Using her chakra to change the composition of ground to mud and sent it foward toward the nearest group of mutants avoiding her own team mates in the process "Zetsuo!" she would yell out as the mud wave would travel along "Use the jutsu I thought you! Set them on fire as well!" she would hope that he would listen to her and executed the combo jutsu. Given her mastery over the jutsu and her mastery over the element the wave would be formidable and a force to be reckoned with for anyone that would stand in the way of said wave.* - Sun Aug 30 23:02:11 2015

She continued to keep her sensing abilities around her and her alies that were nearest toward her and executing the snake handseal she sent chakra out toward the ground and changed the compositionf of the sand into a mud and sent the mud foward being carefull not to hit her allies. Given her mastery over the jutsu and her mastery over the Doton element the mud wave would be a force to be wreckoned with as ti was both large in size and tall. The intended destination for said wave was the front gate.* - Wed Sep 02 21:37:16 2015

Having sensed that there were creatures underground she took several steps diagonally to the right toward where Shin and Orakuru were fighting but did not interfere with the battle. Having broken the Snake hand seal when the mud wall reached the front gate she was free to do another jutsu now that her hands were not in use. She quickly brought her hands down and placed them on the ground and sent her chakra toward Krono's location since he was well within her sensing range. Her chakra gathered in the four cardenal points using Kronos as the center and in an instant the mud solidified from four different points at once seeking to impale him where he was. Since there were four spikes and considering that he was no sensor it would be extremely difficult to dodge considering his current state. Also she made sure to be well away from whatever was going on with Shin and Orakuru as she did not want to be caught in the cross fire between the two.* - Wed Sep 02 23:27:21 2015

After she was done she looked up and see the battle field and continued to keep her sensing abilities on those around her as she did not want to be surprised by the enemy >What to do next?< she asked herself as she scanned the battlefield left to right.* - Thu Sep 03 00:27:56 2015

Zetsumos words only seemed to worsen her condition >Fuck.< she said to herself as she closed her eyes tightly >I just took another step closer to him.< she continued on with her train of though >Fuck fuck fuck fuck.< was the only thing running through her mind at the moment.

It was clear that something inside of her had snapped just like that as she now bared a wicked grin on her face "Kronos kebab!" she continued on laughing afterwards as she felt a sudden pleasure in the fact that she had take a life specially since that life was from someone wanted by many "Hey." she looked at Zetsumo "Do you think I will get the reward?" she asked with the same wicked grin.* - Thu Sep 03 02:48:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) Continued moving along with Klim at a very I don't want to say snail pace but if I snail would to pass by that fucker would be moving faster since she was in no real hurry to deliver said message since she did not remember if the message was important or not. She focused her sensing abilities on the area around them and attempted to sense traps if they had been placed as one could never be to cautious.

Placing her arms up on the back of her head she continued walking toward said outpost "Hmm pretty boring stuff." she commented not really caring if Klim replied or not she just wanted to distract herself from how boring the situation was "I almost wish something would happen." she would continue on as she made her way along with Klim to the outpost.* - Fri Sep 04 16:43:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) Stood up and began to undres "Planning on shocking me?" she asked curiously as she folded her clothing where they would not get wet and once she was completely naked showing off her scared body she would step into the water.* - Fri Sep 04 20:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) eyes widened as soon as she saw the handsighs for the Katon technique >I will be boiled...touche.< she thought to herself as she stood in the water but to her surprice the water was heated but not to a blistering heat that would cause her skin to being blistering as she had expected. Raising a brow she looked up at Zetsumo "This is awfully nice of you." she said rather shocked before submerging her whole body into the water then came back up after several seconds "The water temperature is just dandy~" she commented.* - Fri Sep 04 20:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) began to swim in the little artificial hot spring doing some back strokes trying to listen in but did not say anything as she was rather enjoying this moment. She would swim up and down the little pond just enjoying the moment for the time being. Although she did find it wierd how Zetsumo interacted with females that were not Mukade, Beth or herself as he always seemed to refrain from acting like his normal self.* - Fri Sep 04 21:15:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) turned her head around and saw the male that entered the room and focused her sensing abilities on the new male just in case.* - Fri Sep 04 22:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) arrived at the training field but did not really want to do the punishment that Zetsumo had ordered her to do so she decided she would do something rather fun and interesting, at least for her. She got on her knees and placed both palms on the ground and began to channel her chakra into the ground and thanks to the training field floor being dirt she was able to slowly but surely began to change the grounds composition by humidifying the soil bellow her. At first a very small portion of the soil bellow her changed into the classic dark brown color that was characteristicly associated with mud.

After pouring more and more chakra into the soil she began to expand the range of chakra that was being sent into the ground as she had converted the ground bellow her into mud so she was seeking to expand the range of ground covered and the range of her jutsu >He will not see this coming.< she thought to herself as she continued to pour more and more chakra into the ground changing its composition into mud >He will most will not be expecting this at all since I just came up with it of course.<

She would continue to pour more and more of her chakra into the ground as she expanded the range of her jutsu. Soon more and more of the training field was being converted into mud as it was becoming the foundation for her trap that she was laying for Zetsumo. Once she was happy with the amount of ground that was covered she would remove her hands from the ground and sat down as she had begun to meditate to get her missing chakra that she had just poured into the training fields floor.* - Sat Sep 05 01:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) Watches as Zetsumo approached and arrived at the training field and focused her sensing abilities on him and on those around her just in case the others wanted to interfere with her fune. By doing so she could sense that something was bellow the ground and gained a frown upon her face "Oh whats the matter." she said a bit displeased "You do not trust me?" she asked him as she could clearly sense something underground "Well it cant be helped, I guess you really are paranoid." she commented then stood up as she was currently sitting down.

Once she stood up she patted her ass a few times to remove the dirt and if one would to be paying attention most of the front of her suit was covered in dark brown spots as a clear indication that she had been practicing something. Still keeping her sensing abilities on him and whatever was bellow him she opened her mouth once again and chose her words carefully "I want to have some fun." she simply told him as she stretched her arms upwards in a stretch then yawned "It has been boring and rather than holding onto the things you told me to I decided to go against your word so that -this- could happen."

The ground bellow Zetsumo would begin to rise all around him as several wolves made out of mud began to form. This happened because she had been pouring her chakra into the ground ever since she got her and the wolves were triggered by Zetsumos chakra when he steped into the mud. This was a pain stacking process that took a long time to set up but all in all given the amount of chakra she had poured into the ground a fair amount of wolves would appear all around Zetsumo "What do you say Zetsu? You always seem to have fun with Dissida, how about having some fun with me?" she questioned as she widened her stance keeping her sensing abilities on Zetsumo and the thing under ground.* - Sat Sep 05 01:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) remained looking at Zetsumo sensing the chakra on his fingertips and clearly seeing the flares from his fingertips "Tch, you do not concider sparing me important? Oh well, get set." she said as she began to weave five hand seals  Horse ---> Dog -----> Bird -----> Ox ------> Snake as she finished she smirked "I'll show you odd, go." she simply said as the ground around her began to lift up gaining reptilian like shape that began to form into a dragon that was made out of stone and mud since the field had been partially covered by it and of course this would not upset her previous jutsu as she did not need to hold down any hand seals for it as the chakra had been poured into the ground before hand.

The dragon would coil around her in a semi circle looking down toward Zetsumo, of course this would result in the training field becoming well fucked up since the foundation was being lifted up and shaped to become the dragon that was around her. Swiftly the dragon made its way toward Zetsumo with intent on crashing down against him as the wolves began their attack. She really hope this would at least hinder him a bit since he was being attack on all fronts. Keeping her sensing abilities on him she was ready to react in a defensive way if he decided to attack her.* - Sat Sep 05 02:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) quickly jumped back as her stone dragon was reduced to rubble >Tch I was really hoping to distract him with that but oh well.< she thought to herself as the mud wolves would quickly disappear since the scrolls containing said wolves got wet then got zapped with a whole bunch of lightning. It really was a disappointment to her as she hoped to really at least keep him occupied with the two previous techniques while she worked on the rest of her strategy but things do not always go to plan and she knew this very well.

"Indeed it does counter it." she assured him as she began to weave five more hand seals Boar ----> Ram -----> Snake -----> Horse -----> Dragon and sparks began to fly off her body as she focused it on her lower body running toward water that was on the mud and slammed her hand into the water so that the current could travel back toward him hoping to catch him slipping since she could also use Raiton natured jutsus and the addition of water on the field could be used by both parties evenly. "Indeed I am outmatch but I cannot used that since you already know it's comming." she commented as she watched the wave of raiton travel toward Zetsumo >Quickly think on what else to do... he might use his tendrils but at the same time he might use Katon..no Fuuton ..both.. if that happens I am more than fucked.< she thought to herself as she was just about ready to jump back once again in order to dodge whatever Zetsumo would throw at her.* - Sat Sep 05 02:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) points out that the training field is currently fucked up as there is water, mud and there is a segment of the field that was used as the base for a jutsu so some of it might be missing.* - Sat Sep 05 02:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) did not allow herself to become distracted by said spectacle of light as she was focused on Zetsumo. She heard his words and could not help but agree with him on certain things but there were other things she disagreed upon as it clearly showed in her face "You could have ended this before you destroyed my dragon." she told him with a shakey voice from the adrenaline running through her body "But you did not." she finished as she watched him close the distance between them with tendrills coming out of his hand.

The smirk quickly fadded as she knew now that her shadow would no longer work on him due to his tendrils being out of his body. She did not know why he could move them when she was possessing him and it was something that although she was curious about knew that there was no way anyone could answer. Watching the tendril rush toward her and sensing the chakra running through them she quickly dropped to the ground letting the tendrill pass over her  and once it was done she quickly ran foward holding down the Snake handseal focusing her chakra all around her body turning her skin visibly darker in color.

Meeting Zetsumo half way she jumped up and attempted a very basic taijutsu move but she hoped it would catch him off guard as she honestly never used taijutsu before while he was present. The jump would be converted into a kick that was aimed at his face and as this was going on she used her right hand to reach into her back pouch to pull out a Kunai with an explosive tag attached to it that from the angle of approach and the lack of Zetsumo's eye he would have a hard time either noticing the motion or knowing what she was going to pull out as she tend to keep her ninja weaponry all mixed up in her pouches.* - Sat Sep 05 02:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) Would have landed the kick on him only to feel something that was hard as rock >Shit.< she thought to herself as the next thing she knew was that her body was sending signals to her brain indicating that a large amount of pain originated from her stomatch. Of course it would take her brain some time to actually register it as she was bent foward shattering the rock hard exoskin that covered her skin and with the same force and momentum she dropped the kunai with the explosive tag at Zetsumos feet due to the punch she had received and when she bonced back she only found herself being driven away by mud as she quickly slammed against the fence.

>This hurts.< she thought to herself as the Doton chakra that was running through her skin quickly disappeared. If it had not been for Domu protecting her she would have kissed her internal organs goodbye. >I need to use it.< she thought to herself as she as she focused her chakra around her body to turn the mud into sand and began to sink into the ground as she reached once again for one of her back pouches and reached for something this time out of Zetsumos view since there was mud all around her and she was sinking into the ground.

Once underground she began to "swim." to the right as she wanted to get away from the muddied area as she had given him several jutsus he could use against her with ease. >Here goes nothing.< she thought to herself as she pulled out a blue pill and brought it to her mouth and ate it. immediately she felt the soldier pill she had bought from Hari begin to kick in as she felt more energetic than before and the pain seemed to diminished by the extra adrenaline coursing through her body. She emerged from the ground shortly after ready to dodge whatever Zetsumo would throw at her with her new found energy.* - Sat Sep 05 03:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) did I say new found energy? Well i was just joking as the Soldier pill had bolstered her defenses but had cut her stamina by 50% which left her tired. Sensing him and watching him approach her she wanted to move her body but this would not give into her commands as she was more than tired by this point thanks to the pill she took >Damn, I should have listened to the warnings.< she told herself as she quickly began to weave five handseals again.

When the water spewed out of his mouth she unleashed the jutsu as sparks began to fly off her body and began to travel toward the rushing Zetsumo but this would be a double edged sword as the water current was flowing toward her so in the end would have both ended up taking some damage due to this move so after being swept away and electrecuted by her own move she found herself being covered in more mud thanks to Zetsumos outburst of chakra >Is this really all I have?< she asked herself as her body was too tired to move >I can still make something happen.< she tired to convice herself dispite the situation looking so dire for her. She allowed her hands to touch the ground as there was mud everywhere thanks to the battle and once she did she began to channel chakra into the mud sensing Zetsumo's location and used him as the center of the cardenal rose.* - Sat Sep 05 04:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) was pretty done for a this point and when she saw him jump off the ground she knew that she had to adapt to a new strategy but her body would not allow her to do so as free as she would like, she would stop sending chakra into the ground and focused it instead all around her body which caused whatever ground she came into contact with sand which allowed her to sink as this was the only way she could avoid the incoming fire projectiles without having to move a muscle as she gambled on it just burning the ground above her and not actually blasting through because if it did then that would have been very bad for her.

Assuming that she was successful in going underground again she would remain where she was still focusing her chakra around her body so that she would be able to move ones she had rested enough or at least a slight bit.>This really turned sour.< she thought to herself as she was underground >It all started so good too.< she continued on with her train of thought as she expected Zetsumo to end the battle rather quickly at this point >I know now what I must do.< she told herself reassured as she had gathered intel on Zetsumo through this battle >He did not go all out as I am still useful to him but still there were some things I got him to do.< she continued on yet again.* - Sat Sep 05 04:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) remained underground feeling the tap that Zetsumo had done thanks to the magnetism sensing she gained through the Jutsu >Just one openening.< she told herself as she continued to rest underground >If I do not move soon he is more than capable of tearing down the whole place just to come and find me.<  this of course would not be fun for her as she knew that he had something on his mind >Just a bit longer.< she told herself as she remained underground for the next couple of minutes untill her body felt a bit less tired as for some moments she had been laying still without having to do much other than just rest.

Once she had rested enough she took in a deep breath and emerged from the ground forming five handseals that she had performed earlier Horse ----> Dog ------> Bird ------> Ox -----> Snake causing another stone dragon to form from the ground around her and sent it toward Zetsumo with the intention of blocking his sight of her with such a massive beast. As the dragon that was made out of stone soared through the distance between them she quickly held the Tiger handseal and focused her chakra on her feet and extended her shadow out toward Zetsumo using the stone dragon as cover for said action. Considering that she was not skilled in switching between jutsus like Zetsumo was the execution between the two jutsus gave a lot of room for her plan to be discovered.* - Sat Sep 05 04:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) saw as her dragon crumbled once again only this time due to Katon natured chakra that sent her flying back as the aftershock that would have normally made her stumble a bit under normal circumstances seemed to be all that more powerful thanks to her bodies exhaustion. Hitting against the fence then rebounding back she layed on the muddy field face down againt the mud breathing heavily as she had pushed her body to the limit a short one at that thanks to the Soldier pill she had decided to take "D-D-Damn.....it." she muttered over and over again as she tried to catch her breath. Even though she wanted to get up and keep fighthing there was something strangely comfortable about the mushy cold mud that was on the field that made her want to stay there for a long time.

The shadow would have been broken due to the excessive light coming from the explotion and from the fact that the handseal was broken.* - Sat Sep 05 04:51:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) reached into one of her backpouches and gives Zetsumo several scrolls "Ive already set these, just open them and lay them down. Try not to touch the inside of the pages as you will trigger it." all in all there would be five scrolls for him to place where he though would be best maybe even used them to defend the persons of interest within the village who knew?

After she had done this she would set out toward the south along with three hundred other men in order to set the traps.* - Sat Sep 05 17:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) arrived at the outskirts of Konoha along with the three hundred men that Zetsumo had sent with and did not waste any time getting to work. "Sensory shinobi spread out, doton specialist go underground and provide assistance with magnetism sensing. Suiton speciallist go to the lake Raiton provide assistance and Katon users stay near the sensory nin and make sure that nothing happens to them, do not engage the enemy as that is not our mission." After she was done giving instructions she began to work on laying down the traps along the outskirts of the village.

Kneeling down she took out a Kunai and began to dig a small enough hole to be able to burry the scroll. Having prepared several scroll before hand as she wanted to have another round at Zetsumo but she figured that the situation at hand was more important. Placing the scroll down she realized that she would take a long time setting them down so she ordered the remaining shinobi to start digging next to her in a zig-zag pattern to make the most out of the traps she was going to set as she wanted to stop hold them around for a bit.

Taking out a scroll and setting it on the ground she began to pour chakra into it 
she ordered one of the shinobi with the ability to give her chakra to being assisting with the chakra transfer as this would be a long and pain staking process since well she needed to pour enough chakra into the scroll >This is going to take too long.< she thought to herself as she began to look around and spotted several shinobi standing around "Oi you, begin opening scrolls and lay them down where holes have been dug up. Do it now." she barked as she knew that this would at least cut some time with the process of making the traps.

Exhausting nearly all of her chakra and gaining it back multiple times left her feeling a rather wierd sensation as she would feel exhausted one moment then would feel fine the next as the shinobi in charge of keeping her topped off on chakra were doing their jobs and they were doing it correctly so the process slowly went along just fine "Tell the sensory shinobi to give me a report on the situation." she barked once again as she was setting down covering the scrolls up carefully with dirt so that would would be hidden. She really made sure to hide them properly as she did not want to be clasiffied as an amateur trap maker. When she was done setting down the traps in this area she moved to the next location where she proceeded to repeat the same process as fast possible.* - Sat Sep 05 18:15:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) exited the mansion and stood before Zetsumo as she watched him do the blood sacrifice and the corresponding hand seals and watched as a gaint fuck poofed into the area. She would look at it and whistled "Wooow." she said sarcasticly as she readied her stance "No matter what size that thing may be it is still a duck." she said as she quickly glanced around the area >This is a bad place for combat.< she thought to herself as she returned her gaze toward the massive duck and Zetsumo.

"Its wings can be a problem as it does not take an expert to know that wings that big can provide massive gusts of wind." she commented as she focused her chakra on the soles of her feet just to be on the safe side since it was most than likely that the duck would try and sweep her away. Ones suimen was active on her feet she executed five handseals Horse ----> Dog ----> Bird -----> Ox ----> Snake that when finished began to lift up the ground as the head of a dragon began to form next to her as the rest of the body followed.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) continued running foward then stoped as the giant duck retreated. She would hear Zetsumo but did not bother looking at him >Tch, well sorry for not being a monster like you.< she told her self as she continued to look at the duck >Well the only way her shadow would be large enough to capture is when its about to land so that makes things unfavorable for me.< she thought to herself as she watched the duck birth three eggs. She would observe them and began back peddling as she did not trust anything in regards to that bird.

She would concentrate more and more chakra on the soles of her feet so that the suiment would propel her back as to avoid the eggs >The best thing for me to do is to meet it in the air but there are several problems with that...I do not have wings..and there is that strong air currents I am sure that thing can generate.< If Zetsumo would to be observing her facial expressions it would be clear that he could make out that all her gears were grinding. The train of thought would to be distracted when the eggs landed on the ground with enough concusive force to shatter the ground >....sneaky.< she thought to herself as she continued to back peddle with the assitance of over charged Suimen on her feet "You see this is stacked against me since that thing can fly and I am stuck here on the ground." she would tell Zetsumo as she looked up at the bird while she still held the snake handseal having the Earth and stone dragon grow larger and larger.* - Sun Sep 06 11:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) the back peddling with over chakrad Suimen would only prove to be a bad idea as she was not expecting the sudden wind gusts to pick up after the explotions so the end result would be that she would get sent back even further as the tool she used to keep her anchored to the ground would end up working against her in the end. Rolling a few times due to the wind gusts she was forced to break the Snake handseal to try and stop herself from rolling and when she stoped she was only met with the wind gust caused by the ducks wings that cut into her clothes and some of the wind blades would leave minor cuts on her skin.

>Fuck this.< she told herself as she raised her hand "I lose." she said as she slowly stood up "This was heavily against me, there is no way I can win this with my current jutsus." she told Zetsumo complaining "Wait a bit longer and I will be able to prove that ducks are lame." she finished saying as she waited for the classical Zetsumo degrading. * - Sun Sep 06 11:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) executed a single handseal and poofed away.* - Sun Sep 06 14:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) arrived at the front gate and got to work as soon as possible. Quickly she went toward the traps that where not triggered and dug them up >Well this saves up a lot of time.< she thought to herself as she placed the scrolls back into her backpouch. One by one she went digging up the unused traps and placed them back into her backpouch along with the rest of the scrolls >I will still have to make more but this is a start.< she told herself as she went back toward the gate and began to set up the holes for the scrolls and laid them down. Once that was done she procedeed toward the east and western gate and proceeded to do the same process until the village was trapped.* - Sun Sep 06 15:17:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) went to lean against the wall and chuckled "Mukade will most certainly want to kill her." she commented as she slide down the wall and sat down "Thanks." she said refering to the chakra blade comment.* - Sun Sep 06 15:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) would wave toward Suitengu to approach her then looked at Zetsumo "I thought him well, he does know how to manitulate his chakra now. I thought him all you asked me to teach him so he should be able to use elemental jutsus now." she commented and if Suitengu would to approach him she would ruffle his hair a bit.* - Sun Sep 06 15:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) stood up and looked at Zetsumo "When you are done dry humping the bitch make sure to teach Suitengu something, I've done my part with him now its your turn." she would tell him as she motioned for Zenaki to follow her.* - Sun Sep 06 16:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) would begin heading out of the mansion hoping Zenaki would follow.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) entered the tea place and sat down.* - Sun Sep 06 16:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) ruffled his hair possibly for the last time and headed toward the mansion.* - Sun Sep 06 20:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) activates suimen to stay on the bird.* - Sun Sep 06 20:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) got off the duck and set her focusing abilities on those around her just in case. She would look around the battlefield then saw as the creatures that beloged to Zetsumo dropped down onto the field >Well what do we do now?< she asked herself as she was not given a clear objective >Even death can't stop me, and if it surprices me then I welcome it.< she told herself as she prepared a five hand seals Horse ----> Dog -----> Bird -----> Ox -----> Snake and a massive dragon made out of stone formed around her with intention of crashing into the nearest group of enemy shinobi.

The mask that was assigned to her presumably would follow suit with an attack of it own sending out a powerful stream of water that followed after the crashing dragon that was travelling along the battlefield. This action would ensure that the ground that had been attacked became muddy as the ground absorbed the water from the attack.* - Sun Sep 06 21:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Osamu(Assassin241) whispers: (I hear a wild Katsune whispering) - Sun Sep 06 21:25:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Let's not forget that we 'can' climb trees. I don't wanna see everyone letting themselves get cornered. - Sun Sep 06 21:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) was followind under Darja and Zetsumo at a slower pace since she was on foot so she would arrive much later to the battle. Being no amateur she kept her sensing abilities focused on the area around her and noticed that something was not right as she was getting a lot of the same chakra signatures and she would call it out "Something is not right there are alot of the same chakra signatures." she would inform the shinobi that were close to her >Well that is a huge drag< she told herself as she spotted Sunagakure shinobi Visually and executed five handseals Horse ----> Dog ----> Bird ---> Ox ---Snake and a massive dragon made out of stone began to form and head toward the formation of Sunagakure shinobi.

Anyone above ground and bellow ground would be at equal risk since it was a formidable dragon made out of stone. It did not target anyone in particular as it just seeked to cause havok among the ranks by divinding them or getting their attention drawn toward dodging the huge beast. Meanwhile the Water mask that was following behind her would shot out a massive stream of water to further increase the confusion among the Sunagakure ranks making the field muddy since the ground would absorb the water.* - Sun Sep 06 22:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Any thoughts on the situation, Kitora? Honestly I'm kinda bored, considering how safe we are right now with Zetsumo's masks. - Sun Sep 06 22:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I'm trying to find a way to do something and end this as fast as possible, but charging in by myself would be beyond stupid. - Sun Sep 06 22:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Enemy's playing defense and I'm not good at taking out massess. More of a one-on-one kind of person. - Sun Sep 06 22:52:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Gonna have to get Zetsumo to teach me that big earth technique later. - Sun Sep 06 22:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: Which one? - Sun Sep 06 22:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: The one that traps people. - Sun Sep 06 22:57:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I'd start shooting lightning balls but mine aren't the fastest. I usually sprint up to the enemy before using it to make up for that. - Sun Sep 06 22:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: See, I'm like...a duelist. - Sun Sep 06 22:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: No good in crowded situations unless I can get my hands on an officer. - Sun Sep 06 22:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: And yeah that'd be nice. - Sun Sep 06 22:58:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Right now I'm just planning on backing someone up if they need it. - Sun Sep 06 22:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Only smart thing to do. - Sun Sep 06 22:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) ||The Earth and Stone dragon continues to travel along the battle field gaing more and more mass as it travels. Since its purpose is to cause as much havok as possible and creat as much destruction as well it would seek out the nearest target which would have been the Raikage himself and anyone near that area so in all it would cause lot of destruction to the general area as it came crashing down in all his majestic glory. Anyone caught in its path would most likely be fucked unless they could somehow and by the grace of whatever god they believed in dodged the beast. 

Adding to this came the powerful water jutsu used by the Water mask that went along and proeeded after the Earth and Stone dragon sweeping anything in its aftermath. All in all whoever could not dodge was more than fucked.

Releasing the Snake handseal as the dragon was no more she quickly did another set of five handseals Boar ---> Ram ---> Snake ---> Horse ---> Dragon which caused her whole body to spark up with electricity that she sent foward toward the Sunagakure formation. Keeping in mind that the ground had just been freshly covered with water the speed at which the electric wave would travel would be that much faster providing a nice shock to who ever was drenched in water probably numbing their body damaging their nerves and nerve endings.* - Sun Sep 06 23:10:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: If the Raikage survives we will be at a disadvantage. - Sun Sep 06 23:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I'm not sure what you're suggesting but I'm ready. If the raikage's a problem maybe we should back up a mask. - Sun Sep 06 23:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: The one he's fighting. - Sun Sep 06 23:14:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: If we let this fight go on for too long, we'll be looking at a battle where we don't have Zetsumo as a shield. - Sun Sep 06 23:32:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) whispers: My body is poison...My weapons are poison..Maybe a mist of poison will help?.. - Sun Sep 06 23:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) Watched as someone approached the mess that was the area where the Raikage was, she would watch as the men would begin to carry the injured shinobi in an attempt to get him out of the battlefield but she was having none of it as she executed three hand seals Ram ---> Horse ----> Dragon and sent her chakra traveling toward the nearest mud source and executed her jutsu. In an instant the mud began to rise and form into the head of yet another dragon only this time it would not leave the ground as it just opened its mouth and began to fire a barage of bullets at the shinobi that intended to carry the Raikage out o the battlefield.

Since they had to carry him out and the field was muddy movement would become a hard thing to do as well mud is mud and mud is a dick and with the added weight of someone if would most likely work against them and with all of that taken into account dodging the stream of mud bullets headed toward the group of shonibi.

On the other hand when the ground began to cave in she began to lose her balance which caused her to release the handseal causing her Dragon shooting mud bullets at the group of Shinobi to stop and banished. The water mask by her side would quickly grab her and hoped back with her to stop her from falling in and would also shoot out a stream of water to counter the incoming Katon jutsus.* - Sun Sep 06 23:52:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: This situation is killing me. Can't let my guard down to relax. Can't take out my frustrations on the enemy either. - Mon Sep 07 00:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: Someone is bound to come. - Mon Sep 07 00:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: After all this -- I'm ready for it. Killing Kuro. - Mon Sep 07 00:03:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: It is almost time for you to spring into action. - Mon Sep 07 00:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Is it? - Mon Sep 07 00:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: Yes. - Mon Sep 07 00:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: Someone just entered my sensing range. - Mon Sep 07 00:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Point them out to me., - Mon Sep 07 00:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Their direction. I'll see them if they're trying to use shadows. - Mon Sep 07 00:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) whispers: Where?..My sensing is not as great.. - Mon Sep 07 00:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: East by the trees. - Mon Sep 07 00:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: (need to wait for kuro to reply to Kat's test lightning ball) - Mon Sep 07 00:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) Would be set down by the Water mask and focused on her sensing abilities, she could tell that most of the chakra signatures had dropped which allowed her to distinguish more individual signatures. With that being said she noticed somene very close to them and would point it out to Katsune who was neares to her "Enemy north east of you, by the trees." she would let her know when something else caught her attention as she saw a niggah clocking in on their asses which caused her to become uneasy with the situation.

When Orakuru approached them she would quickly focus her sensing on him but still maintained situational awareness so she would not lose the other enemy that was creeping in on them >Shit.< she thought to herself as she decided on what to do with the situation. When she decided she quickly dropped to a knee and held the Rat handseal as she began to focus her chakra on the soles of her feet which was then transfered to her shadow and this extended foward with the intent of capturing Orakuru where he stood. "Katsune get Kuru!" she yelled out in a panicked state as she knew that they would have a good time with him being there. Unless Orakuru was paying attention to the floor or had gotten sensing abilities or was specifically staring at the floor amidst all this chaos his chances of dodging the incoming shadow where very slim.

The Water mask that was literally behind her would spring into action releasing a stream of water pasing just above her head with the intention of detering him from attacking. Meanwhile the wind mask would quickly move to provide support to the trio as the Wind mask had just been standing there circle jerking doing nothing so it had to do something right? The Wind mask approached with an intention of like the Water mask detering Orakuru from attacking but did not use any jutsus as that would cause some friendly fire.* - Mon Sep 07 00:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) was too late to really do much against Orakuru's approach but she reacted a slight bit toward the attack but that would not have been enough to save her from the slash. She would feel as the tip of the blade would cut through her mask and into her skin leaving a nice cut on her skull as well as it continued to travel down her face she would lose vision on her left eye as the blade continued to travel along her face. While this was going on Yuan who had crept up on the opposite side brought down his blade which would promptly lob off her right arm that flew up in the air and sprayed blood every where. Do to the montion she had started when attempting to dodge Orakurus strike she would end up slamming against the floor.

While all of this was going her body began to feel pain greater to that of any torture that Mukade or Zetsumo had done as that was childs play compared to this as this had managed to slash her face taking out her eye and leaving a nice opened gash along where the cut took place  and ontop of that she had lost an arm. For a breif moment she would let out a harrowing scream before the pain overwelmed her and caused her to pass out. If left there unattended she would most certainly die due to blood loss thanks to the wounds she had just reciebed by the two enemy shinobi.

\\The water mask would stop the water stream as it has proved to be useless for the situation and instead moved to tackle Yuan and if successfull would begin a good old fashioned ground and pound, The Wind mask attempt to do that exact same thing to Orakuru now that his back was turned to it.* - Mon Sep 07 01:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) would be laying there on the ground passed out from the pain overload that her body had been put through. Even as Zetsumo managed to reattach her arm there was still that gash on her face that they had to worry about but that seemed to be taken care of by Yumiko. After some time of laying and visibly laying down in a puddle of her own blood she regained conciousness but only saw through her right eye as her left eye had been cut by Orakuru. She would look pale and rather frail from al the blood loss. She would try her best to look around lifting her head up as best she could but with one eye she could have only seen so much, however she could see Zetsumo reattaching her left arm and she began to cry "I-I..I-I'm sorry." she would tell him as tears ran down her cheek "I'm sorry." she repeated over and over again each time with a weaker voice.

Something inside of her would let her know that it was her time to go and this would be shown in her face as her facial expression became that of fear "I'm cold...don't leave me...Suitengu!" she would begin to cry out as there was so many things she wanted to say but had very little time to do so "I-I'm sorry..Zetsu...don't..let...me go" she would tell him as the tears continued to roll down her cheek  as she reached over with her other arm toward Zetsumo grabing onto his shoulder asuming that Zetsumo would hold her in his arms. Looking into his one eye with her only eye "I..I...I-I..am..glad I got to have...yo-" she would begin coughing as it became difficult for her to breathe "Don't let me go! Don't let me go!" she would say between coughs "Don't let me-" Her eye would go dark as her as her face gained a neautral expression and the grip on his shoulder would get weaker and weaker untill her hand had dropped to the ground. The life of the Nara that began her journey with Kenryoku five to six years ago came to an end amidst her fellow mercenaries and in the arms of someone even though she budded heads with alot was important to her as he was the father to her one and only child.* - Mon Sep 07 03:29:42 2015
