<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) turned, looking over her shoulder at the boy who was leaving. "You can stay and train too. You never know when you might need some good Taijutsu." she said with a koi little smile. Turning back towards the other red headed girl, she put both of her hands out in front of her modest chest. Taking in a deep breath before quickly releasing it. She pushed off the ground rushing over towards the girl attempting to thrust her palm at her shoulder, to push her off guard, possibly off balance if connected. Her strike would be absolutely silent, her leg movements muffled by the sand she ran on.* - Sun Nov  8 03:23:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) would try to push off the sand, to move to the girls side, but she wasn't quick enough in her reactiong causing the girl's punch to instead strike her right arm. She would wince slightly, shouting *AHhh!* in her mind as she stumbled slightly, her entire arm feeling a sting of pain. 

She would then continue to run, stabalizing herself as she did so, aiming to come at the girl's side. Her arm still hurt, causing her to use her specialty, her legs. She would have been running in a near blur if the opponent didn't have a good focus of her senses. Her left leg would rise, attempting to knee the girl in the side of her stomach,  just above the hip bone where it would be less durable then striking at the hip. If successful, it would probably toss the girl off balance.* - Sun Nov  8 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: . . . . - Sun Nov  8 03:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) watched the girl fall, realizing it was time to pounce. As the girl fell to the ground, Aoi wasted no time to take action, quickly disappearing from her location towards the girl. *She's still on the ground* she thought noticing the girl had noticed someone else.  This disappearance of space would more than likely happen as she thought about her father.

She would appear behind the girl, her knee raised up to her waistline. She would attempt to dig her knee between the girl's shoulder blades in an attempt to stun her and more than likely causing her to clock out from the strike. If successful, Aoi would hop back a few spaces before taking in a few quick breaths.

If Aoi wasn't fast enough to rush over towards the girl before she had already ran away, they would eventually just end up on opposite sides without any damage to the two.* - Sun Nov  8 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: . . . . . . - Sun Nov  8 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) watched the girl rush towards her, expecting some form of punch like before.She raised both arms, crossing them to allow her forearms to make an 'X' shape, but slanted to cover a more vertical area, to block what she thought would be a single punch. That's when she felt a foot strike her hand, a sting being felt momentarily as another kick connected near her elbow causing another sting to spread along her arms. Her body would slide back with each kick, the sand acting like a buffer to stop excessive knockback. *That's enough...* she thought as she finished sliding.

Aoi would lower her arms, noticing the girl barely landing onto the sand. Her feet pushed off the ground, immediately speeding towards the girl before stepping off the sand, her knee raised as needed. She would attempt to strike the girl directly in the gut, if successful she would more than likely be lifted into the air from the force used. The moment she was in the air, Aoi would perform a horizontal kick, by swinging her left leg out enough to produce a good enough speed in an attempt to smack the girl on the side of her ribs launching her towards the rock wall. All the while, her strikes made no noise, her complimenting speed making it even more difficult to process. Once done, Aoi would turn to face the girl, panting slightly, both arms showing noticeable markings.* - Sun Nov  8 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) would fall to her knees, their caps digging into the sand. She panted more quickly than before. Sweat visible on her skin as her arms stung from the pain, almost having a sensation as if they were numb or just plain sore. "I...I think...That's enough.." she said between pants. She didn't want to go further in case of serious injuries, although...the girl -was- just launched into a rock wall.....* - Sun Nov  8 04:02:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) was somewhat interested in the spar, but was focused on training her body. She leaned forward, allowing her body to fall to the ground, her hands catching her fall by acting as buffers between them. She would slowly allow her body to be lifted, her overall weight making it rather easy for this to happen. She pushed her body off the ground once, holding the position for a few seconds, holding it as long as she could.

Her abdomen and overall body tightened slightly, as she lowered herself back down to the ground, her nose almost digging into the sand. The heat of the sand warming her nose without even touching it. Holding this position for a few second as well just to keep the rythem of her movements. *What was that....ugh...One?* she thought counting a single regulation push-up. *Only a few hundred more....* she thought once more, going back up again.

She spent most of the time that this spar was taking doing these push ups. Allowing herself to hold each position, allowing her body to tighten with each hold and a deep breath being taken. She was able to perform a few dozen, even twenty, without a single bead of sweat forming on her body. It was a simple exercise to her, but it was still a good one.* - Sun Nov  8 07:24:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) made her way into the confined spaces of the sandy training field, or at least she assumed it was a training field. Her ninja shoes crunching against the sand with each step as she prepared herself, body and mind. Upon reaching her desired location, she would begin to perform a few stretches to loosen up her body. leaning back, arms raised to the air as she tried to pull the muscles in her arms as well as those in her back; the tensing up meant it was working.

She lowered her arms, this time reaching down to the ground, trying her hardest to touch the sand beneath her. She was usually unable to touch the ground, her body not as flexible as it could be; easily confirmed by the fact that she couldn't reach the sand this time. Her hands fell short, only managing to barely graze her toes, her back and arm muscles feeling the pull as she nearly forced herself to go further. *Dang...I can't do it this time either...one of these days...* she thought, returning to an upright position.

Aoi took in a few quick breaths before twisting her body to every which way. She started by turning her upperbody to the right without moving her legs and overall position. Her feet would point north while her upperbody twisted and turned towards the East. An audible crack could be heard from this twist, her back cracking from this stretch.

Aoi performed this task once more, this time twisting her upperbody to look West. Doing so produced a barely audible crack, her back muscles feeling the pull of the movements. Holding it in place for just a few seconds caused a slight aching sensation to run through her body causing her to quickly return to her normal positioning. "That was weird..." she muttered, unsure if others were around to hear her.

As she stood there, determining her next course of action, she thought of what the others could do, their speed and capabilities. She would begin her next phase of her exercise regime, allowing all limbs to go limp to each side. With a quick mental countdown starting from three, she would hop, while she increased the space between her feet, allowing her arms to raise up. She was performing jumping jacks it seemed, her figure performing the technique a couple dozen times before stopping to take  a small break.

After Aoi's slight breather, she would go back to performing her jumping jacks. Her modest figure and chest going through the motions of rising and falling, barely affecting her ability to perform physical activities. Her arms and legs extended out from her body in a very professional manner; her movements and appearance almost identical to a diagram in an exercise textbook or movie. Her formed seemed nearly flawless as her feet stamped into the sand with each rep she finished.

After performing about one hundered jumping jacks, I mean, who was really counting? She would immediately fall forward allowing her body to fall towards the sand. Her hands and arms seemed almost prepared, extending outwards in an attempt to stop her fall from happening. Her hands would sink into the sand, devoired by the grains of heat that seemed to be present in all of the village. In this position, her toes would dig into the sand, placing herself in a push-up position, a quick transition from the jumping jack form.

As her face remained a few centimeters from the sand, she would begin to push off the sandy ground, allowing her body to raise to the point where her arms couldn't extend any further without locking her elbows. This meant she would then have to lower her body back down. Her arms could feel the slight tension caused by trying to push her own weight; although there wasn't much to weigh her down in the first place. She didn't seem to tire because of this, allowing her to perform several push-ups with ease and without faultering. Each push-up she did, she could picture herself saving an orphans from a burning building; anything that made her the hero of the story.

she continued to perform push-ups, the palms of her hands aching from the grains of sand embedding themselves into her skin. It hurt, and constantly hurt with each push she made. *Dang...This isn't good...I don't think I can do push-ups on this sandy field...* she thought as she allowed her body to finally touch the sand; her hands and feet still in the push up position. With one foul push, she tossed herself off the ground, allowing herself to stand up for a brief moment before her body fell back. She curled herself a little allowing her body to take the fall; landing in what she calls the situp position.

In this position, she would dig her feet into the sand, using those as a way to keep her feet anchored somewhere. Her hands would quickly clap away the lingering sand she carried before placing themselves behind the nape of her neck.  "Alright...Lets do this.." she muttered, lifting her upperbody off the warm ground. Her abs compressing themselves as her chin met with her knees. She was able to do this a few more times before quickly remembering she had left the stove on at her home. Eyes widening with fear, she lifted herself off from the ground and rushed home to see if her house was still standing. "No no no no no" she would repeat over and over as she left the training field and went onwards to the Sunagakure residency.* - Wed Nov 11 18:03:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) had continued to walk, unaware that Yan had been swooping past her. Her rather fit and toned rear-end would be eyed before he drifted off towards the bench. She had continued to walk of course, her body fluidly approaching Hassan.


She respectfully bowed once she got close to him. "Kazekage Hassan....Hi...Nice weather we're having...right?" she asked internally facepalming at the thought that she was actualy asking or rather talking about the weather.
