<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Did you guys find anything else about the woman we are searching for? - Sun Nov 15 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Have you questioned the red head? Who drags a body to show it to people? Wouldn't you bring the people to the body? She likely contaminated it a great amount in doing that. - Sun Nov 15 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: It was a male that found it I thought? - Sun Nov 15 03:01:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: I could pick it up with -that- but It would creep people out - Sun Nov 15 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: So Kuro isn't a police officer yet this Aoi girl thought that she would listen to him and I didn't have the authority to know who told her to stand here. - Sun Nov 15 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Annoying. - Sun Nov 15 03:08:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I see, you probably won't be allowed to do that until after the murderer is caught though. - Sun Nov 15 03:14:59 2015
