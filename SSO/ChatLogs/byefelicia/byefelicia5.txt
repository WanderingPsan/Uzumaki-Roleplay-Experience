<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) cleared her throat, making her way into the walled in training field.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) made her way towards the cactus, her legs coated in durable layers of armor to prevent any damage to her body while training. She measured her distance as well as the structure of the cactus at hand. Her body quickly lowered itself down to the floor before her leg swept outwards. Her left leg would ram against the the trunk of the plant quickly slicing it down. It required almost no energy for her to perfom and the process was clean. "Good."* - Wed Nov 25 07:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) 's vision had been focused on the plant before her, that is until some dark figure appeared from the broken down plant. "Huh?" she questioned, stepping a few paces back. "What's that." she said, her emerald eyes piercing through the shadowy figure. When two more seemed to appear, spreading across her vision, she knew it was time to act.

*They're going to try and harm me...* she thought, not wanting to force herself onto other, but would do so if need be. She rushed up to the first one giving it a quick left jab in an attempt to push it back before bringing her left up and outwards, in an attempt to strike the one on her left side. As he leg returned to position, she would bring her right arm out in a back swing attempting to backhand the shadowy figure on her right. 

If all else failed, she would attempt at dropping her body low before performing a 360-degree turn along the earthen terrain, her right leg sticking out as it was done. If successfully, she would successfully knock down the shadowy figures that is, if they could even be knocked down. With that, she would push off the ground, sprining upwards before throwing herself back. She would perform a single backhand spring before landing safely on the ground. "Who are you why are you here?"* - Wed Nov 25 07:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) whispers: I've never did it with another woman, but I'm sure it'll be fun.~ -omit- - Wed Nov 25 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) watched the figures multiply in place. *What...how..!* she shouted in her mind as she stepped back, her back resting against the rock. Suddenly they disappeared after having heard the voice of an unknown female. Turning towards her, her brows would furrow. "Do you think this is funny?" she asked, brining her arm and hand in, attempting to bitch slap her.* - Wed Nov 25 08:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) 's eyes perked up slightly. "Oh...Ugh....R-right..." she said looking down at the ground a bit. "Who...Who are you?" she asked unsure of who she really was.* - Wed Nov 25 08:11:05 2015
