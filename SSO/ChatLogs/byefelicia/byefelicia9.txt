<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) Entered the fitness room located inside the school of Suna. It wasn't the most expensive or glamorous room in the building, but it was suffiecient. As she approached a dummy filled to the brim with sand a leaves stood tall, front and center. Taking this to be the schools punching dummy or something of the sort, Aoi took quickly to it, putting in a few good punches to start off her training.

As she continued to lunge and jab, the force of each blow controlled and precise. The dummy, who she pictured to be Geo Dude, mainly because of his rather astute personality, moved back and forth ryhtmically. This was a display of her ability to form accurate strikes at a constant pace, attributed to her high stamina. This dummy seemed to be gaining all forms of strikes.

Her positioning and stance seemed to remain true, unfaultering with every strike she landed. She made sure her hands were clenched properly to avoid any negative effects to her hands and or knuckles. Her hands were unbandaged, mainly because she wanted to practice fighting in a more realistic view point, regardless if she was training on a dummy. In the real world, she wouldn't have boxing gloves or bandages one hundred percent of the time.

Wanting to get in a few moments of training for her mach punch, she would accelerate her movements as needed. As she got faster, her strikes got even stronger causing the dummy to stagger from its mounted position. The dummy itself was a sack of sand and leaves with sewn on details like a face and muscles. It was a poor representation of a human being, but her punches remained true and on vital points.

Once she was at optimal speeds, she let loose on her target. Her arms zipped through the air between herself and the dummy causing slight booms of sound from her hands reaching extremely fast speeds. Each mach punch she landed on the dummy caused its base to slide a bit. The base being a large chunk of iron which tethered it to the wooden floor. Because the strikes were pushing it back against the wooden boards of the training room, a slight screech would be made with each punch.

Aoi paid no mind to the sound, her eyes and thoughts focused on exceeding her masters expectation. Her box strikes continued to pummel the dummy, each strike hitting a different point on its body. Her eyes seemed to never blink, as she eyed each strike with care making sure she didn't hit hard enough for the dummy to suddenly explode."I will succeed. I will become a boxer." she chanted with each strike.

At this moment, Aoi's punches and hooks began to decrease in speed. She didn't want to focus on just quick and almost powerless strikes. She wanted her boxing strikes to be heavier than normal punches, heavier in that they do more physical damage than just being fast. As her strikes grew closer to a halt, she began to formulate a new strategy.

After stopping for a brief moment, Aoi would stand there, gazing at her enemy before her. She would pull back her arm, cocking it as if readying a powerful strike. This was true, being that she was attempting to perform powerful, individual strikes. She took in a deep breath, concentrating on making her strike connect. Visualizing in her mind's eye, she would position herself at the ready.

Boom! She released her strike, throwing her arm and hand with all her might. The dummy for a brief moment felt as if it came to life and screamed in horror as it watched its life flash before its lifeless eyes. The punch connected, Aoi's body almost toppling over with the strike, due to her momentum. This was also supplemented by her shoes slightly slipping from unacustomed techniques.

With her power punch, the bag slid significantly further this time than when she was performing quick strikes. The screech was also that much louder, this time causing her to wince slightly from the annoyance. "Wow..." she muttered in awe as she shook her hand slightly to indicate that her hand hurt lightly, even if it was a total lie.
10

She went over towards the dummy, grabbed it firmly with both hands and dragged it back to its original position. This was because the bunching bag or dummy, was now almost leaning against the far wall. As she set it back in place, she performed a few light jabs and overhead strikes to warm up for her next power punch. She had a growing excitement for this upcomming strike.

Again, she let her body go slightly limp. This was to releave herself from tension and stress created from anticipation. As her arms drooped over the sides of her body, her right hand readied itself, clenching appropriately.She took a step back, as if giving herself enough room to charge at her target. lifting her arm, bending it at the elbow; she was ready. She was ready to unleash another strike.

KAPOOW! Her strike was unleashed. The force and speed was similar to that of a Cobra or Viper unleashing its devastating strike upon its enemy. The force of her punch audible to those who were in the building, rooms away even....possibly...don't quote me on that. Her concentrated hook seemed to leave the dummy in shambles, the portion with its head taking heavy damage. The neck of the sack was torn, sand and leaves spewing out with ill intent.

Aoi playfully pulled up her clenched fist, positioning it close to her mouth. With persed lips, she blew as if her hand had caught fire from her strike. Having had enough playing around, she rushed at the dissatisfactory dummy, and began to perform a few comboed strikes and jabs, each one causing more and more sand and leaves to pour out. She even broke from her boxing stance to land a few well deserved kicks.

The floor in close proximity to the dummy was decorated with sand. The dummy itself looked deflated, Aoi its victor. Performing several quick gut punches, the alst of the sand flooded the ground. This was due to the heavy and rapid punches that tore open the final seams located near the dummies stomach. "This should surely impress Kanami......Surely." she happily agreed, finishing her damned training sessions.
