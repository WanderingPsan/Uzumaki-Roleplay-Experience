<br><font color=yellow>*Rachetta, DeyQuanda(ByeFelicia) had been eating her enourmous plate of fried chicken and corn bread. "MMmmm This shit gooood." she explaimed, sucking on each individual finger. * - Fri Nov  6 05:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rachetta, DeyQuanda(ByeFelicia) reached up to pull off her head scarf, the fabric unwinding with a single tug. Out popped her nappy, untended afro; it's black fibery texture giving it a rather abnormal depth to it. She had forgotten to wear a bald cap and weave meaning she had to sport this undesireable style. 

"Ooooh Boy, Better gimme some mort sauce for this chicken Mmmmm" she muttered, giving a single, rather loud, burp uncaring who heard. She gave a quick look around before sticking a drum stick into her hair to eat later. 

"Scuuuuse me, I need 'nother round of yuse fried chicken right her'.  " she commanded, pointing at her empty dish.* - Fri Nov  6 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rachetta, DeyQuanda(ByeFelicia) had walked out of the inn, seeing as how the owner refused to let her have a room. She didn't care, she was thug like that. Upon exiting the building, she took a sharp turn to the right, having never been to these parts of the village. A noticeably blue haired girl would be there, causing her to bring her mass over to her. "Gurrll You kno' yer hair blue, rite?" she asked trying to pat down her afro. *This heat makin my hurrr bad.* she would think.* - Fri Nov  6 07:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rachetta, DeyQuanda(ByeFelicia) opened her mouth a little bit, making a singular click with her tongue. "Okay boo, jus' askin for yuse go out 'n public." she stated, sticking her hand into her afro, immediately cossing it to disappear within her fibery hair. "Yuse hungry?"* - Fri Nov  6 07:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rachetta, DeyQuanda(ByeFelicia) would clench her left hand into a fist before raising it above her bust. Giving her chest two good taps with her still clenched hand, she gave a three nods. "I Got yuse boo." she said, pulling out what seemed to be a single, fried drum stick. "This was from my dinna', Yuse can have it okay." she stated, offering up the fried chicken, her left hand released of its clenched duties before resting at her side. The hand that seemed to willingly offer the chicken was decorated in rather excessively long nails that were painted a crisp green.* - Fri Nov  6 07:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rachetta, DeyQuanda(ByeFelicia) gave a wide smile, her pearly white teeth almost glowing in contrast to her flesh tone. " Yuse aight, honey." she said, shoving her right arm behind her back, using the rather long nails to ease the itch she carried. "Watcha doin' out her ?"* - Fri Nov  6 07:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rachetta, DeyQuanda(ByeFelicia) would simply hum, "Mmmmhmmm....," looking the girl up and down. "Whatcha trainin', hmmm?" she asked rather interested.* - Fri Nov  6 08:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Um...My n-nails. - Fri Nov  6 08:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rachetta, DeyQuanda(ByeFelicia) says: Nails? Gurrlll...Like mine? - Fri Nov  6 08:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rachetta, DeyQuanda(ByeFelicia) as she said that, her already long nails grew a few more inches, their crisp green color turning a slighter glossy color. Her eyes immediately turning into a feline-like appearance. A tail would be sprouted from her lower back, although this feature would be stuck beneath her layers of clothing. Her ears would turn into noticeable cat ears. "Meoooww honey."* - Fri Nov  6 08:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rachetta, DeyQuanda(ByeFelicia) shook her head slightly, causing her own afro to move with the motions. "Lookie." she muttered gliding her mass across the dirt, heading towards a nearby rock structure. With a single swipe, her nails dug through the rock without a single crack or loss in the integrity of her claws. " You like? Pft, My nails be gewd, of course yuse like." she said, showing off her finger nails to the girl.* - Fri Nov  6 08:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rachetta, DeyQuanda(ByeFelicia) smirked. "Course yuse do honey." she said, using her rather long nails to scratch at her meaty arm. A small trickle of blood began to run down her ashy elbow before her right hand wiped most of the blood off. Forming a few handseals, she placed her hand on the ground causing a puff of smoke to be produced. As it cleared, a single cat could be seen. It was all black with a single white tuff of fur around its left eye. "This is Buttered Toast. She my homie."* - Fri Nov  6 08:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rachetta, DeyQuanda(ByeFelicia) gave one quick cackle. "Honey, please. I can dues that summon type jutsu, you knows." she said looking at Buttered Toast. "Yuse wanna pet 'er? She like dat." she offered, pushing the cat towards Mai's direction with her foot.* - Fri Nov  6 08:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rachetta, DeyQuanda(ByeFelicia) says: Yea gurl, I can make cats appear an' stuff. Like, they just appear yuse kno'...I don't kno' where theyse come from but theyse due. - Fri Nov  6 08:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Oh... - Fri Nov  6 08:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: C-Can you...teach me that? - Fri Nov  6 08:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rachetta, DeyQuanda(ByeFelicia) says: Ugh, sure why not. - Fri Nov  6 08:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rachetta, DeyQuanda(ByeFelicia) allowed all the feline features on her person to disappear, merging back into her body. "Okay so, all you gotta do is like get some of your blood because da animuls like that stuff. Den yuse form these handseals, " she said as she demonstrated the handseals necessary. 

"Then you just use yer chakra to summon the cat." she finished, before placing both hands on her hips. "Now like, before yuse do that. You gotta sign some paper for dem to like, accept you 'n stuff."

At that moment, Buttered Toast would begin to cough and hack as if it was choking. After three coughs, it coughed out a rather large furball-looking object.  DeyQuanda bent over, a disgusted look on her face, as she used her long nails to pick up the ball her cat had yakked up. Unravelling the object, it would eventually look and be revealed to be a contract.

"Okay so, to sign it you gotta use yer blood 'n stuff. Like Finger print that."* - Fri Nov  6 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rachetta, DeyQuanda(ByeFelicia) says: Gurl, yuse a natural. - Fri Nov  6 08:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: T-Thank you. - Fri Nov  6 08:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rachetta, DeyQuanda(ByeFelicia) used her excessive nails to prick at her finger this time, allowing more blood to trail down her figure. "I've been trying to summona  giant cat, watch this." she stated confidently as she formed the handseals. She slammed both hands onto the ground, exuding a large amount of chakra to try and summon this supposedly furrocious feline.

"Summoning Jutsu: King Kitty PoPo!" she shouted before a large puff of smoke errupted from her hand's position. This large amounts of smoke lingered for a while before eventually clearing. Once cleared, it would reveal a collapsed figure; DeyQuanda, motionless and without life. The amount of chakra she had wasn't enough to perform the summoning technique, the taxxing amount costing her her own life. At least she had been able to pass down her technique before suffering this tragic incident.* - Fri Nov  6 08:46:30 2015
