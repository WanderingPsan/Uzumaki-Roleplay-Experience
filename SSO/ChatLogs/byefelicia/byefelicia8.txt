<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) Once she had stepped back far enough, she cocked her right arm significantly. Her feet sunk into the sandy ground below for only a moment before her foot pushed off with all her might. Her right arm zoomed through the air, the sound barrier cracking ever so slightly. Her right hand struck the sandbag, a ripple of force bursting forth from the impact. The sandbag would have been tossed a few feet back, crashing into the neighboring rock. She was huffing and puffing, finally feeling the effect of continuous stamina drain. 

Desiring more of a challenge, something that wasn't stationary to be exact, she went deeper into the village until she met a willing shinobi. After introductions were met, they found themselves in a quick brawl of sorts. The man ran at her, fists at the ready as he attempted to strike her with a single blow. Dipping under his attack, she swung her right arm in a hook, colliding with his cheek. As she felt her hand strike his face, she would push up, swinging her left arm at him as well. Both attacks connected knocking the man back, his hands rubbing the sides of his face.

Aoi wasn't going to waste time, she pushed off the ground as she rushed towards his current position. Allowing her body to flow with the man's movements, she released a series of quick jabs that struck the man directly in the chest. The force was decent, but the positioning made the made quickly collapse to his knees. To finish him off, she would perform an overhead strike, making contact with the side of his head; knocking him to the ground out cold. "Thanks for the fight mister." she said thankfully before walking away.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) continued to follow kinami, her speed greatly overshadowing Aoi's, at least that was how it appeared to her. Aoi had a problem with self-esteem, quickly causing her mind to wander as she approached the gates. *What if she doesn't like me...what if she doesn't want anything to do with me..* she thought, quickly stopping at the gates. The entrance rather narrow, difficult to miss anyone or anything that seemed to head into the village. (1)

If Kinami were to look at Aoi's body, she would notice a rather thin frame, with even smaller breasts, sized at Double A-cups. Her clothing was nothing special, basic garbs and the like. "I...Well..." she began to stumble with her words. "I..I needed a strong female rolemodel." (2)

Feeling a little bit more comfortable being around Kinami, Aoi would begin to shadow box, performing a few quick jabs that cut through the air. Her arms would swing here and there before stopping. "I also liked how you knocked Momura out cold...It was funny." (3)* - Fri Dec 11 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) had continued to punch the air, as if this poor display of boxing would in some manner impress Kinami. Her jabs were rather slow, her hooks disatisfactory. As she turned her body to face Kinami, a rather massive force seemed to head her way. Leaping out of the way, her body crashed onto the earthen floor, the shell would more than likely crash onto the floor beside her, shaking her very core. *What did she just throw!* she internally shouted. (4)

Slowly raising to her feet, she took the time to dust off whatever dirt had clung to her body and clothes. "Is...Is that...a weight?" she asked reaching towards, struggling to even pick it up. With her rather sub-par strength she would try to wrestle the shell onto her back. (5)

Her body immediately seemed several times heavier, struggling to even stand. She immediately went into a push-up position, the force that seemed to weigh her down made it almost impossible. Her arms seemed to remain at a bend, her scrawny frame unable to lift the shell. (6)

"How...How did you even...c-carry..th-this..." she stuttered, almost unable to get the words out of her mouth. It seemed impossible to do this task, unable to perform the desired push-ups. She released her position, allowing her body to crash quickly onto the surface of the ground. The shell pinning her onto the dirt. "Ughhh...." (7)* - Fri Dec 11 06:29:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) moved her body around, eventually using that momentum to swing herself up from the ground. "Ughhh.." she groaned once more, the weight putting a damper on her mobility. While standing now, she would begin to again practice her boxing technique, performing her usual jabs and strikes while holding her ground. The weight that seemed to cling to her back made each swing and jab slower and heavier causing her to tire much faster. (8)

Her body continued to tire out, each jab causing more and more strain on her person. "This...This is so heavy.." She muttered, trying to keep her balance and boxing position; maintaining the shell balanced on her back. Attempting to deliver a few kicks, almost falling in the process would cause her to stick to punching. (9)

Aoi paused for a moment, catching her breath. She had never done this sort of training, the shell restricting much if not all of her movement. Even though she struggled to stand, she would push on, punching, jabbing, and weaving in place, her form was surely improving at this point, almost reaching professional levels. "Did..Did you see the Raikage?" she asked Kinami. (10)* - Fri Dec 11 06:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: *sighed with relief..* Thank you. - Fri Dec 11 07:01:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: No, not really. Most people know exactly what I can do since I spar so much. - Fri Dec 11 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: However, they don't know what -you- can do, so I assumed you'd want to keep it that way. - Fri Dec 11 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Right. Element of surprise. - Fri Dec 11 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Mhm. Now, come at me. Full-on spar. - Fri Dec 11 07:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Full on...spar? - Fri Dec 11 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Yes, now come on. - Fri Dec 11 07:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) felt a lot more nimble without the weight of the shell on her back. Pushing off the ground, her body would dart out towards Kinami, her speed much more prevalent without the weght causing her to quickly rush towards her opponent. Her arm cocked back as she allowed her forearm to jet out, fists ready as she attempted to punch Kinami in the arm. She wasn't strong, far from it, with the force she used it would barely be noticed. (2)

If the punch had connected, Aoi's body would weave to her left before trying to perform a quick jab with her left hand. The jab turning more into a slight hook, her arm  having swung upwards. Once done, she would back track slightly to gain good enough spacing, enough for her to think about what to do next. (3)* - Fri Dec 11 07:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) would have her nose struck, the sudden impact causing her to faulter backwards. It felt as if someone had bopped her on the nose causing extreme discomfort and slight disorientation. "Ugh.." she muttered as she began to blink heavily until finally seeing straight. "Did....did you just hit me in the nose...?" she asked, almost in disbelief. Pushing off the ground once more, she would rush off towards the girl, arms cocked and at the ready. (4)

As she approached the woman, she would begin to move in an almost zig-zag pattern before reaching her position. Her movements would end with her at the kunoichi's side, left arm swinging to strike the girl dead on her right shoulder. She had heeded Kinami's words, trying to concentrate on making her strikes that much faster. She had learned a unique technique, but she wasn't ready to perform it, not yet. (5)

There was something inside of her that was holding back, not wanting to overwork herself on a spar of all things. If her concentration had been successful, her movements would have been all the more quicker as she attempted to perform a quick underarmed jab, almost like a gut punch towards the girl's side, making sure to not hit the shell. Not only was she trying to make her movements faster, but her damage output as well; if the girl was hit, she would notice Aoi had been putting more effort into her strikes. (6)* - Fri Dec 11 07:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) Would feel her hook strike against Kinami's rigid body. A strong sense of ache rushing through her arm. She recoiled back, quickly grasping onto her wrist with a look of pain quickly apparent on her face. *Holy shoot!* she shouted in her mind as she was quickly taken down by her teacher, landing once more onto the Earth below. (7)

As she quickly attempted to get up, Kinami's hand would quickly appear and fondle her rather petite chest. Aoi's face quickly became flushed with redness as she became both embarassed and angered. *W-what!* she shouted within the confines of her mind as she quickly got to her feet. Her face continued to redden as something inside of her seemed to open. Her fists quickly became clenched as Aoi's gaze became fixated on her teacher. (8)

Pushing off the ground, her body would surely disappear from sight for possibly a moment by how fast she was going, only to appear on Kinami's other side. "Ahhhh!" Aoi shouted, her arm already positioned for a straight punch. Aoi's energy would quickly mix with the large pool of stamina she had causing her punch to tear through the open space between the two girls. (9)

If successful, the sheer speed of the attack would surely surprise Kinami as the punch tried to connect with her left cheek. Aoi would continue to shout with anger as she would then attempt to swing her left arm outward in an attempt at performing a Clothesline-esque swing at the girl's upperbody. (10)* - Fri Dec 11 08:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) 's face grew a quick smirk as her punch had connected against her teacher's face. *I got her!* she internally squeeled with excitement. As Kinami disclosed it was now her turn to strike, Aoi's contentness quickly went sour. *What does she mea-* she cut herself off, noticing Kinami rush over some distance away. (11)

Aoi stood there, in slight confusion as her teacher's arm was leveled with her waist. *What is she do-* she stopped as Kinami's attack occurred. A sudden burst of force struk Aoi causing her to fly backwards, smacking against the rock wall with a mild thud. She slid downwards, slightly, as her gate quickly closed from the knockback. "Wha-..." she began to mutter as she looked over towards Kinami. "How...ho-" she continued as she pushed herself off of the wall. (12)

As she attempted to reconcentrate on Kinami, she began to speculate on how she was able to strike her from such a distance. *What did she do...how did she...* she thought, shaking her head mildly. Pushing off the ground once more, she would dart straight ahead at woman, right arm cocked and ready. As she approached closer, her right arm jetted out towards her once more; its speed greatly enhanced by her adrenaline and stamina, its lightning fast strike aimed at Kinami's nose. (13)* - Fri Dec 11 08:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) , as she sped off towards Kinami, would cause her arms to bend, redirecting and transforming her straight punch into more of a hook, using the force and power that she had gathered from her Mach Punch. The hook itself would surely lose power from its sudden change in direction causing it to appear much slower than usual. (14)

As her hook came towards Kinami, a sudden deflection or force could be felt on her hand causing her arm and entire body to be swung towards one direction. Her hook and moment used against her as she was then quickly dropped to the ground with a spin. Her body crashed once more, feeling as if the earthen terrain and herself had quickly become best of friends. (15)

As she looked up at the shifting skies, she could feel the world turning beneath her. *Ugghhhh* she groaned, exhausted from this exercise, hearing her teacher's comment caused her to sit up, nearly vomiting from her vision still spinning. "R-Really?" she stumbled, straining herself into gett up off the floor. *I know none of the Taijutsu she is using....* (16)* - Fri Dec 11 08:38:24 2015
