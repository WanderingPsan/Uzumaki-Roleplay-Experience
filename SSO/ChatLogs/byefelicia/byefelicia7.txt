She pulled her right arm back, cocking it in preparation for a single strike. She took in a deep breath, releasing it moments before her arm shot forward at speeds that were sub-par. Her hand struck the rock, quickly throbbing from the thud that could be heard. "Ow!" she nearly shrieked as she pulled her hand back, grasping it firmly with her left hand.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) centers herself, allowing her eyes to close for only a moment as they returned to their opened position. She had settled herself into her stance,her body at the ready. "I'm not...strong okay..." she stated, lifiing both hands up infront of her chest; her hands balled into fists. To be honest, she didn't know what to do, or how to make the first move on someone she knew nothing about. "Ugh.....Sir Sanoke......what do I do now?" she asked, unsure of which clone to attack or if to stay on the defensive.* - Fri Dec  4 09:10:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) sighed a little bit. "Alright..." she muttered, lowering her body ever so slightly. "Here I come.." she warned, her feet tensing up a little. With a strong push, her feet flew off the ground, her body disappearing with speed. She would make her way towards the clone on her left, hopefully appearing, rather stopping, at its side; her body crouching by having her knees bend.

Her right arm cocked back quickly, her bodies stamina quickly transforming into energy that was eaten up rather quickly. In this process, her arm would explode outwards with significant thrust in an attempt to plunge her fist deep into the side-ribs of the clone. *Mach Punch!* she internally yelled as she performed her technique.* - Fri Dec  4 09:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) let out a few deep breaths. *Too taxing...* she thought as her emerald eyes continued to focus on the remaining clone. Bending her knees, she prepared herself for another burst of speed that would surely take out the clone. "Here I come..." she warned again, pushing off the ground, this time the bottom of her shoes slide against the sand causing her to stagger forward a bit. Unable to speed onwards, she ran normally towards the clone, stopping before reaching him. *Dang...what do I do now...* she thought, bringing her arm back as if cocking a gun; ready to fire.* - Fri Dec  4 09:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) would be unable to really dodge the attack, her ability to react somewhat weaker than her other abilities. Her body would smack into the sand field below with a thud, her rose red hair flowing over her face. "Hmpphh" she muttered, using the air from her mouth to blow away the hair from her eyes. "I..I think I'm done.." she said, not wanting to fight anymore.* - Fri Dec  4 10:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) allowed her hand to grab a hold of the clones hand. As the man was pulling her up, her left hand quickly cocked back before extending outwards in a burst of quickness. If successful, the punch would tear through the air that remained between the two before colliding with the clone's gut. If the clone was struck and dispersed, she would pushed herself off the ground, allowing herself to stand. With a quick dusting off of her clothes she would be done with the fight. * - Fri Dec  4 10:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Having fun? - Fri Dec  4 10:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: A little. - Fri Dec  4 10:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Huh - Fri Dec  4 10:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) bandaged her hands, making her way towards the sandy field that was so commonly used for training and the like. She had a rather sturdy and elongated bag made of leather which she then began to fill with large quantities of sand. The bag itself quickly became plumped with its contents of sand. Sealing the back tight, she tied it to a neighboring tree with some rope she had purchased. This was going to be er makeshift punching bag for her next series of training. As the bag dangled in the air, she lifted her hands up in front of her rather dwindled chest. Without wasting time, her hands jetted out, nuckles smacking against the specialized leather. The bag itself rocked slightly, her punching being rather soft in nature.

Her eyes followed the bag with each swing it made, her hands still at the ready. She was in no way trying to test her strength, but rather her form. She was good at kicking, but her punching and strikes seemed sub-par. Again, her hands flew out with moderate speed, the tips of her knuckles barely grazing the skin of the bag; The slight budging of the heavy sand revealing this to be true. As her hands pulled back, her stance changed, allowing her body to enter the Silent Fist she was adept at.This form allowed her strikes to make little to no sound, prompting her to perform a few silent strikes to warm up a bit.

This time, she tried to perform a small burst of punches, bringing both hands up to her chest.With her left hand first, she sent if forth allowing her hand to cut through the air void of sound. The punch landed firmly on the center of the bag, quickly retracting for a few seconds before alowing her left hand to fly towards her target one more time. This time, the punch was weaker, having less time to build force and having far less momentum. She was fine with this, since it was her intention to produce a far weaker punch, allowing her right arm to now extend forwards; her right hand landing another punch directly at the center of the bag, retracting and performing a secondary weaker punch with the same hand.

This act persisted for about half an hour, allowing her arms to perform simultaneous strikes, one after the other. Each punch, regardless of its priority in performance, remained soft and not at all stressfull on the body. She had seen how the people of Sunagakure faught, a sense of ease and gentleness was present. She allowed her strikes to continue to make contact with the bag, their gentle strikes barely causing any sturring or movement. Little by little, her strikes began to soften and then gradually increase, testing her ability to control the amount of strength she is utilizing.

Continuing on this approach, she would rest a bit before visually placing a target in her mind, replacing the sand bag. She would begin to release punch after punch, aiming her attacks at the would be gut and arms of her attacker. Her arms swinging with power, fists crashing into the surface of her opponents body, her strike causing ripples of force to form. She began trying out her new technique to better master her attempts at becoming a profficient boxer. Bending her knees, her upper body would drop down significantly allowing her arm to extend outwards before swinging into the side of the her intended victim.

The technique needed work, her body rising up after having attacked the sandbag. She allowed herself to be lowered once more, performing a quick right hook and chaining it with another left hook. As she rose back up, something inside of her began to push her on, causing her to begin releasing a flurry of punches at the bag, not caring about her form or damage output. The bag, defenseless, would be pummled by her strikes; the bag itself showing no signs of damage, not even a tear. She hugged the bag, her breathing was rather abnormal at the moment. 

Stepping back, she knew she had to focus on the task at hand. She dropped down one more time, her arms and hands at the ready. Imaginging the bag being an opponet who was rushing at her, she would swing her right arm upwards, performing a quick uppercut. Her hand crashed and scraped against the durable leather signaling a connection had been made. The bag hopped ever so slightly, a sign that she had lifted the bag even if it was minor.As she stepped away, she swung her left arm outwards punching the bag with moderate force, leaving herself back at a reasonable distance.

Felt as if this was the norm when it came to boxing, rushing up to the bag, striking it a bit, and stepping back. With each set of strikes she dished out, she would perform a feint by allowing her body to maneuver itself until she had a clear shot at the lower region of the bag. Delivering a solid punch, she would hop back a bit, her arms quickly rising and falling, fist clenched in front of her. Rushing in like last time, she performed a quick set of three punches with each hand before stopping to take a small break.

Not only did Aoi want to become a well rounded user of Taijutsu, she wanted to be innovative, performing techniques she created. Her arm remained focused, her hand clenched as she eyed the punching bag curiously. She wanted to perform a single punch, a single punch strong or rather fast enough to be invisible to the naked eye. As she readied her aim, her right arm launched toward the bag, her hand slowly connecting with the target. A thud was heard, as her hand pulled back, repeating the process over and over causing her arm to jet out before her hand slowly punched the bag. She wasn't worried about the power of the strike, but rather the speed at which she launched it.

It seemed as if it was going to be the beginning stages of this feat, creating ones own technique. Her arms erect in front of her chest, her body instinctively bobbing and weaving in place. her positioning being directly in front of the sandbag as each strike she delivered traveled barely any distance before colliding by the hardness of the leather. Right jab, left jab, right hook, left hook; Aoi alternated between strikes with ease, regulating her breathing and releasing a small "tst" with each attack. She had heard this was to add some form of power into each strike, but she couldn't really tell. 

10

Her arms seemed primed at the ready, cocking back while keeping her distance from the bag. Her right arm, once again, began to shake with adrenaline. With regulated breathing, she unleashed her stationary arm outwards, the strike a slight blur. The punch made contact with the sand, causing the bag to rock back and forth significantly. "It worked...It was just too slow." she muttered, allowing her left arm to retract and release. Her left hand zoomed out, mirroring what her right had done, striking the bag with the same amount of force.

With each attempt at her technique, it seemed her strikes and hooks were getting faster and stronger. "Great.." she added as she began to perform a few chains consisting of quick jabs and hooks. The bag of sand now worn by the constant barrage of strikes seemed to flail about as she began to pour more and more force into her strikes. As she began to strike with greater force, the bag was noticeably rocking farther and farther back.

Aoi jumped back before allowing her right hand to thrust outwards, her stamina quickly draining from the strain of this highspeed strike. Her arm hooked mid-flight, colliding eventually with the bag. Wanting to test her current limits, she would allow her left arm to jet out in a hook, attempting to release an exceptional amount of stamina to allow her strike's movements to increase. These highspeed strikes, especially in succession caused the sandbag to finally crack, leaking grain after grain of blandness.

Continued to thrust each fist into the bag, switching up between hooks, jabs, and crosses. Her eyes gazing at the bag swing back and forth, sand slowly pouring out. She seemed to be relentless with her punches, leaving little to no break for the sandbag as each strike continued to unravel the bag. Her body, filled with stamina, allowed herself to continue the barrage with little strain on herself; barely breaking a sweat from all these strikes. The strength and efficiency of each punch seemed to increase exponentially as each attempted jab brought her closer to being a true boxer. After performing a series of punches which included a quick knee strike, she hopped back, preparing to demolish this sandbag.* - Sat Dec  5 00:46:30 2015
