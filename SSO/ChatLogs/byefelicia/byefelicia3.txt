<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) ran towards Yan, her sluggish speed easy to keep track of. Her arm cocked back as she reached his location. She would thrust her arm forward, her clenched hand quickly releasing its grip to form a flat hand. She didn't want to hurt Yan, let alone know if she could even hurt him; she would attempt to slap the man across the face,* - Wed Nov 11 19:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) felt her hand collide with Yan's face, an audible echo ran through the training field. Her mind went blank for only a second before she retracted both hands to cover her mouth. "Oh my gosh...I'm so sorry Yan..." she blurted out, slightly muffled by her cupped hands. She didn't know what to do or why that had happened. "Are you okay? Are you?" she kept asking.* - Wed Nov 11 20:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) was still near Yan, her hands quickly fell from her mouth before her arms opened wide as if to invite Yan for an apologetic hug. "I'm so sorry." she stated once more, waiting for Yan to approach. to embrace said hug.

If he did so, she would wait for him to get close enough before launching her knee towards him. The angle of the kick, well knee, was sent a little on its side in an attempt to strike him above the waist. If successful, she would shout, "Deception no Jutsu!" before grinning, holding back the laugh.* - Wed Nov 11 20:10:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: 'Guess she doesn't like me. - Wed Nov 11 21:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) walked into the bathroom, hopefully it was the womans bathroom. Anyways, she would look around, noticing exposed pipes that led to the sink and other plumbing. "Seems like a good enough spot as any." she said, hopping up alowing her hands clasp onto the pipes, her toes a single foot above the ground. 

Her arms tensed, her upper body strength wasn't as strong as her legs, prevelant in the fact that she was struggling to lift her body up. Her arms could feel the immediate stress as her hands quickly strained and stung from holding onto the bare pipe. She released her grip, landing on her own two feet. "I need better grip if I'm going to try this.." she stated, pulling out a pair of gloves from her pockets. Putting them on, she would try and redo this regime.

She leapt up into the air, grabbing on the pipes with furocious intent. She winced slightly as her eyes quickly shut from the struggle. Her body slowly and shackily began to rise up. Inch after inch, her body would continue to rise and further the distance she had with the ground. The palms of her hands were facing her making this a...chin up?....as her chin seemed to slowly reach up above the pipe's level.

Her chin has reached past the level of the pipe, Aoi's eyes finally opening. * I...I did it..* she thought quickly releiving the stress that had built up in her arms causing her body to rapidly drop down to her idle position, still hanging from the pipe. Desiring to continue, she would slowly begin to lift her body once more, her body already sore from the first lift. Her arms continued to remain sore, trembling with disgust at the thought of another successful chin up.

her body continued to rise with every second she exerted energy. About to reach the level of the pipe once more, she couldn't bare the strain on her forearms and overall body, quickly releasing her grip. "gahhh!" she grunted out in anger as she landed on her feet. Her arms feeling numb from pain, she rushed towards the sink to allow the water to flow over them. After a bit of relaxation, she felt her arms were back to usable levels. She plopped herself down on the hopefully clean floor before raising her torso off the ground in an attempt to perform a sit up.

Her knees were pointing up, and feet wedged between one of the sink's pipes so that they would remain planted. Her hands on either side of her head as she lifted her body once every minute. She took in a deep breath upon lowering her head, and released it each time her nose touched her knee lightly. Her abdomen would squueze and compress with each situp she did, the burn barely starting up. *Going to get fit and tight...yeah..* she thought.
* - Wed Nov 11 21:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) had left the confines of the genderless bathroom, making her way towards the outskirts of the village, while still remaining inside it. Realizing she wasn't strong enough to actually train against a rock or even a cactus, she settled on a dead tree to finish off her training. Placing shin guards onto her legs to avoid any real damage she was ready to face off against this rotting tree. She stood near the base of the tree, her eyes completely closed. Having her mind cleared she would unleash a quick quick towards the trunk of the tree. Her kick collided, her shin taking the full brunt of the blow. The shin guard absorbing most if not all of the damage that would have transpired. Although this had happened, she still could feel the initial recoil of the strike. She would build up the endurance of her legs by continuously striking an object.

Pulling back her leg, she would quickly unleash another strike, her leg quickly colliding with the tree causing all momentum to be lost. The tree seemed unscathed, as was her leg. Either she wasn't using enough force, or the tree was just that durable. Performing a few more strikes with her left leg, she began to feel the drawbacks of continously striking a tree. The shin guards would only absorb so much, as her leg began to ache slightly.

Nevertheless, she continue to strike the tree with her left leg time after time, to the point where her shinguard had snapped. The tree's trunk had a noticeable dent from where she kepting kicking. She had lost count how many times she had successfully kicked the trunk. She removed her shin guard, looking down at her rather worn leg. *I need to keep going* she thought, going back to striking the tree.

Striking the tree without a shinguard quickly began to seem like the worst idea Aoi had ever had. The first strike going bare echoed throughout her leg as pain quickly followed. She grunted and groaned as her leg was slowly becoming more noticeably bruised. That's when she decided to switch legs, using her right leg, with shin guard ready, to continue her barrage of kicks at the ther side of the tree. This vitalized leg and protective shinguard continued to punish the tree with contact every few seconds.

This time Aoi had counted, performing fourty seven kicks on the truck of the tree before the shin guard gave way. She could hear it shift in a manner that didn't sound right. She continued to kick, deciding to worry about the guard later, striking the tree with all her might. The tree itself was starting to look like an hourglass from how dented it was on each side. Upon striking the fiftieth kick, she collapsed slightly onto the ground, her leg hurting from the exhaustion she was forcing them through. The shinguard had broken, quickly disposing of both of them. 

Realizing she had to continue on with her training, she got up, went to her bag, and pulled out knee caps that she eagerly put on. Using her hands to grab both sides of the trunk, she would begin to breath in and out rather quickly. She would then, without warning, deliver a swift knee to the base of the tree; knee pad striking against the wood. The weakened tree shook with instability as Aoi continued to deliver knee strike after knee strike, taking turns with each knee to deliver a calculated blow. She was becoming more and more frustrated from training, wanting to stop for the time being. Seeing an opening, she would place all her strength into one final knee strike at the center of the worn out tree. It would more than likely connect, causing all her pent of frustration and anger to manifest into a strike that would burst through the trunk of the tree causing it to collapse away from Aoi, crashing against the ground.* - Wed Nov 11 22:50:52 2015
