<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Maybe.. - Sun Nov  1 01:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) simply nodded as he learned of his task now, taking the map into his own hands . A basic nod as he looked over the object and then he proceeded to make haste for the village's exit, his eyes looking over his own shoulder towards Mizumi. It was rather obvious that Ichiro was waiting on him.* - Sun Nov  1 01:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) appraoched the massive gates of the Bush Village, his eyes peering across its great length as he did so. As Ichiro stood there, he took note of the guards which seemed to empower the walls and hold a height advantage over him. Of course however, he found no amusement in them sitting higher, especially when the task required infiltration.

To him, this implied stealth, yet he simply found no way for himself to 'sneak' into the village. It wasn't within his nature. Rather than trying his hardest to do such a thing, he just carried himself on until he had been well enough within range, yet sticking to the treeline as to throw off their line of fire.

A palm was stuck out and he allowed himself to initiate a wave of heat to go throughout his body. Of course, this was unreal and purely mental. Regardless though, his sweat exitted his palms and the golden substance had now entered a state of solidity. Soon enough it all continued to pour out until Ichiro now held a single spear in his hand. Casting his vision to his partner though, he waited to see if he would indulge him with a plan of sort.* - Sun Nov  1 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed as his partner employed a mist, impairing his vision only a bit as he stood there. However, he rose up just enough to cast his eyes onwards to the gate. He could hear the poison of the enemies words passing through his ear lobes and reaching his brain. The ominous feeling of the fortress doing a bit to harm his willpower. Yet, for his Queen, he would do anything.

A push forward and he brought his spear upwards, holding it upraised over his shoulders. The words of his enemy were discouraging, and implied they were found out almost immediately. In response to this, Ichiro cast his golden sheen of sweat down his body and allowed himself to access his golden defense. Now, his sweat formed a defensive shell, making this his first line of defense against these explosives as he moved onwards.

He of course felt the impact, which slowed his approach, even making him stop for a second before he eventually brought his arm forward, of course that was only once he had his opening. Tossing the spear forward, it motioned from for at least one of the enemy troops, planning to impale him. And if possible, pass through and strike another. It made no difference to Ichiro, just as long as he lowered their numbers.

Of course, he didn't even pause to check for 'Zero,' assuming that he could handle his own weight.* - Sun Nov  1 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) seemed to keep onwards with his approach. His actions may not have been as obvious as his partners, but that was more power to himself, probably giving him the element of suprise. Rather than continuing to combat the small group, Ichiro manipulated his sweat to form another spear for himself, actively thrusting it into the wall of the fortress. 

A recollection of the other, and he was planting that into the wall as well. Now as he stabbed each into the wall, he utilized his strength combined with them as a simple climbing tool as he attempted to put himself at an elevated position. Not only did he want an oversight of the village, but he wanted to be out of the way of any primary shots. 

To sum it up, he was using his spears to scale the wall now and avoid a direct approach with the enemy.* - Sun Nov  1 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ricky(Lordlol45) says: Yes - Sun Nov  1 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) brought himself to the top of the wall, finding that his progress had gone unimpeded. His progress over the wall seemingly stealthy compared to how he would normally conduct himself. Now that he stood at the top however, he found himself still holding his two spears, bringing them along the way. He thought about attending to the gates and removing them to assist his comrade, but he figured the target was priority.

His eyes scanned the village for what he could see, but probably held nothing of importance. He did of course spot several buildings and proceeded to make his way down the wall, however on the inside of the gates. 

Should Ichiro still be capable of proceeding in stealth, he'd make a rush past as many buildings as possible, only making quick checks in his progress as he searched for the researcher, knowing that it was dire he find this man before things got worse. Regardless his legs were actively pumping a lot of energy through them.* - Sun Nov  1 03:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) stepped back as he raised his arms to cover his face. The poisonous cloud that entered his system only aggrovated him, causing him to grit his teeth as he made a mistake that could possibly be life or death. However, he had no idea considering he had no medical knowledge at his disposal.
leave the premises and 

Once clear of it however, he could obviously feel a great dent in his abilities, finding himself to move a bit more sluggishly and of course finding a loss in his strength, greatly reducing his main focus of combat. He knew he'd have to be a lot more cautious now. But he did take his efforts elsewhere, moving deeper into the small village to begin his search for the area north of the gates.

Rather than moving close for inspection, he remained back a bit, expecting his allies to come to his position soon. He hadn't wished to take on the next area alone of course.* - Sun Nov  1 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed as his partners made quick work of the troops, assuming they could join Ichiro in full force now. Keeping both of his spears at the ready, he trudged on like the brute he was and made his way to make an attempt at the barrier. He of course had no idea how this would play out, and simply started by throwing one of his spears at the barrier, wondering if it would either pass through or shatter against it.* - Sun Nov  1 04:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) only observed now as he stared down the various figures that remained opposite of him. His throw seemed to do nothing against the barrier, and his thoughts only left him to wonder what would be required should he want to pass through. He figured it'd be best to wait for Sado to make way with this. Therefore, Ichiro simpyl formed another spear as he waited, standing still as he expected for him to do away with the formation.* - Sun Nov  1 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) backs away with the onslaught of attacks coming at him. The rush of the weaponry and strike scoming for him were somewhat disheartening, considering he couldn't deal with them at his peak. Therefore, he proceeded to remove himself from the range, bringing up his arms as a defense for the moment while he observed a few of the projectiles either impaling his rough exterior or colliding with his body. Either way he'd still make a move back to safety, awaiting his allies.* - Sun Nov  1 04:59:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed Baen's actions for a mere few seconds before beginning to take off in the opposing direction. He wasn't running, no, but walking. It was more like a confident exit than one that implied a runner. However, Ichiro's eyes pointed more or less towards a specific mass of people and his hand raised in this instance. Yet it was a mere matter of timing and distance if he wanted to get the upperhand. He didn't want to be outted and killed before he could do what was needed.* - Sun Nov  1 07:24:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Meh, what are they offering you for killing him? Could it be you're just doing it to shave off time until something more interesting comes your way? - Sun Nov  1 07:28:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) brought his hand up as he allowed his voice to sound throughout Amegakure, pointing it towards their military forces. "One hundred required to defeat the mankiller, let us move to obey our Queen." 

In only a few seconds they proceeded to travel forth, bringing themselves back to meet at the point Ichiro initially came from. This of course was the cavalry, and Ichiro planned to gain the upper hand by introducing the element of suprise of course. Now he approached with a small force behind his back.* - Sun Nov  1 07:49:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed the changes within the encampment as he moved deeper within, heading onwards to the north. The pillars that had been built up were definetly something new within his eyes, but he figured he could deal with one while his comrades dealt with the other. A simple stride forward and Ichiro eyed the towering construct to the East, choosing this as his target.

As he moved forward, he made no attempts at combat---at least not yet. Rather, Ichiro only observed them to try and get an idea of what he'd be dealing with and how to combat his target, expecting his retaliation to prove difficult in some way of course.* - Tue Nov  3 03:26:04 2015

(*Suimu, Mizumi rushed in behind Ichiro, making sure to pay attention to the surroundings and the barrier that defended their goal. Noticing Ichiro going after a structure to the east, and a similar structure being in the west. Deciding that he had to go after that one instead, he ran over towards the structure, making sure he kept a look out in case something flew out of the barrier. 

Forming a single handseal, a shadow clone was formed near Mizumi, as both began preparations to take on the structure.*)
* - Tue Nov  3 03:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) noted how the Eastern pillar hadn't picked up any action against him. A grunt from Ichiro as this seemed to be greatly beneficial to him. And of course, he heard the abrupt roar of lightning in the background, of course getting quieter as he moved, although remaining louder than ever. He simply brought his hands together now as he allowed them both to crack in each individual hand before bringing himself into a run, thrusting a hard fist forward as he planned to connect with the pillar, hoping nothing could possibly stop his actions.* - Tue Nov  3 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) took note of the enemy amassing, yet ignoring him through the corner of his own eyes. A light nod was made, finding that the plan had promptly introduced the same scenario from the previous day, although a bit altered. However he returned to his task, continuing to toss his forceful fists into the rocklike strucker. THen he promptly paused as he grunted, showing a grimace.

A mental lock within the mind seemed to come to drop against the unreal floor as he brought himself into an advanced state. His strength proceeded to develop tenfold as he proceeded to step back into his actions, thrusting forth another series of strikes into the large pillar. His attempts being to completely knock down the structure as he attacked it.* - Tue Nov  3 06:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) came to a stop as he realized their combined efforts were well enough. Backing away from the towering object, he assumed that the number they pulled on both was just wel enough to send them on their way, and now Ichiro could join the frontlines. He paused only for a moment to take in an observation of the area, surveying what was left. 

However, it was with the eruption of the earthquake that Ichiro took to a different action, running in the opposing direction to escape its expansive action. He had no idea of what it could do to him or his comrades, but he was sure they were better off than himself considering they had the ninjutsu to allow them easier movement amongst the area. He could only hope that he'd be just fine for the next section.* - Tue Nov  3 06:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) took a step up and ran back to the building that seemed to hold his comrades. His eyes looked to both of their options and proceeded to stand still for a moment. As he considered the both of them, he figured that he should consult with his comrades at the least before continuing. 

"I have a feeling, east is the way to go." With that, he set towards that building, regardless of which option they took. Yet, as he approached he observed Mizumi taking action and proceeded to pause, overlooking him for a while as he awaited his ninjutsu usage to be completed to see the results.* - Tue Nov  3 07:04:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) proceeded to act quickly, backing away now as he observed the smog setting in, considering that was truly the only thing that actually bothered him. In his movements, he kept his eyes on the speeding weaponry, figuring that he he'd have the durability to deal with the impact, of course, that was disregarding the tags. With the assumption he couldn't escape their reach with the propelled force, Ichiro activated his golden shell, using that as his basic defensive line for the moment, still trying to move back into a safe haven. Once he'd survive the onslaught, he knew he'd have to attend the northern house afterwards.* - Tue Nov  3 07:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: U--..Ugh... - Tue Nov  3 08:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: My back! - Tue Nov  3 08:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) took a moment to think about how to create a better and more conductive form of training for himself. Standing there amongst Amegakure's outer limits, his eyes peered on the slums that created the edge. He observed the many struggles of the various people within his village--and showed no emotion. He simply didn't care for the lower class, considering he was one of the greater people. Those with power normally looked down on those without, and he of course had some substantial power. A slow walk towards one of the already abandonded homes and Ichiro seemed to make his approach on the front door, finding it to be blocked by rubble. Hs hands reached down and gripped the first block of rubble and began to apply force.

Ichiro was now attempting to remove the rubble from his path, lifting it and pushing it in the opposing direction. Of course this was still difficult considering there was added weight from plenty more rubble being stuck behind this first obstacle. A pause in his actions as he looked over the block and caught sight of the rest. He assumed he could easily move these out of the way and began to apply his strength once again. A hard pushing motion against the stoke and wood mass of rubble and he felt it begin to give way.

More pressure was applied and he felt the stone grind against stone, pushing against the hard ground floor of the already decimated building. His legs pushed back and set themselves in an alternating stance as to brace himself in his pushing. With each movement of the block forward, he moved his feet, allowing them to follow along the same trail. For now, there was actually no form of exhaustion from Ichiro.

Soon he'd pushed the block in far enough that he could just slip past and make his way deeper into the building but decided against it. Rather, Ichiro proceeded to bring himself against the large obstruction without a problem. His strength proving to be enough for him to deal with it quite well. With the amount of force he was applying to move the block, it was now at halfway through the room, and Ichiro had no intent to stop until it touched the back wall.

A grunt and a half later and Ichiro felt himself coming to a stop, his pushing ending after he'd pressed the block to the blank canvas of the wall behind it. Coming back to a full stand he allowed himself to look around at the rest of the decimated building. With observation he found that there was practically nothing of use in here, and not as much rubble as he'd hope for. Yet, rather than leaving the building as it was, Ichiro moved back to the block and began to pull against it.

His hands gripped the sides of the rock tightly, finding a bit of trouble at first but eventually finding the grooves within it to be useful. With an acquired grip, Ichiro stepped backwwards, leading with his legs before bringing the stone closer to himself. He hadn't even planned on putting the stone back actually, but rather taking it out and giving it a new purpose.

With only a minute passing by, Ichiro had swapped positions so he stood behind the rock and pushed it towards the door rather than pulling. Mainly to avoid getting one hand crushed and to have an easier time moving the block once it reached the door. He paused when he felt the collision between the door frame and the rock thoung, finding that a corner piece had shifted its way through but everything else got blocked.

A grunt and Ichiro pushed onwards, bringing his shoulder into the matter as he forced the block onwards. He didn't care if the doorway was destroyed, he just cared about getting what he wanted. Applying his weight and so forth, he now grunted a bit more, listening to the sound of stone cracking against stone. The sound of both grinding together only left him to believe that he'd break through in only a few seconds.

The Engi's beliefs had been proven correct as the doorway gave way. Brick and mortar flying away from Ichiro and clattering against the ground as he observed the daylight settling on both his skin and the stone together. A few more grunts and he now had the block in the streets of Amegakure's slums. Turning, he observed what path he should set it on, and simply put himself on the side opposite of the wilds. Bringing himself against the stone once more, he pushed on to bring it from the starting point towards the exit of the village's boundaries.

With ease, Ichiro was moving the stone amongst the dirt, shifting it around underneath its weight and his own. He did nothing to show any care for the population as they observed him. As he pushed forward he could feel his muscles beginning to twist and distort themselves. Ripping and tearing for the healing process soon to come.

Ichiro was of course making progress, but he simply wanted to speed it up, and put the stone to full use. A lock within Ichiro's mind seemed to open, falling and clattering against a non-existant floor. A rush of energy shot through his body and he felt as though he'd become an entirely new person. No, his energy wasn't restored but he felt a great sense of strength.

Continuing with his efforts, he'd now brought this block to a single point far from its initial place. He left it within the woodlands, finding it to be in a good place for future usage. With that set in place, he proceeded to exit the area, bringing himself back towards Amegakure with the intentions of attending the barracks.* - Tue Nov  3 23:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) only stood still now as he entered the barracks, finding it rather impressive how many troops they'd gathered with the recent events in Amegakure. From poverty to rich, from rebuilt to a boneyard it was believed that Amegakure would remain unsuccessful, but yet it still prevailed in its efforts, finding itself coming through after its hard times, and still remaining better off than most other villages. Even then, Ichiro stompped his foot as he flexed his muscles and proceeded to stand tall and act forceful in his place.

His voice bellowed outwards as the muscles in his neck rippled a bit while he allowed himself to yell out to the troops. "Training. Physical attributes. Right now, bring a rope and meet me outside." Without even waiting he proceeded to exit the room and head around to the back, looking at the troops and joined him. It seemed that there was roughly twenty. All of them being rookies. "Toss one end here, five line up. Alternate." He was obviously planning to begin a game of tug o' war, taking up one end of the rope in his hands after it was tossed towards him. He then braced himself, using his legs to dig into the earth beneath himself while he awaited the troops to take their end.

Once it was confirmed that both ends of the rope had been taken, Ichiro signaled for a single troop to come forth and line up the middle. One did so very easily and quickly before returning to him. A bellowing, "Ready, Set, Go!" was sounded from the sidelines and within an instance the grip from both ends was intense. The troops pulling as hard as possible and of course winning for a moment. At least, until Ichiro began to apply his strength. He tugged backwads himself now, grinning as he did so. This wasn't just a test of strength, but one of endurance as well.

Ichiro's short game of tug o' war began to be very intense as he started out as the struggling side. But as the game went on, his strength seemed to increase with each interval of a second while the troops struggled. It was rather obvious they had no idea how to make the most out of their own stamina while they pushed on compared to Ichiro, whom still remained steady, getting his tugging position low as his eyes met the first man in line.

The brace within Ichiro's form and he found himself finally picking up the winning end, his feet only so close to the line that meant win or lose. However,he now raised his body up a bit as he found an easier footing and began to pull back. His intentions to slowly work his way from one end to the next. Using his right leg first, it moved backwards and pressed firmly into the ground while his grip tightened against the rope. His left foot promptly followed the others lead, standing firmly in the dirt as well.

For a moment Ichiro looked upwards and noticed the shaky position that his opponent was giving now, and he figured there was no longer a need to move slow. The win was his by now and all he needed to do was take his position back with his strength. And he did just that, tightening his grip even more as he stepped backwards and allowed himself to move with some speed added on, feeling the weight on the opposing end 'fly' towards him. The first man crossed the line and Ichiro came to a full stand. His skin was completely clear, showing no signs of fatique as he seemed to manage it to the max. "Ten this time."

Now, a longer rope had been applied and the number of men opposing Ichiro had been doubled. The angle had changed and so did the line, just to fit all ten on one end and give them an even chance at beating their superior. A few seconds passed before they silently agreed to begin and both ends applied stress to the rope, pulling on both ends. With the rope at full extension, they could easily see and hear the change within the tension.

Ichiro's position was low, just as it was in the previous game. His legs were bracing hard. They remained strong and tight as he stood still, letting his eyes remain stagnant upon his opponent. The pull that came from his enemies end being slightly weaker but just enough to keep the beast at bay for now. However, once Ichiro saw his opening, he took it. A step back with his right leg and he planted it directly into the Earth beneath him, kicking up some of the crust while he pulled hard against the opposing force. His eyes noticed the giant lurch from his opponent.

The lurch signified how easy it would be for him to take this win, and it became apparent in his opponent. Not only in their eyes, or in their breath, but in their strength as well. With ease he recognized how easily he'd won them over and knew now that if he could overpower these ten, then the third attempt would be even easier for him. To put an official Win on the event though, Ichiro tugged hard once mroe and brought forth the enemy line, finding their bodies to come crashing forward against the ground on his end of the line. He recoiled a bit, attempting to avoid being hit by one of the fallen. "All of you now."

A period of rest was given in the intermission so that all of the troops could be at full strength now when they challenged Ichiro. However when it was all done and done, both sides took up the reigns and Ichiro stood alone on his end. His eyes observed the twenty that stood tall against him while he remained still. Almost on instinct, both ends applied strength and the difference was much greater than they'd started with. Compared to the groupings of five and ten, twenty seemed to be a rather fair opponent for him.

Twenty seemed to bring Ichiro to test the pinnacle of his strength as he pulled away from them. His grip tightening to hold as hard as it possibly could against the combined efforts of the twenty. Looking upon their faces, it seemed they all thought they'd one, smirking and tugging as hard as they possibly could as Ichiro battled against them. But he wouldn't give in to their tactics and only allowed himself to remain confident and strong.

While he kept himself in his position, it didnt' work for long. The group finally pulling him from his post bit by bit. His feet slid throughout the soil and he could only attempt to hold his own. Figuring that now he could access the eighty perfcent he was holding back from his opponents. It was only now that he'd begun to test them in the same instance by allowing his mentality to shift only for an instance. A lock practically cracked open and now he felt his muscles tightening and delivering a newfound power into the world.

His strength was now tenfold that of a normal human being, putting him one above the rest. Rather than the normal twenty percent of strength most would produce, he brought forth a hundred percent. His power was incredible and he did nothing to waste it as he pulled against his enemy. The rope moving within Ichiro's direction almost immediately without a single problem. Several of the rookie shinobi seemed to find a great problem, stumbling forward and throwing off many more.

Keeping up with his unrelentless actions, he pulled once again, even harder this time now as he found the group of newbies flying forwards this time, quite literally. They left the ground and came forward until they all crashed to the ground before hsi feet. A grimace crossing Ichiro's face as he remained still. An exhale escaped his mouth while he dropped his end of the rope, looking onwards at the few that lay in the dirt. "Clean up, get some rest." was simply all he said in response to the situation.

Now, as he exitted the area he initiated a light jock in order to avoid letting his adrenaline go to waste as he allowed hsi body to settle for its basic strength. The lock seemingly kicking back into place and preventing him from draining his body even more. His running legs carried him on towards a new form of training, bringing him from his initial location now as he jogged the streets of Amegakure.* - Wed Nov  4 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) jogged through the pathways of Amegakure, finding it incredibly relaxing compared to tearing and ripping his skin against a tree or a stone block. It was better than playing tug o' war considering he didn't have to push or pull or even apply force to get much excersize out of this activity. His legs moved him while his upper body began to 'glow' and glisten from the sweat that now began to produce itself upon his skin.

Actively pumping his legs to get the most out of his jog, he continued through Amegakure's various parts. His intentions were to move from the barracks and make way to the slums, his eyes estimating the distance and time it would take for him. Ichiro wasn't a very fast patron, and figured it would take him a while, but with hard work and great stamina he'd make it there eventually.

However as he moved on, it was more like he'd only expended a fifth of his stamina in his expedition from one end to the next. It made no difference to him though as he continued. He could feel a strain beginning to pass throughout his legs, probably from the combination of both his jog and his game of tug o' war of course.

A forward push as his arms moved in tandem with his legs though. While he kept going, his head dropped and peered at the ground ahead of his steps, almost like it was thinking in a precognitive motion. His eyes and mind combined together layed out a pathway for him to travel on without problems in any sense while he looked for his way.

Easily, Ichiro continued to bring his body down the roadways, dodging the various people that stepped out into his way or seemed to be in the midst of working themselves. Ichiro's own eyes simply lifted from the ground while a single hand moved for his forehead. This hand swiped itself across the skin, leaving it sticky but ultimately without sweat layering it now.

His legs still carried him onwards, finding his movements to stay in rhythm. His jogging aptterns had simply become no joking matter as he easily accomplished his goal of obtaining a great pace. Without a doubt he was easily making turns and stops in due time, never messing up on any of his actions as he moved around. Everything happened perfectly, or so he thought.

Now as Ichiro continued to jog, he could set eyes upon the slums from his location, observing it without much problem as he moved. Of course hwoever, he was in no rush to reach the outer limits, considering they were pretty grungy and could only present problems for him once he sets foot in the area. All he could do for now was keep on moving.

His perception allowed him to note that he was getting extremely close to the outer rim of Amegakure. His stride remaining unchanging other than in speeed. He soon began to bring himself to a slow as he came to look over the buildings and nearby region as he passed them. Eventually however he proceeded to find himself crossing the fine line between poverty and rich.* - Wed Nov  4 07:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) now stood in the middle of Amegakure's slums. His arms rested on his waistband while he proceeded to take a couple of deep breaths. Standing still, he eventually found himself peering upon a rather dire situation. A young lady had seemed to stand still amidst a stray alleyway while a large group of males seemed to bombard her with questions. Their intentions seemed quite physical. Ichiro had simply moved directly over to them, pushing forward his fist to meet the nearest male. With ease he dropped the man as he looked to the rest. His eyes showed no curiosity, only purpose.

It didn't take long for the group to turn on Ichiro, presenting roughly ten individuals for him to apprehend. This wasn't apart of the job, but it was good practice. A training session for the hulking guard. His eyes easily set in on the one that seemed to be the leader, which expelled the first and only oder they needed. "GET'EM!" But it didn't matter. Ichiro was faster, stronger, and better in every way possible against these goons. He showed this by proceeding to make a movement inwards and brought his fist up again, allowing it to clash with the first goon while another to his right side produced a switchblade. Ichiro's muscles themselves had simply braced themselves for what was to come, turning his head a bit while his muscles tensed.

Without even as much as a flinch, Ichiro listened to the sound of the blade breaking against his tough exterior while he looked directly forward. The one who recently attacked him had immediately dipped, finding it to be too much for himself as he noticed the differnce between himself and Ichiro. Regardless of one less opponent, Ichiro proceeding to cast an open palm forward and allow himself to build up a golden spear in his right hand, holding it just in case. A step inwards again and he presented himself towards his opponents gain, listening to the grunts that had come from them as he planted his left fist into a single one, turning this enemy around and almost putting him down for the count.

The issue that was now left for Ichiro to deal with seemed to be a gathering of three goons, all moving forward to perform a joint attack. Moving backwards in his actions, Ichiro turned his upper body away from any upperbody strikes and sidestepped those aimed for the lower. While they were all greatly experieneced in their thug routine, Ichiro stood as one above the rest, taking advantage of his heightened threshold of power. He applied his weight again, thrusting into a punch as he struck one in the gut. A leg rasing up after as he performed a spinning kick to drop the other two. He was considerably, moving through the crowd without effort.

A dash forward and Ichiro attempted to skip over the goons and head straight for the leader, but it was obvious his underlings weren't going to give in so easily. He was close, only a few feet away from the enemy before being pulled back by several of the thugs, finding the tip of a blade aiming to cut into the small of his back. Yet, it still never worked. His opponents lacked the physical strength to break skin, let alone anything else underneath. His face remained stoic while another blade had broken against his backside and he only produced a scoff. Once again his muscles flexed and he brought his arms inward, one at a time.

His movements had brought each grappler forward and practically tossed them each in opposing directions. Ichiro then thrust back his right leg, planting it directly into his attackers gut. The force he applied throwing the attacker backwards as Ichiro now stood still, practically stabbing their boss with malice in his eyes. A few steps forward and Ichiro moved towards the leader with a slow stride, finding it to be rather incredible how little of a challenge the group had been. But of course, the leader was more formidable, tossing a fist forward at Ichiro.

The Engi's response being a movement of the head. It wasn't enough though as the strike passed into his cheak, bringing him back a considerable amount. And it seemed that this wasn't the end of the strike as he only found several more strikes coming in as body to body blows. Each strike doing minimal damage, but damage nonetheless. For the most part it only brought Ichiro a short distance away from him until he'd eventually turn back to meet him. He cocked back his right arm and grunted, thrusting it forward to send a cracking sound through the air around himself. With the introduction of his own right hook, he found the knees of his opponent buckling, the jaw cracking, and eventually he heard the thud of his body falling against the ground.

Ichiro had done his deed, looking upwards to see the rest of the goons making a hasty escape. He then turned to look at the damsel in distress. "I'll be taking you home now." And without awaiting a response, he lifted the girl with his own two arms. And of course she weighed considerably less than the men he'd just dealt with, but carried her on nonetheless. Almost like a kid, she sat on his shoulders while he exitted the alleyway, bringing himself back to the streets of Amegakure.

Now as he walked with the girl, he had no idea where to bring himself and only walked around aimlessly, being too stubborn to ask a question. His eyes guided him from one point to the next and he considered what province of Amegakure the female could be from. Ichiro used his knowledge of the village to ponder upon this, continuing to keep hold of her as he wondered where a girl of her nature could be from. Using a marxist view, he thought on the quality and cost of her clothing and believed that could be his best guide. At least until she spoke and said, "Central Amegakure."

He was taken aback by her words, but nonetheless grateful that she specified. He turned now, exitting the slums of Amegakure as he brought himself towards the direction of the center. Without a doubt, he was incredibly wary as he believed someone could potentially make an attempt at him or the girl once again. He was unsure of whether or not the men he let go would play rat and send more goons his way. But so far, things were good and the weight on his shoulders actually made him quite comfortable.

Suprisingly, he hadn't heard a word of protest from the girl. To Ichiro, he as sure she was quite relaxed and keeping up a great hold on his body. As Ichiro moved, he slowed a bit as he stated, "I need you to change holds." Then he came to a stop, lowering himself so the girl could drop. Afterwards, he raised up and allowed her to climb back on, although in a different format. Her arms wrapped around his neck and his hands took hold of her legs, carrying her piggyback style.

Now Ichiro set back on his path and continued to carry their combined body weights from one end of he village to the center. There was a considerable distance between the two, but he could make it of course. The task wasn't really doing much to his stamina really, but nonetheless after all the work he'd put in today there was the presence of sweat on him from the efforts he'd put into each and every single one of his tasks.

Ichiro moving onwards had noticed how many buildings they'd passed by, finding it incredible how quick time passed by. He figured it would've taken much longer for him to bring the girl to her home, but nonetheless that was the last step. He needed to know -where- the house was. Once he reached the middlepoint that made such a place the center of Amegakure, he asked the simple question of, "Which house?" However, he had no need to look in the direction she pointed as he could simply feel the shift in her weight. He turned like a hound dog and observed for a moment.

Nearing the building, he could see that the gril was nothing more than middle class, which didn't bother him but it made him wonder why she was so far out. Once at the doorway, Ichiro lowered himself once more as he felt the weight of gravity bring him down with the both of their combined weights and eventually rested one knee down. Remaining still, he felt the weight leave his form and the girl turning to thank him. It didn't matter though considering he just stood and began a short jog on his way away from the area. He left the female at a loss of words.* - Thu Nov  5 06:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) was now on another jogging expedition through Amegakure. He proceeded to deliver himself from the center and bring himself towards the outskirts of Amegakure now. He found himself in the zone that dictated the roots of hsi training. The place he'd spent so much time at, bashing his fists into a tree. Pausing his jogging motions, he found his palms meeting the coarse soil and grass before eventually letting his legs uphold himself.

His pose was strong, holding himself some considerable height off the ground as his eyes peered upon it. Eventually though, he pressed his body forward and brought it down upon the ground, hanging only a few inches from it as he initiated the starting push to access another form of training. Gracefully, he brought his body back upwards once he completed the push though, finding it rather easy even with his draiend stamina.

Now that he was suspended in the air, he expelled a short breath before going down once more. His arms arcing out to make a perfect right angle with the both of them. His eyes still trained on the dirt before himself, scanning the ground and judging the distance between his chest and the grass level. He understood how difficult pushups were for most but he was different. He was a powerhouse with no limits. He was going to do his best just to keep up his physical prowess, having no plans to lack in this world of dangers.

Ichiro's face had turned from one of an extremly calm, stern, and serious individual idirectly into the face of a savage. His body pumped up and down with incredible strength, moving wickedly fast as he now began to push past ten, twenty, and eventually thirty pushups. None of it being too taxing for the hulking guardian. Without a doubt he was doing incredibly well with his practices, raising his head to look at the area in front of him.

His eyes peered directly at the walls of one of the many homes in Amegakure while he upheld his strong position.  His arms stuck to being as sturdy as possible while his legs remained straight. Without any problems whatsoever, he lowered himself once again with his pure strength keeping him barely out of reach of the grass. In only a few seconds he was now passing fourty and nearly fifty, still progressing onwards.

An even stronger movement seemed to leave him with a great deal of sweat across hsi form. A look between both the ground and the building ahead of himself, he believed that the fruits of his labor would soon pay off. A considerably great amount of exhalation and he found his body pushing him over the limit, his own arms tiring now as his stamina got into the low reserves while he performed the same action.

A further push of his body and he was expending even more of his stamina as he pushed himself past his limits. His boundaries were broken now and he was a wounded man. He could feel the tendons in his body tearing and begging for him to come to a pause, although he simply followed his ambitions and proceeded onwards with his pushups, finding it to be more taxing than his prior efforts to push the ground and keep himself suspended within the air.

Ichiro however, pumped out a few more pushups, finding his stamina to come to a tough point. A point he'd never truly reached before as he felt the need for such to replenish. He simply sighed to himself and dropped himself once he passed the one hundred threshold. Now laying there, he felt his muscles beginning to relax from the force of gravity and the tension combined together.* - Fri Nov  6 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) had eventually finished resting up, although he could still feel a great bit of stress on his body. Rather than letting himself give into his punishment, he stood. As he stood now, he took a moment to register just how bad the feeling was before turning to face Amegakure once more. He'd done every excersize in the book, or at least, every one that was available to him. Eventually though, he caught wind of an idea and proceeded to find himself  a rope and some metal hooks along with a few troops. Guiding them to the outskirts, he had them all plant the hooks and cement their position in the ground with his help included. Ichiro then tied the ropes to each hook and proceeded to tug hard on them for a test before stepping back and setting himself up.

Now with a considerable distance between himself and the hooks, he let the two troops he'd brought along stand on the sidelines and watch for him. Just like the game of tug o' war, Ichiro had braced himself, setting his legs back while his upperbody seemed to lean into the action first. Eventually he pulled back, allowing a crack in his position as the upper portion cut from leaning forward to leaning backwards. He was allowing the rope to hold him up combined with his own strength as he pulled at the hooks. The intent to remove them from the ground and break their bolts and holdings.

Gritting his teeth, Ichiro could feel the strain of acessing his full strength as he did this, but he disregarded the fact and continued onwards. His arms holding the most pain in them as he eventually began to grunt and puff while he pulled. The troops on the sidelines watching with a certain sense of suprise in their eyes. It did nothing to change the Engi's demeanor however as he remained in his placement. The pull being incredibly strong.

His legs moved back a bit and he could feel the rebound of the rope, being almost like an elastic in the situation, which he figured would've been much better in the situation now that he thought about. Yet, it was too late and he continued to tug, watching as his elbows passed his abdomen, finding themselves tugging at the pinnacle of the rope. In the same instance, his head titled back and he looked at to the sky, letting out a roar of sorts as he continued to pull.

With the efforts he applied, he soon felt the hooks loosening, the reverberation of this flowing immediately through the ropes and allowing for him to identify the shift. He still continued to apply the same amount of strength as he pulled away of course, believing that he could potentially remove the hooks and tear away the ground as he hoped for his labors to prove. Ultimately, he just wanted to put his strength to the test and show it was great even in a weakened state.

Ichiro's teeth gripped each other even more, pulling away from the tethered point with his hands hanging onto the rope tightly. With each pull, he could feel the resistance considering the ropes began to slip from within his palms grasp. However, when he lost a great length of the rope, he would step forward and reset somewhat, doing so on the spot. Once he regained his grip in each attempt he would pull back even harder, finding it incredible with how he was performing the task. He of course remained on the same train of thought.

Eventually, as Ichiro pulled against the focal point of his ropes, he allowed his mind to begin shifting. A lock coming undone within the mind as he seemed to increase his strength ten-fold. It was nearly a repeat of his efforts in the tug o' war game except this time he was up against a rock in this situation. But nonetheless, he found it rather relaxing and simple for him to utilize this full power mode of sorts.

With a better grip now, tightening his hands aganst the ropes he easily pulled the hooks further from the ground and brought them closer. Although, they still tethered to the ground. However, the tension had released a bit more, giving him some more lee-way with his pulling. His power was great and the Earth had to bend to his will, allowing him a chance to overpower the earth and reveal to the world how incredible he could get. A smirk crossed his face, being one of the only ones he's ever had as he continued.

With the final pull, he made one strong tug as he watched the Earth ripple and crack. The connected rubble flying forward and moving in directly for him as he continued to hold the ropes. With the hooks coming in along with them, Ichiro did nothing but stand there and watched the two hooks come in and break against his superbly durable form. With ease, Ichiro had overpowered the two tools and found himself doing quite well as an outcome. He stood there for a mere moment as he waited, letting himself think of the next thing to do.

However, Ichiro left the hooks down in place for the two troops to handle them. That's what they were there for anyways. Regardless, he picked up his legs and carried himself off. He entered a jogging motion and brought himself directly unto Amegakure's limits. His movements aimed for the central point of social interaction as he planned to take his rest there as he normally did after his long training periods.* - Fri Nov  6 03:32:28 2015
