<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) approached the stove with the ingredients. It was easy enough that the three he was give nwere all meets, but he couldn't spice it up with anything new. All he could do really was cook them evenly and let everyone at them.

Therefore, when he applied them to their pan on the stove, all he did was apply a little seasoning. His hand seemed to linger of the pan handle, moving it around a bit to keep the meat from sitting in one spot and getting overcooked. It was also his method of flipping, as he didn't really like using a spatula in these situations. 

Regardless though, Ichiro found himself doing an exemplrary job as he cooked. In reality, this was his calling. His profession one could say, but that was still odd for a taijutsu practicioner and a tank. Regardless, he simply watched the meet as it simmered, which was incredibly hard with the leg.

The leg in particular had to be cut into small bits before he could even put it on the pan, and at that, it took longer than the salami and ham. However, he soon found himself putting them all on a single plate, seperating them into their own sections for differentiation. Then he turned, looking to the trio with the plate in hand.

"Salami, ham, leg." That was the particular order they were in. "Want anything else with it, just ask." It was noticable that Ichiro's brow furrowed at that thought though, considering he couldn't find something to compliment all three.* - Sat Nov 28 06:53:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: .... - Sun Nov 29 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) proceeded to make his way towards the doorway, planning to make an exit unless stopped of course.

"If you need my help. Just yell for it or something..."* - Sun Nov 29 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: I really hope I'm not needed... - Sun Nov 29 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Alright. - Sun Nov 29 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) allowed himself to settle down in front of the complex that he'd been resting at with the crew. As he remained there, he allowed his eyes to scan the area around himself. For now, he saw nothing, but he believed that it was quite possible for him to be watched. Although, this changed nothing. Rather than staying in one place, he turned and moved towards the nearby vending machine.

Once Ichiro closed space, he looked directly at it and then to the deposit slot. He hadn't felt any need to pay, especially considering there was no one around to collect. Therefore, Ichiro simply moved onwards and placed himself to the side of it. His hands quickly located themselves in two positions. One on the backside and one on the frontside, covering both ends for himself. With only seconds, his hands began to rock the large box back and forth.

Ichiro was moving it rather easily, applying his formidabble strength to the situatio nat hand. He tipped the machine back and then proceeded to move it forward until he could get it to move without a problem. His hands guided it and easily brought the machine down to the immediate ground.

When Ichiro released, he could hear a slight crunch. It was almost like the glass on the front end had broken in some places. However, his hands moved once more and he was now placing them over the various corners of the machine. There were screws and bolts on the backside, showing that it was secured tightly. A simple grunt from Ichiro and he focused his hands into fists, punching through the two bolts at the top.

Once he punctured some fist sized holes into it, he opened his palms up. His hands had then gripped the edges of his holes, pulling back on the steel gate. His eyes simply watched it unfurl and come off as he pulled, opening the back end. Eventually, when he finished he simply reached inside and pulled out a few snacks before opening a few and began to consume them.* - Sun Nov 29 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Alright then. Let's continue. - Sun Nov 29 05:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Still at it... - Sun Nov 29 05:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: I wish Shiro was here.. - Sun Nov 29 05:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Hmph. - Sun Nov 29 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Your luck is turning to the better. - Sun Nov 29 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Oh, both evens. So, we both say something about ourselves. - Sun Nov 29 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Oh, nope. - Sun Nov 29 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: .... - Sun Nov 29 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Since when is a three an even? - Sun Nov 29 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Looks like I'm looking too hard. - Sun Nov 29 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Do you have issues with numbers? - Sun Nov 29 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Tsk. - Sun Nov 29 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) attempted to slip through and make his way back up the stairs.* - Sun Nov 29 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Should you ask your friend here? - Sun Nov 29 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: About what I said? - Sun Nov 29 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: ... - Sun Nov 29 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh, silly me you probably want to discuss that in private later. - Sun Nov 29 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Nevermind. - Sun Nov 29 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I rather do it when everyone is present.  - Sun Nov 29 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Anyway, back to the game.   - Sun Nov 29 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Why did you personally come here? - Sun Nov 29 05:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) proceeds to move to the center of the room, allowing himself to move slowly, towards the ground. His upper body lowers itself and remaineds distileld in the air for a moment. His arms keeping his chest in suspended motion. Meanwhile, his legs remained straight. Jetted out like a flat plane while it was cooperative with his back. Together, they were both straight. Eventually though, Ichiro allowed himself to press downwards and access the first pushup. With ease, he began to raise himself again before repating the initial motion.

Now that Ichiro had begun to focus on the physical element for training, he found it a bit hard to actually keep up the act. In reality, he could perform them simple enough but they felt awkward to him. His stance was awkward and left him wondering if he was even doing them correctly. Regardless, he continued to pump up and down in short, concise motions.

With each movement downwards, Ichiro made sure that his chest was at least an inch off the ground before pushing off. When he came upwards, he found himself raising until his arms were entirely straight. At some points, he even opted to hold himself there, distilled for roughly a few seconds before eventually dropping back down.

His stone face remained heavy, keeping his serious feeling in play as he came downwards. Eventually he came back up, just as he always did and will. The more he did his pushups, the less awkward they felt. However, he figured he should take a break soon before pushing his limit in this state. A few more pushups were used and then eventually, Ichiro allowed himself to pause.

Following this pause, Ichiro stood up. When he fully stood, he moved from his current spot on to the stairs. Following down the steps, he'd soon find himself returning to the room where Kida was, or at least he had hoped.* - Sun Nov 29 06:50:01 2015
