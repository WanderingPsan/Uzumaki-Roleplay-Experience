<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) turned his head to his right, observing the three new faces within Amegakure. They'd gotten some newcomers in the recent days, but never any more than one at a time. The introduction of the trio piquing Ichiro's interest. However, he still attempted to retain the same nonchalant feel that he normally gave as he spoke outwards with his deep, heavy voice.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) sighed now that the two had left, making way from the middle of the complex out into the woodlands just a bit away from Amegakure.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) held out a single hand, cupping it just a bit as though he was planning to catch something from mid-air. Ichiro settled his eyes upon this palm, watching as golden perspiration took place in his hands and eventually worked its way outwards. Soon enough, Ichiro was holding a single spear in his hands. Shifting his hand, his grip had tightened and he pulled back the weapon now, letting both of his hands grip it. While he held it there, he proceeded to take a stance with the golden weapon at his side, almost as though he was preparing for a stabbing action. His next action however, was rather swift, bringing him forward as he thrusted the weapon into the air before himself. Following this action, his foot moved forward and he planted it sturdily into the ground, letting his eyes carry out before himself while he observed the area before him.

Eventually, Ichiro had reset and allowed himself to assume the original stance as he exhaled a short breath of air. With this action he repositioned his hands amongst the golden spear, recalling the two ends it held. His understanding of the spear only gave little knowledge, showing practically no proficiency whatsoever. Although, Ichiro knew he could utilize both ends and proceeded to do so. His initial action was a stab, just as he did on the first use. The secondary action, following after his stab was a pull upwards, as if he was attempting to cut something in two with one end before eventually bringing the second end in and making an akwards stab with that, only leaving one hand on it after this. This was of course, aimed for the general region of the head. A tactic he believed he could throw from as well.

Resetting his position, Ichiro believed that he could improve greatly in the use of a spear and better himself when using this ninjutsu specifically. With his weapon now lowered and at his side, he stood in a sort of squatting position as though he was attempting to get underneath the invisible opponent. A step forward and he made another active stabbing motion, turning this one directly into a upper slashing motion. A grunt followed shortly after when he performed a great spinning move, turning from the right and bring himself back to a basic stance from the left side. And of course, it hadn't taken much for him to prevent his weight from swinging outwards away from himself. Repeating his pattern, he eventually turned back to a regular and stagnant pose, checking to make sure his formation was correct.

Allowing his eyes to fall to his polearm, Ichiro proceeded to pause for a mere moment as he pondered on how he could expand his use of his makeshift spear. However, he failed to develop any new tactics for use and proceeded to folloq up on the same action. His hands thrusting forward as he brought the spear into another forward motion and enforced a strong stabbing motion from this. Taking back his weapon he grunted and proceeded to step inwards again, repeating this as he unleashed another into the region before himself. Of course, he was indefinetly having little to no problems with performing this series of strikes. Each one resulting in Ichiro guiding himself forward and finding his feet shuffling ever closer to the tree before himself. And thus, he gained an idea.

Releasing one hand from the weapon in his grasp, he held out the free hand and allowed it to secrete enough of his golden liquid to create another spear for use. With ease, he allowed himself to draw forth both of his golden weapons before eventually striking the tree before him. Rather than forming a stabbing motion he allowed himself to creating slashing motions. Each end of the weapons allowing the crude blades cross-cut through the bark and leave two slash marks in place as Ichiro observed. Without a problem, he repeated this motion and created several more marks along the tree, more or less focusing on accuracy as he tried to make his slashes in the same two marks he initially made.* - Thu Nov 12 00:19:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) turned his head to face the presence of the female whom had just arrived, allowing himself to open both of his hands. The result of this being his two weapons of gold to clatter agaisnt the ground and crumble, hidden away by the grass now, although of course some pieces were caught by the sunlight. Regardless, he felt the need to speak, only due to the fact that Sado hadn't been around and he had no other to rely on to handle her socially.

"...Hello."* - Thu Nov 12 01:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I am. - Thu Nov 12 01:09:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: Sure. - Thu Nov 12 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: I'd like you to teach me what you can do in Taijutsu if I win. - Thu Nov 12 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: You can take the first move. - Thu Nov 12 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) nodded as he heard that he was given the first action in the situation, "Alright."

Normally, he was used to playing the defensive, although he figured he could turn it around so that he was, indeed, the defensive party. To begin, he simply allowed himself to move forward, keeping on a straight line as he neared the girl. A single fist was thrusted forward as he aimed to go for a right straight, aiming it for the upper body in general.* - Thu Nov 12 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) expected something entirely different when Makoto dodged his attack. The grip and pull being rather different for him, considering none had ever attempted to lift or throw him prior to now. However, that also meant he had no considerable counter. The most he could do was accept the toss, finding himself on his back as he cast his vision upwards. Most notable however, was the fact that he was practically unphased by the damage. In response, Ichiro attempted to roll a bit, trying to gain enough distance for himself to enter a standing position as he eyed the girl. He wanted to play defense now, rather than offense.* - Thu Nov 12 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed the odd approach from Makoto, never having seen anything like such. To him, the tactics she utilized were the most impressive, leading him to believe that she was the more experienced taijutsu user while Ichiro was just a wall. However, his slow form attempted to back away but failed due to the nature of the action. Once again, he ended up on his back, letting his eyes peer up at his opponent. Rather than attempting to stand however, he tried for a simple move, aiming to throw off her balance at the least as he thrusted a single leg outwards, aiming to make a connection with Makoto's.* - Thu Nov 12 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) took note of the female, finding that she wasn't some sort of glass cannon in terms of strength. That was good, considering it did interest him. However he utilized the time between the two to raise up from the ground and attempt to regain his stance as he looked towards her. Of course though, he understood he was at a major disadvantage.

If he went unhindered however, he'd drop into his signature stance, letting his upperbody lower as his arms remained at his side. He knew with this stance he was dependent on his reach, planning to use such agaisnt Makoto. And of course, his first action would be a long overhead punch, planning to bring it down upon Makoto.* - Thu Nov 12 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed as Makoto seemed to trudge onwards through his initial strike, delivering her shoulder into him once again. Of course though, this was the test run of his stance, and allowed him to recognize a great flaw in it. he could move his upper-body with ease, but the fact that her motion would force him out of his space, all he could do was move with it, bring himself backwards along with her strike. A grunt came from Ichiro as he saw that he was definetly on the losing end. With a short recovery, he brought up another arm and thrust this one directly forward with the attempt to make another connection with her upper-body.* - Thu Nov 12 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) only responded to Makoto's devastating combo by laying out flat. This time, he hadn't even attempted to stand. The buildup of her strikes leaving an abundance of pain for him to feel this time. It was obvious that the brute, no matter how durable couldn't handle multiple throws of such force and body blows when put between a rock and a hard place. As he remained still, he released a few coughs before eventually letting out a, "You win..."* - Thu Nov 12 02:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) raised his upperbody, attempting to scoot himself back a bit to give himself some space, but never moving to stand. As he sat there, he let one hand slowly move to rub over his chest.

"I like you. You're different."* - Thu Nov 12 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: ...Mmm? - Thu Nov 12 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: Thank you. - Thu Nov 12 02:31:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Well, you fought their only one. - Thu Nov 12 02:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: Ah! - Thu Nov 12 02:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: Was that your 100% though? - Thu Nov 12 02:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Yeah. I'm not really much more than a wall, you could say. - Thu Nov 12 02:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: But, since you won, I'll have to keep up on my end of the bet. - Thu Nov 12 02:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Although...From what I saw, you're more experienced...and all I've really got to offer is my boxing stance. - Thu Nov 12 02:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: Mmmmm. - Thu Nov 12 02:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: I'd still love to learn. - Thu Nov 12 02:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Alright. - Thu Nov 12 02:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) finally raised himself from the ground, doing so a bit slowly before eventually stretching out his limbs. As he stood there now, he looked towards Makoto and began to speak.

"The first step, is to get low and let your frame drop. Just let your arms hang like a sloth I suppose."

He then of course, allowed his body to set the example as stated, letting his knees bend so he could get low and his arms begin to sway before him. It was almost like the entirety of his upper-body had gone limp. As though the entire upper half had just died off.* - Thu Nov 12 02:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed Makoto as she imitated him. An assertive nod was made as he looked her over.

"Alright. Now that you have the stance, the actual focus of this stance is countering. You'll want to focus on dodging, by swaying the body and responding with a counter to any oncoming attacks."

To show this, Ichiro allowed himself to begin swaying back and forth, moving his body awkwardly from side to side, front to back. It seemed that the pattern he moved his upper body in was quite unpredictable. Regardless, his feet never moved and his position always seemed to remain low.

"The best part of this stance, is that it leaves you open to strike from any direction, and from plenty of different ranges."* - Thu Nov 12 02:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) continued to sway a bit more, attempting to give Makoto something more to go off of for a bit before coming to a stop. Once he did so, he simply watched her movements. In response to her question, he nodded. Although, when referring to her stance, he simply stated, "Loosen up a bit. It'll help with your sway." Of course, trying to give some guidance to her.* - Thu Nov 12 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) continued to observe a bit, finding that she seemed to imrpove rather quickly. Of course, he nodded with approval while keeping his eyes locked upon her. 
"Very good. You got the basic set. Striking should come easy really. Although, that may feel a bit akward since the stance lets you throw a hit from anywhere. You could lean back pretty far and still throw a great uppercut."* - Thu Nov 12 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Ichiro. - Thu Nov 12 03:30:46 2015

Of course, this only meant that he was trying to guage their personality based off appearance. Ortho on the otherhand, being the only foreigner he'd recognized.
