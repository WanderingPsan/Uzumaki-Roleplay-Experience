<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) ||"Of course."

nodded, exitting the room in search of pajamas now. * - Fri Nov 20 03:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Kida.~ - Fri Nov 20 03:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) proceeds to come close to the drawer within the bedroom, letting his eyes look across the room for any other clothing storage. However, he failed to see any others. As a result, he simply opened the drawer and began to inspect the contents. This left him searching for pajamas, finding this to be a simple task. His, ask no questions personality leading him to dig deep and hard as he searched for them.

Eventually, with enough time passing by, he discovered the product as requested. Blue, with a simple white streak down the middle--lined with buttons and so forth. Not a good fashion statement, but the requested item nonetheless. A light nod and he proceeded to exit the bedroom, returning to Shiro and Kida now.* - Fri Nov 20 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) entered the room, holding pajamas in his hands as he looked to Shiro.

"As requested, here are the pajamas."* - Fri Nov 20 03:27:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) coughs a bit before reciting a quote.

"Tell Sado that 'Shiro' has done five missions and more for your village."* - Fri Nov 20 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: I haven't spoken to Sado in quite a while. But I'll make sure to do so...Who is 'Shiro' by the way? - Fri Nov 20 03:49:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) proceeds to stand out within the open. Taking in a breath of fresh air, he eventually proceeded to extend his arm, letting himself access his chakra. The sweat glands had easily become infused with this, producing a golden sweat from the skin and eventually allowing it to leak into the air before himself. At first, it only formed a long, spear within his hand. Secondly, it becan to encase his arm, creating a shield and gauntlet formation upon it.* - Fri Nov 20 21:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) continued to supply some chakra, allowing each shell crack and break away as he created a newer one, making it thinner and thinner every time. In this instance, he allowed himself to make a few actions with his spear, stepping forward and making a jabbing action alongside it. It was a simple task for him, actually. His actions simply continued, creating more stabbing motions, although, holding a sloppy technique.* - Fri Nov 20 21:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) created one more shield of sticky gold, eventually allowing himself to keep hold of it on one arm. Rather than removing this one from the world, he allowed himself to access it by holding it steady in front of him, as though he was preparing for a block. The spear in his other hand, had come up, meeting the side of the shield. The two tools lightly grazing each other for a moment. Eventually though, Ichiro made a single stab forward while holding the shield in place. A simple reset took place shortly after, holding the shield steady alongside the spear as he did so.* - Fri Nov 20 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) continued to act with the shield and spear combo. His body keeping both close for tight and quick actions. Although, the way he held the shield kept his body low, for maximum coverage. His legs being covered as much as possible, leaving only really his feet and the top of his head open for attack. The spear on the other hand, was drawn back, prepared for striking. Eventually, when ready, he stepped inwards and jutted the weapon outwards, keeping the shield as steady as possible and within the same position, holding it as closely as possible to himself.* - Fri Nov 20 23:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Anyone of you want to spar? I've gotta get some training done. - Sat Nov 21 00:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: A spar? - Sat Nov 21 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Hm. - Sat Nov 21 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I accept. - Sat Nov 21 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Good. - Sat Nov 21 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Let's do this down there. - Sat Nov 21 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: You can start off. - Sat Nov 21 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) nodded, allowing himself to start off by simply raising a single hand. This one being held high over his shoulder as though he was to throw something. At first, it looked like nothing to the human eye. But one with some form of sensory would notice the buildup of chakra, and the sweat glands being imbued with such. With little time, Ichiro had created a rather large, spiked rod in his hand. 

Once this object had formed in his hand, he simply let it launch from his grip, tossing it in a forward action. With ease Ichiro threw it some distance, aiming to strike Kyubishu with this spear. But whether it did damage or not didn't matter. His immediate action afterwards would be a simple dash forward.* - Sat Nov 21 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed his opponent with a stern expression, aiming to prevent his opponent from getting an idea of his thought process. Continuing to close in however, Ichiro didn't care for the usage of handseals. His step bringing him in rather quickly as he began to prepare a bundle of chakra within. This would come into play depending on the jutsu--which he expected to come out as a ninjutsu.

Regardless however, Ichiro's plan of attack now was simply closing distance and aiming to toss forth a punch, aimed directly for the gut of Kyubishu.* - Sat Nov 21 01:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) had found Kyubishu's tactic to be rather different. It was new indeed, but it did nothing to assist him against Ichiro. His skin was like a wall of steel, making him feel like a god amongst men as Kyubishu attempted to send him upwards. Rather, the initial strike did nothing more than knock him forward really. And even then, not enough to deter him.

He stumbled a few steps but recovered and made a turn, sparkign a smirk amongst his face as he looked upon Kyubishu without a single problem. It was as if he'd ignored the damage dealt altogether. There was no rest period, and definetly no grace period for either of them considering the titan, Ichiro, moved back in for another damage dealing move.

Of course, this one utilized Ichiro's chakra in the same instance. It wasn't meant to assist in dealing damage, rather, it was a simple coating for extra protection, considering it was thin and the force his actual fist was throwing would be the true damage dealer.* - Sat Nov 21 01:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) simply cooled himself, stopping his savage style of assault. He observed as his opponent dropped back and allowed himself to access his chakra in preparation. When the tools had begun to fly, his body secreted a substance from his sweat glands, and leaked from his maw as well. The action was simply forming a protective shell around himself.

The one thing that Ichiro knew his opponent had seemed to have forgotten, was the fact that he'd seen this before. This exact tactic left Ichiro standing in a golden shell, not for defense against the shuriken, but against the restraining tactic he attempted to employ. 

For the moment, he was still as he watched and waited.* - Sat Nov 21 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) had planned his actions carefully. To his knowledge, he only had a short moment to escape the grasp of the wire bind when his armor was relieved. And thus, he prepared himself with a hasty motion. His actual action allowing himself to lower himself a bit, preparing to jump as his armor began to crack away.

Eventually, he lifted off, slipping through his original golden shell. But in reality, Ichiro wasn't worried in any way at all about the results of his actions. He could easily overpower the wires should they come onto him, and the shuriken were nothing to his skin. In reality, he was more concerned about when his opponent would reveal his bones.

With his escape attempt, he'd push forward, ignoring the shinobi tools as he moved forward, launching on to strike at Kyubishu.* - Sat Nov 21 01:56:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) (*Kyubishu had simply avoided Ichiro's spiked rod that came directly toward him. It was obvious that it was the start-off for a good spar but that didn't mean he should have done such an obvious technique at the start of a battle, he obviously knew that Kyubishu could've simply dodged it without any type of effort or hesitation. After his opponent had begun to dash toward him, he took off in his own dash in order to weave a few handseals to iniate a jutsu. But what jutsu? That'd be for his opponent to tell.

He was faster than your average Genin, obviously.*)

Regardless however, Ichiro's plan of attack now was simply closing distance and aiming to toss forth a punch, aimed directly for the gut of Kyubishu.*)
(*Kyubishu didn't have a choice but to activate his technique, or else it would've been an absolute waste for the strike that came toward him. And besides if he activated it now it would've meant that he didn't need to waste anymore effort or stamina upon the attack that was coming toward him, a simple strike had came directly toward him and he couldn't afford to take it. But his opponent was quite fast with their abilities and striking speed, so a simple strike had came toward his gut and Kyubishu had taken it.

Or atleast Ichiro would've thought. His opponent's hand might've felt quite bruised up with their striking power so high and a direct punch landed, against a log that would've been. Kyubishu was actually behind his opponent after performing The Kawarimi Technique which had teleported him behind him as he attempted to come forth with a kick upward at Ichiro's back in order to throw him up into the sky.

Leaping after him in order to deliver a few series of lowkicks.*)
(*Engi, Ichiro had found Kyubishu's tactic to be rather different. It was new indeed, but it did nothing to assist him against Ichiro.

(*Kyubishu carefully had witnessed how Ichiro didn't show any actual signs of being legitly hurt after his Taijutsu technique had been succesfully landed, it was obvious that he might've had to hit his opponent harder for them to actually be damaged by his attack. A single adjustment was made toward his fighting style after Ichiro had once again turned around and headed toward him in an attempt to strike at his face, this tactic of fighting against someone was awfully new toward him also.

He didn't natrually fight like this, it was something that he just now tried. And so something else had occured to him once his attack had been landed, thus staring toward the unharmed Ichiro. Kyubishu had quickly evaded his opponent and attempted to leap backward in order to make some distance from his opponent, sliding across the grass and stopping himself atleast two feet from his enemy.

A index finger was moved toward the flap of his holster, opening it up before dipping his hand and thrusting it inside in order to take out some ninja tools. A handful of shuriken were taken out, atleast five on each hand, inbetween each finger. Kyubishu had thrown them directly toward Ichiro, as they cut through the air with little to no effort.

Whilst this distraction was going on, a few handseals were weaved together and he shot out some thin, but durable wire binding in order to try and hold down Ichiro.*)
(*Engi, Ichiro simply cooled himself, stopping his savage style of assault. He observed as his opponent dropped back and allowed himself to access his chakra in preparation.

(*Kyubishu smirked after Ichiro had stood there. After he figured out that his previous attack hadn't actually done shit, it was obvious that a defensive tactic had been taken before his attack was made. And then it all added up once Kyubishu's kick had simply kicked Ichiro foward instead of launching him upward and making him ascend further into the sky, so a small little thin wire had been wrapped around his finger, automatically connected to absolutely all of his shuriken once they were taken out of the holster.

The shuriken had zoomed foward as Ichiro had stood idle, Kyubishu had allowed them to head directly toward his opponent. A simple tug had been taken toward them as they instantly flew off course and headed in a different direction, soaring from behind his opponent.

A offensive tactic was about to be taken, his wire bindings still came directly at his adversay as he attempted to make sure that he couldn't move and so Kyubishu could've effectively taken the advantage of the battle. He needed to examine Ichiro first before he could actually begin his offensive fight with this foe.

Small amounts of frustration had been building up within him, gritting his teeth at the fact that he was so weak compared to everyone else. But that would've eventually changed.*)

REPOST* - Sat Nov 21 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) felt the impact of the shuriken in his back---but it seemed to Ichiro that his opponent didn't understand the fact that these shuriken were nothing to him. Pesky mosquito bites if you will. His ignorance was bliss in this situation, carrying him onwards once his body touched the ground. However, as he moved in towards Kyubishu, it was obviously that Ichiro had changed his stance.

His body hung low now, and his arms presented no attempt to guard. It seemed that all defenses were gone, leaving a straight open path for assault. However, Ichiro himself gave a devilish smirk to Kyubishu, playing on the fact that this was his zone. His lust for the battlefield, and his lust for combat keeping him on the drive. He had a goal, and he planned to achieve it.

With his approach, his right fist came up and jutted out, moving straight across his body for a right cross, aiming to knock Kyubishu in his chin and catch him off gaurd--hopefully using his momentum against him in this instance. 

The Unorthodox Boxing Titan had just now gone past minimal effort.* - Sat Nov 21 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: Isn't that the kid who ran before? - Sat Nov 21 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) seemed to chuckle a bit when the bones were extended. This had obviously meant to Ichiro, that he was pushing his opponent into a state where he'd work his hardest. Or at least, that's how his mind had percieved such. 

Regardless, the connection between the two presented no pain to Ichiro, but his opponent on the otherhand, he was unsure of. The bone had never gone past Ichiro's fist, but the power he had thrust behind his strike left him as the more opressive force. His strength proving greater against his opponent.

If anything, Kyubishu's bone would possibly break, and be rendered useless. 

But this didn't stop Ichiro. No pain, no game. And with how he was striking, there was a virulence in his eyes as he continued onwards, thrusting out his left fist in order to deliver an uppercut directly into the gut.* - Sat Nov 21 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: I don't like him. - Sat Nov 21 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) still held the same bloodlust in his face, remaining unchanging as Kyubishu had come towards him. The unorthodox stance Ichiro had taken had indeed, been perfect for defending his upper body, and he had intended to utilize the full advantages of it. The ram into his chest had assisted him, allowing him to recognize the second action to come.

Rather than staying still like a buffoon, his body leaned back--all the way back. This simply left Ichiro in the most awkward looking stance, but it worked. His reach was incredible and allowed him to toss another strike from this exact range. And that he did. His fist jutted outwards and proceeded to come from his right side, with that portion following into it.

With ease, he made another Right Cross, tossing it immediately into the gut region. He wanted his opponent to topple, or bend to his will in reality. It seemed a bit more like he was on to something new entirely.* - Sat Nov 21 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed as Kyubishu seemed to back off, continuing to look onward at the boy with a sort of malice---intent for evil to be done. No, not the intent to kill, but just to do harm in general. And this had ultimately led Ichiro to trudge onwards, swaying his upperbody from side to side as he came to a full, upright standing. His legs then picked up, carrying him forward as he bounded off of each foot.

It seemed like he bounced around the area, moving from left to right to left. Again and again. Yet, when he closed distance, he made a short jab--no intention to connect. Then he made another with the opposite fist--still no intention to connect. And finally, a third jab from his right fist-his preferred fist-jutting this one outwards and aiming it directly for Kyubishu's leg region.

More specifically, the portion that would represent the knee. Ichiro aimed to deal great damage and cause the boy to buckle before him, and even drop entirely. And if possible, he'd follow up with a second jab from his left to do the same thing again.

In his mind however, he simply pondered on the simple thought of the wishes of his employer, and here he was---carrying out the task as wanted. No words were said in the making of Ichiro's actions.* - Sat Nov 21 03:08:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) proceeded to take a step back. The deed had been done, and nothing more was required. He'd broken a man--although he didn't do so alone. Regardless, he exitted his stance, rolling his shoulders and cracking his neck in the same instance. He'd then proceeded to back off, turning and moving to make his exit as he looked to his partner in crime.

"Leave him. It's been done."* - Sat Nov 21 04:26:40 2015

Without a doubt, Ichiro was laughing. On the inside that is. However, his actions led him to simply bring his own head backwards, simply applying his chakra and spitting directly towards Kyubishu, and more specifically, the gut.

This was a potentially fatal wound, but one he could survive with some assistance--which he most likely wasn't going to recieve. Although, the protrusion of bone and the event altogether simply left Ichiro with pained thoughts. Once his spit was done, he'd simply say,

"I had hoped for you to be like Baen. But this is a disgrace. You'll pass just as he did."* - Sat Nov 21 05:03:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) made a very subtle approach to a nearby tree as he allowed himself to extend both arms. Holding them out, he easily allowed himself to access his chakra as a golden liquid seeped from within his pores. This liquid specifically shaped itself into two dual-ended spears for combative use. Observing the tree, Ichiro's first movement was a step inwards, allowing himself to quickly plant the two weapons into the trunk, pushing hard to break past the bark. Two holes were formed with relative ease. 

Pulling back, Ichiro looked upon the wood again, noticing the damage he'd dealt. It was impressive, being rather great compared to most tools. Regardless, he shifted his pose again, pushing forward as he allowed himself to stab into the wood again. Without a doubt, he created two more open wounds in the wood as a result. Repeating the same original pattern, he allowed himself to remove the two weapons from the bark. Afterwards, he proceeded to jab into the wood again, following the pattern to the fullest for a while.

Eventually, after a couple of stabs, Ichiro grew tired and allowed himself to switch things up. He began to move, shifting his weight so that he'd move around the tree now. The tips of his shoes shuffling throghout the dirt beneath him as he looked directly at the bark. This time, his strikes weren't meant to make deep penetration, but just enough poke to make it seem like he was forcing an opponent to submit. The entire action he was trying to play off of was a beat-down technique in a way. The usage of this meaning to control his opponent--although it was unknown if this would work considering it was just a tree.

For an amateur, Ichiro had seemed to come up with many ideas for combat with a spear in hand. And more specifically, using two spears. The thoughts he had, were only for the benefit of improving offensive capability. As he thought them out, he enacted upon them. His body moving to employ the spears by simply pushing into the wood again. Each stab he made with the simple intent to graze lightly. It was rather obvious he was still utilizing the trapping tactic, as shown by his movements around the trunk.

A few more minutes passed and Ichiro's movements settled. He stopped his circling and his half-assed stabbing. His position came to a rest, and he observed the chip damage that he'd just dealt to the wood. It was completely different from using his bare hands. A sound that seemed to be somewhere between a cough and a chortle sent Ichiro barreling forward once again as he tossed away one spear and formed a single shield of liquid gold, which eventually solidified. Taking himself inwards, he bashed the tree with the shield, scraping bark and--if this were a person--break the defenses. Following immediately afterwards, he stabbed his spear into the tree. His tactics being rather similar to something from the past.* - Sat Nov 21 14:35:05 2015

He watched some swim aimlessly while others remaiend in groups. Ichiro simply dropped his shield, leaving it amongst the sandy beach. Stepping towards the waters, he held his spear with both hands tightly. With his grip, he jutted the weapon forward and sent it deep into a single fish before pulling back and allowing himself to remove it. He tossed it over onto the shield and reset himself, preparing to repeat the spearring technique.* - Sun Nov 22 07:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) steadied himself as his eyes traced across the water. His eyes pierced the top layer of the ocean and looked at the immediate ocean floor for passing fish. However, Ichiro seemed to inhale and then exhale almost immediately afterwards. With this, he launched his arm forward when he spotted a fish following along the path leading into his attack region. The spear he wielded extending to impale the fish in front of himself. When he meade the connection and finally impaled the creature, he shifted his spear so it was positioned over his shield and simply knocked the fish off, letting it all upon it.* - Sun Nov 22 07:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) repositioned the tip of his spear, letting it linger just above the water by a centimeter or two. It was the same pattern again, and he easily tracked his eyes along the same path as he peered directly down upon the water before him. Eventually though, he pressed his spear forward and broke the surface of the water. With his spear pushing deeply, it punctured a rather sizable fish. His arm extending the spear fully and then retracting with one simple and fluid motion after the strike was completed. A third fish was added to the duo on the shield.* - Sun Nov 22 08:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) stayed steady, keeping his breath short as he focused in on the water before him. The combination of light and ocean water had made it a bit more difficult for him to peer upon the fish themself. However, Ichiro cauht sight of one coming into the direct path that he set with his eyes. Not a moment later, his spear plunged directly though the surface and Ichiro apply some great force. With how he did so, he accomplished his goal of collecting the fist, pulling his spear directly up from within the waters and placing the fish where it belonged.* - Sun Nov 22 10:16:57 2015

There was considerably nothing to confirm that this was his name or even imply that it was. However, it didn't bother him. His blank expression remained and the technique being employed.

Throughout the entirety of the moment, he only released a single sigh. Not out of anger, and not out of embarassment or anything. But simply for the pure fact that he hadn't really done anything wrong.

"Are you alright?"* - Mon Nov 23 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .... - Mon Nov 23 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: How the hell?. . .  - Mon Nov 23 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Yep, I'm good..Oh wait, you're talking about that chick?  She seems alright. Don't worry too much about it. - Mon Nov 23 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Oh it's you again kid. - Mon Nov 23 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) nodded, turning to look at the majority of the crowd. 

"Good." His focus had quickly switched after stating such now. "To answer your question, sir, Kirigakure."* - Mon Nov 23 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: I wonder what our little masochist kitty is doing.  - Mon Nov 23 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Damn. . So we gonna. .  - Mon Nov 23 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Pretend like they didn't just pop out of nowhere? - Mon Nov 23 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Nah. - Mon Nov 23 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Our arrival here was...forced. - Mon Nov 23 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: They should be escorted to prison. - Mon Nov 23 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I apologize for intruding. - Mon Nov 23 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Where are the police when you need them? - Mon Nov 23 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I got it covered. - Mon Nov 23 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Police? We do something wrong? - Mon Nov 23 04:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Ithink it's precaution. - Mon Nov 23 04:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You guys did kinda pop out of nowhere. - Mon Nov 23 04:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Why are they being arrested? - Mon Nov 23 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Ah. Makes sense. You can blame the Mizukage for that. He kind of just randomly sent us here after saying some crazy things.  - Mon Nov 23 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I've intruded upon your village, ignoring your policies---despite it not being my choice. - Mon Nov 23 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I'll go willingly. - Mon Nov 23 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I think he's off his rocker. - Mon Nov 23 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm? Oh. Well, I'll give you guys a cozy cell or whatever. - Mon Nov 23 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Just question them. - Mon Nov 23 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: If they are harmless send them off. - Mon Nov 23 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Well, I'm not here by choice, nor am I going to get the Old Man angry. I've seen what he's done with Kenshin to Zetsumo.  He's scary. Heh. - Mon Nov 23 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) nodded, motioning forward as he prepared to follow after Sanoke.* - Mon Nov 23 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Mirai. Do you want to come with? - Mon Nov 23 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sure. - Mon Nov 23 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I suppose. - Mon Nov 23 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Walk ahead of me! And hands where I can see 'em. - Mon Nov 23 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) whispers: You think this might have to do with that one kid? - Mon Nov 23 04:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) whispers: A whisper is futile, they can hear us from such a distance. - Mon Nov 23 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: You think this is a game?! - Mon Nov 23 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Mirai! Do you have any questions to ask, or anyway to interject? - Mon Nov 23 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: No. - Mon Nov 23 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh. . Good. Lastly, you didn't harm anyone or anything within like. .  the last two weeks that could have irked the Mizukage enough to send you teleporting to a different location? - Mon Nov 23 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: H-.hey..? - Mon Nov 23 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: We're sort of busy. - Mon Nov 23 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Right.. - Mon Nov 23 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) turned his head to look at Sanoke as he entered. Ichiro knew what he'd done, and knew exactly how to respond. There was simply no need at all for any lies.

"If I recall correctly, the Mizukage said it was for harming someone."* - Mon Nov 23 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I've no idea. - Mon Nov 23 04:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm. . Well your friend checks out for the most part. i'm going to check on you with a single question. If you check out, I'll have you guys wait in a cell as I report. - Mon Nov 23 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Yes. - Mon Nov 23 05:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: mmm... - Mon Nov 23 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Alright. - Mon Nov 23 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Wait for the Mizukage to answer. - Mon Nov 23 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Actually just let them go. - Mon Nov 23 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: That seems like the proper course of action.  - Mon Nov 23 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So, what now? - Mon Nov 23 05:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I would very much like to return to Kirigakure for Shiro. - Mon Nov 23 05:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: But that is a horrible course. - Mon Nov 23 05:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Sunagakure's policy bars us from remaining. - Mon Nov 23 05:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: We can always ask the old man. - Mon Nov 23 05:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: You can. - Mon Nov 23 05:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I won't remain. - Mon Nov 23 05:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So you're going to head on out to Kiri then? - Mon Nov 23 05:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: No. - Mon Nov 23 05:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Although. - Mon Nov 23 05:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: ? - Mon Nov 23 05:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: When the course of things change. - Mon Nov 23 05:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: And I do return to Kirigakure. - Mon Nov 23 05:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I will send word to you. - Mon Nov 23 05:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Well I don't want to be in Suna by myself. - Mon Nov 23 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So I guess we're sticking together a bit longer. - Mon Nov 23 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: That is fine. - Mon Nov 23 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: The first destination. - Mon Nov 23 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Kumogakure. - Mon Nov 23 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Kumo? It's a wasteland now. - Mon Nov 23 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Good. - Mon Nov 23 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: At least last I heard. - Mon Nov 23 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It's still the designated location however. - Mon Nov 23 05:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) proceeded to start his walk forward. He was now set out for a path onwards to Kumogakure. His face remained steady, holding the same expression he always did. His stone cold face showing a hidden malice. Ichiro, a simple guard, had now begun to spark plans within his mind. He was slowly, but surely growing into a man with ambitions.

Kirigakure had only cemented this path.

Regardless though, he'd move at a pace that seemed to only show that he wished to gain distance from Sunagakure as quickly as possible. Whether Kida followed or not did not concern him.* - Mon Nov 23 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It holds no substantial weight of importance. It's a place where individuals such as us can grow without some sort of interjecting power getting in the way. - Mon Nov 23 05:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Or at least, it should be. - Mon Nov 23 05:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I suppose that's true. - Mon Nov 23 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Looks the same as I left it. - Mon Nov 23 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: This is good. - Mon Nov 23 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: This is a land with no value to any of the other villages. - Mon Nov 23 05:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: They will not relocate themselves here. - Mon Nov 23 05:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: That's true. - Mon Nov 23 05:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Enjoy your social interaction. I'll be looking around for a bit. - Mon Nov 23 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Hm? - Mon Nov 23 18:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Hello. - Mon Nov 23 18:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Who are you? - Mon Nov 23 18:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: My name is Engi. - Mon Nov 23 18:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: You may call me Eiyu, I am the Raikage of Kumogakure. - Mon Nov 23 18:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: What's your trade? - Mon Nov 23 18:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Ah. - Mon Nov 23 18:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: My trade? - Mon Nov 23 18:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Yes. - Mon Nov 23 18:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: What do you do for a living? - Mon Nov 23 18:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I just travel. - Mon Nov 23 18:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I see... That must be a lonely existence.. - Mon Nov 23 18:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Having no real home. - Mon Nov 23 18:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But they say home is where you make it. - Mon Nov 23 18:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: What brings you to Kumogakure? - Mon Nov 23 18:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Other villages aren't so...accepting. - Mon Nov 23 18:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Hm, accepting of what? - Mon Nov 23 18:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: My presence. - Mon Nov 23 18:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Why wouldn't they be? - Mon Nov 23 18:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I do not know. - Mon Nov 23 18:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I haven't heard your name, and you are not in the Bingo-Book. - Mon Nov 23 18:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I take it you're not from Kirigakure, correct? - Mon Nov 23 18:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Correct. - Mon Nov 23 18:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Good. - Mon Nov 23 18:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But how do you make a living?  - Mon Nov 23 18:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I do the odd job from time to time. - Mon Nov 23 18:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Tch, just be straight forward. What kind of 'odd' jobs? - Mon Nov 23 18:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Anything the general population doesn't want to. Whether it be fixing things, bounty hunting, you name it and I've probably done it. - Mon Nov 23 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Much like a shinobi does. - Mon Nov 23 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Fixing things, now that is intersting. - Mon Nov 23 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: - I see. - Mon Nov 23 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: So you are trained. - Mon Nov 23 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Tell me. - Mon Nov 23 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: What can you fix, and just what kind bounty hunter are you? - Mon Nov 23 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I do suppose if you were to kill me you would be paid a rather handsome stipend. - Mon Nov 23 18:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I'm not the best at fixing things, but I've done a few house repairs before. In terms of bounty hunting, I'm pretty straightforward. - Mon Nov 23 18:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: And that's probably true. - Mon Nov 23 18:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: *Chuckles* How much are your services? - Mon Nov 23 18:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Minimum, about a hundred thousand. It'll raise depending on the target. - Mon Nov 23 18:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I'll give you two hundred thousand. - Mon Nov 23 18:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But in return. - Mon Nov 23 18:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Alright. - Mon Nov 23 18:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: You don't target Kumogakure. - Mon Nov 23 18:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I can do that. - Mon Nov 23 18:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: You represent Kumogakure. - Mon Nov 23 18:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: And I've already given my word. - Mon Nov 23 18:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I don't break promises. - Mon Nov 23 18:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It's bad for business. - Mon Nov 23 18:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Good.. I'm glad that you are a Noble man. But you must also realize your life-style is also... - Mon Nov 23 18:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Very risky. - Mon Nov 23 18:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Say. - Mon Nov 23 18:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I wish to gague your strength. - Mon Nov 23 18:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: You up for a spar? - Mon Nov 23 18:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I could go a few rounds. - Mon Nov 23 18:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Nice. - Mon Nov 23 18:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: You may start if you wish. - Mon Nov 23 18:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) nodded as he looked to Minatabi. To his understanding, this was the Raikage. It didn't instill any bad feelings, but it told him that this wasn't someone to play with--At least, not at first. However, as he set eyes upon the man, Ichiro simply shifted amongst the sand until he was lined up with the man.

Now that they were at an even distance and equally aligned, he nodded to himself. Ichiro proceeded to lower his shoulders, bending forward a bit as his arms hang down. His eyes had then proceeded to focus in on his opponent as he look off, launching himself in a forward motion.

Ichiro's right arm however, was the one brought forward for the actual offense. This fist moving in towards the Raikage's head, aiming to come directly from underneath the chin. A simple uppercut really.* - Mon Nov 23 18:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed as the figure he'd struck dissipated. The tactic that was employed was employed nicely, confirming Ichiro's need to be wary. He cocked back, dropping back into his natural stance as he turned to look at the Raikage's new ---or original---position. 

While he stood there, his body seemed to hang low and he made no movements, only remaining in the same spot while he prepared himself for the oncoming tactic. Chakra within his body began to well up as he prepared it for use.

Had his opponent held sensory capabilities, he'd recognize that this was most abundant within Ichiro's sweat glands.* - Mon Nov 23 19:05:36 2015
