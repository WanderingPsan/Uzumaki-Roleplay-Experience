<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: What we'll do is simply plant some along the Mizukage's mansion. - Wed Dec  9 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Others along the bridge leading to the exit. - Wed Dec  9 03:45:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: That it will. - Wed Dec  9 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Our best bet there is planting them within, rather than outside. - Wed Dec  9 03:48:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Distract them, if you will. - Wed Dec  9 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: That's going to be difficult. I'm not the clean and silent type. - Wed Dec  9 03:49:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: For realism. - Wed Dec  9 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: We can simply sell on the market. - Wed Dec  9 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Prepare the caravan, sell it to a willing buyer. - Wed Dec  9 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Surely someone, would enjoy travelling. - Wed Dec  9 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: That is true.  - Wed Dec  9 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: So we're going to sell everything first, then have someone buy the caravan and cause it to explode huh? - Wed Dec  9 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Indeed. - Wed Dec  9 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Let's get this plan to motion then. - Wed Dec  9 03:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Of course. - Wed Dec  9 03:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: You can handle such. Mercantile isn't something I can do. - Wed Dec  9 04:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Alright. - Wed Dec  9 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Good. - Wed Dec  9 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Has he set out? - Wed Dec  9 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: From last I saw, he was getting ready. - Wed Dec  9 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: But he's still in the village. - Wed Dec  9 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Damn. I should have given him an incentive to leave soon. Think I should go look for him? - Wed Dec  9 04:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Probably, we need this to go quickly and swiftly. - Wed Dec  9 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Alright. - Wed Dec  9 04:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) simply nodded at Tetsu's remark. The plan required precision and timing of course, and in order to follow up on this, Ren found himself trailing after the caravan. Although, he was a long way aways. His eyesigh was needed to confirm the descent upon the bridge.

Of course though, Ren found himself in a position where he could watch from afar. IT was when he spotted the caravan making its away onto the edge of the bridge that he acted. His movements carried back, away from his vantage point now. He lost eyesight but estimated the tme required to access the contents.

Eventually once he was out of range and within that of the Mizukage's mansion, Ren simply allows himself to access a singular handseal. One that signified the usage of explosive tags. The seal of confrontation taking place to enforce an explosion to take place. The opening result being the cataclismic destruction of the center of the bridge.

Regardless though, he'd make quick travel on towards the Mizukage's Mansion. Surely this would attract attention.* - Wed Dec  9 04:48:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) found a fairly empty area within Sunagakure, staring at a rather large rock structure. It didn't seem to overwhelming, but it seemed like enough to be a challenge for Ichiro. To begin, he attemtped to alleviate it from its foundation and simply allowed himself to press hsi body immediately into the rock. His body pushed forward, pressing onwards.

As Ren applied his body weight, he was practically tackling the rock at hand. A couple of stressed grunts were made currently. Yet, Ren eventually came to a point where he could not only hear, but feel a shift in the rock's weight. One object as dense and durable as this rock wouldn't typically be broken from a tackle n' push technique.

With a further pushing movement, he found himself with a very loose but heavy rock before hsi eyes now. When finished, Ren simply backed away, relieving his grip as he stared immediately into the rock. Here in this moment, he allowed himself to access his chakra and simply spit forward. This produced a webbing which soon over came the rock and wrapped over it. The rest of the web remained extending, hanging from his maw. Both of Ren's hands simply moved to grasp this webbing and remove it.

Now that Ren had the rock under his control, and the web as his guiding tool, he simply had to pull. His body turned, back facing the rock as he held the webbing over the shoulder. Ren had now started forward, pulling the strong webbing along behind himself. In turn, this too had pulled the rock. Yet, due to the weight and difference in strength it barely moved.

Ren's face became rather serious as he moved onwards. His body pulling it along the sandy ground of Sunagakure. His legs continued to move in a pattern, the right leg being ahead of the left leg. With his pull, he could feel the webbing being tugged back by the massive boulder. The stress on the webbing still not being enough to force a break or snap at all.

His efforts continued, showing that he didn't plan to stop any time soon regardless of how tough the task was. His arm strength being his greatest asset here as he pulled onwards. The rock itself had simply shifted forward, moving along behind himself as he seemed to continue with his step.

Eventually Ren came to a stop, allowing himself to cease his movements as he now planned to utilize this technique in a different way. His training method would now switch up after a short rest period of course.* - Sat Dec 12 09:15:53 2015

Regardless though, he utilized his nose a bit to get the basic sense of smell from it.

He promptly took up his spot at the table, observing the meal. Of course, it was spicy and not really his forte, but he wished to take his chances. He had to know just how good his sister was in this field. Therefore, he dug in.

Of course, you could see how badly he was taking in the spicyness of the meal. It seemed that his face had become a quite red from it all. Regardless though, he did his best to keep himsel composed, utilizing the water when necessary.* - Sat Dec 12 22:44:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) raises up, proceeding to make an exit from the room.* - Sat Dec 12 23:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) approaches one of the trees outside of the homestead. It was quite a distance away but Ichiro didn't care if the sound of what he was to do would carry out over some distance. His face breaks from his blank, hardened expression and turns into one of pure malice and evil. To carry out the act of his anger, he clenches his hand into a fist and stares immediately into the tree before him. This fist moves onwards and simply shoots itself directly into the wood.

With his massive level of strength, he finds himself breaking through the wood of the tree. This of course being a way to release his pent up anger. His thought process practically being that he wasn't mad that his sister found love, but that she was being so secretive about it. He was angered that he hadn't known the male either and especially the fact that he wasn't able to see some form of interaction between the two. Ichiro himself simply wanted to find sme insight to know that she'd be fine.

Regardless, following up on himsel breaking the tree before himself into two, he moves on to the next, finding himself standing before a second. His arm raises up once more, pushing forward and planting itself into the wood. An imprint takes place, and then more importantly, he applies more pressure.The application allowing him to push even further and beyond. A more concentrated force destroying the rest of the tree.

Following this, Ichiro simply remained still, his chest moving up and down as he seemed to be fuming. His eyes stared at the tree he'd easily taken down for now. An aggrovated tongue roll took place and now Ichiro seemed to move onwards, lifting a single end of the tree, starting from the trunk.
