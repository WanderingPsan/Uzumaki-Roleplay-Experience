<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) turned a bit, looking directly to Akira. He'd only recently awoken, and was already quite annoyed by her presence. She seemed to speak without a mind of her own in his eyes. Therefore, his hand, gripping the spear, raised up and took aim. Then it pushed forward, releasing the spear in a singular direction. Of course though, his throw was rather lazy. 

His mindset led him to believe such a ditz was incapable of reacting, and regardless he could handle this in other ways if need be. Overall, his target was generally the head of Akira and his intent to simply pierce the skull, and inevitably, brain.* - Wed Dec  2 22:13:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Why don't you break a tree down, and try to walk across the trunk? - Thu Dec  3 00:55:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) turned to observe the tree next to him--this of course being out of the way of his comrades. Taking up Mizumi's idea he simply allows himself to motion for it. There was the possibility of simply breaking it down, but he opted for uprooting it. 

Taking the natural approach, he got low and tackled directly into the wood. With ease, he wrapped his burly arms around the mass and began to pull upwards. Of course, with his incredible strength he had no problem with such. He could easily feel the roots beginning to give way, but it'd still take some time with the resistance it had.* - Thu Dec  3 01:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: https://twitter.com/VirginAssNigga/status/667041913590034433 - Thu Dec  3 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) finally removed the tree from within the ground. Now as Ichiro stood there, he carried himself forward a bit to deliver it to a safe clearing. Once there, he'd toss the tree forward and allow it to come crashing into the ground ahead o himself. After, a few light gasps escaped him before he moved towards the tree.

Within seconds, Ichiro was standing atop the long trunk and eventually lowering to a squat. His hands stretched out and palmed the sides. For now, he was giving him a few seconds of recovery before he began to work upon his balance and leg strength.* - Thu Dec  3 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Nice job. - Thu Dec  3 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Thanks. - Thu Dec  3 01:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) eventually came to a state where he could get on with the actual goal. Taking up Mizumi's guidance he now began to walk amongst the hardwood of the tree. Ichiro himself had no knowledge of the suimen technique, making it all that easier for him to actually tap into his natural ability. He carefully motioned himself across the hard bark. Of course though, there were a few times where he'd come close with falling and wobble a bit. His arms raised to assist in balance, unsure if that technique actually worked or not.* - Thu Dec  3 02:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Wow they left me behind. - Thu Dec  3 02:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: What assholes, and Mizumi said I wouldn't see him for a few days. - Thu Dec  3 02:12:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Oh...Hi Kari - Thu Dec  3 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) continued to make his way across the trunk of the tree. His eyes fell downwards, looking past its platform and into the grass below. Meanwhile however, he took note of where his foot placement was. Eventually, he'd shift his head back upwards and focus on the area ahead of himself while continuing to work upon his balance. Although, this was a rather easy 'balance beam' to use.

When his head raised, he simply looked to his sister and stated, "Glad you came out to see us."* - Thu Dec  3 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: My business ended rather prematurely.... - Thu Dec  3 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) had felt the force of Mizumi's suiton technique connect with his foot. The force had alleviated the pressure he applied to the trunk in order to keep his place. Of course, this removed his balance. His body turning sideways immediately as he came crashing down towards the ground now. Eventually though, he proceeded to recover and stand.

"...I can do this on my own..."* - Thu Dec  3 02:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: but it adds to the excitement and danger. - Thu Dec  3 02:38:17 2015
