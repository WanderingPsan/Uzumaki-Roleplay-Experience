<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) seemed to have fallen asleep within the wood. A result of his hardwork obviously. However, it didn't throw Ichiro off too much as this wasn't the first time. He simply opts for returning to his training and begins by moving onwards to the tree he'd uprooted the day prior. As he comes close, he begins to brace himself and push his body up against it. The result of this causing the large tree to shift throughout the dirt. He simply guided it forward in an attempt to bring it upon one of the nearby households.

Continuing along his path, Ichiro found himself struggling to bring the tree forward in a straight path. With each push, some force from underneath caused a shift in path. ALthough, Ichiro continued on his path. His momentary pauses were simply to adjust the course and deviate from any obstacles. Eventually, he brought the subject at hand closer to the village of Amegakure, easily spotting the backside of one of many homes. This brought some relief to Ichiro, indefinetly.

With a continued effort and a drive forward, Ichiro eventually brought himself upon Amegakure. A little bit more power behind it and eventually he found himself pushing the tree into the backside of the structure. Eventually, he released and gave up his efforts now that his task was completed. Ichiro took a few gasps of air, even with his incredible stamina and now moved for the next part. * - Fri Dec  4 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) had now exitted the area, making a jog from where he currently was all the way towards the blacksmith shop, or at least what he recalled being the blacksmith shop in his last stay there. Regardless, his legs moved in a pattern as he traversed the various pathways within the village. With ease Ichiro came upon the building, slowing his approach to the necessary equipment.

When he had entered the building, Ichiro proceeded to locate the anvil within. Bringing himself forward he places both hands on it, finding a good grip with both. Now that he had the object in hand, he pulled and lifted it. Eventually Ichiro raised the anvil up to chest level and began to exit. With how heavy an object it was, he could feel the strain coursing through is arms.

Now with the object of desire in hands, Ichiro began his trek from the blacksmith's shop towards the homestead he'd left the tree at. It took him considerably longer than it did to jog between the two places. The weight of the anvil slowing him, even with his own strength at hand. Regardless though, he made his way to the intended location and proceeded to make some adjustments.

First, he opted to move the tree out of the way, leaving space to place the anvil against the wall. Second, with some space available now, he had of course placed the anvil against the wall. Following up on that as well he shifted the tree's placement again, lifting it and moving it to place one end upon the anvil. Eventually he'd step back and allow himself to look at his current progress. With all his hard work, he'd created a bootleg workout setup. Now, he took a moment to regain his breath.* - Fri Dec  4 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) was now ready for the real workout. He proceeded to step forward and allow himself to lay against the ground. His body slid forward against the grass until his legs were underneath the tree trunk. Once in place, he allowed his legs to move up and connect with it and eventually begin to push it upwards, bracing it. As his legs reinforced it and held the tree up, he slowly moved along it until he was centered.

Now with the weight of the tree balancing upon his legs and a majority of his body against the ground, he could feel the stress of this. Applying himself to the work out, his legs pushed upwards, lifting the tree as well. As he moved, he could feel the tendons within his leg flexing. So far, he wasn't feeling the full effects however.

Continuing his training now, his legs were beginning to tense up a bit. There was now a light feel of pain taking place within his legs. Moving his arms, these rested behind Ichiro's head while his legs followed a pattern. They'd push outwards, extending the full length and coming in tight and close as he lowers them. His knees of course coming close to his chest.* - Fri Dec  4 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: who is this - Fri Dec  4 21:31:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) found himself amongst the woods again, having left his training setup there. However, he knew he had to crack down upon his training methods and get the task done immediately. Firstly, his routine began with some simply stretches. Ichiro layed upon the ground, allowing himself to access a set stance. Eventually he began to initiate crunches. The upper portion of his body coming inwards to his knees before extending outwards afterwards.

For a while now, he continued with his pattern, allowing his body to move in and outwards without a problem. After a while he'd completed roughly fifty crunches. Something very minor and basic to begin with. Following that, he'd switch into a pushup position and allow himself to set his arms out equally. His start position being close to the ground, leaving just the breath of an inch between his chest and the grass. Eventually, he pushed off and allowed his body to raise up.

Keeping himself in a composed manner, he applied the basic pattern of a pushup. His body would lower and heighten itself as needed. And just as he did when he started, he made sure to leave no less than an inch of space when he went down. The push off being the point where he would feel the full effects of his actions. Of course though, he knew he had to continue to complete this warmup as well.

From the point of roughly fifty, in pushup numbers, Ichiro was now pushing onwards to the last few rounds. His body moving up and down without any problem and only his arms to keep him suspended above the ground. His head however, raised up, looking into the area ahead of himself. His eyes peering directly into the distance. Noticably, his stamina hadn't even been tapped by these workouts.

A hundred later and now Ichiro was done with his warmups. He proceeded to lift himself and move for the makeshift leg press. It was very simple, and ironically more difficult to use but it worked for him. Regardless, his body was positioned neatly underneath before his feet were applied to the hardwood of the press. With his back close to the grund he pushed his legs outwards. In combination, they both extended into the air now.

With each movement of the 'press,' Ichiro could feel some tension pass through his legs. He knew that a work out like this would benefit him greatly and give him a tougher stance. Not only would his upper-body strength be great but his lower-body would be just as good from this. Continuing his efforts, he made sure to fully extend and retract as necessary. For a majority of the time, he was incredibly silent however.* - Fri Dec  4 23:49:20 2015

As Ren stood there, his vision shifted and he surveyed the area. Analyzing the others within the area. In response, he simply figured that there was no longer a need for the coverup. A movement and he found himself bounding across the plane as his body lowered itself. A restraint unlocked and his arms were considerably lower.

His shuffling movements brought him closer and now Ren was thrusting forwards a fist within Heiwa's direction. He simply wished to stop his interaction, recalling upon what knowledge he knew. His intent to disable him or at least alleviate his focus.* - Mon Dec  7 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) seemed to pause in place. Not of his own volition, but due to the activation of two binding techniques. His eyes shifted, looking downwards at the ground for a short moment, and within a moment his mind was breaking a lock. A gate was opening now and he simply pushed onwards into the next step. The combination of his power beginning to stack up and assist him.

With the newfound increase in power, he had the intent to back away, breaking through the chains if possible. And if he couldn't at least shift his position so that he could hold an opening for himself. Of course though, his plan of action had to change. Meaning, his target had changed.

His hand struck outwards and he aimed to ripp the sign up from where it stood, tossing it forward into Nori's direction of course. Although, at this point he wasn't sure how the genjutsu would affect him, considering he wasn't aware of the downfall of the feathers.* - Mon Dec  7 08:05:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: And the fact that I saw her getting stabbed out in the forrest months ago by Sado. And the fact that she kept on talking about killing in such a casual tone. .And he fighting style. - Tue Dec  8 00:28:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) casually glazed his eyes over Nori for a moment. As he remained there, it was somewhat obvious that her ignorance seemed to annoy him. There was considerably, no way whatsoever that she could have recognized Midori as anyone else. 

Regardless though, a single step forward was taken and he was now at Tetsu's immediate side. Silence ensued.* - Tue Dec  8 00:33:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Why is that? - Tue Dec  8 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Well, you're left with nothing to do. - Tue Dec  8 01:24:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: What'd he do this time? - Tue Dec  8 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: We were threatened and mistreated, and he even attacked one of our own. Of course, reacted in self defense, but he instigated a confrontation with us mere merchants. - Tue Dec  8 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: I'll have our Mizukage deal with it. - Tue Dec  8 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Let it be known that he almost caused your village to enter a decline. - Tue Dec  8 03:48:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: We have some of the greatest clothing ever! - Tue Dec  8 03:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Sadly, we don't have a large amount of clothing at hand, as most of our cargo is in our caravan back in the village's storage. We were just about to leave, but I suppose I can show you some before we do. - Tue Dec  8 03:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: If you wish, you can follow me to our goods.  - Tue Dec  8 03:52:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Huh? - Wed Dec  9 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) simply casted his vision over the small crowd, eyeing the children there. After his round, he simply settled his eyes down upon Heiwa. This was only due to the mere fact that he seemed to be the speaker. The accuser. The one making such a bold statement to the public. Yet, Ren knew the accusations were incredibly off key. This was only due to the fact that, he himself didn't do such things.

"Shinobi killer...and threat to the village. Tell me who I killed and I'll humbly apologize and I'll do my time in prison. Respond carefully, because last I checked, I touched no one. Tell me what threat to the village I made, and I'll do my time. I'd like some proof to back up these statements, child."* - Wed Dec  9 03:14:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: If you're referring to the incident from prior, no one was killed. Seriously injured, yes, but killed no. - Wed Dec  9 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: He died of his wounds shortly after in the hospital. - Wed Dec  9 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: It was an act of self defense might I add. - Wed Dec  9 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Hm. - Wed Dec  9 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Shortly after?  - Wed Dec  9 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Tragic. - Wed Dec  9 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: But not my fault. - Wed Dec  9 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: You tried to punch him and he reacted against you. - Wed Dec  9 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: ....Hm.. - Wed Dec  9 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: This is legal as a shinobi. - Wed Dec  9 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Tried to? No, I simply played a joke like he did to us. - Wed Dec  9 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Throwing a punch is a joke. Very clearly it is not a threat that we, as shinobi, face every day. - Wed Dec  9 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Whatever the case may be, you still killed somone, a child at that... - Wed Dec  9 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Jail would be appropriate... - Wed Dec  9 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: It was a scare tactic for his actions against us. - Wed Dec  9 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: The problem is they are excellent taijutsu users. - Wed Dec  9 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Our jails are not strong enough. - Wed Dec  9 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: I'd like to let it be known that I've killed no one. - Wed Dec  9 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: If not death - permanent exile. - Wed Dec  9 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: My strength.... - Wed Dec  9 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Chakra signatures sensed and remembered to prevent reeentering. - Wed Dec  9 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Hasn't been seen. - Wed Dec  9 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Woah, isn't that a bit extreme seeing how this is a case of self defense? - Wed Dec  9 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: It was not a case of self defense. - Wed Dec  9 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: It was. - Wed Dec  9 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Do you not recall me asking for your help to lead him away before the situation got worse? - Wed Dec  9 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Ren himself charged towards either Nori or I. - Wed Dec  9 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Both of which were not harming anyone in the struggle. - Wed Dec  9 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: If they accept to jail time, then it is to be put in their trust to remain there, if they escape or try to escape it's clear they do not care and are open to being exiled or hunted down as fujitives. - Wed Dec  9 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: *glances at Ren* - Wed Dec  9 03:20:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: For all I know. - Wed Dec  9 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Clearly Ryo is more than hurt.. - Wed Dec  9 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: You could have been a threat to the rest. - Wed Dec  9 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Whether it was self defense or not.. - Wed Dec  9 03:20:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: But it was not intentional. - Wed Dec  9 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: He is. - Wed Dec  9 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: And then the next member attacked a shinobi of the village. - Wed Dec  9 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: And then another member, you, tried to do the same. - Wed Dec  9 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Intentional or not, punishment is needed. - Wed Dec  9 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Let me tell you the story. - Wed Dec  9 03:20:57 2015
