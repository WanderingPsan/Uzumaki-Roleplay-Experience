<br><font color=teal>*Zuvian, Xon(Simbasax) says: Ahhh your butt scratcher I have no ideal where he ran off too. - Tue Oct 20 01:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed the situation between Asteroth and Xon with a sort of disgust. The woman had an attitude in his eyes, like some sort of drama queen while the supposed Ambassador felt the need to make his situation worse. A grit seemed to settle on his face as he looked over the male. A simple hand raised, and connected with his face, eventually sliding down as if he were clearing something from it.

A look remained and Ichiro simply observed the extension of Asteroth, his 'Queen.' With a title like so, he felt the need to employ himself as a guard. A sense of loyalty really. Not to her, at least not at the moment, but one to the village overall. She had leadership, and that meant he must defend her.

A single step forward was made and Ichiro settled for a moment, tensing as he prepared to enter the fray. Yet, only if Xon responded with an offensive action. The entire time, he let one thought relay within his mind, 'Do something...I dare you.'* - Tue Oct 20 01:39:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) turned his eye to meet Asteroth, finding that she had given him some attention of sorts. A simple knee was made and he took up a fist, placing it against his chest. More specifically, it covered the spot that his heart rested at. His eyes had closed in this moment as well and he simply gave a statement for the public.

"My lady, I am Ichiro of the Engi Clan. A resident of Amegakure. I am no strong individual, but I give my mind, body, and soul to defending you if you will accept such. There is nothing I require, other than your safety."

Afterall, a Queen needed a Knight and Ichiro planned to instill himself in this roll.* - Tue Oct 20 01:47:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) had risen after being given the command. Once he stood in his pose, a simple nod of acceptance was given. His stern face remained, and he had obviously set himself forward, already stepping within good boundaries. Even with the minimal, and limited potential he currently had, he knew he could fulfill his current purpose. A silence fell over him, and he simply let his eyes befall those that had just arrived, remaining wary of the two.* - Tue Oct 20 01:57:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) nodded as his Queen reassured him and the others that seemed to prepare themselves. With the realization that there was nothing wrong with them, he proceeded to move off to the side, standing at the fence as he allowed them passage. A silence until spoken to remained.* - Tue Oct 20 02:03:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) turns his head, his eyes meeting the approach of Asteroth. The same stern look fixated upon his face as he acknowledges her presence. A simple statement as he looked her over, "You said you had a task for me, m'lady?"* - Tue Oct 20 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) simply allowed his ears to heed Asteroth's words. A fist met his chest and a forceful nod was given. He did nothing to deny any of her statements, considering they'd all proven true about him. Regardless, he accepted the mission and made a simple statement, "I won't let you down, my Queen." 

With that, motions were made to begin his mission, of course, only if that was all of the instruction.* - Tue Oct 20 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Well....I'd like to speak to you about something which I'd rather your bodyguard wasn't privy to. Trust me, I mean you no harm whatsoever...That would cause much more trouble than harming you would be worth. - Tue Oct 20 03:04:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: M'Lady? - Tue Oct 20 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) found himself out and about on the move, letting his legs carry his body weight amongst the the village of Amegakure. The rainfaill of the village patting against his naked form seemed to be of no problem to him, considering it was his natural environment of course. With his movements, he allowed his eyes to cast out, searching around the village as he looked for the animals detailed.

As Ichiro let his legs move, he let his ears tune into his surroundings, listening for any of the specified animals as he looked around. Normally, a dog would be the loudest, but he'd yet to hear one as of right now. Yet, he recalled that these animals were tame, assuming that meant they participated in natural pet activities, and simply allowed himself to find a stray stick. 

With this stick now in his hands, Ichiro simply observed it for the span of five seconds before proceeding to toss it out into the distance. A pause came from the boy as he remained still, palm facing the ground as he listened. A bark resounded throughout the region and passed his ears. Soon, he spotted a simple dog in the opening and Ichiro wasted no time at all. His leg muscles flexed and he took off in a burst of speed, not quite as fast as most would seem, but fast enough to capture the dog. Closing distance, he'd dive into a tackle of sorts, letting his body slide throughout the grass until he grasped the animal.

First a single hand planted itself on the dog, then the other gripped the leg, and soon he was scooping the pet up into his arms. A moment of pause and Ichiro allowed himself to apply a single hand to the area behind the ears, actively scratching at it tenderly. Of course, he was using this as a tactic to calm the animal as he motioned off to return it to the pet shop.

Within a few seconds he handed the dog off to the shop owner, turning within a short few seconds and exitted once again. Speeding off into the woodworks again, he now searched for the second loudest of the two creatures, the rabbit. Strangely enough, this was a creature that sounded more akin to a pig, and didn't take much for him to find one. The sound led him right to it.

As Ichiro arrived, he found a hole within a tree, the rabbit resting within. Without a doubt, Ichiro allowed his golden sweat to leave the pores of his skin and eventually form into a solid form over his skin. He then allowed his arm to extend, reaching into the hole. The armored layer was simply a defense of course, and he proceeded to pull the rabbit out, finding that it attempted to gnaw into his geared defense. A smirk for a moment, but nonetheless, he kept this one close, deciding to search for the cat before returning.

Ichiro turned, and began on a path to the pet shop, figuring it was the best starting point, yet he found  something important along it. A pause, and he spotted an orange cat, of course domesticated. Approaching the feline, Ichiro made slow, light movements and eventually let himself scoop up the cat as well.

A sigh and he presented himself to the pet shop, delivering the last of the animals now. A salute was given and Ichiro turned, heading on his way back to the center of Amegakure to turn in his mission of course.* - Tue Oct 20 03:42:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I do not use ninjutsu or genjutsu. - Tue Oct 20 04:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: How about you spar me since Susumu seems afraid. - Tue Oct 20 04:26:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Cool. This village have an arena? - Tue Oct 20 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: No, but we can use the area south of here. - Tue Oct 20 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Ah. M'kay lead the way. - Tue Oct 20 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: This'll do I guess...My name is Saeza by the way. Yours is? - Tue Oct 20 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Ichiro of the Engi. - Tue Oct 20 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Nice to meet you. - Tue Oct 20 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Would you like to begin? - Tue Oct 20 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: A pleasure. - Tue Oct 20 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I'll allow you the first action. - Tue Oct 20 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: As they say...ladies first. - Tue Oct 20 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed the Saeza as she moved. Standing there, he proceeded to retain the same sturdy and stern face that he always exhibited. As she tossed her blades away, he scoffed a bit. Almost like he wished for her to use them. But regardless, the drive of combat would intensify and bring him that entertainment feeling he required.

He understood that his target was a woman, but seemed to disregard this, viewing her as a blank template, one that remained genderless as he attempted to side-step her approach, and thrust forth his knee as he made a pass. The location intended for impact being the gut however.* - Tue Oct 20 04:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) shifted his expression from the serious tone to one of elation. Her response was perfect, at least in his own eyes and warranted him to accept the kick to his face, feeling the strike, especially with the momentum of it, carrying his head in one direction. Remaining still however, the leg reaching for his own set was never met with a counter.

In reality, Ichiro accepted it, following through with the technique, trying to lead himself in the same direction that her leg carried. Yet, this was his downfall, bringing him to meet the ground. Rather than leaving himself open for attack though, Ichiro reached out, thrusting his arm up for a grab aimed for one of Saeza's legs. Should this work, he'd have a plan in mind.* - Tue Oct 20 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) continued to observe, finding his tactic to be rendered useless as the girl's form broke apart. In response, he allowed himself to move, and his eyes tracked the swarm now, unsure of how to respond. A gasp from himself and he observed as the female seemed to come from overhead now, dropping herself.

A last second thought and he attempted to backstep her range, chossing to back up a bit now as he stared straight. Thoughts corssed his mind as he found a great enjoyment in the girl's tactics, considering it was something new to experience. 

Now as Ichiro stood there, his eyes scaled her form, looking for a new plan of attack as he prepared himself for another grpapling tactic, lowering his form and setting his legs apart alongside his arms.* - Tue Oct 20 04:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Bats...Strange girl...Strong. - Tue Oct 20 04:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) remained still for the time being, seeing that she utilized the tactic to remain as a flock of bats around his position. Ichiro couldn't counter this technique of course, and simply found himself accessing a post of rest. He simply let himself focus to a point where he was -attempting- to figure out her next move, assuming that she had the upperhand in this situation.* - Tue Oct 20 05:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm.. - Tue Oct 20 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: That was nice - Tue Oct 20 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Yeah...Susumu we can go back home now. - Tue Oct 20 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Take it, and let's go. - Tue Oct 20 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Geez, it's not that difficult. - Tue Oct 20 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Oooo kay. - Tue Oct 20 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) allowed his eyes to peer at the ground beneath himself, looking across the plains that seemed to remain at a rest. The rain that seemed to pelt away at his village felt nice and cool against his back, being rather relaxing to him. Closing his eyes for a moment, Ichiro exhaled. 

Afterwards, his eyes fluttered open and he made an approach to the nearby tree, standing tall in front of its frame before proceeding to raise his fists. He had obvious taken up a boxer pose, finding himself to begin bouncing on his toes in the same instance, trying to keep up and at it, moving around in front of the wood.

Grunting, Ichiro threw forth his fist to allow it to connect with the tree in front of his eyes, finding it to be rather easy for himself to make the connection. Effectively, his strike was meant to be a right jab, following it up with a left jab. A repeat of his actions and he found himself making several different strikes into the wood with his bare hands. Each one presenting a grunt, and the durable shell of a body he held easily defending him from the pain.* - Tue Oct 20 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) continued to attack the tree, building up a bundle of pain within his fists. Continuing with his strikes, he soon found blisters beginning to form upon his knuckles, and he easily applied more work into his strikes, not planning to let up on his actions as he proceeded on with his practice. Another set of boxer-like strikes came forth, edging from his fists as he allowed them to connect with the wood.

Ichiro continued to dance around the tree, watching the leaves fall and the rain drop before his eyes. Heavy grunts and gasps came from him, showing his hard work now as he proceeded to strike the wood before himself. He was easily continuing his beautiful Boxer's Balley.* - Tue Oct 20 21:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) remained in range of the tree still striking wood. Ichiro didn't have much physical power but he was a wall in reality. Yet, as he hit the tree, he heaved more, releasing even louder grunts in the area now as his knuckles began to show the white of his bone, practically grinding his fists down to an unhealthy point.

As he continued to drive bone to wood, making a point as he broke away at the tree, he found himself observing the shards of wood flying from the initial point and crashing to the ground, seeing that he was now whittling away at the green giant---or orange giant you could say. 

Regardless, Ichiro had begun to develop his unnatural sweat, a gold rolling out across his skin as it exitted his pores, still remaining rather soft but easily oxidating itself and taking on a harder form. He knew he would need to come to a pause soon if he wanted to avoid hindering his physical aspect during training time.* - Tue Oct 20 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) still put his fist to bark, letting his already whitened knuckles press into the bark before his own eyes. A huff and a puff and he produced even more grunts for those in the region to hear. Even more beads of his golden sweat exitted his pores and rolled down his skin. Ichiro shifted his vision from the center-point of his attacks, looking upon his skin for a split second.

A grimace came across his face, and he was once again back at it, allowing himself to move around the tree once again. His dancer-like movements were still quite offensive, considering it was a basic Boxer movement. A shuffle really, but a bounce at the same time. The movement of his legs and arms in tandem allowing him to strike more positions on the tree, watching as he wore down several points in the wood. Even if his strength was doing the bare minimum versus the tree.

With each motion, the extension of his arms result in a conenction and a pull-back, setting him up for the next strike as he still produced the same combo from before. Right Jab, Left Jab, Right Hook, Left Hook. However you referred to it, he did it. Even if these Rights and Lefts were simple, basic punches in the world of Boxing. Or any martial art really.* - Tue Oct 20 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) backed away for a moment, letting his set rest in front of his face. Fists stayed adjacent to his form and his legs seemed to be the only duo of limbs to rest. The bottom of his feet now resting, exitting that Boxer movement and letting go of the motto, 'Sting like a Bee, Float like a Butterfly' for the moment.

Five seconds passed.

This was all the rest Ichiro would allow himself, sparking his actions again now as he pushed forward, letting him lead in with a Right Straight. The extension of his arm allowing his fist to reach the tree before he pushed his head past the body region. Effectively, he was in a low, yet extended form before eventually bringing himself to a full stand.

Only for a split-second did he remain standing tall as he did before, soon proceeding to hop back onto the ends of his feet, rebounding from point to point as he rounded the radius of the wood. Ichiro was now set back on the path to destroying his opponent, which would seemed like it would take forever, mainly considering his own physical strength at the moment.

Yet, as Ichiro produced his strikes, he had no regards to his physical ability, no regards to how set back he would be should his fists become destroyed. He lived on the belief, the motto, and simply the meaing of 'Embracing my pain, and returning it ten fold.' And thus, it seemed that Ichiro grew stronger and stronger as he struck the wood, pushing himself past his own limits as he drove his fist to the wood. A raging yell expelling from his form as he did such.* - Tue Oct 20 22:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) came to a rest now, letting himself settle on his toes as his sweat left a golden sheen agaisnt his body. As he began to move towards Amegakure, the substance seemed to remove itself, disappearing from his form or rather breaking away and finding itself upon the ground. Regardless, he proceeded onwards and entered the village to allow himself a period of rest.* - Tue Oct 20 22:48:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Indeed. - Tue Oct 20 23:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: So, Ichiro right? - Wed Oct 21 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Yes sir. - Wed Oct 21 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Let's spar. - Wed Oct 21 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Alright. - Wed Oct 21 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Would you like the first action, sir? - Wed Oct 21 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hm.. - Wed Oct 21 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Nah. - Wed Oct 21 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: You first. - Wed Oct 21 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) nodded, shifting into a bow of respect as he observed Susumu. For a moment, Ichiro's stern face seemed like a plain wall, none really being capable of determining his thought process without a great insight into his person. Regardless though, he proceeded to break into a forward movement, bringing his body to meet the plane before Susumu.

A fist raised upwards and Ichiro projected it forward, aiming to send this simple strike into the right pectoral of Susumu, obviously striking with the right arm in this situation. A simple test for the moment of course.* - Wed Oct 21 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) paused his motions as he observed Susumu's reaction. A slight growl of aggrovation washing over him as he expected a spar, not a show for one. Regardless, Ichiro proceeded to access the basic handseals necessary of the clone technique, summoning a Bunshin.

This clone however, seemed to make an approach unto Susumu, appearing as thought it was charging him while Ichiro himself followed up. This was simply an attempt to draw attention away from the original, and notably give Ichiro a chance to put in a right straight at Susumu. * - Wed Oct 21 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) took note of Susumu's reaction, finding it to be rather insulting. Not because he gave into it. But because of the resounding sigh. Ichiro knew fully that he was being underestimated. A push forth from the original came as he motioned through the cloud of smoke that the destruction of his clone would present.

Closing in he'd eject a single fist forward, allowing it to fly from his range into Susumu's. This fist aimed directly for the gut region. However, he expected a reflex this time as well, bringing his body into the forward momentum to keep a drive forward. And should his right miss his left would be there to deliver an overhead haymaker.* - Wed Oct 21 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: His hits sure are a bit solid..But he isn't that strong. - Wed Oct 21 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Mmm..No matter. - Wed Oct 21 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed the connection, planning to leave no room for recovery as he brought his motions in again. This time, he switched it up from his fists to his legs, allowing himself to utilize Susumu's motions against him. The right leg was brought in, aiming to sweep Susumu off of his feet now, planning a step ahead should he connect his actions.* - Wed Oct 21 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) scoffed a bit at the mention of jutsu. Of course Ichiro utilized them but he made his own retort to the statement.

"As I said the day prior...It's only useful in defense."

Afterwards pushing himself to reach out at the male this time intending to acquire a grasp on Susumu's shoulders. Should this take place, he'd bring his forehead forward, aiming to launch a head to head assault, figuring that his durability would be enough protection against the male's skeletal structure.* - Wed Oct 21 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) remained still now, the actions of Ichiro proving to be rather lax now. His eyes settled on Susumu's form, and of course the recognization of harming the male bringing him some form of caution. A simple, dreaded thought passed through Ichiro's mind, one that he couldn't share with the world. It was rather embarassing of course.

Therefore, he simply stood there, observing. "...Please, stand sir."* - Wed Oct 21 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) nodded. "It's certainly my strongsuit at the moment."* - Wed Oct 21 00:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Alright. - Wed Oct 21 00:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I'll test it if you don't mind, alright? - Wed Oct 21 00:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Alright. - Wed Oct 21 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: 9qq - Wed Oct 21 01:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed Susumu as he stood there, his body simply preparing for the defense that he was to take. For the moment, he seemed rather calm, letting himself exhale a simple breath. Had Susumu been observant of Ichiro's skin, he'd recognize that the boy was sweating

----Yet, this was no normal sweat.

It glistened within the light, shining gold a bit. Yet, within a few seconds it encased his form, solidizing with the reaction to the oxygen in the air around himself. The technique itself meant to work well against chakra and of course further Ichiro's already defensive form. He now wore his gold shell with pride, expecting the dark chakra to be stopped by this.* - Wed Oct 21 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) felt the ninjutsu tear through his defense, his arm feeling the pain of Susumu's jutsu as he stood there. While he'd prepared the defense for the entirety of his body, only the arm had been struck. Event then, the entire shell of gold seemed to crumble and crash to the ground now as he remained still. Ichiro released an exhale and seemed to look towards his arm, already holding a great defense against both physical and ninjutsu attacks alike himself. One hand met the wound and he looked forward, a slight nod. 

"It's...not much, but it's my best---Rather--My only technique."* - Wed Oct 21 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Yes, in some situations of course.... - Wed Oct 21 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It's draining though. - Wed Oct 21 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I see... - Wed Oct 21 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: You'll need to pratice hard then. - Wed Oct 21 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I plan to. - Wed Oct 21 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I'd like to learn many more techniques but...As you see...None around to teach. - Wed Oct 21 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Indeed. - Wed Oct 21 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I can't teach you any of mine. - Wed Oct 21 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Sadly. - Wed Oct 21 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I figured... - Wed Oct 21 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Or.. - Wed Oct 21 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I have one. - Wed Oct 21 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Speaking of su- Hm? - Wed Oct 21 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: But it's a genjutsu. - Wed Oct 21 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Genjutsu? - Wed Oct 21 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Yes. - Wed Oct 21 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: My only genjutsu. - Wed Oct 21 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I've never thought of using genjutsu really... - Wed Oct 21 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) catches the scroll, letting his eyes observe it within his hands for a moment. A simple nod from him as he looked back to Susumu.

"I shall, sir."* - Wed Oct 21 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Good. - Wed Oct 21 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) allowed himself to draw the scroll open, letting his eyes scan over the contents. He of course, expected a genjutsu considering it was the jutsu type that Susumu had just mentioned to him. His eyes proceeded to pass over it, looking to gain the knowledge stored within.* - Wed Oct 21 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) continued to read the contents, effectively focusing in on whatever seemed to be written within. He began to get a feel for it, taking notice of the differences between genjutsu and taijutsu, and of course ninjutsu as well. As Ichiro read the scroll, he even recognized that this would be the first genjutsu technique he would probably ever learn.

As he read deeper into it, he took note of the techniques description, finding it to be very similar to the basic Bunshin no Jutsu technique, just on a more psychological level and of course utilizing the surrounding as the point of arrival for each one. 

The most intriguing part of the jutsu's information simply being the topic of multiplication, leaving him to wonder if he could possibly develop his own technique to follow the same premise.* - Wed Oct 21 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: It's very useful. - Wed Oct 21 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) raised his eyes, looking at Susumu once more as he nodded. "It seems like so." He then averted his vision, looking back to the scroll now and continuing to read throughout such. Eventually however, he paused, giving himself a moment to make use of the handseals, slowly trying to imitate those that were contained in the scroll.* - Wed Oct 21 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) || A continued combination of read and practice came from Ichiro, his mind taking in whatever the scroll presented to him as knowledge, even hoosing to reread some sections and familarize himself with the handseals even better. 

The same stern look remaiend on his face as he proceeded to keep reading on. Ichiro proceeded to follow through each part of the technique and allowed himself to reproduce all of the steps, of course, not picking a target for the technique, nor applying chakra. Just the stimulation of it and the handseals really.* - Wed Oct 21 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hello. - Wed Oct 21 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Auntie. - Wed Oct 21 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) turned now, facing Asteroth as he saw her approach. A sensation overcame him and he placed fist to chest, covering the heart as normal. Then, a bow came.

"Hello my Queen."* - Wed Oct 21 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: He's training. - Wed Oct 21 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) raised himself once Asteroth had spoken, shifting his hands yet retaining his respectful and formal pose.

"A simple practice."* - Wed Oct 21 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Nothing. - Wed Oct 21 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Everything's been silent. - Wed Oct 21 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I have m'lady. - Wed Oct 21 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: And yes, nothing has come up today. - Wed Oct 21 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mmm. WEll then, do you two wish to be put to work? - Wed Oct 21 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I do ma'am. - Wed Oct 21 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Dunno. - Wed Oct 21 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Depends on what. - Wed Oct 21 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) listened to the words of Asteroth, simply giving a nod in response. "Our recovery will be quick m'lady." He then turned, prepared to begin his search alongside Susumu, should he choose to join Ichiro of course.* - Wed Oct 21 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: You got it, Ichiro. - Wed Oct 21 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: ... - Wed Oct 21 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) paused his motions as he overheard his Queen's word. Within the moment, he allowed himself to cast his vision over her frame. Ichiro himself didn't really sport much strength, just a rather defined iron wall for a body. Yet, he simply made his approach, heeding her signal. An attempt to lift and carry the woman was made, doing his best regardless of physical strength. At this moment, he was driving off pure ambition to fulfill her wishes.

Afterall, she was his Queen.* - Wed Oct 21 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) carried the woman, really finding it rather odd for him to be in contact with his Queen. Or rather, just a woman in general, at least like this. However, Ichiro attempted to keep his cool and his focus, placing it on the task at hand. There was need for a recovery and therefore he heeded the woman's words, of course heading onwards to the South as deisgnated.

With his arrival in these slums, as he continued to hold his Queen, he was sure that it was definetly in his best interest to keep her close in an area such as this. A stern, hardy face of stone setting in for him as he did his best to take note of everything in the area.

'Dirty...' was all Ichiro could think, but recalled how his family used to live like this as well, finding his position better now. Choosing his first action of arrival though, Ichiro proceeded to make verbal contact with one of the various lower-class villagers, simply coughing and then stating a question for them,

"Have you seen any suspicious activity as of yet? Any missing items?" Ichiro was obviously not skilled in interrogation, but did his best to keep a confident tone of voice.* - Wed Oct 21 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) allowed himself to lower the woman to the ground, letting her carry out her own actions of course. As Ichiro continued to keep his eyes set forward, being wary just in case any attempted an assault. With the introduction of Amayi, he listened to her words of course, finding her sentences to be a bit odd for him.

To his understanding, it seemed like she was covering for something, mainly due to the fact that she'd gone into detail on a subject he hadn't inquired any questions for. A squint of the eye and Ichiro peered even deeper at the woman's face. A hard step forward and he was a bit more into her box as he seemed to make another statement.

"Is there a reason you cannot meet my eyes? A reason why you blabber on matters not relevant to my questions? What have you to hide?" Ichiro's tall, dark and brooding form seemed to grow, his shadow extending. Although in reality, nothing changed, other than his nature as a bully revealing itself.

This of course was only temporary, obviously. His intentions to use a form of intimidation to gain an even better answer, one that seemed more to their liking.* - Wed Oct 21 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) awaited a response from the small, frail Ayami, yet, found his ears hearing something incredibly displeasing to his ears. It seemed to Ichiro that an individual decided it was best to talk down upon his Queen, and with his vow of defense, he instantly broke away from his original position, finding placement between Asteroth and the fully-clothed individual.

As he stood there, he seemed to flex his toned body, staring down the group of thugs like a bull staring at red. When he'd heard his name from Asteroth, nothing more had needed to be said as he proceeded to dash forth, breaking from his stance of defense and going immediately to the offense.

Ichiro simply extended an arm as he came in with his movements, trying to be quick and relentless to grip the hooded male's head; Ichiro's palm connecting with the face. His intentions were purely to prevent him from drawing out whatever it was within his pocket, planning to leave him either stunned or astonished, trying to implement the move of thrashing this one figure's head immediately into the ground before himself.

Of course, following his nature for combat, a smirk followed up, preparing him for the scenario of not only defeating this man, but publicly humilating him and destroying his cast of characters. Yet, he was prepared just in case they chose not to play fair.* - Wed Oct 21 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) held no reactions to Amayi's strike. Rather, the blade hadn't even gone deep and left Ichiro with that face of pleasure once more. The heat of combat was beginning now, and his durable form seemed to be enough to keep him alive for the moment. As he kept a grip on the so-called leader, he turned his head back only to look at the feminine trickster.

A single hand shot back, reaching over Ichiro's backside in an attempt to grip Amayi's arm and force it to draw back, and hopefully remove the kunai in the same instance. Then, he'd proceed to deliver a forceful push before turning his focus back to the squealing man he held in his clutches, choosing only to bring his foot the man's gut, an attempt to keep him out of the action all that much longer.

Should he be successful, a pivot would be made and he'd turn back, looking upon the female that he attempted to remove from his region prior, now giving her a simple hand wave, as if beckoning her to strike him again. Of course though, he remained quite cautious of the mooks, knowing that they could be problematic due to their numbers alone.* - Wed Oct 21 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) allowed his ears to be the device that hinted at his opponents approach. Ichiro had of course known that the introduction of the various attackers could've overpowered him, of course, his reaction being---sweat.

Yes, Ichiro began to sweat, his body glistening with a gold sheen for a bit. And then soon the chemical reaction between the sweat and the oxygen within the air took place, allowing a thick shell of gold to bundle up upon Ichiro's form. A muffled grunt seemed to come from Ichiro and with his shell, he had hoped to capture some of the blades in this, effectively trapping his opponents for a short time. Of course, the ninjutsu would probably continue on and strike him still, but his efforts were to simply turn and make these goons the front line of the attack, making less of a strike for Ichiro to work with.

Effectively, as he stood there, he simply allowed his golden armour deal with the assault, meanwhile, he just tried to keep his cool and let his breath out as easily as possible. Of course, he'd be prepared should any attacks break through his gear.* - Wed Oct 21 07:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) remained standing tall now as his armor seemed to crumble, layering the ground around hm of course. A simple nod was given to Asteroth as he assumed a jail cell would be more fitting. After all, blood on his hands wasn't required even if they did assault him and his Queen.

"Of course ma'am. Prison should be just fine." was all that was said by Ichiro before he rallied up the thugs and led them off to their newfound homes in prison.* - Wed Oct 21 07:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: . . . - Wed Oct 21 20:43:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Sounds unfortunate. Curious as to why you would choose Amegakure of all places. - Wed Oct 21 20:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: Not really...Kirigakure kicked me out, Suna wont let me in...Kumo is too boring, and Konohagakure is too weird. - Wed Oct 21 20:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) seemed to awake from his minor daze now, turning to let his eyes rest upon Asteroth and then shift onwards to the masked figure. Generally, anyone in a mask meant bad news, and therefore, Ichiro took extra precaution with his movements, slinking his way to a midpoint that seemed to be between Asteroth and this male, yet avoiding a possible interruption in their coversation.

A silence set over Ichiro. * - Wed Oct 21 20:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) thinks: He's too close. - Wed Oct 21 20:56:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku)  decided to begin his day by initiating a short training session. Ichiro proceeded to let himself motion off to find himself a villager in need. And of course, he found one. It seemed to be a farmer loading up a cart for the purpose of trade. With a thought in mind, Ichiro brought himself over to them, simply offering a helping hand. Soon, he found himself lifting up heavy crates and placing them amongst the cart. Moving at least two at a time, although he did see how many crates there were and how many carts, expecting this to take quite a while.

Still continued to assist the various farmers, letting himself work hard to pick up more crates. As Ichiro continued to help, he found himself doing more and more with ease. Right about now, the first cart was roughly halfway full and Ichiro had no troubles helping with the rest, finding that he was going to need to switch over to the other cart soon.

Sweated as he still assisted in the lifting of the crates. With each crate, Ichiro made sure to pass a short check over them, letting his eyes observe the locks and what not, making sure they weren't broken and that they'd remain closed. After doing so, he'd go on to place crates in duos on the cart, drawing forth little perspiration upon his forehead as he did so. His stamina barely beginning to deter however.

Ichiro played a game of foucs as he worked with the cargo, loading them on the crate at a safe speed for himself. Mainly due to the fact that he was trying not to overstrain his physical limits. Yet, as he lifted each box and felt its solid wood graze against his bare skin, he motioned forward and allowed each case to be set down upon the cart as needed, finding a rather safe position for each to set.

He was now onto the final grouping of crates as he proceeded to lift each one individually and place them on the last cart. He had noticed that there was only a single farmer as well, figuring that he was going to need assistance with the crates to move them out with ease. Keeping that in mind, once Ichiro had finished moving the crates he allowed himself to take place behind the first cart and heft up its handles, preparing to follow the lead farmer

Still pulling along the cart, Ichiro continued to watch the farmers movements, keeping on the same path. Yet, it was while he moved forward that he found it to be problematic. His arms struggling to keep a tight and comfortable grip on the wood, and even then, with all the weight he had trouble moving it forward. And thus, Ichiro realized that even villagers had better assets than Shinobi. It was possible that he'd see them in a better light now.

Ichiro proceeded onwards, tugging the cart behind him as he attempted to find some solace in his practice. The cart moving behind him of course, but with some difficulty. As Ichiro moved through the streets, he did find some resistance in the cart behind him. It was practically a heavy boulder that he was dragging with a single string, and definetly beginning to wear down on him.

Proceeding on the same path as the villager, his arms worked hard to keep the crate up behind himself as he moved onwards. Nothing had bothered him in this moment, other than the struggle he was having. A rage was beginning to build within him but regardless he found himself tugging along, the finishing point in sight.

Taxingly, Ichiro continued to lug around with the cart, pulling it onwards to the final point. He was obviously close to finishing the deed now, considering where the end mark was. Regardless, Ichiro continued to push forward, pulling the cart to the end of the road. Eventually his legs beginning to feel some strain as well from the long haul there.

Ichiro came to the end of the road now, leaving the cart down behind the first. Soon afterwards, he took a sigh and allowed himself to begin his stretches. Now that he'd finished his practice he found sweat building up on his body and had of course chosen to remove himself from the premise, taking himself on a path back to Amegakure's center, or possibly his training field should none be currently active.* - Thu Oct 22 02:09:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) simply listened to the words of Asteroth, making sure to implant every word into his mind as though it were a command program being applied to a robot. Once he had his instructions, he accepted the scroll, giving a cursory nod. 

"You will not be let down my Queen." With that, he'd simply aim to take leave with his designated partner.* - Thu Oct 22 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) exitted the boundaries of Amegakure now, beginning to break off into a sprint as he headed away from the rainy village. Proceeding to bring himself away from the area now he let his eyes cast over the surroundings, a stern expression resting upon his face as he moved along. Periodically, his eyes would shift to look over at his mission partner, only wondering what he could be about.

As Ichiro continued, he believed that the sea-port village that Asteroth had detailed wasn't very far off from Amegakure in reality. As he proceeded move forward though, he extended the hand holding the scroll ahead of himself, letting him get a good view of it before utilizing his belt strap to hold the delivery item now.

As Ichiro rolled forward however, he found the rainfall of Amegakure ceasing, coming to less and less amounts of the water falling upon him. Regardless, as Ichiro exitted the percipitation, he found himself in a humid atmosphere, his body beginning to layer itself with a golden sheen just as it always did when he began to perspirate himself. 

As Ichiro proceeded on the path that connected his homeland and this offset village though, he noticed a creeping in the woodline, finding his eyes tracking the movements of several large, dark, and ominous figures. Allowing himself to reach back and reveal a set of kunai, Ichiro attempted to line up his aim. Within only a few seconds he found himself throwing out his basic ninja tools, aiming to embed the 

Dispatching the shady figures that seemed to track along the road before himself, he found a slight pleasure in the sounds of bodies dropping and connecting with the ground around himself. Yet, as he moved, he wished there was some retaliation. However, they soon arrived within the village and Ichiro looked onwards for the target of course. Once finding them, he extended a hand with the scroll within it, giving it to the male.

Once he'd finished the task, he turned, making his way onwards back to Amegakure along with his new comrade, considering the trip should be rather easy on the way back.* - Thu Oct 22 04:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: Let's go. - Thu Oct 22 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: The delivery was a success my Queen. - Thu Oct 22 04:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) simply nodded. "Yes ma'am."

Ichiro of course continues to remain as cautious as ever, considering 'rest' to him was simply to do his job.* - Thu Oct 22 04:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: Yes, m'lady..... - Thu Oct 22 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) entered the woodline outside of Amegakure now as he proceeded to let his eyes look over the area ahead of himself. He recalled the tree that his blood stained, finding it to be rather sacred to him considering he'd formed an impromptu bond with it in his previous training sessions. A light nod before extending his right leg, proceeding forward with the same stride as usual. He easily walked forward now, following up the right leg with the left. Once Ichiro reached the tree, he allowed himself to bring a strong fist forward, punching directly into the wood.

Letting his eyes droop downwards to the ground, Ichiro peered at his legs position, finding his pose to be rather strong and defensive as he remained with the left arm close to his lower abdomen. His legs remained low, more specifically in a squatting position as he retracted his fist. With this, he found himself returning to a standing position. A turn in the body and he was angled to face the tree directly, assuming a grapplers position as he pressed forward, pushing his body against the wood, tackling it.

While Ichiro pushed onwards, his body didn't struggle at all for the moment. However, while he worked against it, his legs were set with the right being extended and his left being put forward, giving him stability. Once he'd began to apply force, he let some grunts escape from his own center. As he pushed himself to the limits however, both of his legs shifted amongst the grasslands, kicking up both grass and dirt as he did so.

Shifting his body now, Ichiro allowed his shoulder to be pressed even more into the tree as he let his arms wrap around the tree's thick mass. His naked chest brushing up agaisnt the bark of course, resulting in himself gaining a series of scratches amongst his skin. However, he had no worries against this considering he knew such a thing would never break his barrier, his wall, his skin.

Even heavier grunts came now as Ichiro's pores began to release his unnatural concoction dubbed sweat by his own personal standards. As he brushed up against the wood, his hair became matted, held down by the forces and sweat combined while he continued to press his own opposition on the bark. Nothing would pause his assault other than his stamina, and of course Ichiro planned to use his above average stamina pools to assist him.

A grind was set in place now and Ichiro could feel the tearing of his muscles as he worked them past their limits. His mind registered this and dished out the corresponding level of pain to each portion of his body. Of course, Ichiro disregarded this and continued to maul the still-standing tree, allowing himself to feel his arms and legs alike ache from his actions.

Ichiro's charge seemed to grow tiresome and he allowed himself this chance to pause and leave space between himself and the tree he once tackled. He now seemed to stand there in front of the tree, bearing various cuts and minor bruises. All of which hadn't done much to his ambition. Five seconds had passed, showing that Ichiro really did stick to this rule in his personal training sessions. After this five, he proceeded to rush into the wood once again, but not tackling this time. Rather, Ichiro pressed his fingertips to the bark, and then pushed the rest of the hand forward as it rolled and balled to form a strong fist, barely deterring the tree in front of his eyes.

Without hesitation, Ichiro unfurled his hand, pulled back, and then repeated his action again. A grunt came forward and he seemingly had begun a more lax and silent form of training as he began to feel the knuckles of his hand blister against the wood. Only one ambition coming upon him as he recalled the words of Baen. Basically, the intentions of this was to utilize the hand to become like that of a spear. Yet, his force had to be worked upon and thus made the tree before him the best target overall.

Now Ichiro believed he had the target of his practice in mind, bringing forth his other hand and imitating the exact same movements. Now Ichiro was applying force from both hands into two different points as he focused on the statue-like tree. His hands of course continuing to bury themselves within it. This was simply a more lax workout, and possibly the only one Ichiro would ever happen to have.

Still had his hands working, seeming to have never put them down ever since he vowed to defend his Queen. Regardless, Ichiro still applied his two strikes, developing his technique as he begins to go onwards. With the application of his fists, he found more blisters sprouting on his knuckles, another fruit of his labors.* - Fri Oct 23 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) casually enters the area, passing the two barricades that stayed to both is right and his left. As he arrived, he let his eyes cast out and look around at the three individuals, of course taking notice of Amegakure's villagers as well. But lastly, his eyes made it a point to keep Asteroth in focus. Remaining still, he felt that he should experiment with different guard types. This time, choosing the passive guard rather than the super defensive guard.* - Fri Oct 23 20:50:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) listened to Asteroth's words intently as he allowed himself to accept the missions. With that, he carried himself off to the east of Amegakure, believing that it was possible the two tasks were intertwined.* - Fri Oct 23 21:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) proceeded to initiate a bit of training on his way to the sawmill, allowing his legs to carry himself out and over the sandy path led from the innards of the village to the edge. A light jog took place of course and Ichiro seemed to inhale and exhale with each bounding step. However, it wasn't long before he could see the mill rising within his view, and simply came to let himself walk the rest of the way.

As Ichiro came closer to the sawmill, he noticed the problem quite easily. A bundle of logs had been stocked up and pretty much backed up the machine used for cutting. A grimace set on Ichiro's face but he figured he could handle the task with ease and simply allowed himself to walk over to it. A hand extended and he allowed for it to set on one of the various uncut trees, soon finding his hand applying force.

A turn of his body and he applied his other hand, pushing one of the logs off to the side now. His legs seemed to lock in place as well, refraining from making a sliding motion backwards of course. As his feet seemed to grip to the hard wood flooring behind him, he felt a shift within the wood that he was pushing against of course.

Once Ichiro had removed the top log from its placement, he found himself stepping back and observing how many were left. Of course, flinching a bit from the sound of the first bashing against the hard floor nearby. Now, with his eyes looking over, he could see one was stuck in the drop-off chute, which seemed to be the initial problem, and he noticed another set immediately within the point were newer logs were to come in.

A sigh from Ichiro and he moved towards the one at the end, figuring if he moved this one he could just easily push all the rest through. With that, Ichiro moved forward and applied bodyweight to the last one, finding it rather hard to remove it due to its positioning. Yet, he tried a different method, allowing himself to formulate a shell of gold on his arm and soon smashing it into the wood.

With that done, he'd possibly have broken the log, or shattered it enough to the point he could remove the top half of course. Howeverm with that, he allowed himself to move to the bottom of the drop off point, leaping downwards to it before simply setting himself against the rest of the log. A grapple was made, and Ichiro began to lift and pull towards himself as he backed away. 

Soon, Ichiro had easily removed the log from its opening, and of course found himself going back to a point where he could access the log at the beginning point. As he realized that the mill wouldn't work lest he removed the one already alotted into the cutting block, of course setting on the saw blade, Ichiro decided to begin by turning the machine on and pushing the log the rest of the way through.

After he'd done that he found himself standing at the opening and bringing forth the single log that remained. With himself pulling through however, he was unsure of how it would turn out, considering he was no lumberjack. Yet, he moved back to the end hatch and let himself look through, calling out for the lumber workers. "It's done, you can work again."

Once Ichiro had finished, and of course expected Zero to be done was well, Ichiro turned, looking back at the other mission scroll now as he tried to devise a plan for capturing a rhino. Regardless, he proceeded onwards to the last knonw location of the beast.* - Fri Oct 23 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) checked to make sure he did well at his job, of course looking over what he'd moved and made sure that each portion of the saw mill was fine. Or at least, up to the standard he believed was 'working condition.' Should there be any parts dented or broken, he'd do his best to shift them back into the correct state with pure physical strength.* - Fri Oct 23 22:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) found himself now standing at the last recorded location of the Rhino. Of course, this was the backyard of Rosaline's home, considering she was the last to have seen it. As he arrived, he simply approached the girl, asking a few questions. "Are there any discernable features...?"

However, as Ichiro asked this, he realized his stupidity and felt it was best to begin his search for tracks, not even waiting for an answer as he turned and cast his eyes over the grasslands. Of course, something such as rhino tracks weren't too hard to follow. And therefore, he moved out and began to look for the big creature.

As Ichiro came to a treeline however, he found destruction amongst the region. He proceeded to step forward into this and begin a sprint now as he looked for the large grey back that a rhino would sport of course. When he found himself standing not too far from the large animal, his eyes cast over its backside and he found himself tensing up, preparing a defense.

The silence seemed to sit for only a moment though as Ichiro called out. "HEY!" His intentions to gather the intention of the large rhino as he stood there. The beast turned, facing Ichiro now and the both of them seemed to pass out a few grunts, speaking the talk of brutes, no, giants. Giants in the terms of physical strength that was. Then they seemed to come to a point where they both centered in front of each other. 

Ichiro's eyes met the Rhino's and they both let another grunt escape and nodded. An agreement had been made without any actual vocal expression. An oddity between man and animal as such a thing was never seen in reality. Yet, a split second passed and the two bashed into each other, Ichiro casting his arms outwards to wrap around the head of the rhino while he felt the slick, smooth bone of his horn brush against his chest region. 

The two seemed to remain interconnected as Ichiro found himself sliding backwards, his feet seeming to kick up dirt and grunts escaping himself as he broke out into a sweat. A gold sheen coming off of him like some sort of aura of course. As Ichiro moved back, his individual legs seemed to kick up, attempting to find a spot where they could plant deep into the earth as he was pushed backwards. A turn of the head, and he noticed a tree coming up.

Ichiro's reply to this to help in assistance to stop this opposing force was simply to guide his sweat to four points on Ichiro's backside. As the sweat he created settled there, they began to build up, bundling outwards and forming several spikes off his backside, which with ease planted themselves in the ground, penetrating through the soft soil and giving him a hold point against the large creature. Ichiro's grunts only grew heavier though as it seemed he stopped the Rhino's push against himself.

Both beasts had come to a standpoint. Human skin grinding against a Steel shell of armor. To further benefit himself, Ichiro accessed his sweat once more, casting his golden armor to defend himself now as he let it shifted and fixate itself between him and the Rhino in this instance. Now the situation had changed for the better and simply left Golden Armor against the beast's Steel--Silver if you will---Armor. 

In Ichiro's mind, this was no longer a mission, but simply put, a test of his own strength as he continued to grind forward. The two opposing forces were having great difficulty in their wrestle. And Ichiro found that he could now use his positioning to get the upperhand, or rather, the underhand. His body lowered itself and attempted to get a better hold on the Rhino and push up against the body, his intentions to flip the creature, not onto its back, not over Ichiro, but onto its side.

The test of strength was rather relaxing to Ichiro, as he knew he was capable of passing. Of course tho, he continued to apply and never backed down, finding a great enjoyment in his actions as a smirk crossed his face, the beast he was working against proceeding to be hefted upwards by his actions. It was heavy indeed, but it couldn't counteract his holds in the event. 

The lift seemed to be even more taxing than his own forms of training and of course this taxed Ichiro greatly. He could find considerably that his stamina was being overpowered as he pushed up though. Even then however, Ichiro let his mind do all the work, keeping him in the zone now as he pushed upwards and yet, he was still struggling. Pushing himself to unknown boundaries as he let his actions cast him into a state of mindlessness, a state of brutality and pain for himsef. The Rhino was no longer a target to capture but simply a target to beat as it had proven itself to be the dominant figure. And Ichiro of course, wanted to become that figure in this instance. 

Yet, now it seemed that he could feel the beast's stamina coming to an all-time low, and he had outlasted it as he felt its weight fall against his form, slumping downwards to the ground as he continued to hang on. As it dropped, he let his body shift and get from underneath it, now becoming level once again. His hands continued to hold onto it and the strain of his body was greatly taxing him as he breathed extremely hard, inhaling and exhaling as he went along.

Of course, with the drop in the animal, Ichiro found himself wrapping his arms around the body of the Rhino and beginning to pull it in the direction he'd come from, his spikes having had broken long ago with his armor. And he still never realized this fact. The fact that his back hand been up against the tree and he was defeated long before he fell into the thought of a test. Regardless, he attempted to return the prized pet to the owner.

As Ichiro did his pull, he expected his partner Zero to assist and of course he found it rather hard even with assistance. Passing the treeline, he could see the home of Rosaline nearby and of course brought himself to the point of returning it. His sweat still cascading his skin as though he always had a new layer that consisted of a sticky chemical combination and a bad smell as a result. 

Once he made it to the backyard of the girl's home however, Ichiro let go of the beast, not -dropping- it per say, but letting it settle the most of its weight lightly. Besides the minor scrapes and bruises the drag would've given it though, he hadn't truly harmed the beast in his actions. And as he looked to Rosaline, he of course stated, "Nice pet. I enjoyed my time with him." Then he turned, leaving without even worrying for his reward as he found himself coming to await Zero's company. Should Zero join him though, they would of course return to their Queen, which Ichiro figured would be pleased with the completion of his tasks.* - Fri Oct 23 23:27:08 2015
