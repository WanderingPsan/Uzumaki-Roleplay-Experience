<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: I have no idea where to get one of those... - Sat Oct 24 15:56:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I can go buy you a suit then. - Sat Oct 24 15:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Is there one you'd like specifically? - Sat Oct 24 15:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Nope. - Sat Oct 24 15:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: So it doesn't matter? - Sat Oct 24 15:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Yea. - Sat Oct 24 15:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Just a bathing suit. - Sat Oct 24 15:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Or swim, whatever. - Sat Oct 24 15:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: This is practically naked. - Sat Oct 24 16:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) allowed himself to turn, facing Baylea. He observed her for the moment. He seemed unphased in reality. "Just as we've all come into this world."* - Sat Oct 24 16:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Right. - Sat Oct 24 16:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Keep the Bathing suit. - Sat Oct 24 16:10:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Thanks I guess. - Sat Oct 24 16:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) turned his eyes back towards the water, assuming it was rather rude of himself to just stand there like a bum. Therefore, he simply removed the pants and belt---considering that was all he wore---and stepped into the water himself. He then turned his visage to Index and simply stated.

"Ah. Safe travels, sir."* - Sat Oct 24 16:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Have fun. - Sat Oct 24 16:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: So ichiro. - Sat Oct 24 16:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: How about we get out and train? - Sat Oct 24 16:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: I'm not one for relaxing really. - Sat Oct 24 16:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: And you seem to be a fighter. - Sat Oct 24 16:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Not really, unless my Queen is endangered. - Sat Oct 24 16:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: But I suppose I could train some more. - Sat Oct 24 16:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Alright. - Sat Oct 24 16:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: So, What did you have in mind? - Sat Oct 24 16:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Hm.. - Sat Oct 24 16:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Let's get out. - Sat Oct 24 16:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) exitted the waters now, simply reapplying his select choice of clothing.* - Sat Oct 24 16:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Anyways. - Sat Oct 24 16:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Shall we spar here? - Sat Oct 24 16:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: If you'd like. - Sat Oct 24 16:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) simply opened his palm, allowing his sweat to exit his pores and form his spear. A simple nod coming afterwards.

"As always, ladies first."* - Sat Oct 24 16:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: So neat. - Sat Oct 24 16:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Let's simply clash blades for now. - Sat Oct 24 16:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) simply observed as Baylea seemed to approach him. He recognized her technique from the days prior, but of course this made no difference to him though as he simply reacted by raising his spear, of course holding it as a defense. Yet, when Baylea's blade met with it, the golden tool seemed to break in half against her strikes. Ichiro's expression simply remained the same as he took each half in each opposing hand. They were still useful somewhat. Regardless, he moved forward at the female, presenting the right end to make a slashing motion across the chest region.

Of course he expected a block or counter.* - Sat Oct 24 16:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed as his improvised weapon had been turned to brittle pieces, making it entirely useless. However, the kick to his gut of course had some force behind it now and he simply found himself making a short stumble. A grunt of sort coming from him though as he now let his eyes look down upon the left end that he still held. A light nod and he simply stepped in towards the female again, aiming to make a cutting motion down the length of her arm.* - Sat Oct 24 16:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) didn't have to look to know that he was countered, finding his attack to be void. Her speed was incredible indeed, especially against this brute and therefore he simply found himself being pushed back and a cut forming upon his chest, but noticably not deep at all. The strike to the gut simply left him in a backing motion, standing somewhat stunned for a moment. A result of repeated damage to the area rather than pure strength. He did however, observe, looking for a chance to retaliate.* - Sat Oct 24 16:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) remained still, finding Baylea's leap to be out of his bounds. This was something that required range and reflex, one of which he was still lacking within. Therefore, he had of course taken another cut to the chest as a result of this. As Ichiro stood there, his chest didn't ache all too much, considering his durability had somewhat approved in the last few days. Regardless however, this pulled him away from his stun.

His simply reaction was a smirk and a step back, observing the female for a moment before pushing inwards to make a simple strong right kick.* - Sat Oct 24 16:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) simply observed and listened as she seemed to take the time to speak. In this instance casting chakra throughout his sweat glands to allow his golden concoction to seep from the skin. The combination of this and oxygen soon causing this all to thicken and harden. Of course however, Ichiro allowed himself to spit out some chakra to join this force. This was a simple reaction meant to meet the female's blade when she came in to deal damage, of course however, he understood that his defensive layer would only crumble at the attack, but he stll believed it should have been enough for now. There was no offensive retaliation however.* - Sat Oct 24 17:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: Wow. - Sat Oct 24 17:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: That's amazing. - Sat Oct 24 17:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed as his golden layer crumbled away. The result of his technique regardless of damage, but of course he'd been struck once more. Acceptance was the cut was all he could do, finding that their meetings would more than likely be like this on many meetings. A step back was taken when she spoke however.

A nod, and then a response. "Thank you. You're very fast."* - Sat Oct 24 17:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) followed after her, having nothing to say in response. She was, after all, his only entertainment while his Queen slept.* - Sat Oct 24 17:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Guess everyone is asleep. - Sat Oct 24 17:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It seems so. - Sat Oct 24 17:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: So ichiro. - Sat Oct 24 17:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Hm? - Sat Oct 24 17:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Why'd you become a guard for your queen? - Sat Oct 24 17:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I felt it was necessary. - Sat Oct 24 17:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I had no purpose, and that seemed like the best role for me. - Sat Oct 24 17:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: And now with her...Well...I have purpose, one could say. - Sat Oct 24 17:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: I see. - Sat Oct 24 17:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: That's good. - Sat Oct 24 17:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: My shoji's only purpose is pretty much me. - Sat Oct 24 17:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Interesting. - Sat Oct 24 17:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: He seems like a good man from what I've seen. - Sat Oct 24 17:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: He is. - Sat Oct 24 17:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Ah. - Sat Oct 24 17:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Hm. - Sat Oct 24 17:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: If I may ask, what did you two do before coming to Amegakure? - Sat Oct 24 17:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Lived in a small house. - Sat Oct 24 17:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Outside of any villages. - Sat Oct 24 17:30:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Interesting lifestyle choice. - Sat Oct 24 17:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Very. - Sat Oct 24 17:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Mmm.. - Sat Oct 24 17:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: So, ichiro. - Sat Oct 24 17:38:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) simply turned to look at his Queen, nodding as he simply stated, "I've been training myself physically, this should be much easier for me." With that, he proceeded to carry himself off to the outskirts of the village, searching for a point he believed would be good for at least one watchtower.* - Sun Oct 25 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: :O - Sun Oct 25 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) came to a point on the outskirts of Ameagakure as he proceeded to look around, settling his eyes on a point to the north-east of the road. This of course seemed to be a rather good point for him to begin his work at. To begin, Ichiro simply allowed himself to expell sweat from his pores as he looked down at the small area.

Of course however, Ichiro only forms about two at a time, simply alloweing himself to move around the center and making a wide box round. As he did so, he shoved each and every one of his spikes immediately into the ground to signify where to build and where to set down the workload. Within only a few minutes, Ichiro had finished making a set zone to work in.

Afterwards, Ichiro seemed to wave, calling forth a supply crew to drop off the workload that he'd be utilizing. Ichiro himself had no care that only he and Zero would be working upon this, as it did merit him with more physical labor and left him with a chance to train and work at the same time. Now with the supplies required for him to form a base platform to work with, Ichiro simply took up a great pose, allowing himself to spread his legs and lower himself into a squatting position. Both of his hands clenched into fists and met at the knuckle. Soon, his stone-like face became a grimace, one of pain that should' e been unbearable. A mild yell escaped Ichiro though as he began to call out and let himself express his pain.

Ichiro now stood there in a new state, one beyond the normal nature of mankind as his muscles flexed and his strength seemed to supply itself at a heightened state. A grunt and a hard nod, creating a neck-snapping sound as he did so. Then with that, he simply stepped forward and applied his strength to one of the boards and so forth that would supply him the foundation of the watch-tower and kunai-launcher. A tug and a pull, and eventually he allowed this all to shift and enter the position needed. 

While he set a foundation, he also worked with a barricade. Placing some of the wood given on the outskirts of his very own spikes as a meants to keep a wall between Amegakure's edge and the outter world. A defense was being placated and Ichiro's only hopes and ambitions were to leave this one as durable as he was, if not, more durable considering it was to be the front line of defense against all outsiders.

As Ichiro seemed to continued to set in the installments, he knew that his power was strianing him, draining away at his stamina faster than normal. But he did not care, purely due to the fact that he felt like an entirely new man. Keeping on the same track, he eventually shifted the weight of the necessary product from one stack to whatever point needed a placement to complete the first foundation.

Now of course, Ichiro set his eyes on the other side of the road, finding a need to shift his body from this side to the next and simply moving in to access the same spear technique again. Of course with that, he proceeds to put down each spike into the ground again, imitating his previous acts with the first side and of course setting a boundary for the Watchtower's foundation. 

Eventually Ichiro found himself moving back and forth between his pile of logs and the edges of the boundaries now as he began to set each within its place. Each log that he lifted and shifted around, moved from the pile and brought to fixate together and create the square boundaries that would soon grow upwards into a large and powerful tower.

Once he'd completed this action, Ichiro took a step back and allowed himself to take a look at his great work, allowing himself a moment to simply exhale a simple breath and exit his enhanced state. The result simply Ichiro standing still, still appearing as durable as ever, even with the pain that seemed to be shooting through his form on the inside. For now however, he was just fine, understanding that he could easily recover with a bit of rest. Something he rarely recieved you could say.

Now as Ichiro finished his end of the task, he simply turned back, leaving both Watchtower and Kunai-Launcher placement alike ready for builders to come in and complete. His legs simply carried him over to Zero's side once the two of them had finished the job and he simply allowed himself to look around, accepting the fact that the task was possibly, the easiest of all their tasks.* - Sun Oct 25 01:42:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) found himself coming up to one of the tree's in Amegakure's forest once again. As Ichiro stepped up to it, he brandished his knuckles, bearing his hands in the form of fists as he looked at the normal mark left by his brute strength. Turning his head to the side, Ichiro spit, allowing a gold to cover a bit of the grass before solidifying. Another shift in Ichiro's position and he took up what he believed to be a boxer's stance. He seemed to grow light on his feet but heavy on the upper body as he bounced back and forth on his toes, and kept his arms held up, focusing them in front of his chest as both a defense and offense.

Of course as he bounced from right to left, keeping on the ends of his feet, he found it rather hard to balance out like this. A motion forward and it seemed more like a stumble. Yet, Ichiro caught himself, bringing his form back up just in time to make the connection with the tree--correctly of course. A jab went out and his right fist had struck the tree, bringing nothing but bare skin in this instance.

The first connection between wood and skin sent a force throughout Ichiro's hands and arms, but he was durable enough to withstand the power, finding it rather easy for himself to deal with the results. A pull back of his arm and he was now in his basic 'Boxer' pose. A puff of air escaped his lips and he proceeded to shoot out the left arm, letting it scrape wood. A turn of the hips and he was thrusting his right fist in. A few seconds in and he had sparked up his pattern, effectively carrying out a pattern of right and left hooks into the tree.

Continuing to trade each punch, a grunt followed. A grunt to show how hard Ichiro was working to succeed at his goal of getting stronger. He simply continued to buffet the tree with a series of strikes from both ends of his body, turning his arms into pistons, and his fists into an object of pure destruction launched forward by these machines. Each movement simply seemed to bring a higher level of heat unto Ichiro until he was eventually sweating in his place. However, this did nothing to hinder him.

As he worked against the tree, he found it taxing a bit, working against his stamina but of course, Ichiro had no care for such a thing. Even if others hadn't seen his power, he was obviously an incredibly hard worker. He beared no titles, and worked against the forces of nature to appease himself and increase his strength with his training efforts. Of course, this was also to benefit his stance training as he wished to utilize a boxer's style.

His arms motoned back and forth non-stop, allowing for himself to access both limbs against the tree. Now pulling back, he focused on performing a series of four. The startup being a Right-Straight followed by a Left. The third step seemed to be a right hook and then eventually a an uppercut utilizing the lingering left.

A followthrough was made and Ichiro continued to imitate the same action. The same pattern stayed and he followed it to the T. Right-Straight, Left-Straight, Right-Hook, Left-Uppercut. It was almost like he was inputting a combo for an arcade game as he still bounded around on the tips of his toes. The more he went on, the more he appeared like a boxer of course, getting better at achieving the appearance and stance as he moved around.

Bounding around the wooden giant on his feet, he knew that while a Boxer's upper body had to be strong, their lower body needed to be quick and fast, making it easier for him to adjust to new stances and of course come with a quick rebound. A lower of his own body and Ichiro found himself creating a fierce uppercut, the bare bone of his knuckles scraping against this wood in the same instance as he did such. Continuing his practice, he swayed from side to side, back and forth.

His training was so vigilant, so true, and of course, everso fluent as he found himself sparking up damage in the tree. A change in the bark after each strike he threw directly into it. He could feel the merit of his training as he sparked up a newfound strength and applied even more power than before. It seemed he was beginning to get up there with an actual boxer, doing much more to help himself.

A dropback and now Ichiro was out of the tree's range. Yet he still continued to bound around on his feet. An observation of the tree allowed him to recognize the damage he'd delt to the tree. However, Ichiro quickly moved back inwards after a moment and proceeded to deal a great deal of damage once again. His combat had easily begun once more as he began to deal eveen more damage to the tree.

His stepback had simply been a break of sorts for him, but he of course wasn't fully re-energized one could say. However, regardless his stamina allowed him to uphold the pose and force him to continue his practices. This time, as he went back in to throw more punches, his upperbody seemed to lean inwards allowing him to thrust a few punches with a much shorter range. He no longer followed the original combo and now used a set of body to body blows, throwing these back to back.

The low punches seemed to have a lot of force behind them, even without the wind-up range and room to pull back. Continuing with this, he seemed to place his head against the tree. Still applying his fists into the work. However, since he was bracing himself against the tree, he no longer added movement and kept his feet set down against the ground. His mouth remaining agape as he seemed to keep expelling his breath into the world. Inhaling after each.

Sticking to this, Ichiro found his sweat continuing to roll down his body for the moment until he eventually took a step back. Without wasting any time whatsoever he was now back onto the tips of his toes, folllowing that same boxer movement of bounding from left to right or right to left. Even then though, his arms never stopped working and simply adjusted their range, dealing a few more blows at the normal, expected range. While he did such however he glided around the tree, drawing a line in the dirt as he did so.

Ichiro's movements had eventually formed a circle in place around the tree, forming a 'Boxer's Circle' if you will. In reality this was now his own idea of how one should move. How one should act actually, in the line of combat. Soon, another breath escaped from him and he came to a stop as he looked on and figured that it was best for him to take his rest or rather call it a day for now as he expected for himself to begin some sense of social interaction. Regardless he found a sense of enjoyment from the pain that rested in his fists, or rather his whole body. It was simply the result of his training, which had indeed pleased him.* - Mon Oct 26 02:06:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: True. - Mon Oct 26 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) approached his usual training target, a tree within the woods of Amegakure. A palm was raised and pressed against the wood of the tree as Ichiro seemed to sigh, finding it incredible how they'd gone through so much to get so strong. In his mind, he believed that the tree too trained from their encounters and had of course been growing and becoming stronger just as Ichiro did. Pulling back his palm, Ichiro entered the boxer pose he'd entered plenty of times before. Both arms remained raised, curling just a bit as his hands hovered in front of his face. In the same isntance he bounded around on the ends of his feet.

Ichiro had done some reading, and had of course learned that in practice, power wasn't required, just form. As a result he simply made two quick jabs, applying minimal strength. Of course each connection felt like he was knocking on wood--considering he was-- while he felt the splinters left from prior sessions. To start though, he didn't even alternate between hands. Each strike was a simple left jab into the tree before soon backing out. 

Once Ichiro stepped back in however, he switched up sides, allowing his right arm to take the forward front, meaning his left side was being defended now. Each jut of his arm resulted in a right-straight into the wooden structure. The serious expression on Ichiro's face showing a determination considering this was to benefit his defensive ability. Even with such a short amount of time passing by, a sweat cascaded over Ichiro's forehead. However he wasn't tired, and more than likely nervous about his taijutsu ability.

With himself continuing to perform the active strikes on the tree, Ichiro proceeded to follow a pattern of switching back and forth. Each strike he began to swap sides in every instance giving an equal workout with both his left and right jabs. His movements never faltered as he kept on his toes, remaining just as agile as ever while he moved around the tree, now utilizing his legs to circle the tall organic giant.

A pause was made as Ichiro made a switch in the pattern, still starting of which a few jabs but now applying the entirety of his body. Jabs from both sides of his body struck the tree, starting with three then transitioning to a right hook before his left hand ended the combination with an uppercut. Of course though, as he dished out his strikes he kept his movements short and his stride close to the tree. Eventually, he came to a stop, settling his position for a stand as he dropped his arms to his side. He was sure that he'd developed his Boxer skills to good level of use, being an amateur at best.* - Mon Oct 26 22:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) allowed himself to stand alone in place, simply casting his golden spit from his body and allowing it to touch against the ground. Of course this was imbued with chakra, eventually forming into Ichiro's signature dual-spiked rods. A spear-like object for his own usage obviously. In the same instance, he began to cast out a layer of sweat upon his skin and utilize it to his advantage. The focus of this to create a thick shell while he weilded his singular rod.* - Mon Oct 26 23:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) still providing a great amount of bodily fluids and chakra, Ichiro seemed to leak gold from within his pores as he looked down upon the ground. Extending his reach, he planted his spike into the ground, finding the similarity with a spear as he looked upon it. As he stood there, he pondered on the thought of Asteroth's order for one as well, unsure of whether or not one would come for him. Regardless, he continued to prepare sweat for his armor and use spit to make multiple spears.* - Mon Oct 26 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) found another layer of gold taking place now on his skin, planting what seemed to be his sixth rod into the ground around himself. This was pretty much an informal practice, showing a sense of boredom in Ichiro as he did all of this. There was quite obviously, nothing to do whatsoever.* - Mon Oct 26 23:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) accessed his chakra once more as his layer of armor broke. Another bundle of sweat began to leak from his organic skin as he continued to spit spikes into the landmass before him. His usage of his own custom technique not really bothering him all too much--of course that's disregarding how much it'd harmed his chakra reserves at the moment.* - Mon Oct 26 23:46:20 2015
