<br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) smirked when he was capable of seeing the nature of the attack. It was the employment of various shinobi tools in a rather quick and easy manner. Although, this made it all that much easier on Ichiro. It was understandable that his stance was one without any form of guard, but that was in terms of Boxing.

His form hunched over more, letting his arms move to cover the leg region while he attempted to avoid any damage to the face---which was impossible. His next tactic simply being the application of his chakra. His focus switched from his pores, and moved into his mouth.

Ichiro projected spit, letting it touch down amongst the ground as he allowed a wall of pure, liquid gold to solidify before his eyes in an attempt to defend against the rest of the kunai and shuriken. Meanwhile, his overall form seemed to be fine. What had made its way to his body beforehand either barely cutting into him or having been stopped by the sturdiness of his skin.

Regardless though, he continued to hang low behind his golden wall, preparing another spout of chakra within.* - Mon Nov 23 19:15:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) remained still while his chakra churned. However, there was something he couldn't quite counter. A churning in the groun beneath himself had begun to spark up and eventually--Spikes had come from within the ground, driving home for Ichiro's legs. 

His smirk remained and he proceeded to make a driving movement forward, planning to make use of his wall. Of course however, he would've been struck by these spikes and damage would be done, but not enough to deter his assault. A light gasp sparked from within as he continued onwards.

Even then however, he allowed himself to take this chance to release his chakra. His spit shot straight outwards, moving directly into his hands now as it soon shaped out into a dual-ended spear. Holding this single spear in one hand, he motioned upwards and touched on his wall, sticking close for only a second before moving back towards the ground--more specifically, somewhere away from the spikes.

When he came to this point, he found himself accessing his mentality. A call for additional power and speed in reality. A single 'lock' came undone and clattered against the nonexistant floor of his mind. He had now passed through, the Gate of Opening.* - Mon Nov 23 19:26:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) had only just awoken from his trance, looking out across to those who seemed to be rushing to the aid of a female. Their relationship mattered not to Ichiro, nor why they were doing so, but it seemed to him that the single male they spoke to was simply doing no harm---at least physically. Mentally, his words may have hurt someone.

Regardless, Ichiro only observed, keeping his place. Afterall, he wasn't one to take action unless provoked. Rather, he began to smirk at their actions. It's possible he would need to make a move---only at the command of the Raikage however.* - Tue Nov 24 01:04:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed as Arihs seemed to return, assuming that it was an escape attempt in progress--and that his mentality had been the reason he would employ such a stupid method of escape. Ichiro did not hesitate. He'd only recently been hired by the Raikage, but he assumed that this would be a given task for him.

A few strides forward and he moved off the wall, bounding out into the open as he could now line up directly with Arihs. His body had no need to turn, and therefore only his head did. It cocked back a bit, and chakra seemed to apply itself to his saliva.

This process happened rather fast of course. When it was completed, Ichiro proceeded to launch his chakra immediately at the white-haired fellow. This entire deal intended to impale the figure with a liquid gold-turned-solid rod. It would of course, travel quite some distance.

Afterwards, Ichiro simply stated, "Someone place a bounty on him for one yen. That way my time doesn't go to waste."* - Tue Nov 24 02:19:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Why not? - Tue Nov 24 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) proceeded onwards, now moving in towards Arihs. His idocy getting to him a bit. But rather, it did give Ichiro some sense of happiness as he found retaliation. It sparked something he loved, that being combat. His stride carried him forward now, not even attempting to utilize another jutsu as he closed the range.

Ichiro focused his eyes direcly on Arihs, recognizing the usage of ninjutsu. His shoulders however, seemed to lower and his arms swayed from side to side though. He wasn o longer in a normal run, but letting his arms slink after him while he ran forth.* - Tue Nov 24 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...because we are in public. - Tue Nov 24 02:30:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Menma, I think I'm going to rest for a bit. - Tue Nov 24 02:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) continued to make his rush forward, hearing the words of Arihs. Although, it didn't change the fact that he was going to apprehend the fool. It just changed -how- he was going to do so. His limp arms returned to a more useful state--in appearance that is. 

When he closed the range, he simpyl allowed himself to lower himself and bring his body in towards Arihs lower half. The intent to wrap both arms around the male and heft him up over his own shoulder.

"Good. You saved yourself some broken bones. Those escorts didn't let you go, and you know it. Run away again and I won't be so lenient."

Afterwards, Ichiro would return him to the escorts and leave them there.* - Tue Nov 24 02:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: We will stay here till we hear back news from Ortho of his army. - Tue Nov 24 02:37:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) stood there with his titan-like posing, holding his arms crossed, tightly against his chest. His eyes looked out into the immediate area before himself, of course taking note of Eri and her smoking habits. Ichiro had smelled the substance and proceeded to take a few steps forward, somewhat intrigued by it. He'd never smoked before and didn't plan on such, but felt a need to learn.

"If I may ask, what is that you're smoking?"* - Tue Nov 24 14:50:01 2015

It was only a natural response for Ichiro.* - Tue Nov 24 15:03:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I assumed this Heiwa had some power, seeing as he was given the rank of Special Jounin when I was there. - Tue Nov 24 15:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: But Genjutsu... - Tue Nov 24 15:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I didn't suspect that. - Tue Nov 24 15:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: Impressive... To think someone so young could obtain that.... - Tue Nov 24 15:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Yes. - Tue Nov 24 15:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: It's fair to say. - Tue Nov 24 15:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: If you look at the triggers for his Genjutsu. - Tue Nov 24 15:36:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: The other children I know nothing about. - Tue Nov 24 15:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I've only seen two of the other in combat. - Tue Nov 24 15:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: The red head-female, and the other girl. Their abilities are unknown, but if they are anything li-.. Hm, what were they able to do? - Tue Nov 24 15:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: One chose only to use a tanto--I have a feeling she is incapable of jutsu usage---and the other...I assume you've heard the name Baen before? - Tue Nov 24 15:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I'm afraid I haven't. - Tue Nov 24 15:39:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Incredibly durable compared to the average shinobi. - Tue Nov 24 15:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Manipulated . . .His bones? - Tue Nov 24 15:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Indeed. - Tue Nov 24 15:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Which child?  - Tue Nov 24 15:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I only recall him having white hair. - Tue Nov 24 15:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: White hair.. - Tue Nov 24 15:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: The shinoi of Kumogakure cannot afford to slack off. - Tue Nov 24 15:42:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: No. - Tue Nov 24 15:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I see. Then let us return to our respective positions. I'm going to go train now. - Tue Nov 24 15:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) nodded, removing himself from the room now.* - Tue Nov 24 15:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) remained in his cool, calm, and composed stance. There was nothing to warrant Ichiro to spark any interest in violence currently. No matter how much he loved to fight, he wouldn't do it without reason. Regardless, when Kana arrived he set sights on her for the tenth of a second. 

The rest of that second spent upon him shying away. His head turning as he attempted to hide his face from the world. There was only so many people that he knew would have it out for him. Obviously, he assumed this would be one.

His hand reached up for his collar and proceeded to pull it upwards, covering a majority of his face with it. At least from the side.* - Tue Nov 24 16:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Too early. - Tue Nov 24 16:26:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: I heard sexual pleasures can assist in bypassing them. - Tue Nov 24 16:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Engi. - Tue Nov 24 16:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed as she extended her hand. Considering he didn't know of her to be royalty, he assumed it was for a handshake. Yet, there was an urge for him to kiss the hand. It was somewhat noticable that his head moved for such a bit before stopping. 

Once he regained his composure, he simply let his own hand reach out and take hers up to complete the handshake.* - Tue Nov 24 17:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) looked slightly startled--odd for him considering he always wore a stone-cold look otherwise. "No, but I've been there in the past."* - Tue Nov 24 17:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: No, I don't smoke. I just wanted to know what gave off that aroma. - Tue Nov 24 17:07:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It's the only village that'll allow me to stay a while. - Tue Nov 24 17:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) didn't even hesitate for a moment as the raging wave was launched towards himself and Eri. The reasoning behind it mattered not, and didn't truly concern Ichiro as he proceeded to allow himself to open his mouth, cocking his head back a bit. He'd then proceed to spit forward and allow a barrier to erect upon the ground in front of himself.

His intentions were to completely defend himself and Eri, or at least split the wave and cause it to deviate from its pathway of course.* - Tue Nov 24 17:38:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) proceeded to plant the flatside of his palms against the rock wall before pushing against it. This propelled him forward a bit, sending him into a short walk as he began to head towards Kumogakure's precious shopping center. He figured there were some items of value there.* - Tue Nov 24 19:46:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) allows himself to spark up some abundance of chakra within his body. As he remains still, he proceeds to access his pores with this. Letting it take over his sweat, it soon began to seep through his skin in the form of sweat. Afterwards, Ichiro produced a golden shell over his body. This was a simple defensive shell, which was noticably already beginning to crack.* - Wed Nov 25 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) continued to manipulate his chakra. His body continuosly surging throughout his sweat glands and so forth. His body began to ooze its golden product like it was nothing. Each bead rolling down his body before hardening into the shell, reparing it with each go.* - Wed Nov 25 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) continued to access the technique, letting himself remain still as his golden shell impaired both his vision and hearing. Sweat came from all across his body and made an open defense against ninjutsu and any other physical attacks. He was rather impervious in this case.* - Wed Nov 25 00:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) remained still as his body leaked even more of this golden fluid. To him, it was quite valuable, but he was unsure of whether or not anyone else would purchase this substance. Regardless though, he pondered on the thought of creating shells of his gold just to sell them to someone. It didn't matter to him though as he simply continued to generate a few.* - Wed Nov 25 00:58:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) continued to actively produce this golden shell, letting himself rest as he stayed his place. His body continuosly letting his chakra ooze from his form as he remained steady and still. Each shell had quite easily taken over his body and left him blind to the outside world while he stood there.* - Wed Nov 25 01:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) oozed more chakra from his skin, letting it encase his outer layer. With each bundle of chakra, he found his shell cracking away before the new one came in. It was almost like a snake shedding its skin in this case. However, Ichiro's application of the jutsu seemed rather simple and easy for himself.* - Wed Nov 25 01:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) allowed himself to travel from Kumogakure to his home village.* - Wed Nov 25 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) comes to a slow, pausing his motions as he stares directly at Baylea. He recognized the female, recalling her event within Amegakure before. His eyes looked her over, calmly and coolly as he assumed that she wouldn't recognize him considering he'd manipulated his appearance.

Rather than speaking, he gave a slight nod and a wave.* - Wed Nov 25 03:32:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: .... - Wed Nov 25 03:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Something's changed... - Wed Nov 25 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I have a question. - Wed Nov 25 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Do you know who controls this village now? - Wed Nov 25 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: What is this village? - Wed Nov 25 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: ...Amegakure. - Wed Nov 25 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: No. - Wed Nov 25 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I see. - Wed Nov 25 03:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Thank you. - Wed Nov 25 03:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Amnesia...That seems likely. - Wed Nov 25 03:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) simply stepped off to the side, seeing that Baylea was walking towards something---not him of course. He'd turn and observe both figures.* - Wed Nov 25 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) continued to stare at the two for a while, having an odd suspicion. This wasn't the first time he'd seen someone change and have Amegakure be involved. Although, he wasn't sure it was within Amegakure that Baylea had changed.

Nor was he sure on if she really changed or had some mental mishap. It just seemed to him that she was out of it all. Regardless, Ichiro did the unexpected---at least for him, and smiled. He smirked to the two women and gave a light wave as he proceeded to exit the area.

"Have a nice day."* - Wed Nov 25 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Nah, just bored you know. - Wed Nov 25 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) walked down the tiled pathway to Konohagakure's first and most eccentric site. His eyes scaled across the ground and eventually fell upon the statue before branching off. His eyes lingered on Abraxas and then eventually fell upon Kida. He had a feeling that his former-and-still ally wouldn't recognize him.

As he came to a pause, he allowed himself to take a deep breath before letting his shoulders lower, his arms becoming lax. It was a settled position, oen that didn't merit any form of antagonization. But to him, it was one that prepared him just on the off-hand. It was only due to his danger-sense.

Regardless, he spoke with his deep voice. "Hello."* - Wed Nov 25 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) only returned the wave, not really caring for the leave that Abraxas had chosen to take. If anything, it was beneficial to Ichiro.* - Wed Nov 25 03:57:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Got kicked out of Kumo too? - Wed Nov 25 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: No. - Wed Nov 25 04:05:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: These villages think they're the higher power---the good, if you will. - Wed Nov 25 04:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I plan for that to change. - Wed Nov 25 04:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I plan for them to see how much they've turned away and how much that's harmed the world. - Wed Nov 25 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So, a revolution or something? - Wed Nov 25 04:07:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: To ensure that things go well and we don't get eliminated before we set plans in motion. - Wed Nov 25 04:09:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: All I ask is that you find someone well versed in genjutsu. - Wed Nov 25 04:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Don't inform them of the revolution or of me. - Wed Nov 25 04:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Just let me know if you see anyone with such abilities. - Wed Nov 25 04:12:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) simply stood there amongst the dirt of Kumogakure, letting his stern, stone-cold face observe the two as they interacted. Ichiro himself felt no need to speak, nor make his presence known. However, his eyes did remain on the two for the moment.

He snorted, much like a bull as he stood there.* - Thu Nov 26 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) shifted hsi face a bit, almost as if he had an itch that he didn't feel like reaching for. Regardless, as he remained cool and collected, he didn't believe anyone would recognize him. Yet--There was an exception to a disguise. Family would be the weakness to any disguise in reality.  Ichiro's hard expression softened for a second before returning to normal and he gave a light chortle.

"Hello."* - Thu Nov 26 03:53:48 2015
