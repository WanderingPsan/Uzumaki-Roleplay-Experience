<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) joined both of his allies in the search for thsi average opponent to Amegakure. Of course, with untrainied senses Ichor could only find his eyes to be drifting around the area as he searched for her. Ichiro however remained his state of silence the entire tim,e listening to his mother unil he noticed that she was yet to be called in his life.

Anguo simply stood there now, weeping for the woman and of f course letting his eyes shift around the room. The implications telling him that the dogs would tear away at Anguo's skeletons more than flared up from the thought. A slly step forward he too was looking around the village, expecting the ebemy to just step forward and unleash Anguo's wereabouts and the enemies.

However, as Ichiro remained, he observed Mizumi making quick work of the villagers alongside Sado. There was a certain sense of darkness that he could feel emit from the two, both of course as Ichiro stood there, he could do nothing to counter but just hang back, awaiting the two of them as he seemed to retain that same seriousness and play a defensive role for his party members.* - Tue Oct 27 02:59:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) continued to observe the actions of both Nigen and Mizumi alike, finding it incredibly disheartening how these two seemed to conduct themselves upon the mission. Ichiro, a proud resident of Amegakure could easily identify Asteroth's butler without problem. Especially with the description she had given prior to them leaving. A simply scan over the area and Ichiro let his palm expand, forming a simply dual-edged spear with his chakra and sweat alike. Casting his eyes around, he simply hefted the weapon up as his eyes seemed to focus in on tall, black-haired individuals. Of course, he disregarded the ones lit aflame.

"Give me a moment."

And of course, his eyes soon locked target, pushing Ichiro's ar forward as he seemed to launch his tool within a short moment, stabbing directly into the back of the man implied in his Queen's description. He was unsure of whether or not he was dead and made no movements to check. He just figured the man laying still on the ground was enough for him. It was up to the others if they wanted to give him a look over.* - Tue Oct 27 03:21:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) sighed and simply proceeded forward, taking hold of the dead man's form. Lifting him over his shoulder, he proceeded to turn and walk, considering both of his partners seemed incapable of carrying out a simply request. He simply ignored their continuous cries for more bloodshed and made way from the small village to his homeland.* - Tue Oct 27 03:35:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) allowed his eyes to shift between the three, those being Asteroth, Index, and the deceased. Although, he did hold his own dead over his shoulder as he looked back to Asteroth. He made a simply pat agaisnt the deadman's leg as he spoke to her.

"The task has been done."* - Tue Oct 27 03:44:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) gave Yukio a quick glance over, remaining stagnant as he brandished his thick skin to the open air. A few steps backwards and Ichiro was at Asteroth's side. He meant to disrespect with his stride, but he figured he could potentially present a threat---Only a precaution due to Baylea and Shoji's actions a few days prior.

He simply stayed silent, letting his Queen do the talking.* - Tue Oct 27 04:30:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) comes to a standstill on the outskirts of Amegakure now as he allows himself to initiate his daily sweat session. An oddity for Ichiro, but a necessary thing. As he did such, he proceeded to turn his head to the side and promptly spit into the grass off to his right. This simply left a spike of his own chakra. Alongside such, his body sweat thickened and hardened until it became an effective shell of armor.* - Tue Oct 27 22:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) continued to followthrough, spitting even more into the grass land. Rather than expelling one spike at a time, he'd promptly build up enough spit for him to access two spikes with some delay between the two. Only to maximize training capacity. He of course noticed the difference in length between each one he made. Regardless, his hardened armor broke away, casting itself to the ground and Ichiro was already beginning to sweat once again. This was in preparation of another godly shell.* - Tue Oct 27 23:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) producing a few more spikes, he watches them all plant into the ground. As Ichiro stood there, he still cascaded his golden sweat across his skin before taking up one of the spikes, weilding it in one hand like a spear---for throwing purposes though. Yet as Ichiro stayed there, he only observed the weapon up until the point where he stepped forward.

He now has a spear, although it's nothing on par with what he hoped for. Taking this one up with the other hand as well he proceeds to step into his strike.  The tip of his spear extending into the air before him until it eventually left Ichiro's hand and flew forward, planting itself within the tree.

Another hand extended itself and took up another spear, this time holding it with both hands as he aimed to uses this one in the more practical form.* - Tue Oct 27 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) still settled there in the same spot, allowing himself to access his chakra reserves as his sweat solidified. The new shell remaining stagnant as he stood there. His movements became a bit more rigid as he hefted up his spear with both hands. The weightless gold remaining in his hands as he extended his reach and presented it to the area in front of him. It was a simply, and very general stab which resulted in him pulling back.* - Tue Oct 27 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) watched as his shell crumbled before him, falling against the ground as he brought his weapon back up. Remaining still, he braced himself, lowering his position so that he looked directly forward without any problems. He figured that this was a simple stance utilized by spearmen. As he retained it, he simply shifted his weight so that his spear would drive upwards, and proceeded to extend its reach beyond his personal range. His eyes watched the gold glimmer in the sunlight.* - Wed Oct 28 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) still follows the same act of making a few stabs with the spear. Each one being pointed more upwards to the sky as if he was underneath his opponent. Although he knew he could potentially go deeper into the method, he figured it was best to stick to basic movements. His arms pumping forward and pulling back just like a piston as he applied force behind his spear's strikes. With short strokes he could feel the wind current pushing past.* - Wed Oct 28 00:58:27 2015

As Ichiro stepped slowly, he found his eyes trailing along the ground ahead of himself while his brutish body seemed to flex, showing off the well-toned muscle of this hulking man as he approached.

Soon he came to a point just a few tiles away from the two seemingly standing outside. Guards, he assumed. A common role between himself and them was what he saw. But regardless he came to settle and find his eyes switching between the two before shifting his neck as to crack it before setting it back into its natural positioning.

A simple greeting. "Hello." was uttered. And thus, he began to wait.* - Wed Oct 28 02:57:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed Arata as he performed the ninjutsu technique. Allowing himself to bring up his own hands, his eyes followed the handseals firstly. Without even uttering a word, he entered a state of focus that showed he was determined in his efforts to learn. As Ichiro worked through the handseals, he allowed his chakra to focus for a bit before eventually finding that he was incapable of performing the technique, brandishing his chakra to the world in the wrong sense. Rather, his golden sweat cascaded his skin and exitted his pores.

However, Ichiro began to make another attempt and brought his hands up together once again. Accessing his chakra, he channeled it into the Doton element as he proceeded to complete the series of handseals. In this attempt though, the difference being how he completed the technique. Releasing his chakra he produced a single clone of mud, turning to face it now as he recognized the similarities between himself and the clone.* - Wed Oct 28 04:24:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Thu Oct 29 04:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) scanned Amegakure with his eyes as he stood there amongst its streets. Ichiro allowed himself to stretch and flex in the same instance. Soon he set his eyes on a butcher that seemed to be struggling with a few carcasses for his shop. Observing this, he nodded to himself almost as though he was silently accepting the task. His legs proceeded to push him forward and eventually he was standing next to the Butcher, placing a firm hand on his shoulder. Once he stepped aside, Ichiro moved forward and placed hands on the first animal corpse.

Within only a few seconds he was gripping the deceased form, finding that it once belonged to a cow. Disregarding that fact, he still wrapped his form around the body and seemed to bring it up, leaving his other hand to guide the lower-half of the dead. A few seconds passed and eventually Ichiro hefted the cow over his shoulder, finding the distribution of weight to be a bit off, but enough for him to work with for now.

Now as Ichiro held this cow suspended in the air over his own frame, he brought the hulking corpse towards the door. Once reaching such, his movements grew slow. Lowering himself and bending his legs, he felt the force of gravity working against him, although he still continued to do his best to avoid letting the body get caught on the doorway. Once he made it through with little trouble, he paused his movements as he waited upon the Butcher to move onwards and guide him to the meat lockup.

With only a few more steps, Ichiro had now found himself in the cold room, staring down several clean hooks as he kept the body upraised. Standing still for a moment, all Ichiro overheard from the Butcher was, "Put it on the back hook." Almost immediately, his need to listen to a command kicked in and Ichiro delivered the foreign weight to the final hook on the wall. Once near, he lowered the back half until he could see the head of the cow. Once it was within sight he pushed it forward, watching the hook impale the skull and eventually suspend the beast's body against the wall.

Ichiro remained still for only a few seconds as he understood what was to happen with this animal's body. Once he had enough time with it, he proceeded to turn back and make his way out of the building to begin collecting the next animal's body. Once outside, he observed several corpses, realizing that he'd be in for the long haul. With observations, he took sight of at least five dead. A sigh and he stepepd forward, taking up the dead body of a rather large pig into his arms. This one of course was a lot easier to carry in, not needing to bring it over his shoulders though.

Both arms slipped under the greasy body of the dead animal and he brought them upwards. His strength was easily applied, and he had only few troubles dealing with the animal. However, as Ichiro lifted the pig he could feel some strain in his muscle. Not enough to prevent him from making progress however. With the backsideo f the pig braced against his bare chest, he could see that some blood from both the cow and pig alike had cast itself across his chest like paint on a canvas. His reaction seemed to be nothing as he retained his normally serious expression within this instance.

Once Ichiro found himself standing in the cold room again, he observed the various hooks and figured that he should just ocntinue down the line. Moving across the room, he found himself near the back of the room, standing by the second to last hook. Bringing the body up and turning it just so he could place the head against the hook, he watched as the blood had begun to spray from his actions. It seemed to him that he applied a bit too much force in his actions and put the pg on uncleanly.

A shrug and Ichiro was now focused on filling the next space. Ichiro removed himself from the butcher's room and was once again otuside, gripping another body which seemed to be the easiest for him to lift out of the three he'd touched so far. This one seemed to be like a goat, no, more like a ram. He could only recognize such due to the fact that it exhibbited great horns, which had of course intrigued him. Yet, they were no use to him and he simply left them there. Regardless, Ichiro continued on by simply bringing the deceased up once again. A repeat of his motions and now he was setting himself in the direction of the butcher's room again.

However, once Ichiro stepped foot into the building, he was met with a voice that guided him to do differently. "Put that one on the table." A nod from Ichiro and he brought it over to the Butcher's table first. As he found himself standing near this one, he allowed his arms to bring the body up a bit. After such, he soon settled the weight of the goat onto the table and found himself releasing it there. Three bodies had been moved by his hand so far, yet he found other words touching his ears now. "Thanks, but I can handle the rest." 

An exit and a wave from Ichiro, and he was now once again on the streets, using a nearby towel to clean off his own chest. From his experience there, he found it to be a rather good, temporary workout. His muscles had already been worked due to this and now he had burning tendons as he stood there. His eyes closely remained amongst the street as he looked for a new task to begin. A moment of pause and he let himself stretch once more, raising his arms as he twisted his body. He easily allowed himself to work out some of the tension before settling a bit.* - Fri Oct 30 20:42:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Consider it a mission or assignment. I want to see if Ichiro is fit. - Sat Oct 31 00:22:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Alright. - Sat Oct 31 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I suppose I shall grant you the first action. - Sat Oct 31 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: No..no.. - Sat Oct 31 00:24:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Battle back. - Sat Oct 31 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: .... - Sat Oct 31 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Very well then. - Sat Oct 31 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If you destroy buildings you get extra points. - Sat Oct 31 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: Good..good..Ignore her. Become one with your thirst for battle! - Sat Oct 31 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) simply observed Sado for a moment, letting his eyes scan over the male's figure.  However, the mask and cloak did nothing to help Ichiro assess where his abilities may lie, but considering his mental state, he also questioned genjutsu as a possible problem. However, holding those thoughts in, Ichiro only allowed himself to carry his weight forward, bringing up a fist as he put some force behind it.

This was aimed for the chest.* - Sat Oct 31 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed as Nigen backpedaled. Ichiro's eyes followed his placement and found himself continuing to travel forward. Without wasting any time however, Ichiro allowed himself to access his chakra and bodily fluid in the same instance. Expelling a golden shine from the palm of his hand, it soon extended and created a make-shift spear of sorts.

As Ichiro weilded this, he pushed forward and aimed to use it to extend his reach, thrusting a single strike forward to strike at Nigen. However he expected a reflex from this.* - Sat Oct 31 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) took note of the reflex, seeing that Nigen had been another opponent with more speed over him. A shift in Ichiro's position and he now faced Nigen. Of course, he didn't want to go to his fullest yet, but he assumed that he would need to if he ever wanted to catch this mouse. And thus, a lock on Ichiro's brain clattered against the metaphysical floor within his mind.

Physically, there was little change other than an enhancement within his muscular composition, showing an enhanced stress on the body. Mentally however, Ichiro felt a rush, and his body gained a heightened state. Due to this, his strikes were stronger and much faster. 

Ichiro simply turned his spear once more and brought it towards Sado's position, and aimed to bat it into the side of the man.* - Sat Oct 31 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Pass. I'm watchingm y calorie intake. - Sat Oct 31 01:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: ........... - Sat Oct 31 01:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed the change in Nigen's actions. He'd gone from dodging to blocking and it seemed to work all the same in his eyes. Ichiro simply nodded and made another movement to bring his body to face Nigen's. Rather than moving with the spear, he attempted to deliver a swift roundhouse kick of sorts before applying his weapon. In that instance, his spear was simply meant to move directly for the chest as well and strike Nigen as a followup. A slash, to put it simply.* - Sat Oct 31 01:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) continued his assault, following up with a dash forward as Nigen seemed to use the force as a getaway tactic. Ichiro brought his spear up this time, hefting it over his shoulder before throwing it directly at Sado. An attempt to throw him off as he changed from a ranged tactic now. 

However, Ichiro continued onwards, bringing his legs in before attempting to smash a knee into the face of Nigen. It was apparent he wanted all attention on the spar at hand.* - Sat Oct 31 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) continued to observe his opponent as they performed their little dance. The more Sado or Nigen had spoke, the more aggrovated he began to get. Not only that, but speed was the bane of his existance, proving to be the one factor that has trumped him so far. This man angered him only due to the fact that Ichiro could do nothing to harm him, or even touch him lest he wanted to be touched.

Another two spears were formed, one being held in each hand now as Ichiro looked at his opponent. A grimace lingered on his face and he simply dashed inwards again. This time, he performed a flurry of strikes, aiming to impale the male on the end of either of his weapons. It made no difference to him really.* - Sat Oct 31 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: The only way to fight is with bloodlust.~ - Sat Oct 31 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) grimaced even harder as Nigen spoke more. His brutish nature simply causing him to drive farther as his body began to produce more bodily fluids in his actions. A drive forward and with each movement came a stab for Nigen's chest region. He knew he was simply too slow for this man, but there had to be some opening where he could catch him off-gaurd. And he actively searched for it with his eyes.* - Sat Oct 31 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hmph.. - Sat Oct 31 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) overheard the voice of Asteroth. While Ichiro had proven to be very animalistic in combat, his Queen's voice had a certain sense of control over him, and seemed to coax him out of his state. A moment of pause and he found himself settling his muscles. These of course exhibitted some sense of pain. Regardless though, he brought both of his spears towards the soil and allowed them both to crack and dissipate. His expression remained serious but his eyes closed as he exhaled roughly. 

One hand raised and swept back Ichiro's hair and then he proceeded to make his way into the village afterwards.* - Sat Oct 31 01:58:36 2015
