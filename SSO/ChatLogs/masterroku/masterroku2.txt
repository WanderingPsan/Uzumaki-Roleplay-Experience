<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: Can't even find a stable building. - Sat Oct 24 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) turned his eyes to face the female that now stood in the midst of Amegakure. Of course Ichiro had assumed the guard position, proceeding to shift from his place amongst the fence to one that put him closer to Asteroth. His attempt at playing a passive guard failing as he looked Baylea up and down now. He was now, very defensive. He knew it wasn't his place to speak, but did so otherwise.

"If I may ask, can you state a name and your business here?"* - Sat Oct 24 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: I wish shoji was here.. - Sat Oct 24 02:05:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: And I'm Baylea. - Sat Oct 24 02:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) nodded as he listened to Baylea's words. They weren't enough to warrant an attack on the female, but the thought of company with her led him to believe he must remain wary of his surroundings. Yet, he simply remained still, assuming that his Queen would address the situation of letting them live there. His only response being, 

"Very well. Welcome to our village, Amegakure. I assure that your endeavors will be addressed."

It seemed Ichiro's speech had developed from a simple brute to a more formal pattern.* - Sat Oct 24 02:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Oh uh. - Sat Oct 24 02:13:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Alright. - Sat Oct 24 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: Best friend, let me watch. - Sat Oct 24 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: I like this one with the mask. - Sat Oct 24 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: He seems..Enthusiastic. - Sat Oct 24 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) nodded, proceeding to the south now. He expected the group to follow of course, considering they did state such.* - Sat Oct 24 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Shall I begin? - Sat Oct 24 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Yes ma'am. - Sat Oct 24 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: I may be able to test my latest technique here... - Sat Oct 24 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Surely this will be interesting. - Sat Oct 24 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: I don't wanna hurt him. - Sat Oct 24 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: But I feel obligated to. - Sat Oct 24 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed the approach the female now as he stood there, his eyes casting over her now of course. Yet, with the introduction of her palm to his face---he felt nothing really. Yet, a smirk formed on his face, a mark being left nonetheless and his body simply jetting a hand forward now as he aimed to wrap one around the waste.

Secondly, another would come up and this would jet out to meet the lower portion of her body, more specifically, the leg. With this, he pushed forward, aiming to topple the female over in this instance. A grapple technique of sorts, yet his hold wasn't superb. If anything, he felt the female could break out with ease against him.* - Sat Oct 24 02:58:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) whispers: (Boxer gives dura, attack speed, and strength - Sat Oct 24 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) seemed to overlook the female's speed of course, his body simply reacting to her kick with a knockback of the chin, his head easily cocking back now. Of course, he still seemed to retain the same composure. Yet when his head came down, his arms raised and attempted to meet with the exposed leg, pulling inwards as a means to flip the girl mid-air. The kick of course, only being very minor in this instance. Like a bug bite against his hardened, naked body.* - Sat Oct 24 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) thinks: Go Best Friend, You're My Best Friend. - Sat Oct 24 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: I should try. - Sat Oct 24 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: But that's a bore. - Sat Oct 24 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) listened to the females words, finding it to be pleasurable to him to hear the complaints of his opponents. Of course, Ichiro simply released his grasp, his head cocking back from the kicks as he simply, well, ate them. There wasn't much to it other than a bit of build-up, obviously causing some sense of pain. Like she'd made an actual attack against him this time.

Yet, Ichiro's only reaction was like that of a man who saw nothing but a simple asexual figure in his eyes--how he normally did combat of course-- and he proceeded to deliver his foot forward, aiming, to plant a kick into the female if anything. Of course he had the intentions to send her in a forward fashion with this, granting some distance.* - Sat Oct 24 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: I don't believe this will warrant my techniques at all. - Sat Oct 24 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: As expected. - Sat Oct 24 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: He seems to be durable. - Sat Oct 24 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I invite you to do so. - Sat Oct 24 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Oh you do? - Sat Oct 24 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Alright. - Sat Oct 24 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Otherwise this will be rather lame. - Sat Oct 24 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: The man has spoken. - Sat Oct 24 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) had of course remained still as the female approached once again. As he stood there, he simply retained the same expression of enterainment. Of course, now the introduction of her blade made things more interesting, and may have warranted Ichiro to utilize at least one of his techniques. Of course though, he knew that he was rather slow compared to the female.

Yet, when he was struck, he did find himself moving back a bit and a simple hand raised. This time the pain that had been introduced seemed to be a bit more...apparent. A slash forming on his chest, yet nothing too deep. Nothing he couldn't handle either. Yet of course, Ichiro simply allowed himself  to nod at the female, opening his maw as he formulated a golden spit from within and allowed himself to spew a mass of liquid into his hand.

Oddly enough, this mass shaped itself and became reminiscent if anything, to a large, golden toothpick. Obviously more dangerous than that of course. 'Now I've been warranted.' And with that, he made an approach back to meet the female, creating a hard step forward as he introduced this organic tool forward and applied it to her lower abdomen region, of course, he was sure she could avoid such a thing.* - Sat Oct 24 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Hello. - Sat Oct 24 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed as his attack had missed, obviously teaching him the importance of his own speed alongside his own defensive capabilities. Yet, it was when he noticed the stance that he'd have to apply his own reaction, in this instance a sweat began to exit his pores, settling on his skin. But he however, realized that he was incapable of applying it in this situation as the spear he held stuck to his own hand. Instead, he brought it over, finding it too late for his arm as the cuts were there, his body bearing the wounds with pleasure.

Yet with his cross-form stab he brought the right arm over and aimed to make a stab region at Baylea's dominant hand for weilding the katana. Of course expecting another dodge as the outcome.* - Sat Oct 24 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Use your hand, spear guy! - Sat Oct 24 03:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) thinks: She locked her knees, but is moving around as if normal....How interesting.. - Sat Oct 24 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed as his strike was diverted from its course. His eyes shifted to Baen for a moment and then directly back to Baylea. Of course however, he still hadn't developed a technique as the one suggested. Yet, as his spear remained in his grip he looked over at the female, only making a simple statement.

"We may do whatever you wish ma'am. I'm simply fulfilling your request."* - Sat Oct 24 03:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) thinks: With her center of gravity...she should be rooted to the ground, unable to move...yet she's avoiding this...very inter-....Oh I found my chocolate bar... - Sat Oct 24 03:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: I need a better blade. - Sat Oct 24 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: Darn. - Sat Oct 24 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) nodded as he allowed himself to bring his own weapon towards the ground, cracking it and causing it to break against such. It was the most simple way he knew of disposing his jutsu. As he looked to Baylea, he simply stated.

"Thank you for your criticism. I shall work on that. This spar was very educational ma'am."* - Sat Oct 24 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Uh-huh. - Sat Oct 24 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: It seemed she augmented her speed. - Sat Oct 24 03:44:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: A guard must not be slow of course. - Sat Oct 24 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I could only assume so. - Sat Oct 24 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: I miss his insides. - Sat Oct 24 03:44:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Who are you? - Sat Oct 24 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: It's him once again. Am I to assume he's a number amongst our forces? - Sat Oct 24 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: I'm Baylea, you? - Sat Oct 24 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) made a simple stride from his place over to his Queen's side. He figured he should invent a technique to help his wounds.* - Sat Oct 24 03:47:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: If so...Can you lead the way? - Sat Oct 24 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: Sunagakure? yes.... Very hot. - Sat Oct 24 06:06:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Good luck. - Sat Oct 24 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) set off from Amegakure now, allowing himself to speed off in the direction of the western front. For the most part, that's all he knew about the villages. That a majority of them were off to the west while Kirigakure remained to the East of them. Regardless, he found this as a test of his speed, training his legs as he made his run. It was simply a physical action of movement that he figured could benefit him as he attempted to heed the advice of Baylea, understanding the importance of speed due to her.* - Sat Oct 24 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) found his eyes setting upon 'Zero' as he heeded his words. A rush forward and he proceeded to move ahead, yet he came to a slow when the male tripped. Hwoever of course, he listened to what he had to say, nodding as he understood the statement with his travel forward. A note to save for later obviously. "Of course." Regardless, he continued to follow Zero along the way.* - Sat Oct 24 06:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) followed up behind his partner as he trusted in his guidance, figuring that Ichiro could make it from Amegakure to Sunagakure and back with the body. It was an odd task, but Ichiro knew better than to question his queen. She was appointed so for a reason of course. Yet, as he followed along the grasslands, he noticed that they easily broke into sand.

Running across from grass to sand now, he figured that with ease, he could possibly find himself having trouble as he'd have to get used to a new ground-type and adjust to the traction and loss of sustainable grip with the shifting sand dunes coming from up ahead. Should his partner say, or do anything though, Ichiro would remain observant and adjust to such. Possibly shifting to a light jog to keep the same speed yet retain a training form.* - Sat Oct 24 06:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) had obviously been searching around the outskirts of Sunagakure alongside Zero when they'd soon come to the dreaded graveyard of their lands. An obvious place to search for deceased. Yet, with Ichiro's arrival he noticed a burial site that stuck out most importantly to him.

Susumu's grave.

The sight of such brought a grimace to Ichiro's face as he felt he'd somewhat failed at his job, but there was nothing within his power stopping such. Yet, he felt the need to of course acquire any particular belongings from his body and bring them back to Asteroth, his Queen. Mainly because he understood the relation between the two.

For a moment, he spent some time digging up the body before eventually taking whatever items of importance seemed to remain upon him and pocket them as he seemed to perform a silent prayer before eventually standing once more and returning to his previous search. However he had the feeling they would need to return for the body at a later date.* - Sat Oct 24 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: Dafuq you doin over here. - Sat Oct 24 06:37:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) stopped once his vision caught sight of Tetsujin's body. Of course, he didn't distinguish it from a distance but as both him and Zero neared it, he seemed to come to a slow and recognized the now-deceased man. As he did so however, he gave a light nod, recognizing Baen's words as true before proceeding to come close and make a connection with the body. 

"It is, Zero."

Of course, he noticed the shattered bones and white dust left from them around the region as he seemed to collect the once proclaimed Mankiller. Using both of his arms, he figured he could at the least bring this male's body back to Amegakure with the help of Zero, and of course, no retaliation. But it was more than likely they would take a caravan on the way back.* - Sat Oct 24 06:41:29 2015

It was a bit taxing, but nothing he couldn't handle as long as he was out of combat. However of course, as he looked on to his Queen's face, he made a rather simple statement.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) found himself standing alone amongst the grasslands of Amegakure, now allowing himself to make an approach to the same tree he always found himself at. As he looked the wood over, he observed the point that he impacted so many times before. And he knew that his strength was nothing compared to this. Yet, in order to work on such, he began to beat against the tree. Of course, with his collision between fist and wood he could feel some form of pain sprouting amongst his fists.

Ichiro of course, did not care for the damage being done to him. He knew for a fact that he could handle this and continued onwards. With each pull back of the arm and wind-up for attack, he could easily feel the tension in his muscles as it seemed the tendons within were easily tearing apart once again. A prize for his hard work both in and out of combat of course. Yet, his stride continued to bring an opposing force to ripple throughout his arms.

A feeling was sparked in Ichiro now and he figured that punching a tree wasn't the only way to improve his physical ability and simply chose to bring himself over to the nearby grasslands, allowing his body to simply lower itself to the ground as both of his palms planted themselves upon the ground. For a moment, his knees too rested there until he had eventually accessed the tips of his toes, utilizing them to keep a majority of his body off the ground. Maintaining his pushup hold with ease, he checked his format and made sure his arms and legs were set correctly. Once he had them all down and correct, he began to pursue his goal, pressing his body lower to the Earth, his arms feeling gravity pull against him before he eventually pushed back upwards, sparking his excersize.

The pushups seemed to be working just as fine, if not, better. Ichiro could feel the burning sensation of pain following within his body. As he continued to apply himself, he found the tension in his form increasing and causing an even stronger feeling of percieved pain to shoot within his body. However, this was simply nothing to Ichiro as he continued onwards, finding a an ambitious love for his workout while he presented his smirk to the world.

A continued effort was applied and Ichiro now felt a sense of sweat beginning to settle on his brow. Furling them a bit, he simply squinted as he bodily fluid began to mask his vision. However, he delt just fine with it, turning his head downwards to let the sweat fall from his face and splatter against the ground. Meanwhile, a set of veins seemed to protrude from his skin on both of his arms, showing yet another result of his training. As Ichiro continued, he was unsure of how many pushups he had done, but with his stamina he figured that he'd at the least applied himself to completing roughly fifty by now.

Lowering himself and pushing back up remained the same pattern. Such a simple task when viewed, yet now that he was participating in the action he found the difficulty that came from such. The strain of avoiding the power of gravity to pull himself upwards from the ground seemed like yet another test of Ichiro's reliability and power altogether. And he felt as though he was succeeding, merely due to the fact that it hadn't been on par with the Rhino, nor had it been on par with the various combatants he sparred against.

By now, Ichiro had completed seventy pushups all in one session. Probably nothing impressive in the world of shinobi he believed, but nonetheless, filled him with a sense of pride. It led him to believe that if he continued to train like so, he'd reach a new height of power. Thus, Ichiro never faulted, slowing yes, but never coming to a pause or stop as he pushed up and down in place.

Huffing and puffing now, it seemed Ichiro had touched eighty in the number of pushups, his body being perspirated with great sweat as he remained still. His mouth still agape as he did so. However, Ichiro proceeded to stand, allowing himself to look forward amongst the landscape. His training efforts were done, for now at least. But he knew that he'd have to find new training practices should he wish to improve even faster.* - Sat Oct 24 14:17:10 2015
