<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Sure..sure. - Sun Nov 29 21:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Don't hold back. - Sun Nov 29 21:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: See if you can hit me once. - Sun Nov 29 21:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: ....Don't hold back? - Sun Nov 29 21:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Yes. - Sun Nov 29 21:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Go. - Sun Nov 29 21:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) nodded lightly as he locked his eyes on Shiro. He'd never really gone all out against anyone before, but he understood that Shiro was one of the only people that could go toe to toe with him, if not, overpower him. Yet, only because she requested it, he allowed himself to drop into his signature boxing stance. His arms drooped and his guard was alleviated.

Secondly, he'd grunt for a moment as he allowed his mind to shift a bit, unlocking a hidden strength from within himself. He slipped past the Gate of Opening now as he looked directly at her. A light grunt came from him now as he seemed ready to move in, and that he did. Ichiro shuffled towards Shiro, moving side to side before thrusting a single fist forward. This was aimed for the center of the chest.* - Sun Nov 29 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: He seems faster than before. - Sun Nov 29 21:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) was struck. It was inevitable, considering the difference in speed between the two. When it came to fighting Shiro, it was more or less who got the first hit. And already, he'd been defeated by her kicked. Of course, he could deal with the damage but he was knocked away, being sent into the grasslands nearby. When he recovered, he released a light grunt.

Ichiro gritted his teeth now however and allowed himself to focus his eyesight directly upon Shiro. He figured if he wanted to land a single strike he would have to actually put his newest technique into play. For a moment, he kept still and allowed his hands to move. They shifted around in a fashion that'd create a sort of illusion and really make his hands movements unpredictable as he moved back inwards.

Obviously, he was taking a risk by doing this.* - Sun Nov 29 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) found himself being countered before he could event input another action. Shiro's kicks had quickly taken away his footing and sent him immediately into the air. The first causing him to flinch and simply maintain a 'stunned' state. The second however leaving a greater pain as he remained suspended in the air. All he could do was wait until she either followed up on it or let him come crashing down to the ground.* - Sun Nov 29 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: I knew it.. - Sun Nov 29 21:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) seemed to have a loss of confidence after this one. Ichiro had easily been sent crashing into the ground, finding the combinaton quite devastating. It left him with nothing. His body lady there and he knew that he could do nothing against her. As Ichiro lay there amongst the ground, he simply released a light moan. Eventually however, he'd stand and attempt to regain his set, standing sloppily in place. His eyes then searched for Shiro, figuring he could still try his hand for a few rounds, even if he should've stayed down for the count.* - Sun Nov 29 21:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Fuck... - Sun Nov 29 21:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Kida. - Sun Nov 29 21:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Join in and help Ichiro. - Sun Nov 29 21:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Two against one. - Sun Nov 29 21:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) shifted his eyes a bit so that Kida was in view as well. Ichiro's face showed some pain but it was unknown if this was due to the physical punishment or whether he'd been mentally defeated. Regardless though, he felt a bit of insult that he had to go in on a two vs. one.

Regardless, Ichiro's body lurched forward and aimed to bring in his right fist. The way he conducted his strike was a simple body blow from the right. His fist pushed forward and aimed to strike Shiro in the lower region of her upper body. * - Sun Nov 29 21:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) gave a blank expression as he saw Shiro grip his fist. Another successive strike to his chest came as a result and he was blown back. This time, Ichiro came back with the retaliation rather quickly though, grunting as he moved forward in Shiro's direction again. This time, he ran entirely low to the ground, aiming to toss his right shoulder into her, and if possible a punch from his left fist, aimed for her side.* - Sun Nov 29 22:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) pulled back for a moment, recognizing that Kida had stopped his assault after being released. The movements by Shiro being quite impressive as well. He settled in his boxing stance for a moment, letting his eyes look out towards Shiro. He made sure to keep Kida in the corner of his eye though.

"We're...not done are we?"

Assuming the answer would be a no, he moved inwards again. His shuffling movements carrying him swaying from side to side. Although, this time he had a different intent. Rather than coming straight up the middle he tried to play himself in the outside zone and use his arm's reach for a strike, bring his right arm in a wide arc to get a single lick on Shiro.

Of course though, had the response to his question been different, he'd simply stop.* - Sun Nov 29 22:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: No, you think I'd give up that easily? - Sun Nov 29 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) turned towards Kida as instructed. His target had changed and this one was already hot on the attack of course. Although, Ichiro could handle the force. His body moving back from the buffet of attacks. Meanwhile, he could feel his stamina reserves feel a little half under, assuming he'd have to step up his game if he wanted to keep going. 

In response to the kicks, he followed up with his own strike. His right fist jutting outwards as Ichiro tried to make an overhead strike, bringing it down to plant it into Kida's face, or forehead rather.* - Sun Nov 29 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed as Kida opted for a bold move, choosing to simply meet with the strike instead. Rather than letting himself be caught off guard though, he threw his opposite fist forward, and aimed to strike the gut region. His breath noticably beginning to get a bit quicker as he did this. Meanwhile, he pulled back his right arm and prepared it for the next motion.* - Sun Nov 29 22:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) bent somewhat from the initial strike. It didn't deal much damage, however it did force him to move awkwardly. Due to himself giving into it though, he ended up recieving the strike to the back of his head, simply letting himself move downwards with this until he could barrel roll, persay, from underneath. His body moved from the center to the outfield. He was now to Kida's right, tossing in two quick jabs from both his left and right. The two of these were aimed for the ribcage.* - Sun Nov 29 23:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) attempted to back out of Kida's shoulder charge. His feet shuffled in the grass and out onto the dirt now. However, he couldn't really avoid it since he went in a singular direction. And considering he didn't guard in this boxing stance, he allowed for Kida to make the connection. With this, he utilized the boxer embrace, making a sort of hugging form to keep Kida close. This was an attempt to remove his offensive capabilties and overpower him. 

Should this prove successful, he'd deliver two strikes to the head, like downward palm strikes with his left.* - Sun Nov 29 23:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) felt the sharp pain in his foot from Kida's kid. Although, that didn't really make a difference. Ichiro knew he had to end the spar now, considering his stamina was getting quite low. As a result, he released his clinch and moved backwards, attempting to keep his balance. It was only just enough however, to prevent him rom crashing into the ground.

As Ichiro stood there now, he looked rather weary and weak. Almost like he was about to drop. "I think that's enough...I'm exhausted."* - Sun Nov 29 23:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I think that's the first I've seen Shiro use that stance. - Sun Nov 29 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It's a second for me. - Sun Nov 29 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Ah.. - Sun Nov 29 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I guess I just have to get stronger. Can't slack off anymore. - Sun Nov 29 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It's strange... - Sun Nov 29 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: How much stronger she's become since she met Nigen... - Sun Nov 29 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Don't mention this to anyone but, Shiro was nothing like that prior to meeting Nigen. - Sun Nov 29 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: That wasn't even her name before then. - Sun Nov 29 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Really? - Sun Nov 29 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: What was it? And just how much of a jump in strength did she gain? - Sun Nov 29 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Her name was Makoto. - Sun Nov 29 23:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Makoto huh?  I'm assuming you knew her before she met Sado? - Sun Nov 29 23:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I met her the same day she met Sado. - Sun Nov 29 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Ah. - Sun Nov 29 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Just an hour beforehand. - Sun Nov 29 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So whatever he did to her, got her stronger huh? - Sun Nov 29 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Just a bit. - Sun Nov 29 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It's that purification thing. - Sun Nov 29 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Which... - Sun Nov 29 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I asked Sado about... - Sun Nov 29 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: He says you and I were options for it but. - Sun Nov 29 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: But? - Sun Nov 29 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: We're already on the right path, so we don't need it. - Sun Nov 29 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Hm.. - Sun Nov 29 23:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Well whatever it is that I need to do to get stronger, I'll do it. - Sun Nov 29 23:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Even if it means selling my soul. - Sun Nov 29 23:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I feel like...Asteroth and Sado are hiding something. - Sun Nov 29 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: A power. - Sun Nov 29 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: A 'dark art.' - Sun Nov 29 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: I can't let her stay stronger than me. How would it seem being the weaker one in the relationship? Pathetic. - Sun Nov 29 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: You mentioned it before. What is this 'dark art' thing? - Sun Nov 29 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I'm unsure. - Sun Nov 29 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: But I don't think it's anything like ninjutsu or genjutsu. - Sun Nov 29 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It's something entirely new. - Sun Nov 29 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Something new? - Sun Nov 29 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Is that possible? - Sun Nov 29 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I believe so. - Sun Nov 29 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Think we can use it if we try? - Sun Nov 29 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I doubt it. - Sun Nov 29 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: We've no idea what it is, so how could we? - Sun Nov 29 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: We'll get them to tell us more. - Mon Nov 30 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I've seen some of what Asteroth is capable of with hers. - Mon Nov 30 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: But Sado's... - Mon Nov 30 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: His is a mystery... - Mon Nov 30 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: But you know he has it? - Mon Nov 30 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Yes. - Mon Nov 30 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I see.. - Mon Nov 30 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Oh, did you tell Shiro yet about that daimyo chick? - Mon Nov 30 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: No. - Mon Nov 30 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I guess I'll tell her then. - Mon Nov 30 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) slowly opened a single eye, looking to find his sister standing next to him. Shortly after, it closed again.

"Did you enjoy your trip?"* - Mon Nov 30 21:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ...yes. - Mon Nov 30 21:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I'm here to stay now. - Mon Nov 30 21:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Well, I'm going to visit Kumo a lot. - Mon Nov 30 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: But he released me. - Mon Nov 30 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Ah. - Mon Nov 30 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Yes. - Mon Nov 30 21:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Thank you. - Mon Nov 30 21:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Yep. - Mon Nov 30 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: This group is going to leave Kumo alone right? - Mon Nov 30 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I mean they talked about starting a war but ... - Mon Nov 30 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I don't think that will actually happen. - Mon Nov 30 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: And I like Kumo. - Mon Nov 30 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Hm. - Mon Nov 30 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Well two people there, the rest who cares. - Mon Nov 30 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I don't know if we'll leave them alone. - Mon Nov 30 21:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Personally, I would. - Mon Nov 30 21:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: But as a group... - Mon Nov 30 21:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: That needs to be discussed. - Mon Nov 30 21:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Well considering he willingly decided to remove you as a traitor. - Mon Nov 30 21:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I think we owe it to just leave them be. - Mon Nov 30 21:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I agree. - Mon Nov 30 21:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: What have you been doing since I left? - Mon Nov 30 21:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Training. - Mon Nov 30 21:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Kida's apparently been negotiating. - Mon Nov 30 21:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Negotiating? - Mon Nov 30 21:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Yes. - Mon Nov 30 21:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Some girl came by and discussed hiring us. - Mon Nov 30 21:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Or something along those lines. - Mon Nov 30 21:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Oh. - Mon Nov 30 21:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Do you guys do things like that? - Mon Nov 30 21:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Take jobs? - Mon Nov 30 21:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: No. - Mon Nov 30 21:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Oh. - Mon Nov 30 21:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Then why is he negotiating? - Mon Nov 30 21:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Unsure. - Mon Nov 30 21:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: What do you think about taking a job? - Mon Nov 30 21:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I see no problem with it. It'll be good for us. - Mon Nov 30 21:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Are you happy I'm staying? - Mon Nov 30 21:41:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Reallyyyyy happy? - Mon Nov 30 21:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) seemed to give off a single bead of sweat, letting it roll down his forehead. He'd rarely ever smiled and couldn't recall the last time he'd done so. However, for his sister, he smiled just this one time to emphasize the point. "Of course."* - Mon Nov 30 21:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Wow, you are terrible at that. - Mon Nov 30 21:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: You know you don't have to pretend. - Mon Nov 30 21:49:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I'm not pretending. - Mon Nov 30 21:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Well then maybe you are bad at smiling. - Mon Nov 30 21:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I don't do it often... - Mon Nov 30 21:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Alright, I like that you want me here though. - Mon Nov 30 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I thought you would want me as far away as possible. - Mon Nov 30 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Because of Shiro. - Mon Nov 30 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I mean.... - Mon Nov 30 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I figure if I could watch you, it would be better. - Mon Nov 30 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: ---Not that you need me to watch you. - Mon Nov 30 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Yeah yeah. - Mon Nov 30 21:52:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Do you train often, Ani-san? - Mon Nov 30 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I used to. - Mon Nov 30 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Not as much anymore. - Mon Nov 30 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Hm... okay. - Mon Nov 30 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Ani-san why don't you have arms like me? - Mon Nov 30 22:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: .... - Mon Nov 30 22:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I don't know. - Mon Nov 30 22:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I assumed the gene skipped me. - Mon Nov 30 22:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Or something like that. - Mon Nov 30 22:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Oh. - Mon Nov 30 22:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Do you think I'm special or a freak? - Mon Nov 30 22:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Or something else? - Mon Nov 30 22:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: No. - Mon Nov 30 22:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: If anything I'm the freak. - Mon Nov 30 22:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Eh? how? - Mon Nov 30 22:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I opted for taijutsu over a majority of our clan's techniques. - Mon Nov 30 22:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: That's not freaky. - Mon Nov 30 22:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I like taijutsu too, Ani-san. - Mon Nov 30 22:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Hm. - Mon Nov 30 22:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I guess it's not so freaky then. - Mon Nov 30 22:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Mhm.~ - Mon Nov 30 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I love taijutsu. - Mon Nov 30 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Really now? - Mon Nov 30 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Yeah but I hardly ever get to focus on it because of my spider stuff. - Mon Nov 30 22:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Ah...I see. - Mon Nov 30 22:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Hm... so you just do taijutsu then? - Mon Nov 30 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Nothing else? - Mon Nov 30 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I use a few ninjutsu, but purely for defense. - Mon Nov 30 22:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It's rare that I use them. - Mon Nov 30 22:58:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: This should be good enough. - Tue Dec  1 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed Kariudo as she utilized the technique. More specifically, her hands however. In Ichiro's case, he despised handseals but they seemed necessary for this technique. Rather than avoiding them however, after Kariudo's demonstration he simply allowed himself to access the same sequence of handseals. Although, his brutish hands moved through them rather slowly.

Eventually, Ichiro came to a point where he completed them. Within himself, he allocated the chakra as described. His chakra control being rather excellent for this situation, coming to form a string within. In his attempt to emulate the technique, he spat forward, trying to target the same tree. Sadly enough, his chakra seemed to fail at reaching it even if it did release.

"Huh..."* - Tue Dec  1 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) nodded lightly, "I had to work on it for some techniques. Like my spears." He then turned back forward, actively letting himself use the handseals again. He prepared himself to utilize the technique once more. Within his body, he allowed his chakra to allocate towards the same central point without much of a problem.

The string of chakra he formed had then began to be utilized from their family chakra point. This was indeed the harder part for Ichiro. However, he opened his maw and allowed for his chakra to fire forward. This stretched from himself onwards to the tree. Although, he could tell that his own string hadn't been quite as strong as Kariudo's.* - Tue Dec  1 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I can handle another... - Tue Dec  1 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Alright. - Tue Dec  1 01:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Oh right, it's called Kumo Soka. - Tue Dec  1 01:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) nodded along with the technique. With his observation, he figured that he could perform it with his level of chakra control. Afterall, he was better than the average shinobi in such. However, he paused for a while to look into her hand. Observing the web, he now understood what the goal was.

Now, Ichiro's hands proceeded to access a couple of handseals. Staring forward, he believed that his control would kick in rather quickly. And of course, it did. His chakra allocated itself to the space as needed, eventually allowing him to use the technique.

Probably the only difference between his use and Kariudo's was the amount of webs produced. His creating much less as he shot it forth. A light gasp came from him immediately afterwards, showing a light sign of exhaustion. Yet, he'd turn to his sister and state, "I guess I should teach you something now..."* - Tue Dec  1 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) nodded, allowing himself to access some of his chakra, focusing it to a centerpoint in the body. "This technique is simple. Since we're of the same clan, this should be an easy one. It's similar to yours in performance, minus the handseals. Just focus the chakra within yourself and spit it forward, assuming you conduct it right it should form a barrier." With ease of course, he allowed himself to spit a golden liquid outwards, spewing just enough until it built up. "Of course, the other application comes as the result of applying chakra to your sweat."* - Tue Dec  1 02:18:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) holds out his hand for a moment, allowing his palm to face towards the ground for a moment. "This technique is also void of handseals. With this, you can apply your chakra to the sweat glands and utilize it that way. You'll need to be quick if you do though. The other option being to simply spit one out, just like the King's Guard technique---the one I just taught you."

As Ichiro spoke, his chakra seemed to access his sweat glands, increasing the speed at which it rolled out. Eventually, it rolled down his hand and rolled over onto his palm. This sweat, glistened with a gold sheen and soon expanded from the centerpoint until it became a single, elongated form. It was quite obviously a long rod. Like a giant golden toothpick when you think about it. Even then it was obvious why he referred to it as a spear.

"Great for close range and long range." he said. Meanwhile, his spear struck the earth below and eventually dug in. His hand moved and he allowed it to rest there.* - Tue Dec  1 03:03:53 2015
