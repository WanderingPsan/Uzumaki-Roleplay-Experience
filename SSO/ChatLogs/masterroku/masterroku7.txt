<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: She'll work! - Tue Nov 17 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: She also has a guard, so feel free to give them more challenging missions if the situation calls for it. - Tue Nov 17 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Her name is Shiro. - Tue Nov 17 02:21:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Shiro, you are to show the proper respect to the Mizukage. - Tue Nov 17 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Tue Nov 17 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Oh, right. - Tue Nov 17 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Sorry.~ - Tue Nov 17 02:33:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I expect you to have at least finished five missions by the time I return. - Tue Nov 17 02:37:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Okay. - Tue Nov 17 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Five missions. - Tue Nov 17 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Got it.~ - Tue Nov 17 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Hey, Ichiro. - Tue Nov 17 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Ichiro.~ - Tue Nov 17 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Yes? - Tue Nov 17 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Let's go rob someone of their house and take it for our own.~ - Tue Nov 17 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: It'll be fun. - Tue Nov 17 02:39:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: As you wish. - Tue Nov 17 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) simply stood along to the side, watching as the stray villagers ran. He had no protests to this action of course. Rather, he simply waited for a command from Shiro, if he was needed that is.* - Tue Nov 17 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Hey.~ - Tue Nov 17 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Ichiro.~ - Tue Nov 17 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Are you good at massages? - Tue Nov 17 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I've never given one before. - Tue Nov 17 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Give me one.~ - Tue Nov 17 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Shoulders and legs please. - Tue Nov 17 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: ... - Tue Nov 17 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: As you wish. - Tue Nov 17 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) simply approaches, standing at the bedside for only a moment as he observed the girl. This was entirely new, unlike any other client he'd had prior. However, he was practically owned by her now. A slave by choice one could say. Yet it did not matter. Taking his hands, he clamped them together and cracked his knuckles before moving in, applying his hands to her shoulders first---only because that was the order she stated.

Once his hands were in contact, he made sure to grip, allowing himself to take a firm grasp, but not one that would cause any harm or be considered 'too rough.' Eventually he began to rub, making sure that his actions were as relaxing as possible.* - Tue Nov 17 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) simply nodded, applying a bit more pressure as he went through the motions. His hands easily massaging her shoulders as he did so. It didn't take long for him to realize this was actually rather calming compared to other tasks he'd performed.

"Like this?"* - Tue Nov 17 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) continued to apply his hands, never stopping with his attempt at giving the perfect massage. It was his first time doing so, but he believed he was handling it quite well. "Good."

When asked though, he had not flinched, expecting for such odd questions to come sooner or later. Rather than reacting horribly, he simply gave his honest response. "It's quite possibly Lady Shiro."* - Tue Nov 17 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) slowed his actions, but made sure to continue with his massaging. He pondered on her words, taking into consideration what she'd requested. Ichiro had of course never cooked for another, but he could think of a few things he could cook for her.

"Hm...I know this is a rather odd time for such a meal, but would an omelette suffice?"* - Tue Nov 17 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) nodded, removing himself from the room as he moved on to the kitchen, of course going to prepare the meal for his employer.* - Tue Nov 17 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) finds himself hovering in front of the fridge door, of course beginning to inspecting the two portions of it. Eventually, he set a hand on the lower door's handle and proceeded to open it, finding exactly what was needed. Without a problem, he was bringing out the eggs, milk, butter, salt and pepper, and various other additives for some expression and flavor.

Without a problem, he soon found a mixing bowl as well and turned the stove on, for preheating purposes. To begin, he applied the basic ingredients; Cracking eggs and applying them to the bowl alongside the milk--for fluff of course. Salt and pepper coming in as well, which he added based upon his own observation and estimations. As Ichiro went along, it seemed more like he'd been going based off a simple routine.

Regardless of whether or not he'd done this task before, he allowed himself to mix it thoroughly and eventually apply it to the pan on the stove. With minimal time, he watched it cook, applying various ingredients like cheese, tomatoes, and a few more appropriate igredients. 

Within no time the omelette was done. Like a scientist, elated with the results of an experiment, Ichiro smiled as he applied the meal to a plate, adding on top some more decorative things to make the omelette appear more appealing. Once done, he turned, drawing the plate inwards and holding it steadily as he motioned to bring it to Shiro. Noticing she was at the table, he'd of course placed it on the table in front of her, and supplied a fork--along with a knife, just in case.

"I hope this is to your liking, Lady Shiro."* - Tue Nov 17 04:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) only remained at the side, observing. To her first statement, he only responded, 

"I'd never dream of poisoning you."

When complimented,

"Thank you. It's apart of my daily routine."* - Tue Nov 17 04:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Daily routine? - Tue Nov 17 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: So you always cooked for yourself too? - Tue Nov 17 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Bet your previous employer couldn't cook. - Tue Nov 17 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I don't believe she could. But I'd never know, she only had me guard. Never anything else. - Tue Nov 17 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: You're more like my butler anywho. - Tue Nov 17 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: I'll get you one of those fancy suits too. - Tue Nov 17 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: To go along with you. - Tue Nov 17 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Now, let's go get ourselves a mission. - Tue Nov 17 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Alright. - Tue Nov 17 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: I still have five to go. - Tue Nov 17 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) turned his head to look upon Kida as he arrived, stopping just short of the little girl. Not on purpose of course, but simply due to the fact that he didn't notice her. But her presence was obvous.

Rather, he mistook her for a short pillar or something. Meanwhile, Ichiro's powerful frame more than likely overshadowed her.

"Hello, again."* - Tue Nov 17 04:28:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Yes, Lady Shiro. - Tue Nov 17 04:35:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Do you know Ichiro here?~ - Tue Nov 17 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I met him before. Why? - Tue Nov 17 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: He's my new butler! - Tue Nov 17 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: You should be my butler too. - Tue Nov 17 04:44:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Okay. - Tue Nov 17 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: I understand.~ - Tue Nov 17 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Hey, Ichiro. - Tue Nov 17 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: If there's anything you want, just tell me. - Tue Nov 17 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: I can probably get it for you. - Tue Nov 17 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: With one kick. - Tue Nov 17 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I'll be sure to remember that my lady. - Tue Nov 17 04:55:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Why did you want to serve under me? - Tue Nov 17 04:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) casually sits there, stretching his arm out in front of his face. As he looks upon it, he allows himself to channel his chakra as a glossy coating of gold took place amongst it. With ease, it began to harden and shift into a more rock-like construct. His entire arm now being covered in this plated shell. Eventually, the shell that covered the length of his arm grew outwards, gaining some more space as it formed a shield amongst his skin.* - Tue Nov 17 23:18:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Anywhoooooooo. - Wed Nov 18 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Let's go do something fun. - Wed Nov 18 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Kida, Ichiro, how about you two spar or something. - Wed Nov 18 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: And I can watch. - Wed Nov 18 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Alright. Kida? - Wed Nov 18 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Sure. - Wed Nov 18 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: It'll probably be like the last. - Wed Nov 18 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Then let us find an appropriate space to spar. - Wed Nov 18 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I doubt we should have to stray from the confinements of this complex however. - Wed Nov 18 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: There's the lake behind the academy. There's enough space there. - Wed Nov 18 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: That should suffice, I suppose. - Wed Nov 18 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Com'on.~ - Wed Nov 18 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Let's go.~ - Wed Nov 18 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Lake~. - Wed Nov 18 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Two men swimming together while rassling. - Wed Nov 18 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Out of respect. I shall allow you the first action. - Wed Nov 18 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) thinks: Oh, oh, oh! - Wed Nov 18 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) thinks: HE CAN USE KICKS TOO. - Wed Nov 18 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed as Kida made an approach, initiating the sparring sequence. As his eyes fell upon his opponent, he took notice in the differences between their combat styles. His opponent focused on leg strength while Ichiro was all upper-body strength.

Of course, Ichiro's speed hadn't improved in the recent days and therefore left him open for attack--compared to Kida's speed at the least. Instead, he simply allowed his arms to raise up and create a blocking motion, aimed to meet with the kick. And of course, he felt a great power behind it. Regardless though, his durability saved him in this situation.

In response, assuming Kida had came to the ground after the initial kick, Ichiro didn't hesitate, tossing forward a punch, aimed for no region in particular. Just the body in general.* - Wed Nov 18 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) returned a simple smile to Kida, finding that one change in every fighter's body that always represented the region of attack. His frame was low enough for Ichiro to identify, too low rather. The fact that he was going low left Ichiro without another chance to dodge or guard correctly. Rather than doing so however, he twisted his feet and grinded them into the dirt a bit as he tried to get a sturdy foundation.

When the kick met his leg, he felt it begin to buckle, but had indeed resisted, shifting the one leg inwards, finding that fact to be unavoidable. With the displacement of his sturdy stance, he allowed his grinning face and eyes of intamacy---for combat of course---to meet with Kida's. 

A lunge forward and Ichiro had made another attempt at the fellow, trying to make sure his legs were set enough for him just in case he utilized some other fancy kick in the process. Regardless, he wasn't attempting to punch this time, but rather, he wished to gain a grip on Kida's head. To do so, he lurched out the left arm, the less dominant, to find a grasp.* - Wed Nov 18 02:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) thinks: Cool... - Wed Nov 18 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed the tactics employed by Kida. The attempt to deliver another kick, in such a position had impressed him. It was a tactic he didn't expect to take place with such little moment, but it wasn't unheard of. Ichiro'd heard of boxers applying the same method before.

Rather than following through with his motion, this was a chance for him to apply his method of dodging. And he only had a small window of chance. The grip was released and Ichiro's body had gone into an awkward pose, tossing the upper-body backwards while his knees bent and effectively tossed him into a low position overall.

With his stance, it didn't seem possible for him to combat from this position, his arms hanging from his sides while the lower portion of his body appeared to be squatting while he leaned back---far back. A single breath expelled itself from within Ichiro though as he aimed to bring his head up, letting himself look upon Kida for targetting.

The next action was a simple toss of Ichiro's fist forward. The difference between a kick-boxer and a boxer being where the power came from, and of course Ichiro had to target the most available point to him. His right arm drawing across his body to come in for the strike, aimed for the leg.* - Wed Nov 18 02:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) recovered from his leaning position, allowing himself to set in the basics of the stance he used. His body hanging low and showing that he obviously had no open guard. His plan was to come in with another strike, but he recognized that Kida had taken a step back, bringing a distance between the two of them. 

His initial action changed into an entirely new one, launching his body forward with a lunging strike. His body sprang forward and he delivered a single punch towards Kida's body. As he did so, he brought his fist towards the center of his chest with a right straight. The momentum of his strike leading up to a more impactful punch.* - Wed Nov 18 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed as his technique had been, quite easily, parried. The series of kicks buffetting his form as he twisted, contoring along with them. The result of such causing him to back out, spinning in motion. The damage had been done, and Ichiro remained in a daze for a bit.

Rather than doing the most humane reaction---a shake of the head to regain what was once lost--he picked up on his senses, focusing on them as he attempted to regain sight upon Kida. His stance was retained once more as he backed out, attempting to regain a set on the defensive.

Overall, Ichiro was attempting to prepare himself for a followup technique from Kida.* - Wed Nov 18 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) had regained a bit of his senses--enough to spot Kida's movements. Of course however, he hadn't the faintest idea of how he'd assault, other than assuming that his legs would come in play once more. Ichiro's own response was simply to wait for the kick off.

When his opponent came close, he backed out, contorting his upperbody so it'd be more or less out of the base range. The lift from the ground to the intended target giving him a good idea of Kida's plan.

Once he backed out, he recognized the pattern, swaying his body from left to right as he moved back inwards. A strike from his left was tossed in and he aimed to come in from the side his kick lead from, planning to end up behind it. His left fist thrusted forward in a quick jab, aimed for the chest and then his right quickly followed after, aiming to get a combo in.* - Wed Nov 18 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) observed Kida, seeing that he backed from his range. A smirk drew out across Ichiro's face as he peered on his opponent. Overall, his brutish nature was overcoming him as he looked upon him. His body feeling some light sense of pain and his stamina still, well-intact.

Overall he was feelling quite well from this bout between the two of them. "It is indeed." A light nod and then Ichiro was back at it, lashing outwards towards Kida. This was only due to the fact that it never registered as anything more than encouragement. 

His right fist had came forward once more, pushing forward with additional force to strike Kida in his chest. This seemed to be the central point of attack for himself apparently.* - Wed Nov 18 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) found the return from Kida being incredibly impressive. The kick meeting his ribs causing recoil, but overall, the pain was mitigated itself. He attempted to remain sturdy, and retain his position while his face still held a smirk. His fist stayed its place and the two titans had stood there, at claw's reach. Each of them could easily go blow for blow, but Ichiro could tell that he was everlasting.

His fist retracted and he brought in the other, pushing it forward to thrust it into Kida's face itself. This strike however, he intended to have some blow-back on it, trying to knock back his opponent and create space so he could lead up for another momentous punch.* - Wed Nov 18 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) drew back from Kida, allowing himself to step back into his normal pose, almost though he never entered combat. As he looked to Kida, a single hand jutted out for a handshake. "A tie it is then."* - Wed Nov 18 04:39:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Take some of his steak too! - Wed Nov 18 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I didn't think you knew how to cook. - Wed Nov 18 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It's apart of my routine and diet. - Wed Nov 18 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I'm not the greatest cook either. I just grill stuff until it's edible. - Wed Nov 18 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) made his way through the doorway, quickly approaching the stove and refrigerator. With a swift motion, he allowed himself to open up the door and search for the necessary contents. However, it seemed after only accessing it once before, he already memorized the contents. This only made it take less time to collect the necessary ingredients--which wasn't much really.

He set a pot upon the stove, allowing the rice to set within it and begin its short process instantly. He knew that it wouldn't take long for that to finish, nor would it take much to control. On the other hand though, he had to pull out various spices and what not. These were applied to the uncooked steaks---for preparation purposes and seasoning obviously.

Only moments later he was applying this to the stoe itself and he found himself observing the delicacy was it sizzled and what not. His eyes scrolled over the rice and steak, while his hands moved to make sure heat was evenly distributed and everything was being cooked thoroughly. Ichiro himself was unsure of how the two enjoyed their steak, but generally people didn't follow his diet.

Therefore, he made sure they were cooked all the way through. Once he'd finished such, he allowed himself to ocnjure up two plates. One for Kida--Which, to his ladies request had left Kida with more rice than steak overall. The other being for Shiro herself, and this had been wealthy in terms of steak. Adding additional herbs, he utilized them in a decorative form, somewhat like a proffesional chef---although he was nowhere near such.

Once completed, he took both plates in hand and brought them to the table, setting each plate down in front of their designated consumers respectively. Stepping back, he let his hands cling to each other as he stated, "Enjoy."* - Wed Nov 18 05:37:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Then what's the point of being a bodyguard to them? - Wed Nov 18 05:57:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) turned his head, looking to Shiro. He was somewhat taken aback by the question. He'd never really observed her as something to be attracted to--just as he did with Asteroth. It was unlike him to view his employers like so. But since he needed to answer her question, honestly and truthfully. He gave her a good look before responding.

"Truthfully, yes."* - Wed Nov 18 06:07:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Master Sado is going to beat me if I don't get those five missions done.... - Wed Nov 18 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: And the Mizukage isn't giving me my missions! - Wed Nov 18 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: What should I do? - Wed Nov 18 06:10:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Just because I'm a sadomasochistical fuck. - Wed Nov 18 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Doesn't mean I want my body to be pierced and ruined to uselessness. - Wed Nov 18 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Pain ---it's like eating. - Wed Nov 18 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: You can't eat too much. - Wed Nov 18 06:12:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Or something given by the Kage. - Wed Nov 18 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Probably something insignificant. - Wed Nov 18 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So any mission basically? - Wed Nov 18 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Yeah. - Wed Nov 18 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Do you know why the Mizukage won't give you anything to do? - Wed Nov 18 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Why? - Wed Nov 18 06:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: ----Oh, is that a question for me? - Wed Nov 18 06:24:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Sounds like a very likely probability. - Wed Nov 18 06:27:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) simply remains still, letting his eyes set on the door. Of course he'd settle in nicely though, resting himself as he kept watch.* - Wed Nov 18 07:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) extends a single arm as he allowed himself to access his chakra, forcing a liquid through his sweat glands. Without a problem, he found himself encasing his arm in a layer of liquid gold. Soon, it began to oxidize and solidfy there in place, leaving Ichiro will a solid plate of gold covering his arm like a gauntlet.* - Thu Nov 19 07:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) raises up the other arm as he holds it out ahead of himself. While he does so, he allows himself to access his chakra and coat this one as well. Without a doubt, he found himself extending both of his arms as he looked over the golden carapace that encoated them. Even if it was his own ability, it still impressed him.* - Thu Nov 19 07:48:03 2015
