<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: -Safe- - Sun Dec 13 07:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) had simply remained outside in the wood. Standing there, he allows himself to access a few handseals. Eventually he allocates his chakra within the gut, guiding it outwards like a single strand to reach his clan's special tenketsu point located in the mouth. Eventually, Ichiro spit forth, releasing a webbing to connect to a single tree. The end that remained strapped to himself was moved from his mouth to his leg. He of course, wrapped such around his leg.

Following that, Ichiro applied the technique once more and strapped this to his other leg. Now with his legs tethered to the two trees, and himself set in a prepared stance, he started forward. The intent of this action to help him gain stronger leg muscles. He simply guided himself forward and began to walk, moving his right and left leg with difficulty.

Ichiro pulled onwards, moving his legs around with great problems. His upperbody leaned forward somewhat, meanwhile his legs remained back. This was only due to the restriction of his legs; the webbing being incredibly strong in this case. His movement continued to be a forward movement as he goes on.

Eventually his actions led to him feeling a very powerful strain on his legs. Regardless though, Ichiro remained directly set on stretching out. His training was becoming rather useful and he could feel the tendons in his legs going to work. A slight burning sensation beginning to erupt from within his legs as he trudged onwards.

Soon enough, Ichiro could hear a sound from behind himself, the pressure he could feel being alleviated somewhat as he moved a bit further beyond his original distance. The tree had broken, not entirely but just enough so that he could get that edge on distance. But he knew all too well that something was soon to give out.

Regardless though, Ichiro's body continued to move onwards from his centerpoint. Step after step her found himself  with less of a struggle, but still some resistance. Eventually it got to the point where the webbing gave way and the trees had been alleviated once more. Now Ichiro simply stood there, looking back towards the two trees he utilized for this training.

A single grunt came from him and he quickly removed the webbing from his legs before bringing a hand to his chin. Remaining still by himself, he simply allowed himself a glance at the ground, pondering on what to do next.* - Sun Dec 13 17:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Yo Ichiro, I'm bored. - Sun Dec 13 18:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) simply cracked his knuckles as he looked towards the ground beneath him. Ichiro recognized that even with his active training, he'd been lacking quite a lot. He simply allowed himself to move ahead. Soon, he was standing in front of a tree before flipping himself into a handstand. 

For the moment, Ichiro distilled himself in the air, allowing his backside to face the tree. With some basic movements, he guided his body backwards until the tree assisted him in keeping some type of balance. Now suspended there, Ichiro set his arms apart, leaving them at a reasonable width. His legs clamped together tightly and held still. Eventually he began to lower himself, his arms now bending to form right angles. 

His body proceeded to lower and raise all the same. It was like doing pushups but balance was a more important focus. While his head continued to bob up and down. The difficulty of this position being that he had to keep his own head from connecting with the grass. A result of this being just the ends of his hair connecting with the grasslands below, but the rest of him generally avoiding it.

For a while, this continued onwards as Ichiro attempted to develop himself beyond his current situation, dealing with the weight of gravity coming down upon him. But then, he heard the voice of Kida and simply angled his legs to move forward, allowing himself to bring his legs downwards. Eventually he found himself on his feet, squatting. His eyes switched over to his comrade before speaking out, "Not much to do without some higher power running around."* - Sun Dec 13 18:18:11 2015
