<br><font color=green>*Joutei, Fukyuu(Kyotoshien) says: (alright)
<br><font color=yellow>*Joutei, Fukyuu(Kyotoshien) was staring down his opponent before he watched them slumped over. Both he and his opponent was at their limits. He began to form hand signs trying to gather up enough chakra to form the next technique. His opponent began to dash towards him forming hand signs. He jumped into the air launching a fire ball towards Fukyuu but Fukyuu managed to roll to the left to move out of the way while the fireball clipped his clothing. "Damn it that was a little too close..." he thought to himself as he began to launch his technique. "Raiton: Raikyuu!" he said as he launched a ball of lightning right at his opponent who happened to be hit in the left shoulder. Because Fukyuu was at his limits his aim was a little bit off.

His opponent fell backwards and landed on the ground trying to gather his bearings. They both began forming hand signs at the same time rushing at each other. Fukyuu held his hand sign as he began to rush into the opponents attack. "Katon: Housenka no Jutsu!" his opponent uttered as Fukyuu was englufed in flames only to turn into a log while he would appear in a tree behind his opponent and a hissing sound could be heard from the log he substituted into. Fukyuu formed a hand seal and detonated the explosive tag he had on the log he substituted from and blasted his opponent back. Fukyuu began forming hand seals once again and began to run towards the opponent who was blasted backwards. "Raikiri!" he said as he rammed the Lightning Fang into his opponents midsection and pulled his arm out from within the opponent. He then dropped to one knee exaughsted and began to rest for a while before moving on.*

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsurugi, Shi(Kyotoshien) walked along the path heading towards the mansion. Fixing his katana on his belt and straightening his jacket he approached the opening within the path way as he adjusted his headband making sure everything on him was straight. As he continued to walk down he spoted a group of people towards the area. Not sure of what else to do he decided to report in and hopefully find an assignment of some sort.

Hoping not to be interupting anything he would attempt to listen in, only barely hearing parts of words and sentences. He approached the group and gave a humble bow. 

"Excuse me...I hope i'm not Interupting anything."* - Mon Nov 23 01:20:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) says: Have fun, you guys! - Mon Nov 23 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsurugi, Shi(Kyotoshien) says: My...My name? - Mon Nov 23 07:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsurugi, Shi(Kyotoshien) would point to himself as he was surprised that the Mizukage would be acknowledging him. He would bow his head and give a greeting.

"My name is Shi Mitsurugi. I'm a new genin this year." he stated as he would then raise his head.* - Mon Nov 23 07:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsurugi, Shi(Kyotoshien) would raise his hand signaling the Mizukage.

"Actually, If you have a moment of time. I was wondering if you knew anyone who would be willing to train me in the are of Suiton techniques and also Kenjutsu. I'm wanting to utilize them in combat together and I've learned the hidden mist technique, but my skill with it is highly lacking and I can only make a small fog." he would announce towards the Mizukage.* - Mon Nov 23 07:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsurugi, Shi(Kyotoshien) thinks: Calling it a fog is actually a bit of an overstatment in itself though. - Mon Nov 23 07:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsurugi, Shi(Kyotoshien) looked a bit dejected and then crossed his arms and tried to thnk. 

"Do you know a lot about jutsu in general. Maybe you would be able to give me tips and help me. Truth be told the only other jutsu I know is The Body Flicker Technique and i'm only slightly decent with it." he asked. 

He was hoping there'd be a chance for the Mizukage to give him some training or help him increase his skill with one of the jutsu. Maybe coaching him on how to perform them would be beneficial to him.* - Mon Nov 23 07:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsurugi, Shi(Kyotoshien) nodded his head. His taijutsu wasn't perfect but hopefully it was decent enough that he could hold his own against someone of his level.

"I would reallyl ike that. Learning taijutsu would allow me to defend myself should I lose my sword a little bit better. Where do we start?" he looked at the Mizukage with wondering eyes.* - Mon Nov 23 07:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsurugi, Shi(Kyotoshien) would simply clench his fist as he pushed off from the ground where he was standing. He would bring his right hand up from his hip rotating his shoulder foward as he kept his forearm straight going for a simple jab aimed at the Mizukage's face.* - Mon Nov 23 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsurugi, Shi(Kyotoshien) arm went flying upwards as his punch would be redirected and the Mizukage pushed inward into his guard. As that happened he couldn't catch the glimpse of the knee that was making it's way towards his midsection. As the Mizukage stopped his attack he could feel the heat from the Mizukage's body and the gust of wind from the knee rising up and looked down in astonishment as it happened all too quickly for him to process the attack. 

"That...was amazing.."* - Mon Nov 23 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsurugi, Shi(Kyotoshien) remembered the Mizukage extending his hand to counter his attack. As the Mizukage launched his first punch, Shi watched the incoming punch and tried to gauge it's movement. He raised his hand instincitvely to block it instead of misdirecting, but as a result the punch slipped through his guard and ended up landing on him knocking him down a bit. 

"Dang it...Let me...try again." he stated as he would get up dusting himself off as the Mizuakge launched the next punch.* - Mon Nov 23 07:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsurugi, Shi(Kyotoshien) watched the second punch come in as  he tried to use his forearm this time to get leverage on the punch and push it up by force. This did not work as the punch still broke through his attempt at a guard. He was still trying to block the punch instead of diverting it's location. As the punch hit him again sneding him slightly backwards this time. He pushed up off the ground and took a stance again. Not willing to get up he closed his eyes as the Mizukage got ready for the next strike. He tried to remember the feel of his punch being directed and decided to try and mimic that as best as possible.* - Mon Nov 23 07:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsurugi, Shi(Kyotoshien) prepared himself for the third punch as it made it's way towards him. Raising his hand he would slide it along the sides of the Mizukage's arm and raised the arm upwards. He didn't have much strength on him and was hoping to use the momentum of the Mizukage's punch instead of his own, having diverted the punch though he didn't have enough reflexes or speed to capitalize on a second shot, but hoped that that would come with more practice and time.

"Was...was that the correct way?"* - Mon Nov 23 07:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsurugi, Shi(Kyotoshien) nodded at the Mizukage as he came with another simple punch. This time he went with a hook shot, swinging his shoulder a bit and arching the curve of his punch.* - Mon Nov 23 07:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsurugi, Shi(Kyotoshien) saw the swift motion of the Mizukage and felt the contact with his throat as it caused him to gag. Grasping his throat he moved back as the attack completely caught him off guard, as he expected the Mizukage to misdirect or flat out evade the attack. He didn't expect him to cut the attack off and as he coughed a bit he wiped his mouth  and rubbed his throat.

"What....was that?"* - Mon Nov 23 07:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsurugi, Shi(Kyotoshien) nodded as he thought about it.

"It appears even the most simplist of movements can be deadly when done by a master of them...So all I have to do is just hit them in the throat in order to cut off the attack?"* - Mon Nov 23 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsurugi, Shi(Kyotoshien) saw the Mizukage make a clone. He didn't know if it was a basic clone or a variation but he decided to give it a shot and see if he could land a hit in the throat. Sticking his hand out he launched an attack but completely missed the targeted area as he had went for the clones throat. He ended up hitting the clone in the nose instead.* - Mon Nov 23 07:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsurugi, Shi(Kyotoshien) prepared himself as the clone launched itself at him again. This time as he launched the attack, Shi tried to aim at the throat of the clone with his hand. How ever due to focusing too much on the clones movements he launched the strike too early giving it absolutely no effect at all. As the clone rushed into him, it knocked him down as he rolled on the ground unprepared for the strike. Standing up and dusting himself off in a bit of pain he swallowed it down best he could as he took a stance and prepared himself once more for the clone.* - Mon Nov 23 07:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsurugi, Shi(Kyotoshien) watched as the clone came at him with an attack. This time when the clone got close enough he would rush in himself at a time when the clone was just begining the attack. As he did so he raised his hand and launched an attack for the clones throat. Should the attack have hit it would hopefully have the desired reaction from the clone.* - Mon Nov 23 07:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsurugi, Shi(Kyotoshien) says: Hai. Thank you for helping me train Mizukage-sama. I will have these trained and mastered as soon as possible! - Mon Nov 23 08:04:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Any time. - Mon Nov 23 08:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsurugi, Shi(Kyotoshien) he bowed showing gratitude to the Mizukage for his training.* - Mon Nov 23 08:05:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanzo(Kyotoshien) crossed his arms as he closed his eyes. 

"I know for certain my name is Hanzo. At least...that was the name that was on the paper that was in the room with me. How ever the rest of everything is just an absolute blur"* - Sat Nov 28 06:47:02 2015
