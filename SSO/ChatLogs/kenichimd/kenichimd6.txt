<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) | | He quietly nods towards Momura. He heads into the kitchen and gets the frying pan ready. He drips it with some sesame oil and swirls it around.* - Mon Nov  9 01:47:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Hm... didn't answer me. - Mon Nov  9 01:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) stares at the demon ramen request.

He glances at the sauteed sprouts, miso soup, and onigiri. 

"I-I think I can handle all of this, y-yes. Besides the r-ramen. I-I'll let the head chef handle that one."* - Mon Nov  9 01:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: O-Okay.. - Mon Nov  9 01:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: They both stutter. - Mon Nov  9 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) | | Swiftly, he heads into the kitchen. Sauteed sprouts, huh? He quickly assumes that by sprouts, it was brussel sprouts. He sets to the job quickly. It was a healthy dish and would be the very first to be completed, due to Hanai's proficiency and adequacy when it came to such dishes. 

He gets a large pot of water and sets the heat to medium-high. He lets the water start to boil before he places the brussel sprouts in. After perhaps three minutes, he drains the pot after lifting it off of the stove, letting the brussel sprouts soak in the water and become much more tender. It was easier to bite through the brussel sprouts because of how long they had been soaked, and especially because of their heat. 

He had sesame oil on a frying pan earlier. He adds in several chopped up onions, diced to perfection. He stirs it until the onion becomes browned. He stirs in salt and pepper, continuously moving the pan so that everything mixed evenly. He adds the brussel sprouts, letting them cook in the frying pan. 

Finally, he extracts them from the pan, places them in a bowl, simmers them in a dose of lemon juice, and places it on the side.

He'd work on the rest in a moment. Onigiri was simple enough. He cups out some rice.

However, he suddenly stops.

"R-Regular onigiri?" He murmured. He wraps the onigiri up in seaweed after he formed the rice into the triangular shapes that he so liked. It was so perfectly triangular that it could almost be considered OCD---the way Hanai picks at every single rice until it was perfect. Not a single rice stood out. The shape was to perfection. 

He moves to the completed brussel sprouts and rearranges them in a circular fashion, letting them spiral inwards with the design.

He starts to work on the miso soup afterwards, but because it was a broth, it'd take longer.

"Onigiri and sauteed sprouts are done...I-Iced water you can get by the refridgerator."* - Mon Nov  9 02:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) | | He proceeds to the miso soup. He places dashi granules and water into a large pot, akin to the one he used at the beginning. He lets it go to a boil before whisking in the miso paste. Two spoonfuls should've been enough for this size of soup. He slices up spring onions, and tosses them into the pot. He gets a bowl-ful via ladle and places the bowl on the side.* - Mon Nov  9 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: Making the noodles for ramen is too difficult. - Mon Nov  9 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: I could make the broth... I guess. - Mon Nov  9 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: D-Deliver the sprouts and the onigiri please. - Mon Nov  9 02:06:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: I need to season the miso-soup some more. - Mon Nov  9 02:06:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) slices up the tofu and starts to dump the soft tofu into the miso soup. He stirs it and lets it boil. He wanted it to be very gentle on the teeth.* - Mon Nov  9 02:22:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) | | Quickly, he heads into the kitchen. He gets a frying pan, pours sesame oil over it, and begins to simmer it. He tosses chicken wings onto it, letting both sides of the chicken wing brown as the oil dripped along it. Hanai uses a poele method to cook the chicken wing, ladling the oil over it again and again. Once done, he pours the mixture into a broth, comprised of mainly water. He lets it all mix together, while taking the scum off from the surface of the liquid.

He then drains the broth and pours it into a container. Once done, he had gotten enough for several different containers of the aspic seasoning.

He now strips away at the chicken wings, deboning it. Once executed, Hanai moves along to work on the eggs. He places four egg yolks in a cup. He removes of the egg whites and whisks the yolk together with a pinch of salt plus a tablespoon of white sugar. Once done, he fries the mixture, letting it turn into curds during a whisking process while it was on the pan.

He had finally completed the recipe. He dices up spring onions and sprinkles it onto rice which he places the chicken strips plus the egg ontop of.

He brings the combination over to Marrisa, with a small container of aspic.

Afterwards, he strides to the dishware to grab two glasses. Once he got the two glasses, he pours water into the two. With two small umbrella toothpick, he spears through slices of lemon and sticks them into the glasses. He passes them to Momura.

Before he does so, he drizzles sesame oil over the pan to give it a fried taste. He fries the chicken, drizzling spices over the chicken while he does so. He marinates it in an orange sauce mixed with something akin to Cholula. 

While it fries, he moves to collect some of the eggrolls from the freezer. He himself didn't know how to make them, so he just heats up some of the eggrolls his boss made an hour ago. He drizzles orange sauce over them so that they had a sweet taste to them.

Next, he works on the fishcake. He dips sections of salmon into flour and places them atop of another pan drizzled with sesame oil. He fries the fishcakes until they were brownish yellow. He puts them on a plate, seasoning with salt & pepper.

Unfortunately, he was greeted with a malicious sight that sent a chill up his central nervous system and threw his peripherals off for a loop with an outrage whose sinister nature professed itself to the atmosphere. His lavendar gaze sets itself on Ryutaro. He dared not to make a move with his girlfriend so close to death's table. 

"What are you doing, sir? May I ask you to release her?" He drops his sports bag, though there is a lackluster intimidation factor present on his facial expression. He did not plan on threatening his foe into coercion, but rather reason with him.* - Tue Nov 10 02:22:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) | | His subtle lavendar gaze settles on Ortho briefly; however, it quickly shifts its attention by riveting Hanai's optics onto Ryutaro. It was not solely because he was regarded as a threat; rather, it was because Hanai was exercising prudence around this mysterious figure. Of course, this does not insinuate Hanai's attention had dissipated from Ortho entirely; he had not met either of the two and thusly had no reason to trust either of them.

His dark brown hair is stroked to the side with a single fluid maneuver of his left hand across his temple, barely grazing his sphenoid bone as it approached. What is to note is that he does not speak, nonetheless. He allows the others to converse, or direct their words to him, for Hanai did not want to start any conversation that could be misinterpreted as provocation, nor did he want to show himself off as an 'active' individual versus a socially passive one.* - Tue Nov 10 02:34:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) | | Swiftly, Hanai gets to work on the miso soup. He pours in a large surplus of water into a pot. He sets the pot onto the stove and adjusts the heat to a medium-high. As the water begins to bubble (indicative of its nearing the boilng point), Hanai combines in dashi granules that were in the refridgerator.

Moments later, Hanai retrieves a small wooden plate of soft tofu. He chops it up with finesse momentarily, and places the tofu in the mix. He takes two spoonfuls of miso paste, quickly whisking it with the rest of the components. 

Afterwards, Hanai's hand nimbly slices up green onion, dicing it up so that it could be added to the miso soup. A pinch of salt was added to the mixture as to make it a bit more tasteful. 

He did ask for the 'finest' after all.

Once he completed it, he cupped it into a small cup. He then cups the leftovers into a larger cup.

"D-Deliver this to him.." He murmured towards Momura. He heads to grab hold of three glasses, to fill them with water. He'd put it all on a plate. 

As for the larger bowl, Hanai himself would carry it out---leaving Momura with the less heavy task.* - Tue Nov 10 03:04:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) moves over to the kitchen area. He smiles over at Kuro with a friendly nature attached to his visage. He sets the heat of the stove to a medium-high. He decided that for dinner he'd make some miso soup, radish cake, and some fried rice. 

He had radish cake prepared from earlier, so he only needed to extract it and heat it up. As for the miso soup, Hanai sets a large pot of water on the stove. He pours into two granules of dashi. Afterwards, he'd stir it all together, pushing in some slices of tofu which he graciously slices up into 1x1 cm cubes. 

He whisks in miso paste and places a pinch of salt into the pot. Once completed, Hanai stops the heat and begins work on the fried rice. He poured sesame oil over a pan and shoved quite a bit of rice onto the oil. He'd fry the rice and graciously place some sliced bellpeppers into the mixture. He scooped out beans from string bean and placed it inside of the concoction as well. 

Once he had finished, he brought bowls and plates over to the table for them to eat.* - Tue Nov 10 03:58:56 2015
