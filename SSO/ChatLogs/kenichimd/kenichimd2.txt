<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsujin(KenichiMD) dodges the ashbone. Tetsujin steps forward. His hands incline in order to assimilate a handseal. Upon execution, Tetsujin's skin turns a pitch black gray. "Come. Show me what you can do, Ossa, Baen."* - Tue Oct 20 00:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsujin(KenichiMD) // The spear had been chucked straight ahead to Tetsujin. "Thank you, for the weapon." Tetsujin catches the spear. Upon catching it though, he is struck by Baen's attack. The fire attached to his fist had also amplified his strike. Unfortunately, upon contact with Tetsujin's body, there is little movement; he doesn't even skid back from the strike. His heavy armor, coupled with his iron apparatus which served to shield his body like a guardian angel, was enough to heavily smother Baen's attack, as well as the fires wreathed around his body.

"A nice attack. Now let me show you mine." Portions of Tetsujin's skin break apart, suddenly firing off small pebble-like structures of his skin. The pebbles aim to scatter and bludgeon Baen across the body, aiming at various locations without discrimination. * - Tue Oct 20 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsujin(KenichiMD) // Swiftly, Tetsujin backpedals. He reacts to the attack, despite his slower form in the iron carapace. The fingers were unleashing shrapnel consisting of bone bullets. He isn't prey to the damage, as much as one would hope. The bullets penetrate his armor but are repelled by his skin, which are much more durable in comparison. Tetsujin smirks.

"You're not too shabby, anyways." Tetsujin calmly notes. He slides his foot back and enters a differing stance---one of notable Taijutsu prowess.

"Let's start getting more serious, though."* - Tue Oct 20 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsujin(KenichiMD) // It was increidble. Sharpened spears were not being used to spear his hardened exterior. On the other hand though, Tetsujin's skin begins to grow jagged edges of iron. Tetsujin's right hand reaches forward, aiming to strike Baen while he was in the air. His rotation was countered mainly by a plume of defensive spikes which sprout upon instinct. 

His bladed arm is also attempting to be used to slice Baen while he spins across him in the air.* - Tue Oct 20 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsujin(KenichiMD) // The flames, unlike the lava he had to face once, were little in comparison to Tetsujin's incredible iron texture. Tetsujin bares the fire without feeling a sensation of heat due to iron complex having assimilated all of his tissues. 

"It's hot and ticklish." Tetsujin snorts. The ivory spears and his iron clash, gray against silver metallic. Neither seem to win though. The flames wash over Tetsujin's body. Not only that, but Baen was skirting around him.

It was true that Baen was faster. However, Tetsujin was a construct of iron. He needed not speed. He needed the endurance and stamina to outlast Baen in the end. Tetsujin's leg extends, sharpened by the edges and razor-bladed ends of his shin, to try and slice into Baen. 

After a short while, the fire fades away from Tetsujin's body, as he wasn't a flammable substance. * - Tue Oct 20 01:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsujin(KenichiMD) // It was brisk and sudden. Tetsujin's right hand aimed to counter Baen's attack, parrying it. There was no way in hell Tetsujin could dodge due to his additional weight from his transformation. Therefore, he took the simplistic and more sophomoric way out. His right hand was thrusted to try and counter the attack with a dynamite clash. 

Sharpened, his blade aims to repulse and negate Baen's attempt at damaging him. 

"You're strong. But you're not strong enough. You can handle any man. But you cannot handle the Iron Man."* - Tue Oct 20 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsujin(KenichiMD) wasn't going to draw his blade. His hands were his blades. Which meant that his opponent was going to be in for quite the fight.

The speed at which his blade flashed though tremendously confused Tetsujin. Eyesight alone with the maximum capacity of carrots could not assist Tetsujin enough in countervailing the onslaught of veiling hits. As soon as they strike though, Tetsujin's right hand jabs outward, trying to stop the entire combination altogether by simply thrusting his palm into Ossa's chest. With this push, he aimed to break the combo entirely. 

Afterwards, Tetsujin's right leg launches itself off the ground and attempts to smash itself into Baen's lower ankle, targeting his left leg where he wasn't as focused in comparison to the upper body.* - Tue Oct 20 01:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsujin(KenichiMD) // The fire that had been manipulated to be conjured from the tip of the bone surprised Tetsujin. Added heat would heat up his iron, but it would do nothing more than that; it was not to the level of melting his iron. Of course, the hotter something was, the faster molecules moved, which meant that it would continue to grow hotter until it closed in on liquidity. That was far from now though.

Tetsujin's strike lands square on his shin. Suddenly, Tetsujin's left hand rushes for Ossa's chest, aiming to stab straight through his sternum. In the midst of its rush, it had hardened to its pinnacle, peaking at the sharpest of spears. Tetsujin's hand aimed to pierce into Ossa's sternum and bring him to a state of desperation, should his attack have penetrated.

Hopefully, he may erect his boner armor, or expect harsh injury to subside in his body.

"Sky Scorcher." 

It was Tetsujin's ultimate attack.* - Tue Oct 20 01:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsujin(KenichiMD) had managed to pierce Ossa's defenses to some extent. Tetsujin stood as Ossa screamed in pain and roared in anger. Tetsujin's eyes landed on his prey, as it was downed. 

"You're a strong warrior. But you've still not grown strong enough to beat me yet." He had lost some of his iron in crossfire, so Tetsujin had assimilated additional armor in order to upkeep his performance in combat. 

"Let's see how well you can fare though, if we continue, Ossa, Baen, the mankiller."* - Tue Oct 20 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Lmaooo - Tue Oct 20 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsujin(KenichiMD) // Suddenly, Tetsujin is speared by numerous of the white bones. Tetsujin's iron carapace though, which lacked veins and whatnot, were being destroyed rapidly. He is crushed into thousands of pieces by the attack, which repeatedly strikes him without mercy. Afterwards though, Tetsujin's body spreads out above Ossa.

"You're strong. I've never been broken apart like that so easily. However, I am -iron-. I am not -man-." Tetsujin shouted. His needles begin to coalesce, before all of them dive to try and spear Ossa through various regions of his body and strike him in every location known to man, nook & cranny.

He also probably didn't know.

Tetsujin had absorbed the Kubikirihoucho. Drawing blood from Ossa supplied Tetsujin with regenerative properties to an extent, giving him the lost iron from Ossa's deadly attack.

Naturally though, this doesn't come with reprrcussions. The arena is still filled with bones. Baen, should this attack not finish him off, could just assimilate with the bones afterwards to escape any further attack.

"What's yours is mine, and what's mine is mine."* - Tue Oct 20 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsujin(KenichiMD) strikes the first bone pillar Baen entered. Tetsujin reforms shortly afterwards, aware that his target was moving through the bones like it was some Yuki Ice Mirrors Demonic bullcrap. 

He maintains his position in the center. "Come out, mankiller. Why do you fear me?"* - Tue Oct 20 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsujin(KenichiMD) // Flames blasted themselves at Tetsujin. However, without a proper technique to channel the power into, it was little less than a spark of fire being blown on him, akin to a flamethrower from a pyrotechnic. Tetsujin takes the fire and his iron starts to shave a little.

"Coward. Stop hiding in your forest of white."* - Tue Oct 20 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsujin(KenichiMD) // Suddenly, as the spear is used to quite literally pin him, Tetsujin angrily changes his facial expression. "You piece of shit. You think that's good enough to handle me?" He had been caught off-guard by the speed at which Baen had moved, which resulted in him being smashed right into the bone. Tetsujin was half tempted to remove himself from the position. Instead though, Tetsujin's right hand zooms at Baen, from the side, trying to right hook him from the side and dig into his bone armor, damaging him perhaps. * - Tue Oct 20 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsujin(KenichiMD) // Ultimately, Tetsujin was suddenly burned. From the inside-out, his iron was beginning to burn. The accumulated heat made it so that the spear which was dug into Tetsujin's body and penetrative, would be able to heat him from the center of his body. Tetsujin felt the heat and he felt woozy already.

"You--- this was your plan all along!" He shouted. "You knew that my weapon could penetrate me because it was made of the same substance I was. And you used it to catalyze the heat that you planted on my exterior. The interior heat was used to blow me up from the inside!"

He says, in the anime way that they explain things at the end.

Suddenly, Tetsujin combusts, resulting in his end as a flaming apparition.

In his final moments, he walks over to Baen, like the Nightmare of Hell, burning to his skeletal form.

"You now have true power. You will send this world onto a new path. Take my title -- you are now the Legend Killer." Tetsujin stated, as he finally slumps to a halt, resulting in death.* - Tue Oct 20 03:14:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) has to go take out trash as part of one of his missions. Hanai scuttles out of the blacksmith area and decides to go and quickly do his mission. If he could complete it in record time, perhaps he would get a reward from his Mizukage for his diligence and good work ethic! He moves to collect any litter on the ground and tosses them into recycling areas. He tosses them into the recycling bins in order to conserve necessities that could be reused, while throwing any of the food waste into compost bins.

He moves around Kirigakure no Sato, moving specifically in front of houses and near the Mizukage mansion to ensure its spotlessness. He'd remove of the trash promptly, bending and squatting down occasionally in order to pick up the materials that were causing Kirigakure's defaming. He chucks pieces into the trash and disposes of it quickly. 

He had eventually collected enough trash to fill up nine bags. He was sweating, but surprisingly, Hanai was not dead-beat tired despite his small stature. He continues his work diligently, without any break in between. He finishes up the final bag by collecting the trash accollected near the beach's shore and saves the critters of the ocean a lot of time by clearing out the aquatic shoreline. * - Sun Nov  1 00:12:22 2015

The kitty would be difficult to locate, but Hanai had that diligent hardworking air about him that would act as a powerful motivator for him to search every location. He moves along the streets and the sidewalks in order to search for the cat.

He does not find the cat in the meantime, but he does realize that the cat was leaving around disposal trails that could indicate its location. Hanai notices one of the sources because of the footprints that are gathered nearby sand. The distinct footprint of a cat was visible for the perceptive teenager, who spent the majority of his time studying nature and revelling in nature's glorious features.

He moves along to the nearest patch of sand, inspecting it for any clues of the cat's location. He also examines nearby turds that the cat left behind as well as any hairs or hairballs that it may have disposed of on its way. The Mizukage, for whom he would do anything, would be pleased should he be able to complete such missions so quickly!

He continues his hard search. He was sweating though, and it was in profuse quantities that drenched the majority of his temple with the thick wet liquid that emerged from his porous membrane. Nonetheless, since his clavicles, nor his arms, were feeling any sense of tire, he continued his work and searched for the cat.

When he finally found the cat, Hanai made darting motions with a lot of energy in order to catch up with its feline agility. Hanai knew that it would be difficult to catch the cat should he maintain a jogging pace or restrain himself from utilizing all of his energy; he wanted to end it quickly and decisively by catching it on the spot. When he did so, he caught the cat in his two hands and returned to the mansion to deliver it.* - Sun Nov  1 00:16:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) arrives at the Kage's office. Supposedly, this area looked to be the Kage's office, or maybe he was very mistaken. Nonetheless, because it was the region the Kage hung out the most around, Hanai decides to clear up any messes that were at the porch. With an equipped broomstick, he starts a pendulum-like rhythm to sweep at the dirt at the front, cleansing the gravel of any depravities. 

He wipes off sweat from his temple and continues his arduous work, nonstopping. He'd lean down time and time again in order to scrub vigorously where areas were not clean enough. He was a hygiene maniac in a way, and even moreso when it came to the hygienic environment of his Mizukage. 

He sweeps the steps of the academy at this point. Once he realizes that the area was the academy, he switches his location to the Mizukage's mansion and starts to sweep at the steps, knowing that if he did both jobs, there was no way he could be at fault, unless the dirtiness of the academy or mansion would pose some sort of friendly advantage for ninja.* - Sun Nov  1 00:20:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: N-Not in there? - Sun Nov  1 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) | | This house had a trap apparently. He rose both of his arms and tried to protect himself. He backs off though, since he was a bit of chicken. He waits until the smoke fades away.* - Sun Nov  1 01:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: R-Run and get the Kage. - Sun Nov  1 01:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: S-Someone help. - Sun Nov  1 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) quakes in his feet as he watches the scene. He starts to step away from the hallway and starts to make his exit, believing that Vessul could handle himself just fine.* - Sun Nov  1 01:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) | | It is a really tight crunch for Hanai. Hanai is so bloody surprised by the technique of his opponent that Hanai unsuspectingly and forcefully awakens his lycanthropy. His blood pulses throughout his person as he activates his lycanthropy, his skin becoming slightly armored in a way by a vertebraic carapace. 

The strike lands against his palm. Upon contact, Hanai screeches in pain. His right hand though, levels out and attempts to quite literally smash into his opponent's sternum.

However, it might not have done much considering how strong his opponent was. If that was the case, Hanai would simply struggle in place.* - Sun Nov  1 02:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) | | As his wrist was grabbed, Hanai reciprocates out of fear. Quite literally, he attempts to latch onto Arata's wrist in return and join hands in a way. He'd clench tightly on Arata's wrist, hoping to not be thrown and to root Arata in place before he could do any evasive maneuvers. Additionally, Hanai's other hand is used to try and bash into Arata's chest and blow him backwards. 

But, something peculiar had happened during this exchange.

Hanai's Tenketsu was closed earlier, no?

It was because he had activated the Gate of Opening during his attack sequence, enabling him to open the tenketsu after it was closed by forcibly increasing the flow of chakra.* - Sun Nov  1 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) | | Having broken his target's wrist, Hanai had the advantage. Four strikes were now coming at him. Hanai brings his left arm back into his body to protect himself from the Gentle Fist, while his right fist swings Arata with incredible strength. He was going to uproot Arata straight off of where he was and swing him straight through the wall, mercilessly. He'd continue to bash Arata against the ground and the walls without any trace of mercy left for the man who had decided to attack the naturally cowardice infected youth.* - Sun Nov  1 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) tosses Arata's body on the ground. He deactivates his Gate and his ant transformation and literally screams in horror.

"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH."* - Sun Nov  1 02:45:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) pushes himself along the carpet back into the corner. He pulls his knees up to his chest and wraps his arms around his knees. He whispers to himself and incants to himself, as if making some chant for his safety and security. It was all just gibberish in the end, all meant to just sustain his mentality in the face of so much blood.* - Sun Nov  1 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) remains seated, scared as all hell. He apologizes quietly.* - Sun Nov  1 03:48:16 2015
