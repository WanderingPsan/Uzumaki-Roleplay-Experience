<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) | | He lifts up his right hand nonchalantly. Quickly, he blocks the blow using his forearm. His other arm quickly attempts to punch Momura's stomach.

Of course, he held back a great deal, not to hurt Momura.

[6 damage.]* - Wed Nov 11 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) | | He nodded quietly.

"I-I just don't wanna hurt you, s-sorry."* - Wed Nov 11 04:22:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) says: w-wahh... - Wed Nov 11 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) whispers: One of everything. - Wed Nov 11 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) whispers: -Everything- - Wed Nov 11 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jay(Serori2) thinks: This is gonna be great. - Wed Nov 11 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) says: i-i will just h-have water - Wed Nov 11 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) whispers: W-Watermelon tea and W-Water.. - Wed Nov 11 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: O-Okay... - Wed Nov 11 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jay(Serori2) says: Its litterally taking them too long to make this food. - Wed Nov 11 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) | | He glances down at the counter for a moment. Sighing, Hanai moves along to pick out the ingredients for his select dishes. One of everything was a really big demand. He was wondering if they'd be able to afford that much food. Hanai moves along to capture some tea. He pours in the essence of watermelon by squeezing a small amount of watermelon juice into citrus-infused black tea. He adds in two tablespoons of clover honey. Stirring it all together, Hanai completes the watermelon tea with a leaf of mint. * - Wed Nov 11 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jay(Serori2) says: And you still haven't even gotten your water? - Wed Nov 11 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jay(Serori2) says: This is crazy. - Wed Nov 11 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) | | Moving along the orders, Hanai pours in a glass of water and sets it aside onto the table. He moves along to grab hold of some more ingredients.

Granted, he was being ticked off by the comments of Jay, which were audible enough to him. * - Wed Nov 11 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) | | He starts up the heat on the stove, setting it to a medium-high. With a jug of water in his right hand, Hanai pours a large quantity of water into the a pot. He sets the pot atop of the heat and allows the water within the pot to reach its boiling point.

In the meantime, Hanai works on chopping up soft tofu. Once he had gotten enough 1x1 cm cubes, he pours them into the water, with two dashi granules coupled with it. 

Once done, he whisks in miso paste, adds a pinch of salt, and stirs until the miso soup had completed itself. He pours a bowl of miso soup as well as a second cup that was smaller for the person to eat with.

The bowl of miso soup was perhaps alone, four servings, enough to serve four people easily. * - Wed Nov 11 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) | | Next, it was time for him to work on the radish cake. Once he gets ahold of some radish, he shreds it quickly by grating it all up. He grabs rice flour as well, pouring in a cup of water so that he could knead the rice flour together into a dough-like formation seen in dim sum.

He slices up several pieces of bacon as well, adding them to the rice flour mix, as well as the shredded radish. Once he had completed it, Hanai grabs a small plate of soy sauce, that they might be inclined to use for the radish. Not only that, but there was a hot sauce bottle that was reminiscent of cholula on the table as well, if they were so inclined to spice up the radish cake. * - Wed Nov 11 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: Radish cake is done! - Wed Nov 11 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) says: e-eight? - Wed Nov 11 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jay(Serori2) says: I need to stay hydrated for my training. - Wed Nov 11 05:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-Alright.. - Wed Nov 11 05:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jay(Serori2) says: By the way! I'm gonna need refills on those! - Wed Nov 11 05:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) | | He slides along to the very next dish. Quickly, he sets a pan on a stove and heats the stove to a medium-high. He adds sesame oil and lets it drizzle all together. He spreads the oil complex across the black frying pan, using a nonstick ceramic for his purposes. He adds in chicken wing and lets it brown on each side. 

Once it had browned on each side, he pours in the entire mixture into a new pot filled with bonito broth. Having done so, he extracts the scum and removes of it entirely so that it could not perturb the food's excellence. He drains the broth into a new bowl, letting it be set aside in the container. He chills it in the refridgerator.

Next, he works on the eggs. He cracks several eggs and starts to exchange the yolk between eggshells. This was a crucial process in draining out only the whites. Once done, he had gotten four egg whites into a single bowl. He places a pinch of salt in it and whisks it quickly. He pours the mixture into a frying pan, whisks it, and creates several egg curds. Once done, he starts deboning the chicken wings from earlier.

With chicken strips and egg curds combined, he tosses them onto a bowl of rice and sets the container of aspic to the side of it. He puts it on a wooden tray for Momura to carry.

"Take this too!" He says. 

When the refill order was made, he hurriedly fills up eight glasses of water and sets it on the wooden tray as well.* - Wed Nov 11 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) | | Next, he was going to work on the fried chicken strips marinated in orange sauce. He starts to debone chicken wings quickly so that he could get all of the strips set aside. He drizzles oil on both sides; he used peanut oil and tossed them onto a pan.

He fries the chicken strips and seasons it with salt & pepper. Once done, he marinates them in orange sauce, leaving them in a bowl of orange sauce so that they sucked up the sauce.

Upon its finish, he puts it all on a plate, roughly eight chicken strips. 

He offers it to Momura.

"Pass it to them."* - Wed Nov 11 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: L-Let's let them finish that. - Wed Nov 11 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: I-I'll work on the rest. - Wed Nov 11 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: But it'll take some time to marinate the spicy sauce into the grilled chicken.  - Wed Nov 11 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-Alright. - Wed Nov 11 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) says: o-oh my... - Wed Nov 11 05:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) says: mm.. - Wed Nov 11 05:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: . . . - Wed Nov 11 05:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: Mmmm.... - Wed Nov 11 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-Alright. - Wed Nov 11 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) | | He nods. He works up another watermelon tea quickly. He pours in the juice of watermelon and set in a teabag of black tea. Citrus-infused, he allows the watermelon juice and black tea to settle in, before he adds two tablespoons of clover honey, to sweeten the mixture and let it all mix together cohesively. Once done, he places a leaf of mint on the top of the drink and passes it to Momura.

"Watermelon tea."* - Wed Nov 11 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) | | Next, he works on the fried chicken strips. He debones another set of chicken wing, stripping away at the chicken wing until it was in strip form. He sets it on the frying pan, which he pours peanut oil over. He lets it sizzle up. The patron desired no orange sauce on it for some reason. Nonetheless, Hanai seasons it with salt & pepper, and offers the orange sauce on the side if he so cared to dip it in. However, Hanai didn't drizzle it in the sauce as to force it on Huey.

"Chicken strips done."* - Wed Nov 11 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) gets to the dishwashing in the time that he had to spare. He scrubs away at the black ceramic pans that he had been using. He even cleans off the pots, using water and sponges to clean out the scum and the rest of the burns that may have been left on the underside of the pan. It was odd that he was taking such time to clean every part of the pot, when one would only clean the innards usually, since that's where cooking took place.

However, in handling such cooking ware, Hanai was a bit OCD. He was a bit OCD on everything really, making sure that everything was perfectly in shape. All the spices needed to be arranged in alphabetical order on the shelves. He even had to set aside specific racks for particular kitchenwares.* - Wed Nov 11 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) | | Stepping to the side, Hanai takes a deep breath. He was sweating from the temple and he wipes it off with the sleeve of his jacket. Hanai inhales, adjusting his glasses at the same token. "That was tough!" Hanai comments, a newly formed confidence rising in his voice as he cooked. * - Wed Nov 11 05:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: Y-You have to pay for it all. - Wed Nov 11 05:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Huey(LolrZ) says: Ummm? - Wed Nov 11 05:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Huey(LolrZ) says: That is obviously the entire check. - Wed Nov 11 05:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Huey(LolrZ) says: Go and check. - Wed Nov 11 05:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) goes ahead and checks.* - Wed Nov 11 05:50:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) | | He steps up to Huey from behind. His right hand attempts to pat him on the shoulderblade, where his scapula was located. 

"Please just pay the whole amount. I'll drop it to ten-thousand, since you didn't need to marinate the sauce. Marination just takes a long time, which is why it was set to such a price. H-However, I cannot let you disrespect the lady any longer."* - Wed Nov 11 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: Sir.... - Wed Nov 11 06:00:32 2015
