<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) raised a hand up catching the scroll and nodding his head. "I'll do what I can," the child says, briefly turning his attention to the weapon that Hana was given. It actually seemed like a gift far more than some silver kunai. <Neat.> 

Turning back the way he came he'd rest the scroll under his arm and move to leave the area.* - Thu Oct 22 23:43:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) entered the academy, holding the scroll still under his arms. Few students remained now at this time of day - but way in the back nearly out of sight Heiwa found the general appearance of the person he was told about. An older kid than Heiwa, he kept himself on a desk with several scrolls around the area. 

As Heiwa stepped up to the table the older kid would initially dismiss him, waiting for the tutor he was supposed to be given. But in time Heiwa's indifferent stare broke him down and he gave him another glance - this time taking note of the reflective plate strung around the child's leg. This was the tutor he was waiting for.

The tone immediately shifted, with the student laughing off the embarassment of his blunder and offering an apology. Heiwa's response was a simple nod of the head, barely a shift in his face through the whole ordeal, before he reached over and took one of the scrolls laid out amongst the table. Having not been through the academy would mean he couldn't just repeat some of what he was told.

He wasn't even sure how far along the kid was with Genjutsu. Cracking open the scroll though, the child read through most of the information scanning across it at remarkable speeds to absorb what he read. As opposed to fully taking in the information all he needed was a few keywords to know how far along the older kid was.

And it wasn't very far. Shortly after he raised the scroll up to read he'd bring it back down, coming up with a few exercises in his mind for how to help. Most of the things he did were natural - innate. His skill with Genjutsu was initially very untrained, and as of late he hadn't really focused as much as he could with it. However, he'd known of various basic practice methods.

The first of which involved a sliver of a piece of paper. Without saying even a single thing since he got there, Heiwa rips off a slab and places it on the kid's forehead. At his expression of confusion, Heiwa responded with his first statement that entire time "Keep it on your forehead only using your chakra." before leaning back and letting him handle it.

Immediately it fell - but the child brought it back up shortly thereafter and tried it out again. And a few seconds later it failed. The child would look up and see only Heiwa's stare whenever he attempted. "Go on. Keep it on your forehead." He hardly sounded like the child he was, but some of this was what his father had taught to him. Much of it the exact same method.

A lengthy period of this as the primary exercise passed, before the kid started to get a basic ability to keep it on him. And at that point Heiwa began to recite the fundamentals of Genjutsu - what it does and how. And everytime he did he'd ask for a different fundamental to be expressed from the opposing child forcing his attention to be spread between the note on his head and the information that Heiwa was trying to teach him.

Finally, when his session was over and the sun was down, Heiwa nodded and left the exhausted kid leaving him with the words of encouragement for his efforts. "Good job."  It'd hardly even sounded genuine.* - Fri Oct 23 01:03:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) walks up to the desk placing the completed scroll on the table. * - Fri Oct 23 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took the reward and nodded, turning to leave just shortly after.* - Fri Oct 23 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) ran through a simple set of three hand seals, the combination being visibly clear to most shinobis in what it entailed. A brief puff of smoke shrouded the child before making way to reveal an illusory copy standing beside him. All of the features that made up Heiwa would appear in that clone, nearly fully real from a first glance, but closer attention could see the difference.

Without a shadow it was hardly anymore than a distraction, the technique making a clone that could not interact with the environment at all. But it could still work as a form of a target. After beng made it followed the orders that Heiwa thought of on creation, stepping away from the boy several meters away. 

After it turned back around it was ready for Heiwa to properly use it. Reaching into his back pouch he swiftly pulls out a weapon and throws it directly over to the clone wasting no time in the movement. While not as fast or as deft as someone who explicitly trained in the use of weaponry, his skill was still above average for a genin and showed potential.

As it neared, however, the weapon he had thrown would reveal its true stripes. Instead of just one it was a total of two weapons thrown - two shurikens stacked ontop of eachother with the bottom one trailing ever so slightly behind hiding underneath the shadow of the first. When it neared to the end it'd reveal its true stripes by slowly changing trajectory with the bottom one hitting at the sides instead widening the arc.

Of course the clone had barely moved, and dispersed the moment that the technique was finished, but that's not what he was hoping for. Damage and striking power weren't the key characteristics - and even aim in general wasn't that important. Instead the child was moreso focused on the illusion that it had made for the eyes.

On perfecting and seeing how far he had gone with this technique. It was near mastered, if not already, and seeing that finally allowed him to stop for a bit with that jutsu and imprint the feeling of his throw on his mind. It was definitively the best he'd done so far.* - Fri Oct 23 07:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stepped up, inspecting the weapons. One had penetrated into one of the trees - he left that alone. The other only cut into the dirt ahead of him, however. While it had some dirt on it it was still definitely useable. Picking it up he returned back to the pond and rinsed off most of the dirt getting it all clean and ready. 

<Alright. Lets see if he's here..> The shuriken suddenly is pressed up against his palm and dragged along the area cutting the skin. A thin layer of blood began to leak out from his body trying to close the wound. It was hardly deep or even that painful, but it'd serve the purpose for what he wanted - the blood on his hands.

Moving all digits upon that hands he mixes the blood across his fingers, staining his fingers in the liquid. Fully covered he rotated his hands through a set of seals, manipulating the digits as his chakra surged. With each symbol made his energy was moulded and changed into a different way or area allowing the proper usage of the technique.

<Summoning - Dragon's Requiem!> On the final seal his hand slammed down on the deck, a plume of white smoke covering over him as his chakra fully surged. When it dissipated it'd reveal a total of two dragons circling around the young child. One black and one white - each held at most a meter in total length and size.

"What do you command of us?" The white one speaks, hovering infront of Heiwa's face before circling back around his head. As this happens the black one comes into focus back infront of him "What is the reason for us to be here?" Both spoke of the same message for their arrival. Heiwa got straight to business.

"I need you to look over the village," the child responds, staring at each dragon as they passed. "Look for a man by the name of 'Nozumi'" After saying this he gave the full description of how the man looked - the picture perfect memory of Heiwa serving him well in being able to describe him. Even moreso the large vocabularly he held only added further to how useful it was.

For a time the dragons continue circling, seemingly considering the prospect before finally responding. "We will do it." They both state in unison and fly up into the sky parting after doing so. <I wonder if he's here..> The drain began to hit him, and taking a step back the child brings himself to a knee taking in some deep breaths to calm himself. His reserves were far from the greatest, especially considering he was only a child, but they were enough for this to work.

Several hours pass before the dragons return. They only got a street view of the village, but they both agreed in the end. "There is no Nozumi that could be found." The black dragon took the burden of belying the bad news, yet seemed stalwart and serious throughout it - not showing any sign of empathetic grief. 

For a brief moment, Heiwa's demeanor lowered, some sadness poking through before nodding and cancelling the technique allowing the two to return. "Good job." 

He still wasn't back. It'd been well over a month since he had left. <Another..person who tried to protect me and died..>* - Fri Oct 23 08:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) clenched his fist tightly as the wave of emotion passed over him. Nozumi, Ushinawa, Hideki, Lyala, Niza, Marianna. Everyone was gone. He had no one remaining to help him. It hurt. 

And that was why he had met Nozumi in the first place. He desired the change to the world and to instill a new way of living. A way where that wouldn't keep happening to everyone. And he made a promise when he came to that verdict - when he realized what he had wanted to do. 

He had promised to Nozumi that he would wait until he was older and would get as strong as he could until that point. Forcing himself up he fights back against the fatigue and overwhelming emotions, his hands being brought up quickly infront of his chest forming one of the basic twelve seals. Much of what Hideki had taught him had already been mastered - he had to work on this now.

To get stronger he needed to continue training. Quickly his hands rotate through an increasing amount of seals as his chakra surges, each rotation bringing about a different manipulation in shape for the individual bit of the jutsu. This was the one that he was taught directly by his uncle shortly after his father died. 

<Fire Style: Fireball jutsu!> On the final note he brings his right hand up to his mouth, creating a circle with his index and thumb and presses that up against his closed mouth. The child takes a deep breath in, filling his lungs with fresh oxygen and suddenly changes the nature of his chakra into that of a different form - that of primal fire.

With a deep exhale back out he spits the contents of his jutsu directly infront of him, near burning the sides of his hand through the usage of it. Immediately upon contact with the air the thick katon chakra would react turning into a powerful flame ball of energy expanding out only further the more it had seemed to leave from Heiwa's person.

It hardly held the same strength to that of Hideki or from what he heard his father, but it was still remarkably strong for a technique. And it was one of his own heritage - spat out in the remnants of the former Uchiha headquarters. <Master it..as a rite of passage to become a man.> He remembered those words well as the final remnants of the jutsu left his system and he was left standing there with the remains.

<I'm..going to avenge all of them and make this world right. To be the fire that reforges the world.> Nozumi himself stated that it'd take a god to do so, and Heiwa was willing to work for that aim if that was the requirement. * - Fri Oct 23 08:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) brought himself up again, not content with just that performance. He still had plenty left in his system to continue yet still. He needed at least some semblance of progress even if it had continued to leave him drained. 

<Fire Style: Fireball jutsu!> His chakra surges with every handseal that he had made, the nature of katon infusing itself within every motion focusing on the power provided through it. Slowly as he reached the end of his seals this would be diverted back up into the throat of the young child where it rested for his release. 

With his hands making the same symbol to spit through he finally does so - exhaling it all out in a quick movement bringing the thick level of flames across in the area in a wide ball of continuous power. With every second he kept it maintained his chakra felt weaker as he drained more of it, but he kept it up just until he no longer could.

When that point hit and the exhaustion began to set in, he let the stream die out and his hand fall, before taking in a couple of deep breaths to calm himself. It was bigger than the last time he'd performed it. It was progressing. He fell back against the dock with a smile on his face letting the reality slip away from him as he passed out.* - Fri Oct 23 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) woke up several hours later staring up at the moon overhead. No one had noticed he'd been out this long. It wasn't even that big of a thing anymore to realize - just a fact of the life he was living in. He had a home, in a sense. The money from his missions and occasional work kept him fed and sheltered enough. The person leasing the room hardly would take notice of his absence. 

It was a sad realization, but he didn't dwell much further on it. Hunger pains hit him shortly after he woke up, and he turned his attention back to the bento box he'd planned out. All of un-perishable food prepared to remain fresh even after storing it for a while. The child knew he would pass out again.

The meal was eaten in silence, filling his stomach just enough to continue and keep the left overs for the morning. Returning his attention to the pond infront of him he decided to work on another jutsu that he lacked full mastery of. That of the Mist Servant jutsu - the very first genjutsu that he'd been taught.

Using it against Niza, it was stated he showed a lot of promise in his craft. The Raikage was impressed with the child..even with his father dead he remembered feeling happy about that moment. That simply wasn't this moment, however. Niza was dead. His father was dead. Kumogakure was just a shadow of its former self.

The steps are taken for the activation of the jutsu, his chakra surging throughout his body as he remained in the area marking it for use. On release the illusionary clones appear, visibly remaining infront of his eyes even if they weren't focused directly on him. Instead their marks were on the tree that he'd intended for them to go to.

There was far much more to the technique than just the bare bones basics that he'd been using against most of the people he practiced it on - the notes given by Hideki himself detailed how one could properly make it seem real. At every point the clones attack the user mimicks their actions with the use of kunais and other weaponry making the impact of their attacks still feel real.

And that's exactly what he'd intended to work on this time. Keeping his eyes remaining on the illusionary clones made before him, he watches for every movement that they'd make  taking in the motions as they attacked the tree stationed infront of him. Not even a dent would be made as he picked out the pattern of their actions.

They fought similar to Heiwa himself, but held more sluggishness. They weren't fluid as Heiwa could make his attacks. This lead to them being more easily blocked, but at the same time- Pulling quickly he throws out a shuriken, embedding it directly on the strike just as it happens predicting in perfection what the clone would do.

The other one starts up preparing to do the same, and quickly Heiwa rebounds trying his best on the other side. Delayed and sluggish - it would obviously feel fake and unreal at that impact if someone was focusing enough. But Heiwa wouldn't stop in the attack. His eyes dart over again to the next side, bringing out another weapon to keep up with his performance.

To someone who wasn't there when it started they'd only see the chasing of shadows as the child contorted into different positions to launch the weapons more fluidly. It hardly kept the same level of surprise if you'd see where the weapons were coming from, but that wasn't the exact purpose.

He could iron that out by hiding. He could iron that out with some other method after he'd learned to be able to handle at least this much. But eventually it had all ended.

He drew at nothing but air as he tried for another draw, the performance ending the moment he'd realized this. <Not bad..take a breather..> he brought both hands up and dispelled the technique letting his chakra go back to normal and take the drain. 

Afterwards, he went up and gathered what remaining shuriken were still useable for next time.* - Fri Oct 23 09:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) returned with the gathered shurikens, laying them all across infront of him carefully deciding to dip each in the water. Following after he dried them all off with a cloth preventing the water from eroding them over time. He knew the very basics of how to keep weapons from degrading over time, and most of it followed along the principles of keeping said weapons clean.

After he'd done that he'd bring them back into his back pouch prepared to use them later. If he had a technique that could work with it - that'd be when he needed it. With his only source of income being barely enough to keep him afloat, it wasn't like he could splurge on some new weaponry like he might want to.

Of course, the night was still young and he was far from finished. The next technique he would practice was the first one taught to him by his father beyond the basics. The ability allowing him to dissipate a genjutsu used on him through a precise and controlled effort. 

In actuality there were really only two general ways. While outliers did exist - the primary methods involved resetting your chakra network to break the foreign chakra signature from your body. And both were rather difficult to do, especially for a beginner to everything. The method taught to him also required a good degree of skill with genjutsus to use it effectively.

Those two methods were Kai, dissipation, and excrutiating pain. Through the usage of pain one could force their senses to reboot breaking them out of a genjutsu through the constant pain forcing them to see what was real. However, that method only worked if it was a good degree of pain. 

If someone had trained themselves to ignore pain it wouldn't do very much, as their body is further conditioned to continue ignoring it despite a genjutsu being used on them. There were drawbacks of course also in many genjutsus being hard to simply break out through pain if you couldn't move your body due to said genjutsu.

And of course you'd also have to fight while having the pain. But the other method was the one taught directly to Heiwa - dissipation. Through applying a greater surge of chakra one can force the chakra out of their nervous system allowing them to freely see reality for what it truly is. However, to do this also had a few caveats.

Very few people would have the direct chakra to suddenly boost their levels beyond that of what they normally have. If you somehow gained a greater deal suddenly that'd work, but that wasn't really predictable or normal. This left the only other option to be in lowering ones chakra and then suddenly surging it back up with what was left.

Bringing his hands together, Heiwa intends to do just that. Interlocked between a handseal, the young child slowly focuses his chakra down to a far more manageable level. It held a lot more speed than what he'd normally been able to do, his chakra control increasing as he aged more and used more techniques. But also as he gained greater with the jutsu itself.

Once it reached that perfect point, that sweet center that he was beginning to recognize as what it was, he thought out the techniques name aloud "Genjutsu: Kai." His chakra surged back up at a rapid pace, entering his nervous system and rebooting his senses back to normal.

If he was under the effects of a genjutsu they'd likely be broken out of, but in the end he simply wasn't and much of the effects were wasted beyond training. * - Fri Oct 23 09:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) It hadn't drained nearly as bad as most techniques - it didn't utilize very much chakra to perform it. He could manage the drain without it adversely hurting his performance and ability to continue training. It's for this reason that whenever he worked on a Genjutsu the child always preferred to dissipate it with the technique.

But he was out of the avenue of genjutsus for now. Glancing back at the dock, he sees the minor charred remnants of what he'd caused in his previous fireball usage. It was far larger than he'd anticipated. It was some improvement on that fact.

And he was sure on why he'd done better with it. But he wasn't going to continue exactly with that one just yet. His reserves didn't feel quite full enough for the usage of it just yet. But he didn't want to rest either. He'd wait until after he was finished with a mission for him to come back to training that.

Which left him just one technique - a generally inefficient technique for the basis of destruction, but efficient if used in a one-off type of attack. That's what he'd be focusing on: The Exploding Flame Shot. 

Pulling back up to his feet the child holds his hand out to the pond of water infront of him, palm facing down to the water. A fire could be started and shit could be serious if he hit the trees, so he'd focus instead on just dissipating it within the water itself. 

Taking in a deep breath, slowly he begins to surge his chakra out from his system, focusing the energy into the one place he could use it - around his arm and directly around his palm. And then suddenly a spark of the energy had exitted him, converting to katon chakra on release and reacting violently with the surrounding area.

The result was a fast spark of energy which further heated the remaining chakra he poured out into his hand creating a small orb of flames gripped within his hand. It'd continue to grow as he held onto it, seemingly not burning him despite the closeness of where his fingers were at.

Once it was plump and ripe enough, he took a step back winding his arm back. In a quick and fluid movement he throws it downwards releasing the explosive shot into the water below and jumps back. It splashes and explodes outwards - hardly enough to damage much but still easily enough to send water everywhere. * - Fri Oct 23 10:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) came back to that place; the pier overlooking the pond. The work for the day had been finished. He wouldn't be needed for a while. He was able to begin training now. 

Bringing his right hand up he focuses the palm facing down towards the water. Starting any type of fire would be worse for him than not even trying to train. It'd get out of hand fast. This way the attack would simply hit the water and disperse shortly thereafter. 

A surge of his chakra passes over the child as he maps out the technique, the energy focusing in his stomach as the primal power of Katon. When it reached such it'd then suddenly slip up the lengths of his arm coming to rest in the one place he could actually utilize such power in - his palm. Feeling the energy make it there he knew he was almost ready.

Suddenly a single spurt of the katon power exits followed by a consistent steady stream of it all. The first bit creates a bright flash in his hand, a spark of power that heats up the remaining chakra he continued to pour out. It'd start off small, but quickly grew out into the size of a hand ball, the flames being held firmly and securely by the child in his hand.

Yet despite how close he was, he felt no heat or pain as he kept it in his hand. <Exploding Flame Shot!> His right arm winded backwards, and he took a step back, gaining the required momentum. Then he steps forward, throwing his arm down alongside the movement letting the ball of flames leave from his palm headed directly towards the pond below.

Without even a moment for hesitation, Heiwa jumps back well aware of what would happen after it was gone. A large fountain of water cascaded over the area as the flames exploded and dispersed sending it everywhere. * - Fri Oct 23 20:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) brought his hand back up, lightly clenching it. It was all tingly from the use of chakra. <Next is Fireball jutsu..> the child thought to himself, stepping away from the pier to change venue. The trees were close targets, especially with the technique seemingly growing larger the more he practiced it. Heiwa would have to train it somewhere else.

The point he stops at, ready to begin, is that where most of the trees had gone and the child was left facing a mountain. The only thing that could catch on fire was the grass infront of him, and with it growing sparse and inbetween it wasn't very likely to start anything he couldn't stop quickly himself. This would be a good spot.

To start, the child bring his hands together, interlocked just infront of his chest in a simple hand seal. His chakra would grow and surge outwards through the gesture, allowing the shape and nature to be somewhat manipulated through the use of the seals being made.

On the final set made his chakra fully felt ready, and finally Heiwa decided to use the technique. Bringing his right hand up to his face, he makes a circle with both his index finger and his thumb, bringing them together against his mouth. <Fire Style: Fireball jutsu!> The swirling flames in his stomach tried hard for release, and taking a breath in he allowed them to enter his mouth.

Suddenly after he takes a step forward, spitting hard through the hole that he'd made of all the fire in his mouth. It'd spout outwards, expanding the further it had left from the boy creating a large, round circle of flames everywhere infront of him. He'd continue holding up the jutsu for as long as he could, continuosly feeding chakra to the flames.

It was slightly larger than last time, his skill increasing generally with each usage of the technique, and when he'd finally allowed it to end he'd feel similar drains as to when he'd first started using it. It was definitive improvement on most aspects of the jutsu. * - Fri Oct 23 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) rotated through a set of five hand seals, his chakra surging throughout every seal that he'd made. Anyone who had seen the initial seals as they were 
made would slowly begin to fall under the influence of the technique, with it fully appearing to manifest after the final and fifth animal symbol had 
been crafted.

Once that was finished, Heiwa holds both of his hands up in the air, palms open and holding up to the sky. In that sky there'd be the slightest of 
disturbances as directly overhead a very small ball of flames would start to manifest, perhaps hard to see under the sun hanging directly behind it.

However, that only lasted for but a moment of time. <Demonic Illusion: Descending Hell!> His power surged further, and suddenly the ball began to 
increase in size. From a minor ball of fire it quickly pulsed and grew to several times larger than that original size.

Where it previously could be obscured by only the sun, it now had been able to obscure said sphere hanging overhead, the size rapidly expanding even 
further beyond that. It'd continue to swell until it'd be near impossible not to see it through ones periphery.

And it's here where most people would probably break. The immense heat involved in the technique even from so far away could put the sheer feeling of 
dread in ones body. And every step that it increased the heat would increase rhythmically with it.

And there stood Heiwa, hands raised upwards with the ball of flames directly hanging above him. With a single movement of his hand the ball inched 
closer, the flames feeling that much more intense upon the body of those afflicted.

Heiwa didn't just slowly move it though. In one large swoop, the child's hands fall down infront of him. And the ball of flames listens immediately. 
Without even a moment of hesitation, the flames follow the commands of their master heading straight towards the target.

With every inch that it took the heat would be equally painful, it feeling so very real as it neared. In only a few seconds it would have traversed the 
distance between the two and would then crash headlong into the ground they stood upon.

Even then, the flames would not cease. The harsh effects would feel so very real as they kissed the skin, the thought of third, maybe even fourth degree 
burns being a very real factor in intensity for any of those that remained within the influence of the attack.

Of course..none of this was real.

The flames touching and spreading across the area were only illusory, nothing being done to the opponent, but the sensations being so very real during 
the whole ordeal. 

If anyone had truthfully been caught in his display, Heiwa would move over to break them out with the usage of Kai, but likely none had been impacted 
this time.* - Fri Oct 23 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) followed up with that last usage of a genjutsu with what he normally did. Both hands brought up to his chest, he took in a deep breath while his hands remained interlocked in a simple hand seal. 

Slowly his chakra would begin to lower from what it normally had been. His chakra control wasn't the greatest for a shinobi, but it was well enough to be able to use this technique, and even further was conditioned through the multiple uses to be quite efficient at the working for exactly this jutsu. 

Of course, Heiwa also knew around that sweet spot through the constant usage to be able to tell just when he'd lowered it enough for dissipation of a genjutsu. <Genjutsu..Kai!> Suddenly his inner chakra spikes, surging up from what it previously was unblocking any sort of obstruction that might remain within his chakra network.

That was, of course, assuming that it wasn't too powerful to be able to break off in such a way, but his skill with genjutsu itself had helped remarkably in breaking most of these from affecting him. Also, of course, most of these effects would only be noticed if he had actually been subdued in a genjutsu at the point he used the technique.

Either way, however, it was still useful practice for being able to use ths technique. It was almost to the point where he could possibly have it work without a hand seal to focus himself with. It had hardly even drained for that matter either. * - Fri Oct 23 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) had one final jutsu to practice before he went back looking for a mission that may be available. It was one that he'd been working on ever since he heard of needing to interrogate a prisoner for why they chose to attack. It's also one that he'd heard before in his studies and had been curious of for some time.

It was that of the interrogation genjutsu - a powerful one guaranteed to make most weak willed individuals talk. Even moreso if given a lengthy period of time under it to succumb further to the effects. He got the basics down, but without that many willing participants progress was becoming much harder. All together though, it wasn't that advanced of a technique.

It required for a captive to be bound physically for its use - this hindered much of the ability for the technique to work especially in direct combat, but in points where it was capable to keep them from moving it surely shined. And following thereafter, the user of the technique walks up to them and places their hand on their head.

Heiwa himself mimicked the actions for what he'd read he needed to do, placing his own hand on the log and slowly infusing a certain amount of chakra into his palm transferring it into the wooden piece of lumber. It'd have, obviously, no effect on it due to its lack of animation, but he still felt the effects himself as the drain began to hit.

It was something he was far from used to, and one he still needed to continue working on much more. But even with his inefficiency, the effects would still be majorly pronounced on a target if he would actually have one. A buzzing in their ear, suggestions being hit from all sides, and slowly their will being broken as they remained captive.

It was a brutal and ultimately quite traumatizing technique if it was allowed to continue, but it didn't involve torture. And it'd keep it with strict, full, truthful information presuming the target wasn't extremely strong willed or able to break out of the genjutsu through any of the other methods. 

Shortly after he'd started, however, Heiwa ended it, breaking the concentration and allowing any genjutsu that would have been used if it was a real person to begin dissipating. * - Fri Oct 23 23:01:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) simply responded with a nod before stepping forwards slowly making his exit back out of the manor.* - Sat Oct 24 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took one last glance at the village hidden in the leaf, before returning his sights back on the exits to the no longer standing gates. Heiwa wasn't going to be gone for long, but part of him wanted to see Kiri again. To see how it had been standing after he left. And to see if he could find Hideki or a sign of him there. Ambrocio himself was missing at this point.

As he entered the trail the young child kept to the familiar path that he remembered the caravan taking those few months back. Hardly one to forget such a journey, it was remarkably easy for him to continue. And there didn't seem to be any hostiles or others on the road. It wasn't even long enough of a walk to make food a requirement. So long as he had money he'd be fine in Kiri once her got there.

Just in case though, he did make sure to hide his red headband as he wasn't sure how they'd react against him.* - Sat Oct 24 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stumbled onto the most peculiar sight. Clothing dropped at the wildest places, and finally what appeared to be a scroll at the last bit. Heiwa simply glanced around, not noting any particular traps around in the area, before picking up and taking the scroll before continuing on to Kirigakure.* - Sat Oct 24 02:58:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) found his way to the manor of the newly reconstructed manor, the young child glancing around at everything that had been fixed up since his departure. It really was quite an improvement. Of course, he likely wouldn't have been there at the time that the Mizukage had used said genjutsu, and even if he was there was a good chance that he simply wouldn't be affected by it.* - Sat Oct 24 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: You wave your balde back and forth. - Sat Oct 24 03:14:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: I see... - Sat Oct 24 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) 's optics flickered immediately to the Mizukage the moment he saw a hint of her dash, watching curiously what she was doing. By the time he'd picked up on it the action was already finished - fluid and concise in it all.

<Like Hana..> 
In due time as he was addressed Heiwa would nod his head, stepping off to the side a little bit just in case collateral would come out from Daisuke. "I went with Hideki as he left to Konoha," the child states, well aware that she probably knew this at this point. "Have you seen him in the last month?"* - Sat Oct 24 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Hmm. - Sat Oct 24 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: He is burried somewhere here. - Sat Oct 24 03:18:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) looked down. The indifference in his facial expression had shifted, shock covering his face. <Hideki..too?> That was one of his last family members that he knew of. One of the last people that he was close to. 

"Do you..know if he was with anyone?" he asks, looking back up to her. There'd be held back tears in his eyes that he refused to let be shed. "Do you know who could have done this to him?" * - Sat Oct 24 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...R-Right.  - Sat Oct 24 03:25:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stepped up closer to the woman. Hideki had told Heiwa to trust her. He almost was sent to go live with her in fact. * - Sat Oct 24 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) wiped a hand across his eyes, breaking the tears that were there before continuing even further. His eyes focused on the woman trying to see what she was going to do. For the moment, however, he continued to trust her up to this point. 

Hideki told him to.* - Sat Oct 24 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) blinked, suddenly feeling her arms wrap around his body and pull him in. His features would shift somewhat, even moreso as he heard the same phrases spoken to him by Mamarou, and then even by Nozumi. He remembered their words well. They were the only reason it'd been delayed as far as it was. 

"I don't..want anymore people to die like that though," the tone he held no longer had kept with the indifference he often showed and had had earlier. "Father wouldn't want me to let it just happen."* - Sat Oct 24 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: YOUR FATHER IS DEAD! HE SUFFERED A HORRIBLE HORRIBLE DEATH! OH LORD WHY DID YOU TAKE HIM AND LEFT THIS POOR CHILD ON HIS OWN!? -omit- - Sat Oct 24 04:11:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: But not any time soon. - Sat Oct 24 04:23:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: You still have to experience being a kid. - Sat Oct 24 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: ..Nozumi said the same.  - Sat Oct 24 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Right. Okay. - Sat Oct 24 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) begrudglingly said those last words. It still hurt to not get some sort of change. After so many loved ones died. But he did trust in what Nozumi had said, and much of Kirie's words also rang true. 

"I joined Konoha..as a shinobi when Hideki left," Heiwa said after some time, making a motion to his pocket where the red forehead protector had been. * - Sat Oct 24 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: So you became a shinobi after all huh. - Sat Oct 24 04:30:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) looked up, an indifferent stare glaring at the man. Every nigga done ruffled his hair when they met him. 

"Are you guys chunnins?" he asked, genuinely expecting they would be. To this day he had no idea Hideki was a damn Genin when he died.* - Sat Oct 24 04:47:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) turned his head, glancing back at the girl calling his name. It was familiar, but on seeing Nina it all came back. 

"Hey," Heiwa responds back with, eyeing her. "Do you need something?" * - Sat Oct 24 05:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) || As her weight hit him the child stepped a foot back planting it against the ground to remain steady. He didn't share the hug with her, awkwardly just letting her hang. Something about her overall happiness had gotten to him. He didn't like it. 

"They're dead.." his words were steady and cold, not of grieving, but of explaining the true fact.* - Sat Oct 24 05:11:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) narrowed his eyes as she let go and offered what she had. It wasn't like it was the first time he'd heard of such a thing. And the last few times it was offered those people came up dead or missing. Beyond that, the faintest hints of pity were felt by him.

"No." His response didn't even raise in tone for a moment, before his eyes glanced off seeing that Arata had left.* - Sat Oct 24 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) thinks: In all seriousness... The child has seen a lot. - Sat Oct 24 05:19:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) pulled his shoulder back, letting her arm fall away from him. Nina would see the growing anger mounting in his eyes, especially upon hearing that. Whereas she might have taken him as a close friend, Heiwa didn't see it that way. If anything he was jealous of how much she had. How much she didn't have to deal with. 

"You're not my family," he says clearly, and loud enough that most in the area probably could hear it, but his next statement was kept low just after it. "They're all dead.." At the very least it probably wasn't a good time to try and have him change families on the rebound after finding out Hideki just died.* - Sat Oct 24 05:27:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) glanced back over to Arata, feeling his hand along his shoulder. Heiwa didn't want a family. Everyone he had previously called one had all died. Many of which were in protecting him. 

"Hideki is dead too," the child looks back at her as he says this, not being phased from her act of crying. It wasn't overly shown, but he was growing angry at her with every bit she continued with.* - Sat Oct 24 05:38:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) got placed on the bench. He didn't move much, not even fully looking at the man, his head pointed away as he peered his eyes over to the side.

"..She's not my family." It'd be the first thing he said as if making that all clear for him. * - Sat Oct 24 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: That's fine. - Sat Oct 24 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: I have no family. - Sat Oct 24 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: Only a single friend. - Sat Oct 24 05:49:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: A lot of people are looking for him. - Sat Oct 24 05:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He was my uncle. I don't know why everyone else was looking for him. - Sat Oct 24 05:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: I see. - Sat Oct 24 05:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded, and pulled himself off of the bench.

"Daisuke is 'black' right?" * - Sat Oct 24 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: No, he's white. - Sat Oct 24 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: But we call him black as a code name. - Sat Oct 24 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: Like my code name is white. - Sat Oct 24 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright. I'll find him. - Sat Oct 24 06:02:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) didn't say anything more. Taking the advice he was given, Heiwa left the area in search of Black.* - Sat Oct 24 06:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stepped past Mashu, entering the courtyard taking a position near the side of Daisuke. 

"White said he was going to sleep and to find you."* - Sat Oct 24 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Hold onto that. - Sat Oct 24 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: I'll tell you a story. - Sat Oct 24 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) brought a hand up snatching the coin from the air. The child would glance down, taking a quick look at what it was. <Just a coin.> It was weird to be given, but he didn't do anything but what Daisuke had told him to do for now.

No longer did he show the answer or even the sorrow from before. Indifference covered over him marking him with similarities of how his father was before him. 

"What's the story about?" the child asks, glancing back at the older man.* - Sat Oct 24 06:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Did you think...  - Sat Oct 24 06:44:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Nope. - Sat Oct 24 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took another glance detailing the coin. 

"Why are you telling me this?"* - Sat Oct 24 06:47:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Everyone is going to keep dying if I get close to them. - Sat Oct 24 06:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'm not having another person protect me with their life.  - Sat Oct 24 06:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Then will you hide from them? - Sat Oct 24 06:55:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Then should we just throw you in a ditch? - Sat Oct 24 06:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Perhaps. - Sat Oct 24 06:56:51 2015
