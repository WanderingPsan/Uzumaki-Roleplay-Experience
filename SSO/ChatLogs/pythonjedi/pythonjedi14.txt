<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) leaned himself against the wall of the local hardware store, eye remaining on the road. The sun had just earlier made its way above the horizon, when 
the faint outline of a small, old lady made its shape against the backdrop. Just a few minutes after the doors opened and she was here, near directly on 
time. It brought a smirk across the young Heiwa's face seeing her again. This would be the fourth time in only a few months that he'd been helping her 
with shopping, and he was already getting well adjusted to her. Indeed, she even requested him by name to be the one to help her.

Flashing a smile as they met, her arm would reach out into an awaiting hook. "You didn't have to get here before me, dear." With his parents gone, it 
had been nice to have just some of this woman's attention for the short bit of time it was. Heiwa liked her. "It wasn't a problem," he replies back, 
bringing his own arm out into a hook and interlocking it against her arm. With a move of his free hand he'd motion over to the door. "Shall we?" She 
nodded, and together they both stepped closer, Heiwa opened the door, and she stepped through it first with Heiwa trailing second.

Compared to the previous shops they had visited, this one was relatively larger than each, and much of the work would actually require Heiwa's aid in 
the efforts. Carrying many of the supplies simply was too much for the little old lady, and so it was reflected back onto Heiwa. Of course, his size had 
hindered his ability to comfortably carry much of this, however, Heiwa's training had managed much for his relative carrying ability. From weeks before, 
Heiwa was now able to carry quite a bit of weight on his hands, and would follow behind the lady without making much of a bother of himself over all of 
this.

Sensing Heiwa's discomfort, the woman didn't speak much, allowing him to focus instead on holding the items instead of having to pay attention to her. 
The work he was doing was enough for her. In due time the work would be finished though, much of the materials being in the area that they started in, 
and it'd all get purchased rather quickly before being subjected back onto Heiwa's back. 

Due to this change, though, Heiwa hadn't simply left after the shopping had finished. With her inability to fully carry all of the stuff, Heiwa was made 
to carry his own, larger, share of the hardware items all the way back to her place. A couple miles away from the hardware store, it ended up leaving 
the child winded from the effort, but even still he kept himself going until they had finally made it the entire way back to her home. Gently, but 
quickly, Heiwa dropped all of the supplies and took a step back, recovering his breath. "Thank you dearie," the lady responded to him, and gave him a 
soft hug.

She went back inside afterwards, carrying most of the purchased items with her. Nodding, he'd think to himself <First mission done,> before turning back 
to the horizon, a smirk on his face from the job well done. Her house wasn't terribly far from the post office, so he made that his second stop along 
the way. Over the last month he'd been doing missions daily, and so he was quickly recognized amongst the employees there. With a flash of the paper he 
showed what he was here to pick up, and they handed the item off without any form of complication. Heiwa thanked the people, and left outside.

By the time he had made it out there, his hand was already pulling out the sharpened edge of a kunai, twirling it about in his hand for a moment before 
finally bringing it against the palm of his right hand. A small leak of blood began to pour out from him, spreading across his digits with an increasing 
motion of his fingers digging and spreading into the liquid. In a short amount of time his hand was stained in his fluids, and the child would bring his 
hands together interlocked infront of his chest. 

A series of hand seals were made, his chakra spreading out from his body with every motion made. <Summoning Technique: Dragon's Requiem.> The name of 
the technique passes by his mind as he finishes, and finally slams his hand against the pavement with a surge of chakra. A plume of smoke escapes him, 
and a small, black dragon begins circling around his body, its tail lightly gracing across his body as it rotated all the way up to the child's face. 
"Why have you called of me, summoner?" it asks as it passes by his face, circling across the area of his head. 

"Another letter delivery," he explains, briefly raising his hand up to show him. It would listen as he stated this, agreeing with his proposal quickly. 
"Very well, summoner." Often Heiwa asked for the help of this dragon, who he still hadn't even asked the name of, when he was doing his missions. While 
not the most glorious of missions, never once did he hear any form of anger or complication over the work. The dragon slowed down in its rotation, 
giving Heiwa enough room to strap the letter around him tightly so he could still manage to fly about. Of course, it also was kept in such  way for him 
to wiggle out once he'd made it to the mission site. Without a single word past that, the dragon glides up into the sky to its destination.

<And that makes two.> Most of his missions were completed, but there was still another one left for him. Detailed as a C rank mission, it was ultimately 
a bit of nice reminder of the work that he'd done. To be given one like this meant some level of being recognized by the kage. It put a smirk on his 
face. Without a second thought he turned to his next destination, and began making the final trek of his journey to complete the missions he'd been 
given.

Heiwa stops infront of the Kirigakure academy, the backdrop of the sun hanging overhead. Normally it'd be time for school, but today was a day off for 
most at the academy. Including the teachers. Except for one person that is. The student he was made to go and help - Gekkido. The child made his way 
past the steps, entering the academy doors and glancing around. It was a big place, so it'd take a while to find the area, but at least he knew where 
it'd be. 

<The Taijutsu gymnasium,> Heiwa read it silently to himself as he found the spot, and opened it up to peer through. He'd find a rather portly young kid, 
maybe ten or eleven, sitting against the wall writing something on a piece of paper. Initially he'd pay Heiwa no mind, until he saw the child continuing 
to stare at him. It was at this point that it clicked in for the kid. "They sent a runt like you to teach me taijutsu?" The older kid asked 
incredulously, more insulted at the gesture than anything.

There'd be a nod given from Heiwa as he stepped closer to the far larger child than him. Teaching wasn't his strongest point, especially not in 
something like Taijutsu, but he was going to do his best. However, that didn't seem to be the most immediate thing that Gekkido had wanted for Heiwa to 
do. Giving a quick shake of his head, he brings himself up showing just how much farther he stood over Heiwa. At five feet tall he dwarfed the young 
child in comparison.

"Nah. I'm done here," he says, picking up the rest of his materials. "This is stupid." He wasn't going with the program. Heiwa's brow narrowed as he saw 
this, well aware that if he just left the child leave immediately that he wouldn't get any credit for the mission. Stepping into the brute of a kid's 
way he firmly shakes his head. "You can't go. You need to improve your taijutsu." With a roll of his eyes the kid stepped even closer, staring down at 
the child. "And just who is going to stop me? I bet you can't even beat me."

Heiwa took a step back, creating space from Gekkido which immediately he abused by stepping even closer and pushing Heiwa away. "Come on then! How about 
a fight, right now?" The larger child flashed a toothy smile, his intent beginning to shine through. If he beat a genin at Taijutsu it'd be clear that 
he was, indeed, unneeding of training. Heiwa gave him an easy out. Again the child took a step back, and finally Gekkido took that as proof it wouldn't 
happen. "I knew you were a coward," he says, and steps past Heiwa to exit the gymnasium.

Before he had made it out though, Heiwa finally responded back his voice echoing in the silence of the interior "I'll fight you," he says, nodding his 
head. "A spar in taijutsu - I'll do it." The smile returned to the older kid's face. "Good. We'll start in the middle," He made a motion to the center 
of the room where two circles were made - a couple meters apart giving room for charging or setting up a defense without starting directly next to 
somebody. These two circles were within one larger circle, which the child explained was an automatic disqualification if you had exitted from it.

All of the Taijutsu spars that Heiwa had done in the past hadn't worked out for him. To say the least his confidence was shaken in his ability to 
immediately work on that, and to make matters worse the child, even if he was just an academy student, did easily lumber above him. It'd be likely it if 
he got hit. All of this was quickly pieced together in his mind, with the full and final conclusion being clear and obvious to him - he couldn't allow 
himself to get hit.

An obvious thing to a fight it meant more to Heiwa than most others. Getting hit was a bad thing for most, but it was all over if Heiwa managed to be 
knocked down. This was something he knew very well, and part of it really was beginning to remain in his brain for how to bring it all together. With 
their hands raised, they made the seal of confrontation between eachother, and the fight started just like that. Gekkido takes the initiative and 
charges towards Heiwa in a poor and obvious stance.

His feet would be held without form or style, heavy flat footed steps being taken as he inched closer to the child. In addition his hands remained 
raised and outwards half way. His attempt at combat fit his body type rather well - a wide portly figure he was focusing on heavy handed attacks while 
using his initial broader reach of range against his opponent. However, again, his skill was simply just very poor. When he'd made it to Heiwa his right 
arm raises and is thrown out in a very wide, broad hook.

In contrast to the far larger child, Heiwa was small and short. His arms didn't carry much muscle at all, and his legs even seemed as if they were weak 
and undeveloped - untoned. It was obvious why he was taken as not being a threat. But Heiwa had training from his father and measurably a good bit of 
other people, and with that added with his very quick learning abilities, the short child had considerably more under his belt than the larger boy.

Bringing his hands up he holds them tight infront of his chest, his legs spreading out slightly to give him some more room. But also to allow something 
he had been working on for some time. Following against the example of how he normally had fought, how the other child had fought, and how most of the 
people he watched had fought, he kept himself raised up on his toes, gaining slightly more height than he normally had had, but also gaining something 
else from the maneuver. 

Remaining on his toes his feet had less surface tension, and required far less for him to quickly slide out from the area. Over the last month he'd been 
piecing together the ideas of this, and it was finally his first show and attempt. It was hardly perfected - but he had to do it if he was even going to 
try and win against this kid. He simply could not allow himself to be hit.

The wide angled attack comes in - the speed low but the range as high as it could be. His arms were large and his hooks were powerful. Most of the other 
kids likely could block them with their forearm, even Heiwa having the quick thought to do so, but they simply were far stronger than the kid. He 
couldn't let himself get hit in any way even in a block. <I have to move!> 

Taking a quick step inwards and to the side, the child moves to sidestep the attack with surprising agility and reflexes, quickly moving out of the way 
in a far more deft of a way than the child thought was possible, and then suddenly snapping his fist out the the kid before his fist had even made it to 
where Heiwa had previously been. It'd hit somewhat hard against his chest, unable to reach somewhere soft like his face, before Heiwa continued to move 
on with his assault.

By the time the kid had finished and failed with his first attack, Heiwa had already tip-toed behind the larger kid and sent off a flurry of weak, but 
precise blows against various parts of his stomach and side. Turning quickly, Gekkido brought his arm arcing out in a wide whirlwind type of attack, 
bringing his forearm against anything in the area with the momentum of his spin driving him forward and harder. 

But it didn't catch Heiwa up. The kid's reach was long, but his arms were still higher than it would be if someone Heiwa's height did such an attack. 
With relative ease, Heiwa bends downwards and reaches for the kid's strong legs, forcibly pushing at them with both arms at different levels. One behind 
the leg near the heel, and the other above the knee around the calf. With his position already compromised by the wide angle of his attack, this would 
leave him quickly ending up falling backwards to the ground.

<It's over.> The kid lands hard, not having even realized what had happened befoe he hit, and following the impact some tears would come to his eyes as 
he rubbed the spot. Not wanting to seem weak, he wiped away the tears and pulled himself up with Heiwa's help, some newfound respect being gained for 
the child from that action. There wouldn't be much conversation from the two after that point, both of them making the seal of reconcilation without a 
word, before Heiwa began to go into his teaching methods.

It'd go on for a long time with various drills of endurance and tightening of punches being shown, the child not making immediate improvement in the 
afternoon on anything but his character. A kid far smaller and younger than him beat him rather easily in a spar. It was a wake up call for him needing 
work. They'd leave, still, without much of a word being said and Heiwa would finally mark this off as a completion of all of his missions. * - Sun Nov  1 15:23:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Mind if I come with you? - Tue Nov  3 07:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Come with me for what. - Tue Nov  3 07:01:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: So, I asked if I could come. - Tue Nov  3 07:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Why do you want to come? - Tue Nov  3 07:02:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: None of us were here. - Tue Nov  3 07:03:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Like, really small right now. - Tue Nov  3 07:03:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Does the village yet have a police force? - Tue Nov  3 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: This area should be blocked off for a few days. To see if clues can be gathered. - Tue Nov  3 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No. She wasn't able to decide rankings or the like before the death. - Tue Nov  3 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Whatever, I guess you can come with. - Tue Nov  3 07:05:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: But if you cross me, I'll have people to hurt you. - Tue Nov  3 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: A village without structure. Pity.. - Tue Nov  3 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Tue Nov  3 07:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Alright then, - Tue Nov  3 07:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Anyone you want to say bye to? - Tue Nov  3 07:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Not really. - Tue Nov  3 07:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Okay. - Tue Nov  3 07:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: There's not much salvageable with that being the case. - Tue Nov  3 07:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Oh, Ortho. - Tue Nov  3 07:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Hrm? Salvage. . . Perhaps not. But you can maybe find out what triggered the combustion. - Tue Nov  3 07:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: And maybe from that. .  - Tue Nov  3 07:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Try to theorize a killer? - Tue Nov  3 07:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: To be able to do this while the village is on high alert means it was a very proficient shinobi. - Tue Nov  3 07:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Or someone that Kirie trusted. - Tue Nov  3 07:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Well then. . . You are a young shinobi of the village, yes? - Tue Nov  3 07:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A very prof - I am. - Tue Nov  3 07:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: I'll leave it to you. Compile a list of those who were seen to be close to your late leader. - Tue Nov  3 07:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: -- Hell, anyone that has any connection whatsoever. - Tue Nov  3 07:08:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: She kept herself away from most others. - Tue Nov  3 07:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..An explosion. - Tue Nov  3 07:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: . . .It isn't hard. Also, have the men that guard the exits screen anyone that seeks to leave. The murderer could very well be taking an escape. - Tue Nov  3 07:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Screen them for what? - Tue Nov  3 07:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Who's the idiot that left their stove on? - Tue Nov  3 07:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: This isn't a joke Heiwa. - Tue Nov  3 07:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Anything suspicious -- And rather, don't even let them leave. - Tue Nov  3 07:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: . . . - Tue Nov  3 07:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Explosive tags wouldn't leave an immediately dis - who said it was a joke? - Tue Nov  3 07:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: A simple stove being left on doesn't destroy an entier mansion. - Tue Nov  3 07:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: entire* - Tue Nov  3 07:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Ehh? True. - Tue Nov  3 07:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It can. Kirie wouldn't die that way. - Tue Nov  3 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Anyway- - Tue Nov  3 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: This person seems to be trying and take charge. . .suspicious. Must mean he had something to gain if the place blew. - Tue Nov  3 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Kirie died? - Tue Nov  3 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...Yes. - Tue Nov  3 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) whispers: I'd say. . . This man seems to be a suspect. - Tue Nov  3 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) whispers: All of this. . .Is to convenient, don't you think? - Tue Nov  3 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..... - Tue Nov  3 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright. - Tue Nov  3 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Who's the next scrub to step up? - Tue Nov  3 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..... - Tue Nov  3 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Ortho. Stop. - Tue Nov  3 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Now. - Tue Nov  3 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: No one. - Tue Nov  3 07:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: The village has yet to recover from the tragedy. . . - Tue Nov  3 07:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: I can assume that the intelligent, higher-ranked shinobi will for ma brief council. - Tue Nov  3 07:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: To decide on decisions.. - Tue Nov  3 07:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Is it really expected for us to? It's been only a little bit.. - Tue Nov  3 07:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) whispers: And now. . he seeks to leave? - Tue Nov  3 07:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Those two. Scum. Both of them. - Tue Nov  3 07:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) whispers: Is this not raising any brows, young shinobi? - Tue Nov  3 07:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: He's not the only one. Elon and Violet have both left. Alongside Thaenan.  - Tue Nov  3 07:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: Off of merit of that alone we can't judge Nina or Ortho. - Tue Nov  3 07:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) whispers: The -village-? - Tue Nov  3 07:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Now now. . . - Tue Nov  3 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: I assume. . . An intelligent man such as yourself. - Tue Nov  3 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Woudl realize the suspicion that is immediately garnered, no? - Tue Nov  3 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: He doesn't care. - Tue Nov  3 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) would take that money, and shortly thereafter nod his head. Heiwa didn't have beef against Ortho - he was more upset at Nina and Thaenan than he would be at him. "Thank you,"  were the simply words he said. He also didn't have suspicion it was that nigga who did it.

That being said, Heiwa cared about his own life and he began to search through bits of the cash subtlely just making sure whether or not this nigga hid an explosive tag in the mix. Or..multiple at that.* - Tue Nov  3 07:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took a step back, watching to himself as the first bit of fire began to be released by him. It was so genuinely unexpected he really didn't have much that he could do - and by the time it was finished he'd easily get off the gust of wind without Heiwa moving much of a muscle to stop him. It was at that point that much of the military power would begin to get damaged. 

<What is he doing..?> Faintly he'd see the outline of people being in there, and loudly he'd yell out "Stop! What're you doing!?" It was one of the rarer times in which more of Heiwa's emotions had gotten out from the normally indifferent expression he caught up.  This one held shock and some anger within it. * - Tue Nov  3 07:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: What are you doing?! - Tue Nov  3 07:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) eyes widened and the child gritted his teeth, the visage of a giant snake appearing suddenly underneath Ortho as they both continued the rampage. Just like Kumogakure more and more people were dying without a purpose or a cause. And just like there there was nothing he could do to stop it. Hatred and anger filled his eyes. Not just at the two who were going to go with him - or at Ortho who he'd previously thought incapable of doing this.

But also at himself for this weakness. Quickly his eyes shifted as he took stock of the situation, and yelled out an instruction to Marco. "We have to leave! Tell everybody to evacuate!" The child yells out, and suddenly begins running over to Marco nudging him so his message was heard. * - Tue Nov  3 08:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stopped in his nudging the moment he saw where Ortho was going. <Leaving the village..?> It hadn't made sense for him to go towards the village gates right now if he wasn't planning to exit. <But if he was just planning an exit..then why did he have to kill all of those people..> The thoughts of it all got him more than confused at the situation - but the fact alone that it wasn't heading towards most of the civilians was enough to make him not leave to help evacuate just yet.* - Tue Nov  3 08:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) genjutsu mind fucks this nigga. He never said where he was looking at. * - Tue Nov  3 08:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stared at the two as they left, watching their exit until they finally faded from sight. A large part of him disliked how Violet and Nina had taken the situation. Self centered: they were terrible shinobis in his eyes and in the same way also terrible people. Breaking down into crying because of this - but not because of all of the people around them that had died. But instead from the minor conflicts. 

He didn't want a part of it. "I'll go tell anyone with medical experience we might have wounded," the child states, the indifference returning to his face as time went on. If not stopped or addressed in another way he'd move to walk off to do just that. * - Tue Nov  3 09:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Evening. - Tue Nov  3 09:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..I thought I'd find you up. - Tue Nov  3 09:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You hear about what happened? - Tue Nov  3 09:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: How could I sleep with the chaos going on? I thought of checking it out, until I saw the giant snake from a far. Then learned it was not wise to go. - Tue Nov  3 09:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Right. A lot of people didn't heed that. - Tue Nov  3 09:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Too many didn't.. - Tue Nov  3 09:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stepped up closer, taking a position beside her on the dock. 

"Kirie is dead."* - Tue Nov  3 09:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: There were no ranks before her death. - Tue Nov  3 09:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The village is going to run into a power vacuum. - Tue Nov  3 09:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Fall of the village? - Tue Nov  3 09:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Likely. Unless someone can convince the majority to accept them as the new Mizukage. - Tue Nov  3 09:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..I hate this. All of this. - Tue Nov  3 09:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Seems like it's only going to get worse. - Tue Nov  3 09:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Arata died a little bit before this all. - Tue Nov  3 09:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Kirie was taking care of me..until now.  - Tue Nov  3 09:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: My uncle is going to be here for me soon. - Tue Nov  3 09:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: With there being no Mizukage I don't want part in the chaos in the village. - Tue Nov  3 09:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ... - Tue Nov  3 09:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Did you want to come? - Tue Nov  3 09:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm, I did make a deal with you. - Tue Nov  3 09:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What about your parents? - Tue Nov  3 09:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: They'll be to busy arguing to know I'm gone.  - Tue Nov  3 10:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright. If he comes I'll bring it up to him - come on. - Tue Nov  3 10:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I told him we'd be at the remnants of the southern gate. - Tue Nov  3 10:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Lets go. - Tue Nov  3 10:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Good bye Kirigakure... - Tue Nov  3 10:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Having doubts? - Tue Nov  3 10:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: If I return I return a hero. - Tue Nov  3 10:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I don't think he's coming right now. It'll be harder for him to enter later. - Tue Nov  3 10:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: What village is he from? - Tue Nov  3 10:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I believe Sunagakure. - Tue Nov  3 10:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: We should leave the village and meet him half way then. - Tue Nov  3 10:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Meet him halfway? - Tue Nov  3 10:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: You said it'll be harder for him to enter later, so the simple solution is for him to not have to enter. - Tue Nov  3 10:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You mean to stay on the outskirts of the village waiting for him?  - Tue Nov  3 10:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If he doesn't come that could be bad. And we'd still have to survive a few nights out there. - Tue Nov  3 10:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: At the same time we can't enter that village on our own. I've heard rumors that Sunagakure is attacking those not of authorized passage. - Tue Nov  3 11:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: It's a chance we'll have to take. - Tue Nov  3 11:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Fine. Lets go. - Tue Nov  3 11:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: You want to do it? - Tue Nov  3 11:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. I'll send another message to my Uncle telling him we moved.  - Tue Nov  3 11:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Right. - Tue Nov  3 11:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Well this is it. - Tue Nov  3 11:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: For the next few days.. - Tue Nov  3 11:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took a step back, eyes glancing around at the area they were stopping in. It was a good enough place, and it was also relatively far away from where all of the conflict would be in the village. 

"I can make a fire," he says, mentally creating an image of it all, before turning his eyes back to Yumiko. "Can you get the wood?"* - Tue Nov  3 11:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Yep... its not utterly destroyed - Tue Nov  3 15:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: What happened? - Tue Nov  3 15:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: You awake? - Tue Nov  3 16:52:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mmm yeah. - Tue Nov  3 17:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded. In all of his time as being a shinobi of Kiri he never got a headband, so he had to do little but simply bring out his own Konohagakure headband and sling it around his head.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Alright then. - Tue Nov  3 21:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) followed the movement of the weapons, his body tensing up the moment he saw the glint of their movement. His sight was well trained, and the child was well capable of seeing them as they lit up before him. And yet Takeda did something that was unexpected. Instead of the weapons being thrown at him they were thrown into the air. 

The child followed them briefly, before returning his attention back onto Takeda to make sure that it wasn't some type of feint for another  attack. <What is he doing..> Before Heiwa had made a move, however, Takeda's plan fell into place and the kunais fell before him, the use of the technique suddenly sending them spinning towards Heiwa as if he'd thrown them all along. <What the..>

His thought trails off as the kunais inch closer as the thought of having to move plays out over in his mind. Reacting on impulse, he takes several quick steps out to the side moving to directly avoid the incoming kunai and break the distance between the two. Heiwa had relatively strong speed especially considering his age, and the distance would be broken quickly with the child standing near to Takeda with his hands held up to his chest.

There wouldn't be an attack thrown, but showing his relative grace Heiwa would take a quick side step around Takeda hoping to potentially cause him to lose track of the child.* - Tue Nov  3 21:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) didn't let up from Takeda. Graceful and fluid on his feet, Heiwa stepped in quickly following after him as he left. The young child's speed would be far higher, and with a quick step in he could make it up to him and send out a relatively weak but all too distracting jab. The fact that he was six would make it just that much more not really powerful. Of course, immediately after he sent said attack he'd follow up in stepping off to the side, fighting on his toes to avoid his opponent and leave them hardly able to deal with what he could dish out.

Of course, if he were to still manage in getting off the attack, Heiwa would be sent remarkably far. The technique, added with his low body weight, and then the fact that he had less surface tension for said low body weight, would all combine together to send Heiwa far off of his feet and likely far enough to impact rather hard against the fence if not hitting and skidding along the ground. * - Tue Nov  3 22:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) felt the sudden blast of wind hit him as he moved mid-sidestep. It wasn't a clean blast, but it was still well enough to send him off of his feet while at the same time sending his body twisting off from the imbalance of the blast. While it didn't send him all the way back to the fence, it had sent him several metres away by the time he landed back down, skidding a bit from the impact. 

It left his body a bit rug burned, but nothing was broken or too much injured. If not stopped he'd pull himself back up to his feet in short time after he'd been knocked off from it, his eyes focusing on Takeda. "You craft those jutsus quick," the child remarks, a smirk on his face. It wasn't often that Heiwa showed much emotion like this. He was enjoying it.* - Tue Nov  3 22:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) narrowed his eyes, following the movement of his hands. The stance that he held alongside the gathering of chakra. The child knew it well. <Exploding Flame Shot..> As a practicioner of the technique he quickly would come to figure out just what Takeda might be able to do with it. Of course, Heiwa's own usage paled in comparison, but still. Once more evasive action was required. 

The moment the embers were sent off towards him Heiwa would take into moving, stepping quickly out to the side and away from the blast. This diversion would prevent the child from outright getting in closer to Takeda, nearly keeping him at bay from the potential fear of actually having one of those attacks land and hit him.

Of course while he was running he finally was able to take notice of Rias, and planting both feet against the ground after dodging he'd twist his feet to skid to a stop. "I think you have someone for you," the child says, making a motion to the buxom woman.* - Tue Nov  3 22:44:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Yeah....we shouldn't go outside to much. - Wed Nov  4 14:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Like playing hide and go seek. - Wed Nov  4 14:08:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And it was more than just one person. - Wed Nov  4 14:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Bandits and rogues were attacking as well. They made up for the leadership being gone. - Wed Nov  4 14:09:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: That would be bad. - Wed Nov  4 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Sunagakure would attack us for trying to enter. - Wed Nov  4 14:17:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Here and Suna are the only places standing. - Wed Nov  4 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Not good odds. - Wed Nov  4 14:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: We could learn how to survive in the forest. - Wed Nov  4 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Do you think we should? - Wed Nov  4 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..No. We can't. - Wed Nov  4 14:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hmm? - Wed Nov  4 14:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: You can't beat them by yourself. - Wed Nov  4 14:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Hiding away will do nothing. - Wed Nov  4 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We have to - - Wed Nov  4 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Mm. We can't.  - Wed Nov  4 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Not so much hiding just biding time in order to think of a new move. - Wed Nov  4 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And how long would we bide our time? - Wed Nov  4 14:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Rushing leads to making mistakes, carefully thinking is the best way to go. - Wed Nov  4 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..I know. I'm not saying to rush. - Wed Nov  4 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We can't do that. But biding our time may be an equally costly maneuver. - Wed Nov  4 14:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: How so? - Wed Nov  4 15:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Can I show you the place? - Wed Nov  4 15:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Yes. - Wed Nov  4 15:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded and turned on his heels heading to the location.* - Wed Nov  4 15:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) entered into the house, the child actually having a key for the place. The inside would be..unlighted. Seemingly abandoned, yet not decrepit. 

"This is the place.."* - Wed Nov  4 15:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: It's dark...but that's good. - Wed Nov  4 15:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We should be able to stay here. I have enough money to afford food.. - Wed Nov  4 15:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Nozumi's old place..so many people.. - Wed Nov  4 15:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We can't go into the wilderness like that. - Wed Nov  4 15:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: It could be a quick way to get killed if we don't know what we're doing. - Wed Nov  4 15:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: But even if we do manage..it wouldn't be the right choice. - Wed Nov  4 15:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Got any suggestions? - Wed Nov  4 15:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We need to stay within Konoha or Suna. Depending on whether Fujitora pulls through. - Wed Nov  4 15:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If he doesn't come by in the next few days.. - Wed Nov  4 15:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'll find the Hokage. - Wed Nov  4 15:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'll see if I can join back in. - Wed Nov  4 15:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: That might lead to them trying to kill us. - Wed Nov  4 15:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Correction: Kill me. - Wed Nov  4 15:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'll go in by myself. - Wed Nov  4 15:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If it fails..you don't have to tell anyone you were from Kiri. - Wed Nov  4 15:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You got in without complication. As far as they know you can be an orphan. - Wed Nov  4 15:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: .....You're right, but that doesn't sit well. - Wed Nov  4 15:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I need the people.. - Wed Nov  4 15:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I need the shinobis together. - Wed Nov  4 15:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: We can continue hiding out here and trying to send word to Fujitora...lay low as long as possible. - Wed Nov  4 15:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: In the mean time practice jutsu that doesn't damage the house. Does this place have running water? - Wed Nov  4 15:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It should. - Wed Nov  4 15:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Lets go find a sink. - Wed Nov  4 15:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Something in mind? - Wed Nov  4 15:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Wed Nov  4 15:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Show me. - Wed Nov  4 16:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Right. We don't have to stay directly in here. - Wed Nov  4 16:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If we get a mask..or something. - Wed Nov  4 16:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Unless they recognize us for being short. - Wed Nov  4 16:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mask wouldn't be wise. - Wed Nov  4 16:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: We'd stick out like a sore thumb. - Wed Nov  4 16:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Would we? We're in a village of shinobis. - Wed Nov  4 16:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Yes but mask concealing our faces might draw people to think we're hiding something. - Wed Nov  4 16:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: So just stay in here and hope for Fujitora? - Wed Nov  4 16:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Send a hint to where you're at. - Wed Nov  4 16:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I don't have another messenger bird. Nor have I received a reply. - Wed Nov  4 16:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I see... - Wed Nov  4 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If you're worried about me leaving.. - Wed Nov  4 16:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You could go pick them up. You won't be spotted. - Wed Nov  4 16:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. I know a few techniques but it might be better for me to better understand them first. - Wed Nov  4 17:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) reached up catching the headband in his right hand. 

For several moments his eyes would linger on her, making sure that he was judging her intentions fully and that she was indeed serious. When it became far more evident that it was the case, Heiwa's arm lowered and he tossed the blue headband onto the floor infront of him. "Alright." He says, while bringing both of his hands interlocked near his chest. 

It'd be several seconds of him rotating through a set of hand seals, his speed picking up as he reached the final sixth one. During the entire action his chakra surged and circulate around his body, focusing finally up into his mouth where it switched into a volatile mixture of chakra and the katon element. When the seals were finished, he brought his right hand towards his mouth and brought index to thumb forming a circle through which to blow out the flames.

They were uncontrolled - volatile and unkempt. They didn't hold the power they could have if Heiwa had more training in the use of his element, however, they held some power in and of itself reflecting his relatively potent chakra. It'd be centered on the room infront of them and would begin melting at the target - the headband itself.

The house wasn't made of flammable material on the flooring so it wouldn't run into an issue, and the flammable material that -did- exist wasn't reached enough by the young child due to his relative inexperience.* - Wed Nov  4 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Not bad. - Wed Nov  4 17:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Uncle Hideki taught me that. - Wed Nov  4 17:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Why? - Wed Nov  4 17:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Heiwa smashing Yumiko - Wed Nov  4 17:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: I think they need a ban - Wed Nov  4 17:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: LOLno - Wed Nov  4 17:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) zips up pants.* - Wed Nov  4 17:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Tf you talkin about? - Wed Nov  4 17:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: SaVaGE LOL - Wed Nov  4 17:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Did you ever get a mission from Kirie? - Wed Nov  4 18:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: No. - Wed Nov  4 18:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Didn't get a chance to know her well or talk to her. Just knew she was the Mizukage. - Wed Nov  4 18:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm..I didn't talk to her much. She let me into her place after Arata and Daisuke died. - Wed Nov  4 18:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I see. - Wed Nov  4 18:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..She gave me this one mission. - Wed Nov  4 18:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: To go shopping with an elder villager. - Wed Nov  4 18:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: After that one I got another like it for the next couple of weeks..since my time in Kiri.  - Wed Nov  4 18:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: She was nice..told me a lot of stories. - Wed Nov  4 18:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Her house was destroyed in the attack following Kirie's death.  - Wed Nov  4 18:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I don't know if she lived.. - Wed Nov  4 18:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mmm... - Wed Nov  4 18:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: It seems the good always die while the evil roam free. - Wed Nov  4 18:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Too many have died.. - Wed Nov  4 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'm not going to let it continue to happen.. - Wed Nov  4 18:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: How will you stop it? - Wed Nov  4 18:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The world won't do it on its own.  - Wed Nov  4 19:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That much is clear. - Wed Nov  4 19:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: This world..has to be changed.  - Wed Nov  4 19:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Amass a strong enough power to do that. If they refuse.. - Wed Nov  4 19:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We'll be the fire that purifies the world. - Wed Nov  4 19:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I see. - Wed Nov  4 19:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Come on. Lets go get the bird. - Wed Nov  4 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Right. - Wed Nov  4 19:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I'm back. - Wed Nov  4 20:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Did you buy a scroll and a messenger bird? - Wed Nov  4 20:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Lots of messanger birds, one scroll. - Wed Nov  4 20:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Only the one? That gives this one message.. - Wed Nov  4 20:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: For now... - Wed Nov  4 21:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Lets send one. - Wed Nov  4 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Right. - Wed Nov  4 21:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) reaches out taking the scroll handed to him. At this point it was seeming like a loss cause sending these messages. It honestly wouldn't have shocked him if Fujitora had somehow ended up dead. It was the common thing to happen around him. Slowly the child was falling back into his anti-social tendencies. 

After taking the scroll he'd return back to his place and pull out a pen from his ninja back pouch, pressing the ink against the page and very carefully writing down the message. When it was finished he'd lay it out for a bit to make sure it dried before he'd roll it up. 

"Alright..that'll do."* - Wed Nov  4 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ... - Wed Nov  4 23:04:57 2015
