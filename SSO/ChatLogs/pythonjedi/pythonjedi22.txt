<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) sighed, and gave a nod in response, the child himself moving in carefully leading the two into the interior. Foliage in bounds - he'd be stepping as softly as he could so as to not make too much noise, assuming that the two behind him would be doing just about the same. Meanwhile he kept his eyes and wits about him attempting to track whatever he could find.* - Fri Nov 27 07:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) || A figure moved past - faintly off into the distance several metres away. The outline of its shape being discernable from Heiwa's view alongside the ever so soft patter drawing his attention to it. 

<A deer..> He was sure it was likely that, and quickly his hand raised up pointing off in the direction of the animal. It likely hadn't even seen the child, and even Nori and Yumiko would likely be strained to find it even with knowing it was directly where he was pointing. 

"A deer - over there," he whispers softly.* - Fri Nov 27 07:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) knew that Yumiko needed far more work on learning to use that bow than Heiwa - so after being the spotter he'd wait personally and allow her free ability to rend into the deer.* - Fri Nov 27 08:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stood at a rather small stature - the child and his cohorts each likely sharing this height disadvantage. Only the red headed Nori would hold any level of relevant size, and even then it'd be small. Bushes and shrubs hindered their sight if you were one of a size similar to them, but an adult or near to it likely could just see over to view what they were doing.

A deer trapped up in very powerful bindings, bleating for its life while remaining unable to move. The bindings themselves seemed to be strong iron chains protruding out from the grounds like some sort of trap. Just what were these kids doing? Torturing it? Hunting it?

Turning his head, suddenly the child locks eyes on the woman, dark onyx pupils focusing and scanning all that there was of her. His gaze would hold a certain analytical edge, and beyond that very little else shown in expression. Indiference at most. Seeing her, he'd make a small nudge of his shoulder aiming to grab Nori's attention.* - Fri Nov 27 08:58:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No close up fighting. No genjutsu. - Fri Nov 27 09:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took a seat on the couch, a deep breath being taken in. <We may be fighting Liu's brother again sometime,> Heiwa's eyes close, his thoughts entering the spotlight as he focuses inwards. <Or Ortho. Tetsujin. Maybe even Edge. I don't want this village to fall,> A single hand seal is made out of both hands interlocked infront of his chest. <I'm not going to let Nori and Yumiko die like everybody else.>

A small amount of chakra begins building up in his body, only surging further as their names were thought. <I'm going to protect them with all I've got.> Slowly the chakra begins to spread out from his body, the child taking meticulous care through the expansion. It made him burn far more energy within the act, but in keeping it steady he'd be able to feel the differences of what he was making.

A jutsu of a highly advanced category - the difficulty of use was definitively a prime limiter still. Only a couple of metres or so in width could be crafted through the making of it before difficulties in sustaining the technique began to present itself. The effects of his jutsu began to die out on the outer edges with only a max of a certain range actually maintaining the characteristics.

But the drain in extending it so far remained hitting him keeping him from having a chance at impacting anyone beyond just close range. Something like that may not be a problem again certain shinobis - but it'd put him heavily at a disadvantage and could definitely be problematic for the child. That was, simply, not something he was going to keep.

But, beyond that, the disadvantages were also highlighted in the fight against Ortho. Yumiko and Nori fell under the effects - if somehow he could control the technique to prevent that..he had to try his best to not put either of them at risk. 

Slowly, the chakra he had used would begin to shift and change shape, the appearance of falling white feathers spreading across the area. Calm and serene just the sight of them would appear originally completely innocuous - the target unaware of the true nature of the jutsu that was being employed within the area.

With just a slight touch of any of these feathers regardless of sight or sound the opponent suddenly feels a large surge of tiredness spread through their body. Like a pure state of zen the eden-like bliss near sends them over falling to the ground in a deep state of slumber. Even when they awoke it'd be unlikely for them to even be fully aware of the technique that had just been used.

But, Heiwa wouldn't just keep it up for a single usage. Holding his hands together, he continues pumping as much chakra as he can out into the area continuing the technique more and more. With each surge of chakra he'd begin doing his best to spread the reach just that little bit out from where it previously was.

<Come on..> A few inches of progress is made, his reserves straining and buckling underneath the stress. Not renowned in any capacity for his high levels - he held frankly average capacity with his chakra. Yet, from all of the experiences he has had in the last year, it was surprisingly very potent and powerful.

But, still, it was no where near powerful enough to keep it up as long as he wanted. His breath escapes him, his concentration breaks, and the jutsu falters - the child himself leaning back showing a high level of exhaustion. * - Sat Nov 28 02:50:40 2015

"You needed to work on the use of chains, right?" he asks, the question more rhetorical than anything. "I'll work on dodging your chains in turn  - so do your best to catch me."

After giving the training ideal to Nori, the child's hand raises up into the seal of confrontration detailing to her for each to start.* - Sat Nov 28 03:19:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: It's been a day. .or two . . Been liking it though. - Sun Nov 29 03:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I've noticed. Has the kage called for us lately? - Sun Nov 29 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Not that I know of. .  - Sun Nov 29 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Oh, Yumi ,can you untie me now? - Sun Nov 29 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Or Heiwa.. . One of you two? - Sun Nov 29 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I..couldn't really release you - if Yumiko is intending for you to be chained up still. - Sun Nov 29 04:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I'm nowhere near strong enough to pull those chains off.. - Sun Nov 29 04:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Awww. . - Sun Nov 29 04:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I'm hungry though. . - Sun Nov 29 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...Well what do you want to eat? - Sun Nov 29 04:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Uhm. . Dumplings. - Sun Nov 29 04:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Was it that bad? - Sun Nov 29 04:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Think the pressure being off her stomach made her realize how hungry she was? - Sun Nov 29 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Two daaaaaayssss. . - Sun Nov 29 04:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Oh god it's been that long!? - Sun Nov 29 04:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Need help getting up? - Sun Nov 29 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yeeaah. - Sun Nov 29 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) follows over doing the same to pick her up. "Come on - dumplings are on me."* - Sun Nov 29 05:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Lets go.~ - Sun Nov 29 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Two chairs three people...hmm.~ - Sun Nov 29 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) didn't take a seat - he'd let Yumiko and Nori have the chairs. "Dumplings, right?"* - Sun Nov 29 05:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Duummmpliiings. - Sun Nov 29 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stepped away from the table and propped himself up on the counter placing his order down alongside the money. They'd take it and Heiwa returns shortly thereafter. "It's going to be a bit."* - Sun Nov 29 06:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Nori-chan are you okay? - Sun Nov 29 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Nooooooooooooo. . - Sun Nov 29 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It won't even be that long..here. - Sun Nov 29 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) pulls out a candy bar. It wasn't chocolate so it was saved from being all melted and terrible. "To tide you over." he says, offering it on the table.* - Sun Nov 29 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..I'm fine. - Sun Nov 29 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Did some missions earlier. - Sun Nov 29 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Am waiting on the Mizukage to return. - Sun Nov 29 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Brief me on a few things. - Sun Nov 29 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Yeah we need to finish that mission we went on to kill the old man now that I think about it. - Sun Nov 29 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Could we talk about that in fact? - Sun Nov 29 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Yes. - Sun Nov 29 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hm? - Sun Nov 29 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Well..he's sent us out to attack a former gang he was a part of. And this is after his previous hostile takeover against the previous Mizukage. - Sun Nov 29 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Even if it was in a bid against Ortho.. - Sun Nov 29 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Do you think he's no better than him? - Sun Nov 29 06:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Can we be sure? - Sun Nov 29 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Never know. - Sun Nov 29 06:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmm. .  - Sun Nov 29 06:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: What he said could be true...the old man. - Sun Nov 29 07:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: What did he say? - Sun Nov 29 07:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: That lord Mizukage was a monster in short. - Sun Nov 29 07:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He admitted himself that he'd done such things. - Sun Nov 29 07:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And that he had, indeed, hunted the members of the 'black hand' for years. - Sun Nov 29 07:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: He did yes. - Sun Nov 29 07:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Just pretend you know what they are talking about. - Sun Nov 29 07:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Mhm. - Sun Nov 29 07:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Just..some things to consider. - Sun Nov 29 08:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) || Around that time the orders come in. A shit ton of dumplings. Primarily just that. * - Sun Nov 29 08:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) remained, along with the waiter that dropped off the food, just staring at Nori chowing down on the dumplings. * - Sun Nov 29 08:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Is she..alright? - Sun Nov 29 08:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: O-Okay. . Okay. .I'll stop. . - Sun Nov 29 08:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: You need to calm down. - Sun Nov 29 08:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Sorry. . - Sun Nov 29 08:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Yumiko, when you're not busy, you up for that spar we mentioned? - Sun Nov 29 09:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Ah now would be a good time. - Sun Nov 29 09:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Outside then? - Sun Nov 29 10:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Sun Nov 29 10:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stepped out of the restaurant alongside Yumiko, bringing her along to a more deserted area just on the outskirts of Kirigakure - away from any sort of civilian to inadvertently harm through their soon to be spar. Once they were there he'd take a position away from her giving the two an ample amount of space between eachother. 

"I was thinking this spar could be made special," Heiwa explains, lightly stretching out his body. "Long range only. If one of us moves within a few feet of the other it's a loss of the spar. Ninjutsu or whatever is chosen can be used - no Genjutsu. Fair?"* - Sun Nov 29 11:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) responded with a nod, and reached up to his chest to unstrap the bokken he kept slung around him. Holding it firmly in his hands, he tosses it out to the side before returning his attentions back onto Yumiko. 

"I'm ready when you are," he says, holding his hands both up infront of his chest. One arm would be held horizontally facing to his elbow - the other held upright and vertical in the seal of confrontation.* - Sun Nov 29 11:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Shockingly it's been quiet. - Mon Nov 30 03:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. It has. Heard any word of the Mizukage lately? - Mon Nov 30 03:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He's dead. - Mon Nov 30 03:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Wait. - Mon Nov 30 03:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Lord Liu, or the new Mizukage? - Mon Nov 30 03:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...What do you mean he's dead? - Mon Nov 30 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What happened? - Mon Nov 30 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Lord Lou died. - Mon Nov 30 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Liu* - Mon Nov 30 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Do I have to ask again..? - Mon Nov 30 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What happened? - Mon Nov 30 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: We went on a mission to Konoha. - Mon Nov 30 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He tried to harass a woman. - Mon Nov 30 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Ended up punching a defense mechanism type of thing. - Mon Nov 30 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: And it broke into shard and pierced him all over his body. - Mon Nov 30 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ... - Mon Nov 30 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What was the mission about? Why were there no guards brought with him? - Mon Nov 30 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Because to be frank, he was being stupid. - Mon Nov 30 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: No offense. - Mon Nov 30 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Suicidal coot. - Mon Nov 30 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Who's this 'new mizukage'? - Mon Nov 30 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Don't know. - Mon Nov 30 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Never seen 'em. - Mon Nov 30 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Are you sure the spot has been even filled? - Mon Nov 30 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Not too sure. - Mon Nov 30 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Just a rumor I heard. - Mon Nov 30 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: And the power vacuum starts again. There are only two candidates Liu would have in mind. - Mon Nov 30 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I cou - Mon Nov 30 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I wouldn't have been able to react fast enough to pull him out before the shars got him. - Mon Nov 30 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Then again, it was only a jutsu used to defend the woman, not harm the Godaime. - Mon Nov 30 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He decided to punch through it, and then the crystals shattered. - Mon Nov 30 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: *sigh* - Mon Nov 30 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Interesting. - Mon Nov 30 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...Crystal? Was the one who used said technique - did they have purple hair? - Mon Nov 30 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: If I recall correctly, yes. - Mon Nov 30 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) thinks: I was just thinking the samething. - Mon Nov 30 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I think he was originally from this village as well. - Mon Nov 30 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No. - Mon Nov 30 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Hm? - Mon Nov 30 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If it's that person he wasn't originally from Kirigakure. - Mon Nov 30 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Ah. - Mon Nov 30 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He's from Konohagakure. - Mon Nov 30 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He did reside here at one point or another, correct? - Mon Nov 30 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: It's odd. - Mon Nov 30 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Liu offered him a transfer to the village on temporary probation. - Mon Nov 30 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He lost a fight and was criticized for his fighting style. Reacting negatively he stormed off - he was thereafter exiled from the village. - Mon Nov 30 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I see... - Mon Nov 30 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: From the sounds of that he made a new technique, however. Finally took the advice I gave him to heart..in order to kill the Mizukage. - Mon Nov 30 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Though I must say. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: It seems as if that man never meant to kill Lord Liu. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Liu put himself in that situation. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Liu. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: That's much easier to say than Lord Liu, or Lord Mizukage, or the Godaime. But that's disrespectful. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Regardless I should have killed him. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Lord Liu, excuse me. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Why do you say that? - Mon Nov 30 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Because if I did then it might not have happen and he might be alive today. - Mon Nov 30 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Right. - Mon Nov 30 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The thing is, Yumiko, it's not quite Abraxes's fault. - Mon Nov 30 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Besides - Liu was unfit for the job. - Mon Nov 30 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nori can attest to that. - Mon Nov 30 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A few months prior he handed us his hat and mentioned he was going to 'walk off into the woods and die.' - Mon Nov 30 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And then there is the matter of how he became Mizukage to begin with. - Mon Nov 30 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I still can't believe it though. - Mon Nov 30 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He tells me to scout Konohagakure, and get a "feel" for it. - Mon Nov 30 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A feel for it? - Mon Nov 30 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Was he..intending to attack Konoha? - Mon Nov 30 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Then he transforms into me, and waltzes right into the villages, trying to feel a woman's knockers. - Mon Nov 30 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Yeah, like the type of people, the environment. - Mon Nov 30 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: It's presence, whatever you may call it. - Mon Nov 30 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He was -very- unfit. - Mon Nov 30 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: To think he made -me- his "bodyguard." - Mon Nov 30 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: I'm too weak for that type of stuff. - Mon Nov 30 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...I see. - Mon Nov 30 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Regardless of how unfit he was, he at least prepared for the future.  - Mon Nov 30 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I guess... - Mon Nov 30 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Fighting over who the Mizukage is won't be necessary. - Mon Nov 30 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: There are two candidates. One of which is the captain of the general military of the village. - Mon Nov 30 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: How come? - Mon Nov 30 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Ah. - Mon Nov 30 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: The other? - Mon Nov 30 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: The other is the captain of the binding and genjutsu corps. - Mon Nov 30 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The other is the captain of the binding and the genjutsu corps. - Mon Nov 30 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Right. - Mon Nov 30 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The two highest ranks made by the Mizukage before his death. - Mon Nov 30 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: How will either of them be chosen? - Mon Nov 30 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: More by whomever fully chooses the title than anything.  - Mon Nov 30 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: After that - well it depends on various other factors.  - Mon Nov 30 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I predict it will go to the military captain - Kana. - Mon Nov 30 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Kana, I've heard of her. - Mon Nov 30 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: The name sounds familiar. - Mon Nov 30 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: She's a chunnin of the village. - Mon Nov 30 03:48:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I imagine she is, at least. - Mon Nov 30 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Interesting. - Mon Nov 30 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: She might be able to teach me a trick or two. - Mon Nov 30 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: From Chuunin, to Captain of the General Military, to Mizukage? - Mon Nov 30 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That's quite the jump. - Mon Nov 30 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Not nearly as large of a jump as some kages in the past. - Mon Nov 30 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Including Liu. - Mon Nov 30 03:53:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Fresh from the academy basically. - Mon Nov 30 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: What!? - Mon Nov 30 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Tha-That's crazy. - Mon Nov 30 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Kirigakure has not been in strong straits for the last couple of months.. - Mon Nov 30 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I doubt Liu made much of an announcement of my rank. Beyond Yumiko and Nori at least. - Mon Nov 30 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That, I know. - Mon Nov 30 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: It's about time that we fix it, right? - Mon Nov 30 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. The people in Kiri deserve better than what we've had. - Mon Nov 30 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Agreed. - Mon Nov 30 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Tengoku, right? - Mon Nov 30 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: You are correct. - Mon Nov 30 03:58:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Oi.~ - Mon Nov 30 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Someone's woken up from a slumber. - Mon Nov 30 04:12:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: How was your sleep? - Mon Nov 30 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Good! Was tired. - Mon Nov 30 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Tenny? Yumi? - Mon Nov 30 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Awesome! - Mon Nov 30 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Up late researching again, Nori? - Mon Nov 30 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Researching? - Mon Nov 30 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yeah. . Sure. . - Mon Nov 30 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Research. .  - Mon Nov 30 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: That's what I've been doing. - Mon Nov 30 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: ..? - Mon Nov 30 04:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nori is a medic. - Mon Nov 30 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: She's often up late studying plants and herbs. - Mon Nov 30 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Or chaining herself up.. - Mon Nov 30 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Or doing both.~ *omit* - Mon Nov 30 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That's pretty cool. - Mon Nov 30 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I've got to admit, Nori, I thought you were training to be an expert in chained weapons. - Mon Nov 30 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Or rather, chains in general. - Mon Nov 30 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmmm .. I should try containment after medical works, to be honest. . - Mon Nov 30 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Containment?  - Mon Nov 30 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Fuuinjutsu. Sealing stuff. - Mon Nov 30 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Then after being full on white mage I could go and get some offense stuff. - Mon Nov 30 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Hrm, I might detach from my scouting ways for a brief period. - Mon Nov 30 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Possibly learn some new things. - Mon Nov 30 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. You're a scout?  - Mon Nov 30 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: He's better at shunshin than me. - Mon Nov 30 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Really?  - Mon Nov 30 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: How much better? - Mon Nov 30 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: He's faster than me and doesn't get disoriented. - Mon Nov 30 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I fell in the water once. - Mon Nov 30 05:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I see - fell in the water? - Mon Nov 30 05:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov 30 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What water? - Mon Nov 30 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Someone went a bit to far with their shunshin and an accident happen. - Mon Nov 30 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Ah - she's still having trouble with it? - Mon Nov 30 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I was .. tired at the time. - Mon Nov 30 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Anyway, yeah. I'm a scout. - Mon Nov 30 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That's probably the only thing I'm good at. - Mon Nov 30 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: How good are you at it? - Mon Nov 30 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Depends. - Mon Nov 30 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: If we're speak relatively, then it depends. - Mon Nov 30 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: In general, I'm fairly adept in my profession. - Mon Nov 30 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Wouldn't say I'm the best there is, but I'm close. - Mon Nov 30 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Well what can you do? Few people work to become scouts. - Mon Nov 30 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: As these girls have mentioned, my best skill lies in the art of Shunshin. - Mon Nov 30 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I can get in, and get out quickly unnoticed. - Mon Nov 30 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Kinds sound of assassin-esque, excuse me. - Mon Nov 30 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Weak. - Mon Nov 30 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Effective. - Mon Nov 30 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Useful. - Mon Nov 30 06:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Could you show me? - Mon Nov 30 06:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Idiot. - Mon Nov 30 06:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Yeah. - Mon Nov 30 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) 's dark, onyx shaded eyes rested on Tengoku, analytically passing over the movements he made. There'd be a sure attention focused on the handseal that was crafted - one well and clear to Heiwa on the meaning to what it was. <Here he comes,> the thought passes by his mind, and a small step is taken backwards with his right leg. Said foot would remain stationary on the tip of his toes, his stance a bit wider and his height boosted marginally. 

Throughout the entire maneuver the child's eyes would not falter or step away from where Tengoku was, and when he made his move so too would Heiwa. As a product of his advanced sight - even the remarkably quick movement of Tengoku would be spotted and tracked through his use of shunshin. Meanwhile, Heiwa's front left leg moves to meet up with his back right leg - each being brought up in that stance on both toes. <I'm ready - show me what you can do.>

When Tengoku moves to stop infront of Heiwa - the child would respond reflexively by moving out to the side of him showing near comparable speed and swiftness of the action. If he continued with his combination of strikes - unfettered by the show from Heiwa - then each would be followed carefully and reacted against with the child jumping away and creating distance from each of the nudges. * - Mon Nov 30 06:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) followed through with every movement, careful dodges and dancing around of the two that were each moving far faster than the average human would be able to. Especially at such young ages. <How many more times is he going to appear?> Without a doubt it was proving an exceptional level of skill with the technique, enough so that when Tengoku had finally come to a stop back where he had started the child would remained tensed up still - ready and waiting for another movement. Just working to react against him kept him on his toes - quite literally.

When it became clear that that was the end of their little exercise he'd exhale out and bring himself back against the soles of his feet. "That's not weak at all," he explains, shaking his head as he said that. "I didn't even think you could chain the technique together like that," the child's remark would be felt with an additional level of genuine surprise. <It truly is something..>* - Mon Nov 30 07:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Yeah, it's possible. - Mon Nov 30 07:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I mean, I think I'm fairly skilled at it. But that's primarily my only skill. - Mon Nov 30 07:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I can overwhelm someone, but I'm rather weak i. - Mon Nov 30 07:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I'm rather weak in taijutsu. - Mon Nov 30 07:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm - Are you intending to work on Taijutsu? - Mon Nov 30 07:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Soon enough, yes. - Mon Nov 30 07:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: My Shunshin abilities wouldn't prove well in combat if I didn't work on taijutsu. - Mon Nov 30 07:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Either Taijutsu or Kenjutsu. If you need a sparring partner I'd be up for it - like I do the same with Nori and Yumiko. - Mon Nov 30 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Hm. - Mon Nov 30 07:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Seems everyone here but two are weak. - Mon Nov 30 07:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That would be nice. - Mon Nov 30 07:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Thanks Heiwa. - Mon Nov 30 07:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Thanks, Yumi.~ - Mon Nov 30 07:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm - evening.  - Mon Nov 30 07:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Bored. - Mon Nov 30 07:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yumiko, are you busy? - Mon Nov 30 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I'm not busy at all. - Mon Nov 30 07:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Alright, I'll be off. - Mon Nov 30 07:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: See you guys later. - Mon Nov 30 07:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I have something to show you - lets go to the waterfall. - Mon Nov 30 07:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Alright. - Mon Nov 30 07:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) walked off expecting Yumiko to follow.* - Mon Nov 30 07:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) made his way up to the top of the plateau, standing just before where the water fall began descending into the pond below. "You remember that water jutsu I showed you?" he asks, bringing his hands up infront of his chest. It'd be made in the way of a single hand seal, it being held as his chakra began to surge up more and more.

"I have another like it I can show you."* - Mon Nov 30 08:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded, and brought his hands up into another seal - this one of the tiger. It'd be kept deliberately slow so it was very easy to note and copy. "It's called Suiton: Mizuame Nabara," he explains, and very suddenly the chakra surges up towards his mouth resting there.

"Water Style: Syrup Trap." As the translation comes out, he brings his hands out to the sides and fully converst the chakra he had formed. It'd begin to turn into a very thick, viscous liquid inside of his mouth, and taking a deep breath in with his nose he fully steps forwards spitting it all out infront of him.

In an arc it flies - the large sticky mass exitting him and pooling around ontop of the water creating a sticky field trap - difficult to even pry oneself from.* - Mon Nov 30 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) had, honestly, been expecting far less immediately from her at first. <She's really good with this element..> Considering the difficulty the technique had put on him at first. When she was finished he'd return taking a position beside her. "It's another technique Lyala taught me. Useful - likely moreso if combined with the enemy being unable to see."* - Mon Nov 30 09:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: It's very useful. We should have used it on that guy. - Mon Nov 30 09:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The old guy? - Mon Nov 30 09:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov 30 09:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It wouldn't be too useful if we couldn't track him, though. Or if his barrier were able to deflect the technique. - Mon Nov 30 09:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: It would turn it into a range fight however. - Mon Nov 30 09:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm - but first things first was deducing whether his barrier could deflect it to begin with. - Mon Nov 30 09:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If it could..it'd hardly do much. - Mon Nov 30 09:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: This is true. - Mon Nov 30 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stepped a bit closer to the water, before pulling his feet in and sitting against the ground. His eyes would be focused on the outlying village.

"So..Liu is dead."* - Mon Nov 30 09:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...A new kage is required. - Mon Nov 30 09:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That's..clear. - Mon Nov 30 09:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You think Kana would accept it? - Mon Nov 30 09:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Would she be the right person for it? - Mon Nov 30 09:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Is there another person for it? The lone adult with any strength in a village of children.. - Mon Nov 30 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: ....True. - Mon Nov 30 09:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: But she seems weird. - Mon Nov 30 09:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm? - Mon Nov 30 10:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Like uh. - Mon Nov 30 10:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Me no no how to say it. - Mon Nov 30 10:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: .... - Mon Nov 30 10:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: She seems hard as a person. I..I don't know. Who else if not her? - Mon Nov 30 10:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stares at the oddly dressed man, his brow raising ever so much. "Err - hey." Judging from his tone he was sufficiently weirded out.* - Mon Nov 30 19:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mikaelson, Mystic(Mammon Monomyth) says: Where is Lady Tetsu? - Mon Nov 30 19:09:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Oh...Do you know of a place that I can obtain Taijutsu scrolls? - Mon Nov 30 19:12:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: That's quite bold of him. - Tue Dec  1 01:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You win, I stop talking about being in a squad. - Tue Dec  1 01:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I win, I go it alone. - Tue Dec  1 01:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: No ninjutsu? Alright. - Tue Dec  1 01:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Give me a few days for my hands to heal first. - Tue Dec  1 01:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Oh by the way. - Tue Dec  1 01:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: If I win, I'm slicing your arm off. - Tue Dec  1 01:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: If you can. - Tue Dec  1 01:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ... - Tue Dec  1 01:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Tengoku, are you busy? - Tue Dec  1 01:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Nah, how come? - Tue Dec  1 01:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'm thinking of bringing my squad together for some training. - Tue Dec  1 01:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You'd be a help in this training. - Tue Dec  1 01:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Oh? - Tue Dec  1 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I guess I can help. - Tue Dec  1 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: --Right. Nori, Yumiko, our radios are on the same frequency. - Tue Dec  1 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmm? Oh, alright. - Tue Dec  1 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Sekitsui, I'll have a radio for you in a little bit. - Tue Dec  1 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Oh, okay. - Tue Dec  1 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: In the mean time, Tengoku, lets go get ready. - Tue Dec  1 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Are we going to go train? - Tue Dec  1 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Alrighty. - Tue Dec  1 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. We are if you three are ready. - Tue Dec  1 01:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took a position standing infront of the gathered shinobis - the short child glancing across the four of them before speaking.

"Welcome to the inauguration of Squad 1," the child speaks, his tone being kept serious and formal. "My name is Heiwa, and I am a special jounin of this village. I will be your squad leader." Formalities, of course, would be discussed and taken through quickly as he went onto the point he was getting at. "There are three of you total - Tengoku here is merely meant to add as an aid for our training if he is needed. Before we get to that, however, we will start with your own introductions."

A gesture is made towards Yumiko pointing her out. "Starting with her we will descend down the line. Feel free to join in as well, Tengoku." * - Tue Dec  1 02:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: ...I don't know that word he just used. - Tue Dec  1 02:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Maybe I should start off? - Tue Dec  1 02:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Go ahead. - Tue Dec  1 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) eyed the small, black dog very quickly understanding what it could be used for - even with its small stature. He'd seen one or two practicioners of dogs in combat, and he was also well familiar with the idea of summons existing that were potent even if small. <She brings more surprises than I realized - useful and versatile.>

Bringing his eyes off of the dog, he'd return scanning over all four of them before finally resting his eyes on the group total. "Good. It's a good thing you've kept yourself open around your squadmates. In the field knowledge of your allies strengths and weaknesses is just as important as knowing your own or your enemies."

"Can anyone tell me who the prime person to protect is?"* - Tue Dec  1 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yes, Sekitsui? - Tue Dec  1 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: The medic. - Tue Dec  1 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Precisely. - Tue Dec  1 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nori is the primary person to protect in most situations. - Tue Dec  1 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Other exceptions exist, such as a mission built around protecting a person, or a position where ones skills are suddenly elevated beyond where Nori's are useful - but in the most case our work will be cut out on protecting Nori while finishing our actions. - Tue Dec  1 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And this is why we've brought Tengoku here. - Tue Dec  1 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Please, if you would, step up. - Tue Dec  1 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Because of his speed and use of shunshin? - Tue Dec  1 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Closer, stand beside me. - Tue Dec  1 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The three of you are on a mission. I've been seperated from the group. - Tue Dec  1 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: What does Heiwa have planned? - Tue Dec  1 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You see the faint outline of a rogue shinobi infront of you.  - Tue Dec  1 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: ... - Tue Dec  1 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You have one minute to get into position. - Tue Dec  1 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Protect Nori, disable Tengoku, however you choose to play it. - Tue Dec  1 03:18:24 2015
