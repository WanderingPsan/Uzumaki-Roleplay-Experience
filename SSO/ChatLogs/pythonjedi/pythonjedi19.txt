<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Is that why you let Ortho do as he did? To butcher those in Kirigakure freely who didn't deserve it? - Tue Nov 17 11:07:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And joke with him - a known mass murderer responsible for the death of hundreds in this village. - Tue Nov 17 11:09:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Could you at least try to save one of them? Stop one of them from dying unneeded at the hands of Ortho for what will soon be the fifth time that he invades this village? - Tue Nov 17 11:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If they weren't killed by my hands, I've had no involvement in their deaths. - Tue Nov 17 11:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...Exactly. Which is why the question of why you're helping this village is brought up. - Tue Nov 17 11:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Are you asking for help?~ - Tue Nov 17 11:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If you don't care for the village or their people why are you trying to help as you are? - Tue Nov 17 11:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I help where I see my services being most useful. - Tue Nov 17 11:12:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..And you have not a reason to help Kirigakure either. - Tue Nov 17 11:16:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A psychopathic sycophant - concerned with your own motives and unconcerned to the plights of the people. - Tue Nov 17 11:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It is quite selfish of you to demand my help, and then not even give thanks for me saving your life.~ - Tue Nov 17 11:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Shouldn't you be thankful that you're alive? - Tue Nov 17 11:18:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stared at him with a slight raised expression about his brows. The child just pushed seven - he really had no idea what the man was talking about. 

"She's a girl that's my friend." he says, still holding a bit of that edge to his tone. * - Tue Nov 17 11:26:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Mind if I speak with Yumiko-chan alone? - Tue Nov 17 11:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...No. I'm not having you do anything to her. - Tue Nov 17 11:29:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: As if I'm going to do something to her. - Tue Nov 17 11:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Because I don't have a reason to trust you.  - Tue Nov 17 11:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Because you let Ortho escape unconcerned about what he'd done. - Tue Nov 17 11:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Really? - Tue Nov 17 11:34:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I don't mind you stopping him. - Tue Nov 17 11:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Just know that..unless you train hard..you most likely won't be able to beat him anytime soon. - Tue Nov 17 11:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..I know.  - Tue Nov 17 11:38:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Then you know of their eyes, right? - Tue Nov 17 11:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I know of them to an extent. - Tue Nov 17 11:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I never was interested in their eyes. It seems they made a big deal about them. - Tue Nov 17 11:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Do you know how they achieved them? - Tue Nov 17 11:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Sadly, I do not. - Tue Nov 17 11:41:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Yes, but you shouldn't rely on them. - Tue Nov 17 11:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hideki, and Ushinawa did have those eyes. Yet they could operate without them. - Tue Nov 17 11:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If you ask me, those things are nothing more than a hindrance. - Tue Nov 17 11:42:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And now Ortho..says I won't be able to beat him without them. Or see things the way he does. - Tue Nov 17 11:43:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Well..it solely depends on what you want to do? - Tue Nov 17 11:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) did not have a good childhood so far.* - Tue Nov 17 11:44:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Or..focus on training your real skills, that'll most likely save you. - Tue Nov 17 11:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ....I don't feel as if my cause will be right without those eyes. Without my father's will..with me. - Tue Nov 17 11:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Well..then.. - Tue Nov 17 11:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: But he wouldn't want me to be wasting m time. He would be wanting me to stop Ortho. I know this. - Tue Nov 17 11:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Achieve those eyes. - Tue Nov 17 11:49:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) echoed in his movements stepping even closer to Yumiko. The girl more or less seemed to be dazing out or flat out just unconscious. Yeah - that's the excuse we're going for. 

"I'm still not letting you have her," he repeats for him to hear. Romantic feelings weren't those he had for Yumiko. It was closer to family - he saw her as a sort of kin to him with the current state of her own family being not the greatest. Even more so she was actually capable of keeping up with him - to some extent.* - Tue Nov 17 11:57:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Why? - Tue Nov 17 12:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Just wondering. - Tue Nov 17 12:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: There's nothing wrong with that..~ - Tue Nov 17 12:03:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I wasn't expecting you to. - Tue Nov 17 12:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You're also not one to tie yourself down to a village from what I've seen. - Tue Nov 17 12:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That's true. - Tue Nov 17 12:07:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If you had to who would you save? That red haired medic, or Yumiko? - Tue Nov 17 12:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...What? - Tue Nov 17 12:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Who.. - Tue Nov 17 12:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Would you save? - Tue Nov 17 12:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It's simple.. - Tue Nov 17 12:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If you had your hands full.. - Tue Nov 17 12:14:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'm not having them put in a situation like that. - Tue Nov 17 12:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Sometimes you don't get to choose. - Tue Nov 17 12:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Neither of them are dying. - Tue Nov 17 12:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'm not going to let them. - Tue Nov 17 12:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Oh? - Tue Nov 17 12:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Let's test that? - Tue Nov 17 12:16:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I'm just joking.~ - Tue Nov 17 12:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You see Heiwa-kun..that was just a simple test. - Tue Nov 17 12:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Of what? - Tue Nov 17 12:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You still have much to learn. - Tue Nov 17 12:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hi, Heiwa. - Wed Nov 18 01:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Hey. - Wed Nov 18 01:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Kida, Ichiro.~ - Wed Nov 18 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: There you assholes are. - Wed Nov 18 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I apologize Lady Shiro. - Wed Nov 18 01:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: What's this mission about? - Wed Nov 18 01:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: It's okay Ichiro.~ - Wed Nov 18 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: You owe me so much though. - Wed Nov 18 01:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Of course. Anything for you. - Wed Nov 18 01:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Oh, hey guys. - Wed Nov 18 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) whispers: Mmm... - Wed Nov 18 01:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I see. - Wed Nov 18 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Uh huh.~ - Wed Nov 18 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Anywhoooooooo. - Wed Nov 18 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Let's go do something fun. - Wed Nov 18 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Kida, Ichiro, how about you two spar or something. - Wed Nov 18 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: And I can watch. - Wed Nov 18 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Alright. Kida? - Wed Nov 18 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Sure. - Wed Nov 18 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: It'll probably be like the last. - Wed Nov 18 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Then let us find an appropriate space to spar. - Wed Nov 18 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I doubt we should have to stray from the confinements of this complex however. - Wed Nov 18 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: There's the lake behind the academy. There's enough space there. - Wed Nov 18 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: That should suffice, I suppose. - Wed Nov 18 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Com'on.~ - Wed Nov 18 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Let's go.~ - Wed Nov 18 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Lake~. - Wed Nov 18 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Two men swimming together while rassling. - Wed Nov 18 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: *Whistles* - Wed Nov 18 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: This may take a bit. - Wed Nov 18 02:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yeeaah. - Wed Nov 18 02:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: So... - Wed Nov 18 02:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) whispers: Booored. - Wed Nov 18 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: Want to go do something? - Wed Nov 18 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) whispers: Mhm! Anything really. - Wed Nov 18 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) whispers: Hmm - Wed Nov 18 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) whispers: *? - Wed Nov 18 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: Want to get something to eat then? - Wed Nov 18 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) whispers: Sure. - Wed Nov 18 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) offered his hand out to Nori.

"Got a place in mind?"* - Wed Nov 18 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Alright. Lead the way? - Wed Nov 18 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I got bored searching so I went here instead. - Wed Nov 18 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I'm buying though. So want anything? - Wed Nov 18 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Small order of Miso soup? - Wed Nov 18 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) grabbed the bowl from her, lightly placing it along his side of the table. Even still with it here the child wouldn't take a bite of it, his eyes remaining along the tightly swirling yellow broth.

"I'm fine," he doesn't look at her as he says this. "What he said was stupid and much of what he's done makes me think that way." There wasn't the same respect he had for Kirie on this kage. * - Wed Nov 18 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: He didn't make much sense. . I'll agree with you on that. .  - Wed Nov 18 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmm. . Did that question upset you or anything? - Wed Nov 18 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No. It's..fine.  - Wed Nov 18 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'm..worried about Ortho. About the village. - Wed Nov 18 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: About you two.. - Wed Nov 18 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Chunnin exams? - Wed Nov 18 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Eh. .? - Wed Nov 18 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Don't know, maybe I feel like I'm not helping enough. . - Wed Nov 18 06:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) did take note of the kage being here, yet didn't make much of a motion because of it aside from a glance in his direction. The child wouldn't be the one to stop him if any were to do so.* - Wed Nov 18 06:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) once more shifts his eyes in the direction of Liu, a more or less disinterested look on his face. But one who had been near Heiwa for any period of time could note this being closer to the standard or norm for the child than it was one of inherent hostility. 

However, such a visage would break into one of confusion and curiosity as he heard the kage speak, the words spelling quite bad for the look that he'd hold about him. A sense of impending hardship - there wasn't anything he enjoyed about the tone of it all. When it ended with the hat upon the table Heiwa wouldn't move immediately, the sorting out of it all taking a bit of time for his brain to register - his mind initially elsewhere.

But when the fog was gone and it became fully clear about the nature of it the child picked himself up and moved out of the pub glancing around in either direction to find him. If he'd really wanted himself gone it's likely he could have left during this time without the child catching onto his trail - but if he remained slower in his departure the child would rush over and try to flag him down. 

"Hey! What's that all about?"* - Wed Nov 18 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) raised his brow somewhat - the child wasn't around for the whole situation that apparently happened earlier. He'd not heard anything about the villagers or other shinobi being upset at him. He'd hardly even seen many people mention the Mizukage's performance.

And, seeing how Nori was taking over with clearly more knowledge, he'd not say much himself.* - Wed Nov 18 07:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) grabbed a hold of Liu's coat. "JUST DO IT!" the child screams out, voice suddenly Shia Lebouf. "JUST DO IT! DON'T LET YOUR DREAMS BE DREAMS! YESTERDAY YOU SAID TOMORROW, SO JUST, DO IT! MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE!" 

He took a step back afterwards.* - Wed Nov 18 07:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Besides, Heiwa too emo to be mizu *omit* - Wed Nov 18 08:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) really and truly didn't have much to add to all of this. Heiwa wasn't much of a person to give encouraging speeches, even moreso seeing as how Nori was actually pulling it back around. He'd keep his opinions to himself.* - Wed Nov 18 08:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Right. Good luck. - Wed Nov 18 08:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ... - Wed Nov 18 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hm? - Wed Nov 18 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Surprised? - Wed Nov 18 08:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: At how he acted.. - Wed Nov 18 08:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) heard the light breathing as he passed by, his eyes flicking across to find the source. It wasn't initially anything that seemed major, just some curiousity. But seeing who it was made Heiwa stop. His eyes would remain on for a time befoe approaching. 

"Hey - are you alright?" he asks, having not been there of course to see the actual usage of the jutsu.* - Wed Nov 18 13:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: M-mhm....shunshin takes a lot out of me. I'm still not use to the effects of it. How are you? - Wed Nov 18 13:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I see - I'm fine. You hear the announcement from the kage? - Wed Nov 18 13:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: About the chunnin exams? - Wed Nov 18 13:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm...a lady delivered the message after that weird guy spoke to her. - Wed Nov 18 13:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It doesn't seem like we have much of a choice on entering.. - Wed Nov 18 13:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I figured... - Wed Nov 18 13:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Do you think we can handle it? - Wed Nov 18 13:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: When I think of the exams I think of people who are as strong as the lighting lady. - Wed Nov 18 13:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The lighting lady? - Wed Nov 18 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: The one who injured my arm... - Wed Nov 18 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Isn't there a written test normally before anything else? - Wed Nov 18 13:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We could just bomb that. - Wed Nov 18 13:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: You want to? - Wed Nov 18 13:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yeah. I don't want you or Nori to get hurt.. - Wed Nov 18 13:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Alright then. - Wed Nov 18 13:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) kept an eye on the girl, his eyes keeping track of the brief blurring of her movement as she moved to stand beside him. It was getting better - and it looked even faster than when he was first shown the technique on Nina. "Not bad." the child says, earnestly still impressed with the jutsu. It seemed very powerful.

Of course, the slight bit of dizziness that she would show would be enough for Heiwa to pick up on it - and he'd put an arm around her to help stabilize the girl and guide her over to the bench to take a seat. "But if you still get dizzy form it it's not that useable in combat,"* - Wed Nov 18 13:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: That's true....however, it did keep me alive luckly. - Wed Nov 18 14:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Yeah. I shouldn't have left you like that..by the way.  - Wed Nov 18 14:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I didn't think any jutsu..could move that fast. - Wed Nov 18 14:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Wish we could have forced some information out of her. - Wed Nov 18 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm..she was dead before I was given a chance. - Wed Nov 18 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hmm maybe next time under conditions we can find a way to get information without them knowing. - Wed Nov 18 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Without them knowing? - Wed Nov 18 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm.  - Wed Nov 18 14:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Heiwa-kun go stand a little bit away from the tree. Going to try and shunshin to you. - Wed Nov 18 14:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded in response, picking himself up from the bench and stepping over just infront of the tree.* - Wed Nov 18 14:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) again moved over to help her as the effects began to present themselves, not wanting to have her fall because of it. He'd help stabilize her standing for a bit before leading her over to take a seat on the grass.

"Nothing worth it is," the child responds, adding on his own little addition for the statement.* - Wed Nov 18 14:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: That's true. - Wed Nov 18 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Once I'm rested up I'm trying again. - Wed Nov 18 14:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Right.  - Wed Nov 18 15:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) still had plenty of reserves himself. He was saving up for later when he'd need to do his missions, but a little bit of practice, he felt, couldn't end up hurting him. Besides there was one jutsu he was beginning to want to master relatively quickly - even moreso because he intended to show Yumiko how to use it after he'd manage to do it.

Without standing up, he'd bring his hands up to his chest and rotate through a set of three hand seals, his chakra surging throughout his body with every single one that he'd made. It'd begin to swell and flow up into his cheeks, the pressure welling up with every continued ounce of the stuff that made it up to his mouth.

Once it was about adequate, he broke off from the seals and placed his hands against his mouth. A hole would be made from the combination of index and thumb, said hole being used as a target to spit the liquid straight through sending it off as a stream infront of him - arcing directly to the ground infront of him.

It'd last for a short bit - the child's reserves relatively potent, but not the largest. After his short display he'd lean back - not seeming terribly as phased as Yumiko's usage of the Shunshin would leave her.* - Wed Nov 18 15:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hiii. - Thu Nov 19 01:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Hey. I was about to get something to eat - either of you want to come with? - Thu Nov 19 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Sure.~ - Thu Nov 19 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright. To go fine? We can eat at the waterfall. - Thu Nov 19 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: The waterfall sounds like a good place to eat. - Thu Nov 19 02:15:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded, sitting down just a few feet away from the water. The child seemed in a relatively positive mood for someone like him. "You can see most of the village from this high up."* - Thu Nov 19 03:48:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The effects - Shunshin? - Thu Nov 19 05:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Thu Nov 19 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: So you can use it without any problem?  - Thu Nov 19 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mind showing me? - Thu Nov 19 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Dutr. - Thu Nov 19 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) watched the girl carefully, eyes remaining on her through the hand seal made and then the following use of the technique. Honestly - most of it he'd already either deduced or been flat out told before by the multiple other people who managed to show it to him. Even Mizumi had it. "I've seen someone use fire with it," he adds in, nodding as she mentioned the additional things you could add to hide your tracks.

When it was over he at least had a basic demonstration of it, and would take a step back away from Yumiko after it'd all happened. "So something like.." he says aloud, bringing his hand up into a simple seal - that of the ram. As he made the seal he focused his chakra around his body, suffusing it across the various places that she'd mentioned. Primarily around his feet. It almost felt somewhat similar to that of the Suimen technique, and in many respects that's partly what he was basing it off of.

When he felt the proper 'sheen' of the effects had managed to be created around his feet, he'd finally send a final surge of chakra creating a white plume of smoke. However, when it vanished Heiwa would still remain in the same area. It caused him pause, blinking for a moment where he went wrong, before shaking his head and bringing his hands up into another iteration of the hand seal.

<It's not an automatic process..does it just maybe increase the velocity..?> Showing much of his quick learning, he'd begin to peice together parts of where he might have failed, before once again focusing chakra around his body. The suimen technique wouldn't directly be the one used - and he wouldn't be focusing it off of that anymore. He'd be focused instead on the phrase she used "It's a quick burst of movement" and basing the attempt off of that now.

The chakra would begin focusing on his feet and somewhat around the muscles of his legs, as another surge of chakra exitted him creating the plume. This time while under the guise of the smoke he'd take a step forward - and before he even realized what had happened his foot already hit the ground. His eyes widened, and quickly while doing his best to keep up he sends his next foot forwards so as to not send him toppling over.

More and more it kept moving faster than he could predict or imagine - and when the plume had faded Heiwa would be seen on the ground only a few meters away from where he started barely holding himself up on all fours. The disorientation of being in such a state and now being once more out of it left him almost feeling like throwing up.* - Thu Nov 19 07:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) || In the motions of it all the child would barely notice Yumiko having given him a body to lean on. It only came back through after the disorientation began fading and his mind returned. <So this is what they pushed through..>

He'd remain leaning against her. The child would be relatively light even for his age. "I'm surprised you can get through it.."* - Thu Nov 19 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: It took me a long time...a real long time. - Thu Nov 19 07:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: My..head is still spinning. Can you take me back to the ground? I need..to sit this out. - Thu Nov 19 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Thu Nov 19 07:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Better? - Thu Nov 19 08:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Yeah. I'm getting there. - Thu Nov 19 08:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That's..terrible as a feeling. - Thu Nov 19 08:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I know... - Thu Nov 19 08:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: You can rest on me. - Thu Nov 19 08:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm..Alright. - Thu Nov 19 08:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: How long have you been working on that? - Thu Nov 19 08:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) found himself walking back to the house alone, his partner having left to work on some missions after verifying Heiwa could make it on his own. Indeed he could, but as he kept walking to the house his mind would continue swirling with ideas of how the jutsu could be used more efficiently - and ways for him to improve on his usage of it beyond what he demonstrated to Yumiko with.

And, what was more, it nagged at him to an increasing extent due to how the match with Ortho had ended. Life or death - he couldn't move past the certain brink of exhaustion. The two newest techniques he had picked up were surely powerful additions, but none of it was going to be strong enough if the child didn't have the ability to properly use all of them.

Which is why the inefficiency of that jutsu - the glaring weakness that Yumiko had managed to overcome - left him more than just a little bit energized to continue. There was likely the same spark of inspiration that could be applied to not only Shunshin, but also the rest of his jutsus if he was able to put in the time and effort to mastering them. Now, he had the motivation and the understanding enough to want to continue harder in his training.

En route to the house, he'd crack a smirk, the competitive side of Heiwa showing through - the love of improvement making him excited. Both hands wrap infront of his chest, interlocking digits coming to a close as he formed the symbol of the ram, his chakra spreading across the various parts of his body moulded into a different formation through this ritual.

Following the advice of Yumiko he focuses the chakra into the area of his legs, a thin sheen of the stuff beginning to pool around his soles. But, more than that, he knew what the next step was. The chakra wasn't just to be focused around his feet - but also around the muscles within his legs. Engorging themselves on his energy they grew stronger momentarily - the drain immediately beginning to hit Heiwa as he remained focusing his chakra.

<Shunshin no Jutsu!> The name flashes past - his chakra surges and a plume of smoke appears covering his escape. Each step would be taken easily, the muscles themselves planting and firmly stepping far faster than the child would be used to. However, this wasn't the first time Heiwa has ever dealt with such a detriment of sight and spatial awareness. Among many his speed was phenomenal - a true showcase of how far he had come.

But he wasn't always capable to that extent. He only got so far with proper hard work and training - and at various points he'd run into a similar situation. Being unable to track even himself his eyes were forced to adjust. But before they had his mind would work on it to not just adjust later - but in the immediate. Judging based on the facts that he could truly see a picture would be laid out - and the feelings of how far he was going would lead him to a choreographed stage of movement.

The mental powr of Heiwa simply was an amazing thing - and much of it was capable of enhancing his physical body where truly it wouldn't be expected to. The child was weak, small, and overall far more fragile than someone his age would be - especially with the level of training he has perservered. But proper thinking was Heiwa's trump card in life and as a shinobi.

With each step he took his mind would begin mapping out the speed and would adjust to it, the child coming to a stop out of shunshin remaining luckily still on his own two feet - the final plunge to the ground not happening just yet this time. But the disorientation, either way, would still hit and force him to find somewhere to rest and lean against.

Still on his way home, he'd hold a smile as he caught his breath and finally returned to that group house.* - Thu Nov 19 12:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) entered the house later than had been expected - his pace slowed by the drain of the technique he'd been using along the way. But the major thing of it all was a definitive mark of improvement over what he'd had before. Heiwa was getting far better at that technique. The drain wasn't even hitting him nearly as much in either disorientation or actual chakra drain. 

If he kept this up he could assuredly be able to handle someone like Ortho. Even if he disagreed with Sado - the words that he spoke indeed were true. Improvement of the self over a reliance on the eyes. He'd carry his father's will even if he'd never activate that which his father intended for him to carry. The weight on his shoulders felt markedly alleviated from before. Even if he did still carry many burdens this one was finally off of him.

The house was empty as he entered, Nori seemingly gone from the area as well. Heiwa didn't miss a beat. He continued out into the bed room, moving past where they slept to enter into the bathroom. There he positioned himself hovering just directly infront of the bath tub, position almost as if he was about to throw up inside of it.

And to an extent one could argue that was the case. The child, bringing his hands up to his chest, would slowly begin to circulate chakra around his body drawing the combination of energy to flow up into his mouth. There it'd begin pooling up, morphing and moulding into different shapes with every rotation of the fingers that Heiwa's digits went through.

Only three were counted, the third being held as he made the final surging change to the energy. It'd turn into that of suiton based chakra, the energy transforming to a sudden gathering a water within his mouth as it continued to shift into its new form. His cheeks swelled under the pressure straining to contain it all.

<Water Style: Raging Waves!> His right hand disjointed from his left, raising up to hover just infront of his mouth. There it'd create a small hole from index and thumb which he fit himself through, the swelling near growing painful. And then just like that he let it all out. Parting his lips he spreads the full formation out in a stream gushing out of his mouth and directly into the porcelain tub.

There it'd begin rising more and more. Heiwa didn't stop immediately after using it - instead straining not only his reserves but his ability to use the jutsu effectively. He wasn't basing it off of time, but instead off of total fill amount. If he ended up improperly converting the chakra or misusing some at some point it'd be just that much more straining.

In doing so he'd set a marker. Every second was calculated in his mind with the final number ringing through his head as the water finally touched the tip of his nose and the child took a leaning sit backwards breathing heavily in and out. It was draining, surely, but a lot of it was in his mind better than going through any more shunshin mastery. At least he didn't feel like he was going to throw up - instead it felt as if he just finished doing so.

As he waited for his chakra to return, he'd unclog the drain and go out into the kitchen to get something to eat. Yup.* - Thu Nov 19 13:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) sat near to a window, eyes focused on the area outside directly from him. One spot in particular was the one that caught his eye - a large growing tree that had been in sight of the window. It'd give him a chance to utilize the technique without exposing himself to the elements - shit was cold at this time of morning. 

Bringing his hands up to his chest he rotates through a set of simple seals, his speed minimal with the child clearly focusing on the use of his chakra throughout the entire endeavor. It'd circulate all around his body, before finally the child slams his palm against the ground sending all of that energy through the ground and outside.

There, just beside the tree, multiple iron chains would pop out of the dirt grabbing hold of their target - chains wrapping around the dark brown trunk before pulling it back downwards. Quite quickly the entire tree itself would begin falling - the child's own direction of the pull causing it to land innoculously away from any of the houses.

<It's getting stronger..> he thinks to himself, staring at the work he'd done.* - Thu Nov 19 23:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) turned his eyes back to Yumiko, a smirk still on his face. "Hey." he says, bringing his hand up  into a small wave. "How are you doing?"* - Thu Nov 19 23:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I'm doing alright and you? - Thu Nov 19 23:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'm alright. Feeling better. You seen Nori around? - Thu Nov 19 23:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Not lately no. - Thu Nov 19 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I haven't for a while..Still never was able to discuss the plans about chunnins. - Thu Nov 19 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Speaking of which - mind if I show you something? - Thu Nov 19 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Alright. - Thu Nov 19 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) picked himself up, walked over, moved to grab her hand, and if successful he'd go outside with her.* - Thu Nov 19 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stepped outside with Yumiko in hand, stopping just infront of the felled tree. At that point he'd let go of her hand and turn to face her. "I'm going to show you a jutsu - try your best at replicating it." After saying that he'd nod, and promptly bring his hands up interlocked against his chest. It'd be in the formation of the dragon seal, which he'd call out. "Dragon!"

Following that he'd bring his hands into the tiger seal, again each following the same up until he finished. "Tiger! Hare!" On that last one he focused chakra up into his mouth flooding the confines under the pressure of it all. During which it'd begin converting to suiton based causing his cheeks to swell under the added strain.

<Suiton: Mizurappa!> His hand breaks off from the two and presses against his mouth making a hole with index and thumb to spit the liquid out from. It'd be considerably better than he had it before in his previous uses. Definitely an upgrade in total striking and sustaining power. He'd keep it up for a bit before letting his chakra finally subside and the stream stop.

During which he'd turn to Yumiko and nod his head. "Suiton: Mizurappa. You convert water based chakra up into your mouth and spit out the liquid." he explains - of coruse that would probably be obvious. "How much you convert though determines the strength - and it's rather important to have it all spread out in the mixture. Too much and the water doesn't convert fast enough lowering the striking power. Take too long though and you could drown in your own jutsu."

Many coughing fits made that final bit far more true.* - Fri Nov 20 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) still knew that he had several more techniques that he still needed to work on. The next of which would end up being in strengthening his genjutsu - one of the stronger points for the child. Many people did not have a strong tolerance for it, he was beginning to realize, and using one may just be able to catch someone out.

Even moreso, however, is that if he combines Ninjutsu, like the binding chains, with it then it'd be just that much harder to break out. The combination that he had in mind was that of chains of absolution followed by a binding genjutsu. <Alright. Just like I did on Ortho earlier.> 

His eyes focused on his target, and quickly he brought his hands up to his chest rotating them each through a series of a few hand seals. This time he wasn't showcasing it to anyone - so the speed of his movements would be at their full, peak amount. In under a second they'd be finished, and his body would lower bringing his right hand hard against the dirt.

His chakra exits out from his palm and travels along the ground moving directly towards the target in question. When it reaches it suddenly pops up from out of the ground pushing dirt up from the impact. The chakra would be morphed into the semblance of iron chains - each rising up from their confines and gripping around the target.

The log, which was the target, would be wrapped fully in the bondage, and then quickly fall over from the downwards pull that the ninjutsu enacted on the object. It was strong enough that Heiwa himself would possibly never break out of it from strength alone - and that was what made it all the more powerful.

But the combination wasn't just that technique alone. If anything the chains were more of a distraction that'd keep the enemy from understanding the true nature of the assault. If they had managed to evade it, like how Ortho had done, then he'd follow it up rather quickly with the next technique.

Another series of hand seals sped out from the child, his chakra being shown and focused on this rotation to create the proper trigger. Of course, if he had anyone actually actively viewing it it would cause some actual, potentially detrimental effects, but since he hadn't it would fall inert on deaf ears.

The combination, however, did and could work rather efficiency. If they evaded his chains they'd quickly find them speeding up the moment they saw his hand seals - their minds playing that they managed to get wrapped around by them before they even realized it. And from that they'd be unable to actively move from it.

The combination worked to better hide the true nature of the technique preventing one from simply and logically applying that they stopped being able to move suddenly after viewing said hand seals. In essence - the chains and being aware of it was mostly what Heiwa had to do in order to trap them - almost as if the hand seals weren't the biggest part of the trigger involved.

The combination of those two still left him rather drained, his chakra not quite powerful enough to sustain both of them in quick succession while continuing with a fight. But with how dark it was he figured he'd get the full use out of this training session. 

The final jutsu he'd use would be that of the release technique - applying a potent reset of ones chakra to balance out and destroy any sort of chakra obstruction within an individual. In this case, doing this against an enemy genjutsu would cause it to exit ones system and rebalance their senses.

His chakra control was nothing particularly amazing, but it was potent enough easily to handle performing said jutsu. Focusing his chakra inwards he begins slowly lowering the amount that he had actively in his body, a single hand seal being used to better focus his mind to the task.

Then, the moment he hit that sweet spot, he'd suddenly surge back upwards with all of that he had remaining - losing some of the chakra inadvertently in the process, but more importantly breaking him out of any sort of genjutsu he may be under. 

He'd begin passing out shortly thereafter, though, his chakra levels dipping well into that territory.* - Fri Nov 20 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mmm. - Fri Nov 20 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) sat down beside her. The child seemed definitely in a brighter mood than he'd shown before, a slight look of determination playing on his face throughout this time. "You're doing good.~" he says, taking note of how much water she could make. It was definitely showing how much her skill in Suiton was.* - Fri Nov 20 01:51:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded a bit to himself - knowing very well how painful the technique itself could be. The added tripping was only really icing to the pain cake as far as he was concerned. 

"Getting ready for chunnins?" he asks, stepping up to her and extending a hand to help her up.* - Fri Nov 20 02:25:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) truly had not been expecting such a sudden shift of events. The fan is used to knock her back - the sudden burst of energy more than catching both her and him off guard. <When did he..> the thought of how far the mizukage came from what he was before passed by his mind, but quickly seeing Yumiko in possible trouble the child would move out and grab onto her - bracing the impact and the recoil of such an action to prevent her from hitting the far less forgiving ground - the force of the attack sending him still skidding off against the pavement.

Only when they had come to a stop would he let her go, making sure she could stand fully before doing so.* - Fri Nov 20 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: Be careful around that fan.. - Fri Nov 20 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) only saw the faint outlines of the fighting from as far away as he was, but it became more and more evidently clear that Yumiko was fighting a losing battle. When it finally happened and the mist was cleared it was definitely not something he was unexpecting. "Nori! Go check on her," he says, moving himself over to see how badly she was injured and see if she was even conscious at that.* - Fri Nov 20 05:33:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) follows after Yumiko.* - Fri Nov 20 07:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Oh right. I have a lot of weapons. .  - Fri Nov 20 07:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) creeps through the foliage of the forest, Heiwa's eyes keeping an observant eye around the area as they trekked through. While he wouldn't be outright intending to make noise, the occasional crinkle and crackle underfoot would be inevitable - and likely equally the case even still for Yumiko and Nori passing behind him.

Nori, likely, would be further in the back with Yumiko pulling up the middle ground. Heiwa as the leader. Of course - he'd come to a full stop the moment his eyes passed over the target - a man(?) well past his prime mysteriously in the forests in the exact place that they were told to expect him. It didn't take a genius to figure out this had to be the target. Heiwa's own right hand is raised up telling the back line to stop. 

"Are you 'Betty'?" The child calls out once he was sure those behind him were well enough aware of the danger, making sure of at least one thing before they went around and killed someone.* - Fri Nov 20 07:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) only needed to see the initial drawing up of his bow to take the man as a direct threat. Even without the string it was a clear indicator of hostility. 

"Get ready!" the child yells out to his squadmates, alerting the threat the moment the man presented it to him. When his eyes fell back onto the man he'd see the quick flash of flames appearing before them, and for the briefest moments his mind flashed back to the Yumiko's injuries. <I can't let either of them get hit by that..>

His mind set - he stands infront of where the arrow was heading, his hands quickly running through the motions of four seals. It'd be completed in a fraction of a second, his chakra surging out as the technique's name flashed through his mind. 

<Kuchiyose: Aian Meidan!> Suddenly appearing from the ground a large, white, iron maneki cat appears clamping down on the jutsu attempting to absorb the impact and prevent either the arrow flying straight through the tree, a feat not terribly difficult to do, or even further causing the entire forest to come ablaze.* - Fri Nov 20 08:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) followed the trail of the fire based attack only briefly, the sheer fact alone that it could melt through his summon leading him to be rather clear of its striking power. Getting hit by one of those could easily spell death. Standing up on the tip of his toes, he redirects his eyes back onto the man and follows the trail of movement that each of the arrows would take, another simple and quick rotation of movement appearing infront of his chest that'd send chakra through his body focused around his legs.

A plume of smoke appears where, presumably, the arrows were headed and suddenly Heiwa is gone - the child's movements circling all around the base of the trees to appear several feet (like 3 or 4 tiles away.) from the man. Despite the short time he'd known it, shunshin was already mastered by the boy and he'd experience no sense of dizziness as he broke out of it and called out to the man "HEY! I'M OVER HERE!" 

His intentions were to draw the fire away from Yumiko and Nori allowing them both to utilize his distraction. But, more than that, it'd also be circling the man making his escape that much harder to achieve.
* - Fri Nov 20 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) caught notice of Yumiko's choice of weapon, a plan immediately falling together. The Uchiha chose a position behind a tree for a reason. Whether such a thing could manage to protect his body was one thing - but the likelihood that accurate shots could land while making quick measurements of his size was another. The tree itself would be armor not just in the sense of taking damage - but also in keeping most blows glancing due to line of sight limitations.

As his arrows began firing on Yumiko - the child ran through a small set of hand seals, slamming his hand against the ground as the position changed over towards covering fire against him. But the target indeed would be set. Suddenly appearing from the ground iron chains would spawn up moving to wrap themselves around the man quickly - focusing primarily on his upper body of all things. 

They'd start wrapping around keeping mainly his arms pressed against his chest. Even if he try to ran - unless he could out pull them he'd find the chains keeping him in a position preventing very much movement. There'd be a total of four massive links of chains - each coming from a different cardinal direction.* - Fri Nov 20 08:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) only looked out as it became clear the man was subdued, taking a good deep exhale out as he heard that. But, at the same time, something stuck out. <Leera..> The name of the bandit from before. He knew her? 

The child got up, an idea in mind with what to do now with the man binded - but of course if head go boom that'd probably no longer be the case and the child would take a quick leap back covering his face from any of the debris.* - Fri Nov 20 09:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) sighed. They had intended to kill Betty, of course, but the chance for gaining knowledge about Leera and their connection was definitely one of value. This would have to be reported to the kage. 

"Tell me if you find anything," the child says, not showing much of being upset despite that not working perfectly to plan. Meanwhile, he'd take the occasional glance around at the area making sure there wasn't some sort of trap. If Kana didn't make herself revealed Heiwa likely wouldn't see her, though. Forests are dense af.* - Fri Nov 20 09:17:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: They -were- siblings. The Old man and the Young Assassin. Chain and Strike...Their combination was terrifying. - Fri Nov 20 09:33:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Makes sense..I'm sure more than just them left due to the power vacuum. Technically even we did for a short time. - Fri Nov 20 09:40:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I see. So none of the other four have shown themselves against the village? - Fri Nov 20 09:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: ...Not against. One of them sent me a letter asking for amnesty...I told him to be here in a few days...New Mission. - Fri Nov 20 09:41:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..An S rank... - Fri Nov 20 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: That's why you strike before he does. - Fri Nov 20 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I was thinking about that. - Fri Nov 20 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: That is what the training I gave you earlier was for... - Fri Nov 20 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: It was a hint... - Fri Nov 20 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: You utilized the technique, but you can't even fight in it... - Fri Nov 20 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: But for now...Good job. Time for rest. - Fri Nov 20 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) hadn't been able to take something directly from the mission, unlike Yumiko with her new weapon or the new jutsus to work on with Nori. However, Heiwa still had managed to take something from it. A measure bit of more confidence in his abilities and the usage of his techniques against an opponent. One considered at least B rank if not higher as a shinobi - the child had managed to mainly take him down.

It left him far more motivated to the continued training of his techniques. For once he was feeling strong. Capable even. <Lets work on Chains of Absolution,> he thinks to himself, turning his attention to the side focusing on a pile of rocks near to his house. It'd be sturdy enough to work for the use that he was aiming for.

<That'll do,> he brings both hands up to his chest interlocking digits between eachother. As soon as he did so they'd rotate through a set series of hand seals, chakra surging and moulding with each one that he had made. Steadily he was growing stronger with not just this jutsu, but most jutsus in general of his roster.

As a shinobi, even, he was beginning to show his true stripes of proficiency. The final hand seal is made, and slamming his palm on the ground he'd send a surge of chakra through the ground. It'd travel along the length of the ground before suddenly popping out in material form - the mass of chakra moving to grab onto the rocks.

They'd appear as a combination of four massive iron chains, and promptly it'd begin dragging it against the ground after wrapping across each of the rocks. Smirking, the child would follow up with another usage of the 'combination' as he so called it. Ninjutsu added with genjutsu for a general ultimate state of mind games with the opponent.

Another series of hand seals are crafted, his chakra being capable enough to survive an additional usage of a jutsu as he was doing so. <Genjutsu..Binding.> The name of the technique quickly flashed through his mind, and if the rocks were sentient, and actively looking at his hands, they'd be caught under the spell of his illusion.

In this case they'd purely see what Heiwa had wanted to be seen - the binding of the chains managed to wrap around them before they even realized what had happened and their minds would keep the actual effects of such a genjutsu seemingly real on thier mobility and usage of most types of techniques.

Of course, they weren't sentient, so it was an inert usage. But the insight he gained in the proper usage of the technique wasn't inert nor wasted.* - Fri Nov 20 13:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) didn't drop the technique still on the rocks, however. There was still a bit more that the child could end up doing for progress now that the rocks were properly binded. Of course, they weren't sentient so it wouldn't work regardless of the proper conditions, but a certain part of rehearsal would always make a technique at least that bit more capable, at the least.

Even if it didn't teach him how to properly break a targets will, it would teach him to better control his chakra through the usage of the technique that would do so, and primarily Heiwa didn't need help in breaking a targets well. His ability with Genjutsu was frankly fully adequate to handle near any target that came his way.

The first technique he'd work on in this case would be that of the interrogation genjutsu. It was a technique he'd began wanting to work on and make himself the moment that the idea of a prisoner that refused to talk began to circulate around Konoha. It was at that moment that he felt he could have some amount of use in the village.

Of course, that never quite panned out. The kage became an absentee, Heiwa started going his own way, and many others started to die without him ever being able to properly use this technique on a single person. It left him rusty with the technique - but also at the same time left him able to learn quite a lot from even a small bit of usage.

Placing his hands on the still binded rocks, he'd begin to slowly focus his chakra into the object pretending it to be an actual living person. The actual usage of the jutsu would be focused on playing a genjutsu that slowly corroded at the natural state of conflict that a person would possess against questions and interrogation.

It held multiple benefits over a true type of torture method. It didn't have a large capability of someone dying from the effects, nor of the injuries, and it was also that much harder for them to lie about the actual questions unless they held a strong, considerable amount of will to use against the person preventing the jutsu.

Taking his hands off of the rock after his chakra began to fade, he took a step back and began working on some jutsus he'd already been fully acquainted with. Just to remain in full ability with the remaining two that he hadn't, as well, been able to use in quite a lengthy period of time. 

<Demonic Illusion: Death Mirage Jutsu.> The name of the technique flashed through his mind as he ran his hands through the rotation of symbols, it quickly being crafted and chakra sent off to infect any that had been focusing or watching on the trigger of the genjutsu - in this case the handseals themselves that he had made.

Anyone affected would see a sudden gathering of leaves appearing around them - and then the true genjutsu would begin. They'd see their deepest, most personal fear play out before them slowly corroding at their ability to concentrate at the lowest stage. It may even end up becoming a rather large distraction for them.

But at the highest stage it'd be much farther than any of that. At that stage the person could very well begin to find reality breaking around them - the fear leading to them being forced into a frightened state unless their will truly was powerful enough to force them out of a such a point. It may even cause lasting damage after the fact.

Heiwa didn't stop after performing just that. The final one he'd work on refreshing would be that of the first genjutsu that he'd been directly taught. Focusing his chakra out into the area, he places a hand on the nearby rock marking it as the trigger for the jutsu.

Stepping past them he'd willingly trigger it on himself getting a full look at the jutsu. It'd be far, far more advanced than it was when he first used it on Niza. It'd, in fact, dwarf his previous ability with each step that the illusionary clones took. They'd appear fully life-like even as Heiwa himself knew that they were truly fake. 

But even more they contained that bit of increased speed due to all of the work that Heiwa had done  making the jutsu ultimately a strong distraction and at the same time making it that much easier for him, if her were to use it, to avoid the targets infront of him by creating more and more copies to tank their attacks for him.

Of course, after that usage he'd break himself out of the technique, a simple rebalancing of his chakra forcing the infectious nature of his own out of his mind. * - Fri Nov 20 14:24:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Not yet no. - Fri Nov 20 14:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mizurappa I've finally gotten it down. - Fri Nov 20 14:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Have you? That's good..I guess we've both been busy over the last few days. - Fri Nov 20 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) turned, facing the ground infront of him. Both hands would promptly be brought up to his chest rotating through a set of hand seals. While doing so he'd focus chakra around his body, mainly in his lungs which would quickly turn into a deep, powerful katon version. <Fire Style: Fireball jutsu!> he thinks to himself, before bringing his hands up to spit out the combination directly infront of him.* - Fri Nov 20 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) moved to try that again, another quick series of hand seals being completed as he focused the swirling katon chakra into the pit of his lungs. The name would flash by his mind, and with a fluid motion he brings his hand up to his mouth making a hole with index and thumb through which to spit the large ball of flames directly out.* - Fri Nov 20 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took a breath in, realizing shortly thereafter of how much he really did not know of the element. He'd decide to work on multiple jutsus now. The next would be the one taught to him by Fujitora. Completing the hand seals he afterwards brings his hand up to his mouth spitting out a thin line of chakra exitting from his mouth in the form of katon.* - Fri Nov 20 14:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) watched as it ended, and following it very quickly thereafter the child would repeat the same set of seals focusing his chakra throughout each one he made. When it ended he'd repeat the similar stance powerfully releasing the pent up energy he had accumulated so as to spit out in the following direction.* - Fri Nov 20 14:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) was steadily growing drained, but there was one last technique he would do to improve his focus on katon. Bringing his hand up he focuses a small amount of energy into the palm of his hand forcing a sudden spark to form. From that he'd generate enough heat to flash the rest of the chakra into a small ball which he launched outwards.* - Fri Nov 20 14:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) moved both hands up to his chest, aiming to continue again in some aspect of his training. A total few hand seals would be crafted in relative quick succession, his katon chakra expanding out from his body and focusing up into the point of his lungs primarily. <Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu.>

Index and thumb are brought up to press against his mouth as he took in a deep breath from his nose and exhaled it hard out infront of him. It'd create into a rather large ball of fire that'd continue growing before finally launching out into the destination intended. It takes long to perform - but it'd give Heiwa some of the best possibility to improve his training.

Lowering his hands back quickly, he sorts through another set of symbols - totalling at a number of four by the time it finished. His chakra surges out. The ground rumbles, and suddenly popping out from just infront of the fireball would be a large, iron maneki cat split directly down the middle as it emerged.

The fireball would connect into the inside of it - and firmly the maneki cat clamps around it securely imprisoning the fireball within it. There'd be no sense of it being burned or melted through - neither from the damage it had received earlier or the latest addition of damage that he just added to it. <That jutsu must have been powerful to tear through that defense,>  he thinks to himself, taking a few breaths to calm himself.

He'd wait until he was sure that the heat had been dispersed before opening the confines seeing that nothing had remained within. He'd bring his hands together and fully undo the technique allowing the summoning to return awya from this area.* - Fri Nov 20 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) enters into the office, taking a seat infront of the desk. "You called for me?"* - Sat Nov 21 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) paused at the question, Heiwa's brow furrowing on hearing it. <What's all this about?> he'd think to himself, before looking back up at Liu seeing the serious intensity within his eyes. 

"What's this about? Are you afraid that I'd rogue?" he asks, by now already having been informed of the people who had done so already.* - Sat Nov 21 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..No. As long as it remains as it is I wouldn't leave the village or stop fighting in its name in some aspect. - Sat Nov 21 00:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) blinked, reaching out slowly to grab the badge as it was given to him. A look of surprise would overtake Heiwa as he lightly turned over the badge in his hands several times. 

"Captain..of the rear guard?" he asks, his question more rhetorical than anything. "I don't know what to say.." there weren't many times where Heiwa was genuinely this surprised at something going on. "How..How many Genjutsu and Fuuinjutsu users do we have available?"* - Sat Nov 21 00:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Are you sure they'd even listen to me? - Sat Nov 21 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ... - Sat Nov 21 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Fine..just don't make Nori or Yumiko have to take it. - Sat Nov 21 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Why would I? - Sat Nov 21 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: They aren't ready. - Sat Nov 21 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Alright. When will the caravan be here? - Sat Nov 21 00:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Ill be going with you so we'll leave when I get word from Hassan. - Sat Nov 21 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Fine. - Sat Nov 21 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mind if I get ready? - Sat Nov 21 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Aye. Go ahead. - Sat Nov 21 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) knew that he'd be called out in the next few days to head to the chunnins. He'd be going in practically alone to the event - perhaps others, like Kana, may join but none of his close comrades would be there. But, at the same time, that left Heiwa with a certain level of relief to hear and know about.

He wouldn't have to worry about Nori like he did during the fight versus Betty, and he wouldn't be forced to see the after effects like he was made to do versus Leera. Both of them not being involved would only mean they were that much safer, he felt, and that bit of knowledge relieved him more than anything else.

Of course, he'd still need to work himself to be ready for the chunnins. Slacking would only lead to his failure, which, as he knew, could also lead to his death. It'd hurt overwhelmingly so to do so, but he'd train as much as he could in this last bit of time to make sure that he was ready for whatever would present itself in those fights.

To start with - he brought his hands up into a series of seals, his chakra growing out into an expansive force with each one that he made. It wasn't an overwhelming amount - his chakra wasn't potent enough for that, but it would be enough at the very least for the use of the jutsu he was planning to use right now.

On the final seal another surge exits him causing the chakra he had readied to activate in the form it was currently at. 

The ground would begin to rumble ever so much, but Heiwa stood as calmly as he could waiting for the shaking to come to a final stop. Indeed it would the moment that the technique fully had finished - a large iron maneki cat appearing from beneath the ground infront of Heiwa, easily dwarfing the child in its overall size.

It would appear split down the middle, grabbing at anything that had happened to be in its way before closing fully and securely. But the technique would stop instead of finishing its final goal - that of going under the ground after appearing trapping whatever had been caught deep under the ground to slowly suffocate or be forced into other difficulties of leaving.

In this case, however, it'd stay out of the ground waiting for Heiwa to disperse it. There was a fair bit of control the child had over what it did - and this was indeed his intentions. The first part of his training involved not only learning to better control the chakra of the technique, but also further see how much punishment the metal could take before breaking.

Knowing, of course, from the fight with Betty that it indeed could be melted and pierced through. In this case, it'd be seeing just how much abuse it could take from one of Heiwa's jutsus. But, again, before doing that he'd check on one final possibility that existed that he still wanted to explore a bit more as well.

Bringing his hands up again, he would seem relatively far more okay with handling the drains of the techniques he was using. Far more than when he started as a shinobi - his control of his chakra as well as his overall chakra capacity were increasing to levels far beyond what the child previously had been able to show.

But along with that so too did his skill in ninjutsu increase. Two hand seals are made in a short period of time, the movement passing by in a quick, near blurring rotation of hands. When it had finished his hands would be raised up to his mouth creating a hole with index and thumb to spit out what he was making.

This time it wouldn't be pure water like used with the Raging Waves technique. It'd be a certain special combination that he'd learned from a close teacher of her. A thick and viscous liquid forming up in his mouth it swelled up his cheeks slightly before he took in a breath and spat it all out infront of him.

The target for the liquid would be the maneki cat he just finished summoning. It'd connect onto it quite easily, a light sheen of the liquid pooling up around various points as it dripped downwards. But unlike pure water, it'd be sticky and able to remain a good deal still on the cat even after the gravity began pulling it to the ground.

He'd continue this spray until much of the cat remained coated in the stuff. From front to back it'd appear greasy with a pool of the sticky stuff beginning to form on the ground near to it. Taking a deep exhale, he releases much of the tension that the technique had impacted on him, before returning his gaze onto the form of the cat before him.

With it as his target, he ran through another series of hand seals, his chakra straining and tiring him as he pushed more and more out of his body. It'd be at some levels torture training - pushing his limits as far as he could before passing out from the pain and overall tiredness the techniques pushed on him.

This next technique he was working on would be different. It'd be a katon jutsu - and briefly as he formed it his mind would pass onto Fujitora, remembering the man that had taught him the jutsu. While in Suna he may very well take a brief break to see him once more at the very least to explain where he was now.

But quickly his mind snapped back to reality, and the nature of the jutsu he was forming. It drained a considerable amount - something Heiwa was beginning to dread as he formed it all up into his mouth, swelling it lightly underneath the strain of the growing levels of flames within his insides.

Unlike the fireball jutsu, which had a series of different possibilities it could be morphed into, this one would have only a long string of flames exitting out from it - a large degree of chakra being kept on not only keeping the size of it fully - but also the overall power that it would seem to possess.

Even if his skill with katon was minimal, his skill with ninjutsu in general had made it relatively capable of being used as a weak type of jutsu. His intentions were to see not only how much the syrup trap could handle, but also whether the iron maiden could withstand the drain as well.

On impact with the heat the water would bubble and lightly boil - but wouldn't overall lose much of its effectiveness. Especially with his still weak capacity in Katon ninjutsu. Due to this not much heat managed to trade off into the iron maiden making the final point of his attempt overall rather unsatisfactory in its completion.

However, he'd keep up the flames for as long as he could spitting the flames out in a long stream until finally his chakra could take no more and he fell to his knees. The cat would disperse into a plume of smoke as Heiwa remained on the ground huffing and puffing to catch back at his breath.

But he simply had used too much energy. His eyes begin closing and the child passes out along the ground sleeping against the floor.* - Sat Nov 21 01:39:24 2015
