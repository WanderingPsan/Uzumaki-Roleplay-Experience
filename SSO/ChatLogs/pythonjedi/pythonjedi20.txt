<br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) woke up a few hours after passing out. He'd return to his house, get something to eat, rest for a bit, go to the bathroom, and then return back outside after he was finished with everything. He hadn't seen Nori nor Yumiko around the place, but in some aspect he thought that was ultimately for the greater.

If he didn't see them he wouldn't have to worry about explaining what he was doing. He wouldn't have to tell them why he was now going to finish the chunnins. The thought of them getting hurt..was enough for him to keep up this general lie in the name of keeping them safe from harm. The chunnins weren't a good place for them.

Heiwa himself hadn't even felt he was ready to join the chunnin exams, but he felt far more confident in himself than he did in the idea of Yumiko or Nori handling it. At the very least he felt that he had a chance - even moreso if he continued in this level of training which he definitely was still motivated to work on. 

The next bit of jutsu he'd practice would be involving making his genjutsus just that level of more potent required for use. Namely one of the first genjutsus he ever learned fully on his own - that of the illusionary descending fire jutsu - one that he'd even managed to convince Mizumi of so strongly to stop him from killing Heiwa.

To better use it Heiwa needed to know just how flames truly felt - in full and unadulterated detail. Of course, the child had a good understanding already. His genjutsu was potent and could cause quite a bit of traumatic mental damage if all things went according to plan.

However, there was still more that could be done to make it just that bit of more realistic. And for that he'd begin getting more adjusted to how fire felt. It'd hurt - but he wouldn't go as far as to get serious burns or wounds. And the minor ones he'd get he'd ask of Nori to heal at a later time so as to not be inconvenienced in the upcoming fights.

The first he decided to use was Exploding Flame Shot - his hand being held out firmly infront of his body, the child taking a stance-like position with his right leg being held in the back behind his left. It wasn't necessarily required to use the jutsu, but it made it easier if you could remain in this stance.

Slowly he'd begin to well katon chakra up within his body, focusing and forming it to begin slowly forming within his hand. A small spark of energy appears - and suddenly from that flash a growing level of more energy becomes ignited and fueled to burn within his finger tips. It'd swell into a full form of a soft-ball sized sphere, glowing hot within his fingers.

Yet, surprisingly, it wouldn't hurt too terribly within his hands. The chakra coating allowed him to hold it for a while so long as he kept flowing chakra into it. But that would change once it was released. Taking a deep breath in, he focuses on something else for a few seconds as he throws the ball upwards into the air.

It crashes onto Heiwa, spreading out and hitting him hard from the impact. It'd send him back to the ground - and immediately the fires of the flames would hit his mind in how they felt. Again - not too far off from his own measurement, but the faintest of details that he got wrong he could still make out as he rolled on the ground putting out the flames.

When they had sufficiently been put out, he'd breathe a sigh of relief, pulling himself back up to his feet carrying the knowledge that he'd gathered fully with him.

<Okay..so maybe if I..maybe I should try another jutsu..> The child deliberates on his next action, but seeing as his tank was still relatively full he'd move to capitalize on how much more he could add. Bringing his hands up to his chest, he ran through another quick series of hand seals ending at around six or seven total crafted.

His chakra within his body would begin to well up and surge, turning into a vile, potent form within his body as it quickly turned into the mixture of katon chakra. He'd take in a deep breath, and flood his lungs with air allowing for the chakra to take spark and travel up fast into his windpipe and up his mouth.

Without taking a break - he raises a hand up to his mouth making a hole with index and thumb before spitting out very quickly the entire mixture into a large ball of pure fire. It'd surge and form until it took on the full large form that it'd stop with - being possessed of a full power and size.

<Fire style: Fireball jutsu.> The thought of the technique passes by his mind as he lets it go - fully allowing the flames to shoot forward. However, Heiwa wouldn't just let it pass him by. Taking a quick couple running steps forward he moves towards the flames - making sure to stay away from the pure impact of it all - and just deal with the closeness of being so near to it.

It'd hurt. A lot. He wanted to push away - but he'd keep himself near absorbing all of the information he could. When it had passed his face would be somewhat burned, reddened from the heat and remaining sore. It'd be healable with time or a medic. Heiwa knew this, and was okay with the fact of the pain. 

Just so long as he took information from it. 

And indeed he had. Bringing his hands up to his chest he runs through another set of hand seals, using the information he had gathered to his benefit in crafting the final and last jutsu he needed to use. In this case it'd be the genjutsu of descending flames, the target or whomever had decided to watch the hand seals being quickly afflicted by it.

The sky would darken as a shadow appeared under the ground - an overly large ball of flames suddenly beginning to shift and form directly overhead. It'd start off small, but very quickly it'd pulse out into its full size allowing all near and watching to quickly see the brilliance of the technique and how very large it was.

And, indeed, more than just sight they'd even feel the technique as it grew - and with a flick of his wrist it'd go even further and begin descending upon the enemy with each step of it as it neared bringing the flames that much more against their body. 

It'd go even as far as to fully engulf the opponent if they remained iwthin the area - the fires kissing their flesh as it danced across their bodies leaving them with the imagination that they were, indeed, suffering third or even fourth degree burns as they remained within the overall area of the effect.

Of course, it was just an illusion and no one would be impacted. But Heiwa, in his mind, would be able to recreate the sensations and know, indeed, just how potent they could be. He was feeling ready.* - Sat Nov 21 02:13:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) eyes quickly turned to Ortho as he arrived. There'd be the ever so occasional glance towards both the Raikage, Ortho, and then Hatsujin. It seemed like a trap - and at this point the child was unsure whether they were set into it by the Raikage or if it was the new comer that had decided to bring him along.

Either way it was trouble, and at this point Heiwa was growing fine with assuming it was both of them. "Why are you here, Ortho?!" Very quickly he'd seem to be growing upset at all of this. Paranoid even - if he wasn't already. "Is he with you?!" he asks, throwing accusations at both Hatsujin and Eiyu.* - Sat Nov 21 05:45:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Which will most likely happen once Hassan. - Sat Nov 21 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: HE ATTACKED US FOUR NEARLY FIVE TIMES! - Sat Nov 21 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Did he do so without reason? - Sat Nov 21 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Is this tale truly one sided? - Sat Nov 21 05:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: So you think it's perfectly fine to kill civilians when you're upset at a shinobi? - Sat Nov 21 05:49:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That is Ortho. - Sat Nov 21 05:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: No. - Sat Nov 21 05:49:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: This situation must be dealt with. No fights are happening in my village. - Sat Nov 21 05:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Eat a carrot. - Sat Nov 21 05:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) quickly brings his hands up - a single seal being made in the form of the tiger - the speed of his movements happening very quickly near moving at his full level of fluidity. Less than a quarter second had passed and it'd be made - his chakra quickly flushing out of his body to affect the area immediately around him. He was more than upset - driven to anger from Eiyu and now seeing Ortho was driving him over the edge.

He'd finish this fight as quickly as it'd begin. Small feathers appear falling from the sky - a single glance at the white falling flakes causing an immense and very quick level of chakra to enter the persons body. They'd begin growing tired - and with Ortho already yawning it'd be just that bit more realistic. In only a few seconds anyone caught looking at them would begin passing out into a deep sleep. Including any of his comrades.

And the fact of not looking at them would be measurably more difficult than anything - considering how abundant and large the area was. It only took a single glance. Indeed, if other shinobis from farther away looked on the scene they'd also see a similar effect of passing out.* - Sat Nov 21 05:55:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) 's eyes remained fixed on Ortho, the mere sight alone of doujutsu making it plain and clear that his genjutsu would not work. He remembered how easily he was able to dispel it previously - and moreso Hideki had told him enough about it to note it wouldn't simply work. But it'd at least knock out most in the area giving him time for that strike.

If there was one person Heiwa was beginning to hate it was Ortho - with most of his feeling and self. But not just Ortho as he was, but the idea of Ortho and what he does. Attacking villages and killing innocents all in the name of revenge against another. Heiwa wasn't intent on doing that. No, no. Heiwa was planning to end the fight just now without involving the military or any of the others any more than he needed to.

The moment Ortho's hand seals would begin Heiwa's would follow in unison - aiming to stop anything he'd unleash before it managed to be let out. <Kuchiyose! Aien Meidan!> His hand seals finished before Ortho's - less being needed between two of the same speed. The ground rumbles and suddenly appearing beneath Ortho would be a giant iron maneki cat.

It'd appear underneath very quickly and aim to swallow up several degrees in the air trying to capture Ortho and whatever jutsu he was unleashing back inside. * - Sat Nov 21 06:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) would stop considering troops are now suddenly OP whenever Heiwa decides to attack. Darn. However, Ortho would still have to deal with the Maneki cat because time delays and all - his jutsu would be off before the warning was offered.* - Sat Nov 21 06:46:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) already said he had stopped. Even if Heiwa was a skilled shinobi - with multiple of them there he wasn't going to fight off all of them. Nigga was six he ain't gonna fight soldiers in hand to hand. He'd be taken and presumably also possibly cuffed.* - Sat Nov 21 07:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Zzzzzzzzz. - Sat Nov 21 07:37:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) helps Yumiko in dragging Nori out. Heiwa had calmed down after the incident. Even moreso because Ortho was gone.* - Sat Nov 21 08:15:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) generally would have been brooding ever since the failure. He felt like a failure. He'd move over to the house with his head low.* - Sat Nov 21 08:23:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) moved over to the pillow sitting down infront of the table. Nigga seemed all sorts of depressed.* - Sat Nov 21 09:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) glanced at the tea, of course assuming little as to what it actually contained. He'd have his own cup, relatively small making up for his small stature, and he'd take a small sip of the liquid. It..ended up leaving him a bit more soothed - likely due to the soft taste and the warmness of it all. But nothing really major happened.

When he placed the tea back down, he'd  exhale and shake his head. "I'm sorry I got you both in that. You could have died..because I tried to stop him." * - Sat Nov 21 09:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) remained feeling terrible, but didn't push her off of him. "Even now..I'm still too weak to even and try and face him," he laments, ending his statement off with a sigh. * - Sat Nov 21 12:19:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I still haven't mastered Shunshin. - Sat Nov 21 21:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) never finished the tea that night. Heiwa himself only had a small amount of it before calling it for the day. Yet for a good bit of the night and morning he felt strangely good. Far more relaxed than he'd been. While not a full blown high, the amount he drank being small enough for even a child like him to get very little of the stuff, it was still a soothing enough experience.

Noticing that Yumiko and Nori were both up, he'd greet them, visibly appearing far less like his mopey self from earlier. "Hey. What're you guys doing?"* - Sat Nov 21 21:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Thinking on which technique I should try to train first. - Sat Nov 21 21:35:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Why not Shunshin? - Sat Nov 21 22:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: That's what I am trying to master first. Then probably this diagnosis jutsu I learned. - Sat Nov 21 22:13:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: The Mizukage is too foolish to make decisions for himself, I'll explain to Ryutaro why I kicked you out and if your employer is 'Nigen' then I suggest you leave immediately. - Sat Nov 21 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: My employer. - Sat Nov 21 22:50:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) didn't pay much of a mind to answer his question, assuming it was rhetorical more than anything. 

"Guess that's all it was going to be, Nori."* - Sat Nov 21 23:02:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yeah. .  I mean, maybe if I had dead bodies of murdered people, I can find out how they died. - Sun Nov 22 00:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: If it was poison. . . Or stabbed organs or some other stuff. - Sun Nov 22 00:06:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . .Yeah. - Sun Nov 22 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded, and moved out infront of Nori as requested. Heiwa himself would be doing his best to take something from this - primarily attempting to track the movements of Nori - it was something to do at least.* - Sun Nov 22 00:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) refkexes were strong - and eyesight equally capable too of keeping minor track of the girl even as she blurred towards him. Yet he wouldn't move out of the way. Instead he remained watching, forcing himself to wait and see if Nori would manage to dodge around him.

Which she, unfortunately, did not. Just before impact he tightens his foothold on the ground and places a hand out to attempt at stopping her before she overtook him. Heiwa was, surprisingly, not that weak anymore, but as he was six there was a good chance she'd still manage to overpower him.* - Sun Nov 22 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) fell over from the impact, Nori bringing him down with her the, the girl's weight being enough to continue in keeping him pinned inadvertently. 

"Nngh..you didn't..dodge," he says, pulling his head up lightly shaking off the daze he felt. He wasn't angry at her, but the pain definitely made it seem like he was.* - Sun Nov 22 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) reached his hand out meeting hers picking himself up. "It's..fine. Oww.." Dodging was still highly preferred for Heiwa.* - Sun Nov 22 02:22:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Uhhh.... Depends on what it is. - Sun Nov 22 16:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Well what do you know? - Sun Nov 22 16:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I just know how to cook rice. . That's about it. - Sun Nov 22 16:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Just..rice.. - Sun Nov 22 16:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Guess we're heading out to the pub. You want to come, Nori? - Sun Nov 22 16:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Mhm! Sure. - Sun Nov 22 16:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright.  - Sun Nov 22 16:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) offered a hand out to Yumiko. 

"Lets go."* - Sun Nov 22 16:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Oh. ..  - Sun Nov 22 16:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: So this is where the pub is. - Sun Nov 22 16:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Sun Nov 22 16:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yeah. They've started serving to children with the market being filled with so many orphans. - Sun Nov 22 16:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yeah. You two ready to order? - Sun Nov 22 16:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmmm. . . Curry. . ! - Sun Nov 22 16:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded, and made the order of curry for Nori and decided to follow along with her suggestion by getting it for himself too. When he returned empty handed he explained "Our orders are being worked on," before sitting back down beside the table.

"So how has Shunshin been going? Run into anyone else using it?"* - Sun Nov 22 17:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The other two as in the diagnosis and..you never told me what the other scroll was. - Sun Nov 22 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: It's basically a jutsu that helps me heal at long range. It doesn't require handseals too. . Healing Pulse. - Sun Nov 22 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: It takes a lot of chakra though. - Sun Nov 22 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I see - how long of a range? - Sun Nov 22 17:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I didn't test how long. .  - Sun Nov 22 17:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: It takes alot out of me. I even passed out. - Sun Nov 22 17:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..I see. Perfecting that jutsu will be difficult then. - Sun Nov 22 17:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Well, it could be worse. Anyway, how has your training been coming along? - Sun Nov 22 19:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Getting slower. - Sun Nov 22 19:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Heiwa c'mere. - Sun Nov 22 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) responded back with a nod, the child moving around the group of Yumiko and Kokoru. As he did he'd take a quick glance of the new genin, his dark onyx eyes passing over his body as if sizing him up.

There'd be no verbal response from the child when he neared the kage, as if waiting for an instruction or order.* - Sun Nov 22 20:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) whispers: Yo, Heiwa. How much was that fine? - Sun Nov 22 20:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: ..One hundred thousand per head. With Nori, Yumiko, and I it was three hundred thousand. - Sun Nov 22 20:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) whispers: Alright. Did you guys have to pay for it? - Sun Nov 22 20:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: I paid for it. It's fine. - Sun Nov 22 20:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Like wise. - Sun Nov 22 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Well then I guess you can have the first move.~ - Sun Nov 22 20:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Kana, C'mere. - Sun Nov 22 20:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) head shifted in his direction - the relative size of the man being enough to easily catch the attention of the much smaller child. Before the weight would be pressed on him the kage would rebound back, however, and his pocket would feel considerably heavier from the transaction.

Initially he opened his mouth, as if to say something, but hearing the tone in his voice he'd decide against his protests. "Thank you, sir," were his words, the child's own eyes quickly darting back to the spar that was about to take place. 

He'd seem somewhat upset as he continued watching.* - Sun Nov 22 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) thinks: That's still quite a lot of chakra to use.  Hmmm. - Sun Nov 22 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: She's using too much chakra..Yumiko can't sustain that anymore. - Sun Nov 22 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: At this rate she has to be going for a quick finish. - Sun Nov 22 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) whispers: .....Not in the stomach dear. Too many important organs. - Sun Nov 22 21:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Nori. Heal him for me. - Sun Nov 22 21:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hello. You're leg is good now. - Sun Nov 22 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) says: Oh uh, thanks~! - Sun Nov 22 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) says: Boy, that sure was interesting. - Sun Nov 22 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Hmm...Everyone. I want you to prepare for our first inter-village tournament. The top two combatants will be promoted to the rank of chunnin. - Sun Nov 22 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Everyone is required to participate. - Sun Nov 22 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) says: Hm.... - Sun Nov 22 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) says: Neat. - Sun Nov 22 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: ....I'll join. - Sun Nov 22 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Promoted? Weren't going to  go to the chunnin exams, sir? - Sun Nov 22 22:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmm? Alright. . - Sun Nov 22 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) thinks: Already, I get to try out for the Chuunins!? Dude, i'm psyched! - Sun Nov 22 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) thinks: Or rather...I get to have a oppertunity... - Sun Nov 22 22:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) says: Uhh... - Sun Nov 22 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) says: Fine weather we are having...? - Sun Nov 22 22:08:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) says: We sell good candy. - Sun Nov 22 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) thinks: Woah...They are hot...But I have a bad feeling... - Sun Nov 22 22:24:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) thinks: Kinda' straight forward...I guess..... - Sun Nov 22 22:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Looking around. Simple. - Sun Nov 22 22:32:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) says: What-...Uh...Why would they do this? - Sun Nov 22 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Ichirou and Kida..as in the people with Sado. The people I warned the Mizukage about trusting.. - Sun Nov 22 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) thinks: I have no idea who Ichiro and Kida are but they're going to be punished. - Sun Nov 22 23:38:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..They might not be in the village anymore. - Sun Nov 22 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: ...How is he alive with all of those injuries? - Sun Nov 22 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) thinks: Because, he has hatred. - Sun Nov 22 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I'm no medic but the blood loss alone from losing your tongue should be enough to kill him. - Sun Nov 22 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) says: Lord Mizukage! Those two ladies over there want to talk with you! - Sun Nov 22 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Well..Rest unless you can still fight. - Sun Nov 22 23:46:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: Isolationists? - Sun Nov 22 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: T'is a shame, Kokoru. You were a joy to speak to. - Sun Nov 22 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Alrighty...Let me get the brackets together then we'll kick off this tournament. For the time being, there's nothing we can do about Kyubishu's attackers but be prepared to destroy them upon location. - Sun Nov 22 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) says: Ohhh! I'm excited! - Mon Nov 23 00:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Think they spaced out. - Mon Nov 23 00:07:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: I like this matchup better. - Mon Nov 23 00:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Yumiko you're up. - Mon Nov 23 00:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) thinks: Hm...This girl again... - Mon Nov 23 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Sorry I spaced out, what? - Mon Nov 23 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: It's fine Nori. You'll be up next. - Mon Nov 23 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) thinks: Yumiko is clearly going to win... - Mon Nov 23 00:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) thinks: But this new kid might have a few tricks up his sleeve. - Mon Nov 23 00:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Aye. Let round one begin! - Mon Nov 23 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Come on, Yumiko. You've got this.. - Mon Nov 23 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Does this put me against Kana? Or is there someone else I'd be fighting? - Mon Nov 23 00:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Good. ..The winner is Yumiko. Kokoru you did a good job. - Mon Nov 23 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Next fight. Heiwa, Nori. You're up next. - Mon Nov 23 01:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) says: Ah, dang it...Thank's so. - Mon Nov 23 01:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Against Nori.. - Mon Nov 23 01:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Sir, are you sure about this? If Nori is healing him up just before the match she'll be at a disadvantage. - Mon Nov 23 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: I'm sure. She'll be fiiine.  - Mon Nov 23 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Alright. Heiwa, Nori. Get in place.  - Mon Nov 23 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Huh? Oh, okay. - Mon Nov 23 01:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) looked towards Nori, his emotions being far easier to tell on his face than the child normally allowed. It was guilt - discernably he would appear bad about having to fight her like this. 

"You alright for the fight, Nori?" he asks, moving himself into position on the other side of the concrete.* - Mon Nov 23 01:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Over here. - Mon Nov 23 01:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Quickly jacket. - Mon Nov 23 01:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) gave a nod in reply, the child's mood lifting somewhat as he came to a conclusion. 

<I'll make this fair,> he thinks to himself, bringing his hands up to chest level. His left arm would be held horizontally in a fist, the knuckles pressed against the elbow side of his right. In contrast, his right would be held up vertically in a rather respectable sign of of the seal of confrontation. He'd hold it up clear and plain for her to view and see.

"I'm ready too then,"* - Mon Nov 23 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) raised his hands out of the seal, the child himself reaching for the very same thing as Nori just revealed. Strapped around his back would appear to be the sheathe of a standard tanto - but on further reveal it'd be shown for the truth of what it really was. A blunt, processed hunk of wood made in the general size and shape of such a small weapon, a type of one used by those moreso aiming for a spar attempt than anything. Both for the safety of their opponent and for themselves.

Indeed, that is also what a well practiced or observant individual could note. Holding it roughly within both of his hands, he'd keep the hilt held diagonally facing off from his solar plexus - the sword wobbling ever so slightly under its own weight. It was uncomfortable - unwieldy even to use. Yet, even still, he chose this as his weapon of choice. His right left spreads out behind him, his left leading off pointed towards the red-headed girl.

"Here I come!" he calls out once they were both ready, and promptly moves out towards her location. His speed would be relatively good. Far higher than that of the average genin, and far stronger than would be expected for someone of such a young age. He'd make up the distance between them in only a few seconds, before bringing his blade down horizontally and sending a somewhat delayed strike across to hit at her sides - mainly aiming towards the area near her hip.* - Mon Nov 23 01:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) thinks: Ah the wooden tanto. Been a while since I've seen it. - Mon Nov 23 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) pulls back as well following the impact - gaining some needed distance from the struggle. The child hadn't thought he could win in a battle of brute strength against someone older than him. And, even more, someone with better materials. As he pulled back and saw the chip in his wooden weapon it became clear it wouldn't have many more uses in a prolonged struggle. 

Somehow he'd have to avoid that blade. Keeping his eyes on Nori, he initially remained unsure of her skill with that weapon. But the occasional wobble, the level of uncomfortableness that was shown in her stance. Heiwa himself didn't have the most experience with a sword, but it'd shine bright for him to notice. <She's holding back as well..> In some sense it left him feeling better about it all as he waited for her next move.

When it came in, Heiwa would make his sudden counter attack. Shifting his weight onto his toes, the child steps inward and off to the side with surprising grace - moving past her shoulder in a move that she may very well have grown familiar with at this point. It'd utilize the full potential of his speed and reflexes - it being even greater than initially portrayed in the dash towards her. Several steps would be made in the time of many.

As he passes her by he briefly would brush shoulders with her, and then quickly twist his body back around aiming to bring the full force of the strike barreling down on her back in a hefty form of a counter - his entire body weight shifting to bring it hard against her. Even if he didn't have much skill with the blade none of that would be terribly too important with the position he endeavored to make through his movements.

And, what's more, it'd be a rather potent strike too even for someone as young as him.* - Mon Nov 23 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) 's counter narrowly missed - the sudden leap away from Nori keeping her out of the full impact of the attack. But following behind, Heiwa wouldn't be that far off - even with the short time of recoil from the inexperience of his strike. His speed was formiddable, and the fluidity of his steps great. A short turn and switch of position, and he'd already be hot on her trail.

Before the weapons would be made to leave her hand, Heiwa would already be readying a strike. Aiming to bring it hard to bare against her right shoulder, he'd send another forceful strike before, again, stepping inwards towards Nori. Catching him wasn't a very easy thing - the style that Heiwa himself was exposing being focused on quick, unrelenting strikes to wear down the opponent without being hit himself.

With the step that he took towards her, he'd twist on his feet moving out and away from her immediate line of sight while at the same time taking a quick step backwards resetting the playing field leaving her to, again, re-aim at him even if she managed to tank the blow of his strike. Hit and run tactics.* - Mon Nov 23 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Heiwa. Stop holding back. You hold back and fail to show your true ability and your men won't respect you. - Mon Nov 23 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Interesting. - Mon Nov 23 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stopped before following up with another attack - his eyes falling on the Mizukage and the orders being given to him. In some sense it had rung true. That was ultimately the reason he'd even be bothering with trying to be a chunnin. The reason he hadn't just forfeited to Nori when it had first started. <Fine. I'll make it up to Nori later,> he thought to himself, returning eyes onto the girl.

By now she'd nearly be finished with her charge - an attack reminiscent of a stab initially seeming to be shown as her attempt. Still keeping on the tips of his toes, he'd make another quick dash inwards towards her strike, the young and agile body of the child keeping himself out of harms way from her strike. His feet turn, and he remains facing her - jumping away and off to the side. While in the air his sword would be dropped allowing it to cling against the ground.

<Chains of Absolution!> Both hands are used in a quick flurry of digits, his speed being enough to craft the small amount of hand signs by the time he hit the ground - and plant his fingers against the concrete as he skidded further away from Nori. It'd leave his hands somewhat bleeding from the friction - but it'd also send his chakra directly inwards to the ground and towards Nori's location.

Suddenly, spewing out from all around her would be large metal chains rending and ripping theirselves from the concrete before moving to wrap themselves around the young girl's body. They'd be weighty and forceful in their pull - not going as far as to hurt her unless she were to struggle with all her might in order to be freed. However, the pull itself would be mighty durable.* - Mon Nov 23 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded, and the chains began unwrapping themselves around Nori before receding back into the ground. 

Following that, the child would move up to her offering the girl a hand up from the ground.* - Mon Nov 23 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Right. - Mon Nov 23 03:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Hm. - Mon Nov 23 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Engi. - Mon Nov 23 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It was a test, or at lest I believe so. - Mon Nov 23 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Aaah. - Mon Nov 23 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) blinked, eyes widening at the sudden promotion. Again he was caught well off guard from an action by his kage, but quickly he'd reply to the honor with a nod and bow of his head.

The disinterested stare he often gave was broken by a surprising sight of a smile. Not wide or overly large, but one definitely there. The pride of being recognized left him briefly basking in the glow of happiness. Relief even despite the throbbing pain in his right hand. It'd fade, however, on hearing the voices behind him and recognizing who they were.

The smile falters and lowers, defaulting back to how he normally stared as he walked over towards the Mizukage. As he took a position beside him, a faint voice could be heard like a whisper.* - Mon Nov 23 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: They're the ones mentioned. Ichiro and Kida.  - Mon Nov 23 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Daki's the name. - Mon Nov 23 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I like long walks on the beach, and beautiful women. - Mon Nov 23 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Hired out to you? - Mon Nov 23 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I was not informed of this. - Mon Nov 23 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: . ..  I wanted to stay there longer. . - Mon Nov 23 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) helped that bitch up when it became clear those two were gone. His hand would still be somewhat bleeding. 

"Nori..think you could patch me up?" he asks, showing her the scuffed up fingers.* - Mon Nov 23 04:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: And that's how you say bye bye to someone. - Mon Nov 23 04:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) thinks: Well we're done for today. I'll be back around later. - Mon Nov 23 04:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) waited freely with his hand out for it to be healed. It was an ultimately somewhat minor wound - nothing too major but if you have a medic nin with you I mean..* - Mon Nov 23 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) thinks: Does this mean I have to take the Chuunin Exams? - Mon Nov 23 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) thinks: I hope so! What an adventure! - Mon Nov 23 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) quickly the wounds on his hands close up, the faint feeling of relief reminding me of his mother. When it was finished, he'd close and open his hands for a few times feeling near to no pain. 

"Thanks, Nori," he says, nodding his head. "The both of you want to get something to eat? Celebrate the promotions?~" Uncharacteristically the child seemed higher in spirits than normal. * - Mon Nov 23 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Yes. Lets have lots of ramen, dumplings, and tea.~ - Mon Nov 23 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Well. . I am hungry. So sure. - Mon Nov 23 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) says: Have fun, you guys! - Mon Nov 23 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) extended his hand out to Nori. 

"Come on - I doubt she's going to slow down."* - Mon Nov 23 04:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Dumplings and tea.~ Mmmm.~ - Mon Nov 23 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) reached into his pocket and handed Yumiko some money. "Mind ordering?" he asks.* - Mon Nov 23 04:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) reached out grabbing a stick and bringing it to his mouth nibbling on it. 

"Wonder if we're going to be put into anything like a squad," he wonders aloud, eating the food. "Aside from what the Kage already put me into earlier.."* - Mon Nov 23 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Sort of. But more of a permanent one.. - Mon Nov 23 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Confused. - Mon Nov 23 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: So like a faction then? - Mon Nov 23 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Not really. We'd still be a part of the village..just a group together for the sake of missions. - Mon Nov 23 05:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: No I mean like. . an inter-village faction.  - Mon Nov 23 05:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. What do you think, Yumiko? - Mon Nov 23 05:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I rather us three remain together... - Mon Nov 23 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. That's what I meant by a squad.. - Mon Nov 23 05:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: But, uh, we're always..going to be together, right? In that house? - Mon Nov 23 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov 23 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov 23 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Our house, home,heaven. - Mon Nov 23 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: But then the fire nation attacked. - Mon Nov 23 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Good.~  - Mon Nov 23 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Mhm. Now....Wh- - Mon Nov 23 19:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Was that Heiwa? - Mon Nov 23 19:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm.~  - Mon Nov 23 19:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: So, we're going to Spar Yumiko. I want to see where you're lacking. - Mon Nov 23 19:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: C'mon..Show me your skill. - Mon Nov 23 19:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Alright.~ - Mon Nov 23 19:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: C'mon now Yumiko. Show me your skill. - Mon Nov 23 19:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Heiwa-kun wanna go hang out? - Mon Nov 23 20:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Sure. Where to? - Mon Nov 23 20:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hmm....the house. - Mon Nov 23 20:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright. - Mon Nov 23 20:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Do you think something big is going to happen soon regarding Kumogakure? - Mon Nov 23 20:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Hm. Like what? Between Liu and Kumo? - Mon Nov 23 20:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov 23 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) glanced over towards Nori as she entered, getting enough of a faint outline of her red hair such a quick look to know it was her. Just as fast as his eyes fell on her they'd be back off returning to his conversation with Yumiko.

"It might, but I don't think so. Ortho is allowed there - but he's not working with the Rai -" Just then the sword impacted interrupting his statement as he turned towards Nori. "Hey - that's not fair I wasn't ready." he responds, rubbing the back of his head. The child was definitely growing comfortable with both of them.* - Mon Nov 23 21:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Talking about Kumo. Wondering if the kage is planning to do anything against it.. - Mon Nov 23 21:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: It's a mystery but after what he said he might be planning something in general. - Tue Nov 24 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Who might be what, what? - Tue Nov 24 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mizukage. - Tue Nov 24 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What'd he say? - Tue Nov 24 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmmm? Yeah, what did he say? - Tue Nov 24 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Say. . Uhh.. Heiwa? - Tue Nov 24 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yeah? - Tue Nov 24 01:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Uhm. . If you don't mind. . Where did those chains come from? - Tue Nov 24 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) raised his brow somewhat. He'd honestly expected her to know more about the technique considering he used it on the regular.

"The ones from the ground, right?"* - Tue Nov 24 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yeah. . . - Tue Nov 24 02:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's a jutsu. A hiden in Kirigakure. Curious about them? - Tue Nov 24 02:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . . In a way. . Yeah. . - Tue Nov 24 02:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Chains. . . Oh god, yes. . - Tue Nov 24 02:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Might also pick that up. Seems like a useful binding jutsu. - Tue Nov 24 02:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's strong - it'll likely help you both out. The scrolls should be in the archives - but do you want me to show you instead? - Tue Nov 24 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Yes please. - Tue Nov 24 03:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Sure.~ - Tue Nov 24 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright. It's still a hiden though - only the kage and us three will know it.~ - Tue Nov 24 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Lets go outside. - Tue Nov 24 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stepped ahead of the two, stopping a fair distance away before turning back. "The jutsu is called 'Chains of Absolution,' the child explains, bringing his hands up quickly and running through a fast set of hand seals. Catching all of them in their exact formation would be difficult considering he was moving at full speed.

"Like this!" His chakra surges, and suddenly he plants his right hand against the concrete. It exits from his body travelling along the ground until it reached its target - a second or two passing before a nearby shrub was assaulted by the mass of iron chains. They'd shortly thereafter fade back into the ground following the demonstration.

"The hand seals aren't too elaborate," he continues, far more slowly showing them the number to be made. "When using the jutsu you're crafting the chains out of your chakra. Proper control and strength of ninjutsu leads to far stronger effects. And, potentially, larger chains."* - Tue Nov 24 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) heard the message and ain't want to miss them missions. He grabbed Nori's hand following the completion and ran to the academy.* - Tue Nov 24 05:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: All kids? - Tue Nov 24 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I assume they are little monsters, must be deadly. - Tue Nov 24 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) spotted that red glint around his neck.

"From Konoha?" the child asks, before further looking at what made up the man infront of him.* - Tue Nov 24 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Exactly. You ran away from Ku- It's irrelevant. - Tue Nov 24 05:29:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Working under me? What is he focused on? - Tue Nov 24 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: For now..You guys. come line up alongside me. Yumiko, you're not tired right? - Tue Nov 24 05:30:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) followed the kage's orders, moving to stand beside the man.* - Tue Nov 24 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) whispers: The individual isn't a Fuuinjutsu or Genjutsu User I'm sure, but he's on probation and you're the chuunin that I want assigned to him currently - Tue Nov 24 05:34:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) whispers: ( Why did yo usay I need to keep an eye on Nori before? ) - Tue Nov 24 05:45:36 2015
