<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What're we doing here? - Thu Oct  1 19:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) curiously stepped up closer to the bed his mother was lying in. At first the child hadn't recognized her, the view from farther away hard to see, but the sound of her voice was what gave it away. However, Heiwa was too short to see above the bed! The child steps closer trying to see more, even grabbing onto something to awkwardly peek his head up, but he simply couldn't make it past this hurdle.

Cutting his losses he turns to his father, asking "Why is mommy here?" * - Thu Oct  1 20:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: Tetsujin dies... Erebus dies... - Thu Oct  1 20:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: It's not a matter of strength. I am not a coward, and Tetsujin is afraid of me. - Thu Oct  1 20:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Believe it or not. - Thu Oct  1 20:15:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: ..Hm, or- Is Hideki still alive? - Thu Oct  1 20:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Of-course he is.. - Thu Oct  1 20:17:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: Where's Ushinawa? - Thu Oct  1 20:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: He left. - Thu Oct  1 20:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: Where? - Thu Oct  1 20:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: ..He never told me. - Thu Oct  1 20:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: Why wouldn't he? - Thu Oct  1 20:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: I have no idea. - Thu Oct  1 20:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: Mmm.. - Thu Oct  1 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: ((*Ushinawa reaches into his eye-sockets and hands Heiwa both of his eyes.) - Thu Oct  1 21:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: ("I have regular eyes in my posession that will have to be implanted. I want you to have these son.. I want you to carry on my legacy, and protect your mother should something happen to me.. Speak to Hideki about what they do."*) - Thu Oct  1 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: How are you, Heiwa? - Thu Oct  1 21:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) entered the room with his head down, one of his hands behind his back. What he was holding would initially appear as a mystery. Could it be a kunai knife? Or something else? Either way it could be taken clearly that he wasn't wanting to show it to Hideki, even fi the young kid couldn't see above the bed his uncle was laying on. 

"H-Hideki?" Both sadness and fear could be easily discerned in his trepidating voice as he neared closer to the injured man.* - Thu Oct  1 21:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) pulls himself up on the bed, briefly giving a view of what the child had had in his hands. Two round small balls with red in the center - blood covering his palm. It'd disappear from sight as the child oriented himself and again presented them out to the man. His hand would be shaking obviously as he did this. The two round balls would be two eyeballs each with the Sharingan already activated on them before being ripped out. 

"M-My dad..gave me..these. Said to..ask you about them.." Tears were equally welling up in his eyes. The kid was terrified about this all.* - Thu Oct  1 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) would, as ordered, drop the eyes into the container. Afterwards the child brought his shaking, bloody hands back to his knee listening to his uncle's story. Seeing a man like him who he had respected begin to cry was almost as bad as seeing his father do so. It made the pure gravity of the situation just hit down that much harder.

When the man finally finished tears would equally be falling down Heiwa's face as he leaned up against his uncle's shoulder. "Sh-She's..injured..dad said.." The boy had left before any news of death would have hit.  * - Thu Oct  1 21:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) moves alongside Hideki somewhat directing him to where the child remembered last seeing his mother. * - Thu Oct  1 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Where is Niza.. - Thu Oct  1 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Alright, I'll find his body then - Thu Oct  1 22:12:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hm? - Thu Oct  1 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Anyone seen Niza? - Thu Oct  1 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Why do you..need to see Niza? - Thu Oct  1 22:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I need to speak with him. - Thu Oct  1 22:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Over..dad? - Thu Oct  1 22:19:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: What happened? - Thu Oct  1 22:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: . . . . - Thu Oct  1 22:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Ushinawa died. - Thu Oct  1 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: ------------ - Thu Oct  1 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Lord Ushinawa is dead? - Thu Oct  1 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Yes.. - Thu Oct  1 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Everyone around me dies. - Thu Oct  1 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Was it Tetsujin? - Thu Oct  1 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: No idea. - Thu Oct  1 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: .... - Thu Oct  1 22:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Hanabi died...Ushinawa died...I just hope Mariana is okay.. - Thu Oct  1 22:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: ... - Thu Oct  1 22:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Anyways, where's this medic I've been hereing about? - Thu Oct  1 22:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stood back, not even getting a glimpse of most of the actions before they'd occurred. The young child was significantly out of his league with keeping up with any of this but the final inching closer of Hideki towards his father's eyes. Why was he doing something like that? Did he think those two would take them? 

The young child glanced across at Reguel, and then are Seisuke, genuinely hoping that that wasn't the case. That they wouldn't do something so horrible to his father.* - Thu Oct  1 23:15:12 2015

Of course, on getting near he'd immediately remember the obvious case of him being dead, and would look towards Hideki as his laugh happened. Everything today seemed surreal to the boy.* - Thu Oct  1 23:55:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'll be back soon. - Fri Oct  2 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) throughout his stay in his parents darkened house, the child would have spent most of his time moping in a corner, replaying the events from which he had seen. The name Tetsujin swirling around as the cause of his mother's injuries, and suddenly possibly his father's own suicide. After an amount of time he pulls himself back up and brings both hands towards his chest interlocking them in the seal of the ram. It'd be a weak formation, but a passable enough one.

Slowly his chakra starts to lower across his body, dropping into smaller and smaller amounts as he practices the technique his father had aimed to teach him. It didn't seem likely that it would aid in his predicament - the boy hadn't thought truly that he was in a genjutsu. And yet a part of him simply had intended to hope in the situation that maybe it'd all work and his father would be brought back there. 

After it had reached a certain point suddenly he'd tried to surge and spike his chakra back upwards. But it would fail. Instead all in vain he's left with the technique failing and his chakra slowly climbing back up with minor surges. Throughout it he simply hadn't had enough chakra control, or ability in the technique itself.

But that was something he'd already known. Not letting it get to him he waits until he feels his chakra to be in an even level before starting again. It'd be a very slow and gradual process, but one that he believed would have its merits. For once, at least, he was focused on something that was just his father's own suicide. 

Once more as he feels his chakra lower down to a smaller amount he quickly shoots his chakra outwards hoping for it to make a difference. And, from the last time, it does. Surprisingly his chakra spikes in two differing patterns until they reached back to the normal position he was accustomed to. It wasn't how he believed the technique to be, nor how his father described it, but it was progress to the inevitable goal. 

It was a good thing and was one thing he'd continue until he felt he could do it. Not wavering his hands from that hand seal he keeps his eyes closed while he manipulates his chakra. <More..More..like Dad said..> The fact of his father being dead still weighed heavily on him and for some time would, but slowly it was being channeled into a focus on progress of himself. After a short time he surges his chakra upwards suddenly, a powerful spike followed by another weaker one after.

And again he doesn't open his eyes nor falter his concentration. The child was going to continue this until he was done, or was forced to stop. In the end it'd end up the latter with him falling asleep from exhaustion shortly after.* - Fri Oct  2 14:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) woke up several hours after passing out, still feeling some fatigue in his body. Despite all of his efforts back there the child wasn't able to actually make the technique work. Or it had worked and this wasn't a very long genjutsu. Either way sucked. Glancing around his room his eyes spot on to a shining glimmer on a high counter. Curiosity gets him moving, the young child grabbing onto it from the side and pulling it back down.

It was something recently familiar - the shuriken and string given to him from his uncle. <Mother said not to play with it..but..> The child begins to wrap it around his fingers carefully, making sure not to touch the spikes protruding out from the sides. With his mother still in the hospital if he got injured he simply would have to deal with it.

It'd be a snug fit with the string appearing near invisible at a simple common glance. Yet around his fingers it was anything but. With this around him he could definitely feel the taut strength of the string. <Okay..now just throw and pull back don't take your eyes off.> He holds it in his hand like Hideki showed him and pulls his arm back.

In a single quick motion it's thrown out towards the other side of the room - appearing only as a black blur as it reached the ends of the string's length. <When I pull back it'll end up where my arm was.> He reels the string in with one large tug bringing it all spinning backwards. The child ducks, pulling his body out of the way narrowly avoiding the returning attack.

Afterwards it continues flying off towards the other side of the room behind Heiwa, reaches the end of its length, and then falling on the ground losing all its momentum. <Predict where it'll go..> There was a slight smile on his face as he succeeded, the pride taking his mind off of the death of his father.* - Fri Oct  2 22:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) enjoyed that. <If I spin it around to the sides could I predict-> His thought cuts off as the pains of hunger hit him, forcing all thoughts to that. With his parents both as shinobis in some respect he never had them taking care of him all the time, leading to the child being able to at least prepare food. Pulling himself up from the floor he walks over to one of the pantries. From here he takes out a box of prepared food. Ovals baked out of some cheesy compound.

It'd survive him at least until his mother returned. Grabbing a bowl as well he fixes himself a serving of 'Cheesy Ovals' to eat for breakfast.* - Fri Oct  2 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) steps over close to the wheel chaired man. Over this time Heiwa at least wasn't crying or sulking about anymore. He'd stop just a bit infront of the man, grasping at something to say before just saying it. "Is Tetsujin the reason my dad..'died'?"* - Fri Oct  2 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) lowered his head after hearing that. Strangely it wasn't what he wanted to be told.

"Alright." The child's tone was low, nearly a mumble as he said it. He'd pull back and lean against the wall before sliding down it sitting on the ground.* - Fri Oct  2 23:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hmm.. - Fri Oct  2 23:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Do you know the fireball jutsu yet? - Fri Oct  2 23:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Fireball jutsu? - Fri Oct  2 23:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Mhm. - Fri Oct  2 23:20:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Do you know.... - Fri Oct  2 23:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Mist Servant Jutsu? It's a genjutsu however. - Fri Oct  2 23:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No. Dad only tried to teach Kai..and.. - Fri Oct  2 23:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) reaches into his pocket very carefully pulling out a shuriken with a very thin string attached along the insides. 

"You showed me this.."* - Fri Oct  2 23:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Right. - Fri Oct  2 23:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hmm.. - Fri Oct  2 23:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Here...Take this. - Fri Oct  2 23:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) takes the scroll from Hideki.

"What's this?" If it were properly labeled, he didn't read it.* - Fri Oct  2 23:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Basically, when using the technique you can summon forth eerie black ninja that act as illusions. - Fri Oct  2 23:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: And once they are to be hit, they multiply. - Fri Oct  2 23:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: How many times? - Fri Oct  2 23:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: First time use. - Fri Oct  2 23:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I believe it's about two. - Fri Oct  2 23:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: But. - Fri Oct  2 23:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: If you master it. - Fri Oct  2 23:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: You can summon forth a lot more. - Fri Oct  2 23:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Did my dad ever use it? - Fri Oct  2 23:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Of course. - Fri Oct  2 23:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) pries open the scroll given to him, unraveling it to a decent length for the child's eyes as he scans across the material. There'd be a surprisingly indepth amount of knowledge to learn from it, with a minor amount detailing even into the formation of genjutsu which significantly helped the child in understanding and realizing what one was beyond the basic things his father had taught him. 

In very short time he'd close back up the scroll given to him, placing it by his feet just shortly afterwards. Whether he had actually read through so much, or if he was just quitting and taking a break it didn't seem as if the child's actons were immediately telling. 

But after a time he turns to Hideki and asks of him. "Could I try it on you?" * - Fri Oct  2 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I'd rather..Not.. - Fri Oct  2 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: However, did your father ever give you the Genjutsu Kai scroll? - Fri Oct  2 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. He did. I never read through it much. - Fri Oct  2 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I see, well when you're done with it. I'd like to read it, if you'd allow me to. - Fri Oct  2 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mhm. Okay. - Fri Oct  2 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: ...You needed to speak to me? - Fri Oct  2 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Yes. - Fri Oct  2 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: You know of, Ushinawa's eyes....Right? - Fri Oct  2 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) grabs the mist servant jutsu scroll from both ends, meticulously rolling it back up into a single roll. When that was done he places it to the side of him and pulls out another scroll. It'd appear to be of a similar make as Hideki's own, but along the front of it would be written the kanji for Kai crafted carefully. 

The child opens it and begins to read through what was within, before his eyes shot up to stare at the Raikage. Heiwa couldn't concentrate with them talking, so he closes up the scroll and lets them continue. Besides, he also wanted to hear about his father.* - Fri Oct  2 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Yes, I do. - Fri Oct  2 23:58:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) awkwardly held the head of the man, feeling the texture and look of all that there was. It felt so lifeless. It scared him from the simple fact that this was once a human before all of this. 

It was only the body being fully hoisted up further by Kuro that snapped the child out of his daze and made him move over to follow behind the man. Even still - the head was a bit heavy for the child to carry leaving him somewhat strained from doing so.* - Sat Oct  3 07:10:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stepped up to where the corpse was located, placing his body in the proper area a head would normally go. The child was kept away from most deaths that hit the village until just recently just before their own deaths. 

Stepping back from it all he'd stand beside Kuro, his eyes remaining on the deceased mercenary. History wasn't something the child had been taught very much of, but from the recent deaths, and how widespread they were, he had his own thoughts still. "I don't like how everyone is dying.." He answers in regards to Kuro's question. Marianna and Ushinawa spoke of peace when around the boy - so much so his name even meant that. It wasn't much of a shock he'd feel that way.* - Sat Oct  3 07:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) had been watching the man dig dilligently until he said that, the boy's eyes darting away to look somewhere else. "I don't know why it all happened.." he says in a low tone, sorrow beginning to surface in his voice. "I didn't want them go." Luckily he wasn't directly crying over it anymore, but it still hurt.* - Sat Oct  3 07:39:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) lowered his head through the speech. There was much the young child wasn't taught, but that much his father had done for him.

When it was done and the marker was set he'd finally interject, choosing to ask a question of the man from what he'd said. "Do you really think there was a peaceful ending? He looked like he was going to kill everyone there.."* - Sat Oct  3 08:02:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: What use would taking another's life have? It'll only weigh on your conscious, and you'll be continuing this endless chain of death and conflict. - Sat Oct  3 08:20:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) shook his head and turned away. "At least then my friends would be alive - it's their fault for attacking," after saying that the child would move to walk away.* - Sat Oct  3 08:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) pulls out the scroll given to him by his Uncle Hideki. <If I don't get stronger..> The recent talk with Kuro brought some things into perspective for the boy. He needed to get stronger. To protect those that he loved. To protect Hideki now that his mother was gone. Just like his father told him.

Quickly opening the scroll he scans across the material - reading through the information left behind by his father for the use of the Kai jutsu. In essence it was a jutsu based around manipulating the effect that a genjutsu places onto you - by focusing on the chakra nervous system the genjutsu is susceptible to being refreshed and purged through a proper reset and surge of the user's chakra.

Of all things it wasn't the most advanced topic or idea, but it did note that it required fast timing and quick ability with it making chakra control and even general mastery over the jutsu tiself to be a mandatory.

After a short while the kid finishes reading through for the first time, taking the information on the methods to heart. For once, he felt, he had actually gotten this thing down.* - Sat Oct  3 10:42:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) presses his hand against the wood of the abandoned house, his mind racing with details of what the scroll had entailed. The child's chakra would begin surging and exitting his body, appearing on the entrance to the area marking it faintly with his chakra in a form of a trap utilizing the Mist Servant genjutsu he was taught to use by his uncle. 

This, of course, was his first time properly attempting it beyond just himself. Once he felt it was adequately prepared, the child steps away running back to find the Raikage.* - Sat Oct  3 23:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) comes running back in at the unreasonably slow speed that the child always had. "Mister Raikage, I'm ready!"* - Sat Oct  3 23:12:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Can we go? - Sat Oct  3 23:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Yes. - Sat Oct  3 23:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stops just outside of an ordinarily abandoned house. His hand waves motioning for the kage to enter. "Go in!" The child seemed to be growing a bit excited at the opportunity.* - Sat Oct  3 23:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) || The house would be inherently dark at the moment. Being abandoned it had no artificial light, and to make matters worse it'd be also night time which limited most visibility in the area. But what could be seen would be the two beds, in which two shadowy, black figments emerged from out of to slowly creep towards the Raikage. In the environment they appeared in they'd naturally blend in making a natural, quick observer likely only see a figment or an outline of something happening as they creeped closer to the man.* - Sat Oct  3 23:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded his head, thinking quickly on his feet. "Yeah - Hideki was helping me use a string to manipulate a shuriken, so I wanted to set up a shuriken trap for him. Did it work?" He lies straight through his teeth, hoping that would make the entire situation seem more serious for the Raikage. By now the figments would have stepped close enough to be more visible - each having a size comparable to a small child. However, in their hands they both also seemed to hold an edge appearing reminiscent of a kunai with their arms pulled back in a drawing position to throw.* - Sat Oct  3 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) || Both weapons are thrown at where the Raikage originally was as opposed to where he landed, failing immediately to hit the mark. Seeing this their heads turn to face where Niza currently was, one of the two, the one spawned from the right-most bed draws out another small, sharpened edge aiming to throw it towards the leader. The other moves further towards him, hopefully using the darkness to its advantage in making it harder to see. At this range if it was properly seen it'd definitely appear to look like a ghostly version of Heiwa - much of his body turned into a deep, shadowy black. If it properly reached the Raikage this figment would throw a very slow, and wide angled punch to the area directly infront of it - the kage's dick.* - Sat Oct  3 23:57:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) || The close up, ghostly visage of Heiwa strikes only a log, the attack itself going straight through as if the creature were made of air. It'd turn around shortly after, finding the kage within the darkness and begin moving towards him. Of course, it was slower than Heiwa, and Heiwa has 0 speed stat, so it'd probably take a while to get there.

Meanwhile, the other figment, who was closer to Niza, moves in for a charge, throwing another overly wide punch straight towards the kage. The real Heiwa during this would be simply watching, trying to analyze all he could from the situation. 

What Hideki would probably see is Niza being in a genjutsu, the house being super dark, and Heiwa peeking his head in.* - Sun Oct  4 00:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) || On impact the clone itself would seem to physically hit, its arm stopping on hitting against his flesh as if it were real and even the sound of the impact would play out - but it wouldn't be felt. Physically there'd be no damage, but the figment itself would reel back as if it were a hard hitting stunner punch. During this time the one that had dealt with the kawarimi would be pulling its arm back, seemingly preparing another kunai to be used against him - the sharp looking mass speeding towards Niza's skull with surprisingly acceptable speed for a young child.* - Sun Oct  4 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) || The kunai whizzes past Niza - not making a cut but surely making a sound as if it had made small grazing one. Once his chakra was refreshed though the illusions would simply disappear from sight, no longer affecting the man in any way, shape, or form. * - Sun Oct  4 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) briefly smiled on hearing that. "Did you like it?" he asks enjoying the attention from his work.* - Sun Oct  4 01:09:32 2015
