<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) likely would be just waking up, his head previously laying on Lyala held up close to her. With his height he couldn't even really see onto the bed to see who it was, but he had heard the door slide open and the man's own question. 

"I'm..Heiwa. " the child says in a groggy state, rubbing the tiredness from his eyes. * - Fri Oct  9 18:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) blinked, turning his head somewhat as mention of his father got him to wake up further. "You knew my dad?" the child asks, pushing off the ground with his hands after untangling from Lyala.* - Fri Oct  9 18:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Who are you, exactly? - Fri Oct  9 18:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) brought his head down, eyes showing him in thought. Ushinawa had never mentioned a man like this. After a time the child opened his mouth, as if to say something, but Lyala chimed in with similar sentiments he was going to ask leading the child to add onto her question with a nod of his own.* - Fri Oct  9 18:50:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stepped backwards, moving in closer to Lyala the moment the clones had appeared. "I don't want Lyala to go.." the child says, shaking his head.* - Fri Oct  9 19:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: See now you don't even have Hideki...Come with me. -omit- - Fri Oct  9 19:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) was pushed towards the bed suddenly, catching himself on all fours just infront of the bed post. The attacks themselves wouldn't be seen by him, but the concussive force of Lyala being sent back would easily be known. <Miss Lyala!> He pushes himself up, the young child gritting his teeth with anger shown in his eyes. 

His focus would fall onto the masked individual, and without much of a delay the young boy moves his hands interlocked infront of his chest crafting a series of five hand seals. * - Fri Oct  9 19:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) expanded his chakra out on the final seal,  the entire room growing hotter to all of those that had managed to view his hand seals. It'd be as if a flame technique were growing ever so closer to the area - and, in fact, if someone were to look outside of the window they could view this very fact - what would appear to be a giant ball of flames having expanded rapidly seemingly to engulf the area in its destruction. 

Of course, Heiwa's own reflex game was weak, and shortly after making these seals he would be crashed into by the water, being sent back towards the drawer and passing out immediately. However, the flames wouldn't stop themselves - instead seeming ready to fully engulf the area in just a few seconds - and the heat would feel just as real to anyone who had viewed it.* - Fri Oct  9 19:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) 's optics fluttered open, the dim of the afternoon sun casting a shadow over the room. As his just waking eyes passed over the area, the young child stopped and pressed his hand against his head. A sudden wave of pain shot over him originating mainly in his stomach. It felt as if he'd been toppled by a football player. <What..happened?> Brief flashes of the event just prior crossed over his mind immediately bringing him up to speed. Some man in a mask was aiming to take him.

Again the child took a quick look at the area - it was exactly as when he'd left. He hadn't been taken. Heiwa leaned back with a smile spreading across his face - when he notices something in his periphery. "M-Miss Lyala?" He calls out to the woman, turning his head to see her. "Are you awake?" 

No answer. 

His smile dropped. "Lyala?" Tears began to well up in his eyes as he suspected the truth. Forcing himself on all fours, the child bears through the pain moving fully over to the silhouette of the woman seeing up close and personal her state. "N-No..No.." He stops just infront of her, quickly scanning at the injuries. Tears stream down his face, the young child shaking his head denying what he was seeing. "No! You said you wouldn't leave me!" First his father, then his mother, the leader of the village, the person who had been entrusted to carry his father's will, and now finally Lyala.

Everyone he loved was dying and there was nothing he could do to stop it. * - Fri Oct  9 20:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) turned his head back in the direction of Nina, briefly registering her as being there before returning back on the recently deceased woman. It all ran back to that man having done this. To that man having killed her. Hate began to flash in his eyes as he realized this. All because he had wanted to take him away. The woman who had treated him like a son was murdered all for that reason. 

The child eventually broke down and fell against her, sobbing against her lifeless body. * - Fri Oct  9 21:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) struggled against her grip, the lack of upper body strength, as well as the age difference between the child and Nina, making his efforts all in vain. "Let me go! I'm not leaving Lyala!" His struggles pick up again as he yells that, before quieting down once more, being generally very easy to drag away. 

"One of us..has to keep their promise.."* - Fri Oct  9 21:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) || Apparently around this point a bird would pass by dropping a message in a bottle by the door. Or some shit. * - Fri Oct  9 21:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) felt the slap connect and pointed those hateful eyes directly at her, glaring up at the older girl. * - Fri Oct  9 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) would be dragged away, the boy pouting the entire time. It was clear by now in his weakened state he couldn't break out of her hold.

"Where are you taking me! Let me go!"* - Fri Oct  9 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I'm taking you to your uncle, now shut up! - Fri Oct  9 21:57:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) would appear to be forcibly grabbed by Nina. By now his struggles had ended and he'd be simply staring at Misa while Nina was taking him away, his face still somewhat wet with tears.* - Fri Oct  9 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Yeah, with your nephew. - Fri Oct  9 22:13:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) 's eyes followed the weapon, seeing it finally be resheathed. If only Nina had directly told him what the note she had read. "Lyala is dead..Nina was taking me to see Hideki.." By now he was, at least, given some time to think and knew that his Uncle would need to know.* - Fri Oct  9 22:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Fine with me. Fine with you, Heiwa? - Fri Oct  9 22:33:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) held that paper tightly in his hand, focusing his chakra in through it to cause the desired effects. Suddenly it'd burst into flames, prompting for the child to let it go and fall to the floor. Having already done this he knew what would happen. It'd appear to be just the fire element for the boy, but if someone were watching observantly they could note that it wasn't smoke rising up from the paper, but instead steam. 

And smoke. More of a mixture.* - Fri Oct  9 23:41:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) lowered his head somewhat, seeing how the woman was standing on the water. <So that's chakra that does that..> All things considered it was a good and handy skill to learn, and the child hadn't thought it would be too difficult. In comparison to some of the techniques he had already been taught, after all, this shouldn't be that far above himself.

Closing his eyes and bringing his hands up infront of his chest he'd focus in on his chakra, sending a steady stream to coat around the bottom of his foot. Then, following the lesson, he'd move to place his foot tentatively on the water and see if it'd stick. Briefly it would seem to do so - before suddenly shooting out sending a splash of water back up to him and forcing him to fall back. "Wah!" He exclaims out, barely avoiding the water from soaking him as he was pushed back landing on his butt. 

He sits back for a moment, catching himself and giving a quick thought on what happened. <So..too much chakra causes a problem..> The child had the mind of a scholar, and quickly picked up on what his mistake obviously had to be, his immense intellect aiding him majorly in problem solving. <If that was too much then..> Without even looking back for help he brings his hands up and channels another steady stream into his feet, focusing far less than he had before this time.

Then, standing up, he approaches the water holding his feet out briefly to see how it'd react. It didn't push him back this time, but from his overall hesitation he could note that it, also, wasn't sticking. If he put more pressure on it he'd just fall right in. And so, again, he pulled his foot back, focused his chakra into a slightly higher variation, and stuck himself on it once more.

That foot managed to remain atop the currents, his chakra mildly fluctuating as he kept it there, the waves making it harder but not impossible. The child puts his weight on that foot and does the same for the next foot, attempting to plant it on as well. He nearly falls through, but briefly manages to save himself and find stable enough footing shortly afterwards for some, altogether, relatively quick picking up on how to use this technique.* - Sat Oct 10 01:19:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) trailed their eyes elsewhere, not looking directly at her. "I came here after the village was destroyed." Over the last few months the average tone of the child would shift from his normal timid to now what would seem as cold indifference. He'd seem ready to add something on that last statement - before Nozumi stepped up and stopped him interjecting with his own addition.

Heiwa closed his mouth stopping his statement, and nodded in agreement.* - Sat Oct 10 07:12:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) whispers: The things I'm going to do) - Sat Oct 10 07:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) shifted his eyes around the broken remains of the once powerful village, seeing firsthand the destruction this beast would have caused. It was, all in all, similar to the sights he'd been seeing over the last week of traveling with seemingly every village having been hit by some sort of calamity. Just seeing it all made him upset, even if he did his best not to show it.

When Nozumi spoke he'd grab the child's attention his head turning back. "Yes?" He noticed Nozumi's tears. His eyes lowered back and away from him, so as to not have a constant reminder. This world was terrible.* - Sat Oct 10 08:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: When I look at you... - Sat Oct 10 08:15:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: That fire.... - Sat Oct 10 08:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) felt his face scrunch up as the man continued. The scars of what he saw in Kumo before leaving was still fresh in his mind. And the masked visage of the man responsible for it all. Emotions started to show through, even if he was able to battle back the tears. 

Tightly he'd clench onto the book, relieving some of his frustration as he read the index getting the slightest of feels for what it would say. What the village he may be forced to remain in now would be all about. 

But reading it all was for another time. After accepting the booklet he pulls it into his own backpouch before focusing back on to the still continuing Nozumi. One of the things he said got him mildly curious. "You knew my parents?" he asks - not seemingly fully surprised for the question, even if it was peculiar. As time went on he found that most people had met them before.* - Sat Oct 10 08:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) this time did not lower his eyes, remaining on the man as they spoke. 

It all reminded him of his conversation with the priest earlier - and just how far he felt from himself less than a month back. "A kind heart..won't change the world..to be better." The sacrifices of near everyone he had met prior, and how much he couldn't protect them, let alone himself, made this ring true in his mind. "If I'm their fire..I'll be their fire to rebuild everything after. To force the change." * - Sat Oct 10 08:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Do you think I hate the entity that did this? It's as fruitless as hating a lion that killed a human being. - Sat Oct 10 08:49:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: They would realize being a shinobi for one village is simply a means to an end. - Sat Oct 10 08:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Yes, I wanted to become Hokage at-some point. - Sat Oct 10 08:51:12 2015

"It's comfortable.." he says, staring at the man briefly before turning up to the wall. "Can we..talk again tomorrow?"* - Sat Oct 10 09:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded, hearing Nozumi's wishes. If anything, the child had calmed down a measure with being able to share his feelings with someone. But, beyond that, also having one he deemed smart and able to converse fully with him. 

There wouldn't be anymore answers to the man's statement's, however, as the young child finally fell asleep in the bed.* - Sat Oct 10 09:42:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded, his eyes looking elsewhere. That was still distressing to hear his name at times. "He was my father."* - Sat Oct 10 11:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I see. - Sat Oct 10 11:17:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Oh . . . And Misa. - Sat Oct 10 11:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I have no idea where Misa is. - Sat Oct 10 11:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Uncle Hideki tried to kill you? - Sat Oct 10 11:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yes. - Sat Oct 10 11:19:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: And Misa tried to kill Uncle Hideki. - Sat Oct 10 11:20:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Anyway . . . We should get back to training. - Sat Oct 10 11:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Try learning that jutsu Heiwa. - Sat Oct 10 11:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll try teaching Nozumi Genjutsu Kai in the meantime. - Sat Oct 10 11:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright? - Sat Oct 10 11:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded, and stepped back away from him creating his own personal space bubble. "Right."* - Sat Oct 10 11:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You ready, Nozumi? - Sat Oct 10 11:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Yeah, I'm ready. - Sat Oct 10 11:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Sat Oct 10 11:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Genjutsu Kai allows you to escape Genjutsu without hurting yourself. - Sat Oct 10 11:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: I see... - Sat Oct 10 11:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You use the ram hand-seal and then stop the chakra flow in your body . . . Then use a stronger force to disrupt the chakra of the genjutsu user who is using a genjutsu on you. - Sat Oct 10 11:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll give you an example. - Sat Oct 10 11:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: In the meantime . . . I'll practice a certain technique. - Sat Oct 10 11:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took a seat on the ground, holding his legs crossed out infront of him. It was in this cross that he held the scroll which he unraveled progressively to read what was inside. It wasn't hard for the child to block out some parts of the world as he read, and at that he read at a surprisingly very far above average pace for someone just his age. It was something he'd been prided about in the past by his parents.

But as he read through it became increasingly more linked with them. His father didn't use the same term 'Death Mirage' instead choosing to use 'Hell Viewing' but without a doubt it was this technique. The technique he was being taught was the same his father used against him just a few months back. To force your target to view their deepest fear, with a strong enough user of the technique even being able to alter and make every detail feel and seem as real as the next.

Tears welled up in his eyes as he read through these passages, forcing himself to continue until he had fully managed to read over all of it. It'd be immediately comprehended and understood as he did so - the knowledge of the technique imprinting itself on the child like a sponge would soak up water. Hopefully no one would notice the tears, as after he closed up the scroll he brought his hand up to his eyes and wiped them away, standing up fully and slipping it into his pockets.

<I think I can try it out..>* - Sat Oct 10 11:33:20 2015
