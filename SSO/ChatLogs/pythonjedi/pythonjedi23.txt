<br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Oi.~ A mock mission encounter? - Tue Dec  1 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: This is gonna be over rather quickly. I'll try to last as long as I could against them. - Tue Dec  1 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I'll just say this. - Tue Dec  1 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: If I tap you, let's say you've been assassinated. - Tue Dec  1 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Just for the sake of the training. - Tue Dec  1 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Have one better. - Tue Dec  1 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Wait, what? - Tue Dec  1 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) reached into his back pouch, pulling out a small black notebook. Three pages would be ripped out and handed off to Tengoku - the words quickly scribbled about on the page to read out 'Death'.

"A clean hit with one of these and the target is out of play."* - Tue Dec  1 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I can still uh. . Defend myself though. . Right? - Tue Dec  1 03:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: ...Interesting. - Tue Dec  1 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: Don't go in yet. - Tue Dec  1 03:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: Wait out their chakra. - Tue Dec  1 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) whispers: Right. - Tue Dec  1 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Why did I do that if I can't see? - Tue Dec  1 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) watched carefully, the child himself taking immediate notice of the fog beginning to envelop around the area. Much of it reminded Heiwa of some bad moments - very few good memories were held inside it. However, the sounds of the dog echoing out in the area, as well as the ever so subtle additional entires of the girl in question pattering near, made it clear to Heiwa that it was time to move.

Bringing his hands up quickly, he'd rotate through a single seal while flowing chakra down towards his feet. <Shunshin no Jutsu.> The chakra rapidly would begin energizing and revitalizing his muscles making them stronger and more capable for just a few brief moments. On taking a step forward, suddenly he'd disappear from any sort of sight - a brief plume of smoke being left in his wake.

The slight smell of soap and a smokey char  would disappear from the area, reappearing quite a distance out of the mist - more towards Nori.* - Tue Dec  1 04:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) remained relatively still, his ears being kept wide and aware to keep track on both Sekitsui and the rest of the attackers going about in the mist. The dog would be far more noticed, but it wouldn't drown out the fast, misplaced steps that were bound to appear off of Sekitsui. Even if he hadn't shown it he was aware of her coming.

His eyes point off in that direction, waiting carefully for the faint outline of her to appear out in the mist. His eyesight was great enough that he'd be given at least a couple more feet than the average person in total sight. Which hadn't helped him as much as if she kept in her charge, but, thankfully, he also hadn't needed to dodge anything.

With her taking control of the situation, Heiwa would comply while making minimal amounts of sound. <Fast. Efficient in her strikes. Even has great enough hearing to be able to track us.> Yes. He misjudged it to be hearing. No, the kid did not have any idea smell could work that well. Shh.* - Tue Dec  1 04:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded, noticing the mist finally begin to exit out from the area. "That'll do - hostage saved and Nori wasn't injured." he says, somewhat congratulatory in his tone. In all honesty he wasn't fully expecting for Sekitsui to be moving so fast. It was interesting to say the least.

However, his voice dropped somewhat at the end with his tone lowering with it. "There is a matter of problem, however. Yumiko - that jutsu can be useful, but can also be a detriment."  As he said that, he pulled out a small paper with the word 'Explosive' sprawled across.* - Tue Dec  1 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If this was on me would any of you be the wiser? - Tue Dec  1 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The technique itself could hinder you in many ways. - Tue Dec  1 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Be careful with that jutsu, Yumiko. - Tue Dec  1 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I would have acted differently, I only use it to make it harder to shunshin an attack as quickly as he could since Nori could have been the first target of such a stratagy. - Tue Dec  1 05:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Paper* - Tue Dec  1 05:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . . Can I come out now?! - Tue Dec  1 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yes. You can come out. - Tue Dec  1 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Perhaps. Not every hostage will be a shinobi, however. - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Not every hostage will be capable of stating they're tagged.  - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Around near any person it's a good idea to be careful. - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Or develop some sensory ability. - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: The situation was saving -you-, our squad leader. - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Not a civilian. - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Yeah, I screwed over your little lesson. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Nice try though. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: This time - don't worry. Feeling around me would have been a mistake. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It wasn't a chastisement of you. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The lesson itself was rigged against Yumiko's usage of that technique. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: I don't see why her using the technique was a bad thing. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's strong. Invaluable even. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: I don't understand. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: But it can have detriments. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Collateral..unintentional actions or results - the use of the mist blinds us as shinobis from being able to react. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: ....oh that jutsu? - Tue Dec  1 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: I thought you meant the other one. - Tue Dec  1 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Tengoku, you aren't hurt, right? - Tue Dec  1 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Yes - Tue Dec  1 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: No. - Tue Dec  1 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: I feel like I could have fotten murdered in that mist. - Tue Dec  1 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: You're lucky you moved. - Tue Dec  1 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: I was about to knock you out. - Tue Dec  1 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Yeah. - Tue Dec  1 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: OOC OFF - Tue Dec  1 05:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Having her train against Yumiko or Nori could be hard. She'd likely even be capable of being me too. Especially in Taijutsu. - Tue Dec  1 05:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Her using that jutsu helped me. - Tue Dec  1 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: But I mean, she didn't know it would. - Tue Dec  1 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Just worked out. - Tue Dec  1 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Right. Your sense of hearing synergized well. - Tue Dec  1 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Similar to mine. - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: No, smell. - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: I smelled him. - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: And you. - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Oh? - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Again - interesting. - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You'll work well in the team then. Only one who still has difficulty from what I've seen if Nori herself.~ - Tue Dec  1 05:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Thanks. - Tue Dec  1 05:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took a step back. He hadn't seemed to be in as nearly of a mood as he normally took. The brisk bit of exercise and interactive learning left him feeling better. "That'll do then," he says, ending his statement with a nod. "Of course, there will be some more training to come. Formation training could work for tomorrow. As well, you all will need to keep up with your individual exercises."* - Tue Dec  1 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We'll do some together, but much of that is reliant on you personally. - Tue Dec  1 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hmm okay. - Tue Dec  1 05:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yeah . . . Wait, difficulty in what? - Tue Dec  1 05:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Finding your way around the mist. - Tue Dec  1 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Oh, uh. . That kinda. . wasn't something I expected. - Tue Dec  1 06:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: If only Nori ran my way. - Tue Dec  1 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I didn't know where you were. .! - Tue Dec  1 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Which was the problem in its use.  - Tue Dec  1 06:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yeah. . - Tue Dec  1 06:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Eh? Where did the tag go-- oh right. I picked it up. - Tue Dec  1 06:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: ... - Tue Dec  1 06:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hello there.~ - Tue Dec  1 06:22:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: What do you want, little boy? - Tue Dec  1 18:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Sorry, I don't speak brokanese. - Tue Dec  1 18:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: That's better. - Tue Dec  1 18:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I see pain in his future. - Tue Dec  1 18:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: So hello everyone. - Tue Dec  1 18:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: It's too quiet. - Tue Dec  1 19:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Ryo. - Tue Dec  1 19:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: I want you to spar Geo Dude. - Tue Dec  1 19:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Huh? - Tue Dec  1 20:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: No. - Tue Dec  1 20:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Why not? - Tue Dec  1 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Pointless. - Tue Dec  1 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: What is pointless? Sparring me? - Tue Dec  1 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yes. - Tue Dec  1 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Why would you feel that way? - Tue Dec  1 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Weak. - Tue Dec  1 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Who? Me? I wasn't even fighting at full power... - Tue Dec  1 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Me. - Tue Dec  1 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: ...That's why you should spar me..To get stronger. - Tue Dec  1 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: I could even help you. You fight similarly to me..So I'm sure I could give you some pointers. - Tue Dec  1 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: No. - Tue Dec  1 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I don't need help. - Tue Dec  1 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: You clearly do if you think -I'm- too strong. - Tue Dec  1 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Sparring someone that outmatches me doesn't make me stronger, it makes me weaker. - Tue Dec  1 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I just need to train harder. - Tue Dec  1 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Hmm..Unless you can break your limits you'll never be on par with me....You think you can fight without assistance...You'll never defeat me that way. - Tue Dec  1 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: You need allies to grow. - Tue Dec  1 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I do not. - Tue Dec  1 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Whatever you say... - Tue Dec  1 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Allies make you weak, they make you rely on them. - Tue Dec  1 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: If you have to rely on them, you can't rely on yourself. - Tue Dec  1 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: That's so backwards.... - Tue Dec  1 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: You've clearly been hurt in the past..I'm sorry. - Tue Dec  1 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: If that happens, you're weak. - Tue Dec  1 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Well you're alone and weak. - Tue Dec  1 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: What's your excuse? - Tue Dec  1 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I haven't trained enough. - Tue Dec  1 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I like being alone. - Tue Dec  1 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: A spar -is- training. - Tue Dec  1 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: It isn't. - Tue Dec  1 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: It is though...I fought you wearing weights the entire time....Had I fought you with them off. The fight would have been much shorter. - Tue Dec  1 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Exactly, that isn't training. - Tue Dec  1 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: But I fought you -with- weights. So that I can increase my speed and stamina. - Tue Dec  1 21:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: If you train with weights on...You get stronger. - Tue Dec  1 21:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I don't have anyway. - Tue Dec  1 21:03:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Inside the academy. - Tue Dec  1 21:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Whatever, I'll train the way I want to train. - Tue Dec  1 21:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I don't need you or anyone else. - Tue Dec  1 21:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Very well...Would you like to see the results of my training? That is..Training the way I train? I don't intend on causing you distress...But I'd really like to show you the benefits of it... - Tue Dec  1 21:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: No. Go away. - Tue Dec  1 21:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Very Well. Where is Lady Mizukage? - Tue Dec  1 21:06:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Huh? - Wed Dec  2 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Hey, Yumiko. - Wed Dec  2 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: What's up?~ - Wed Dec  2 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Was thinking of some training - you and Nori up for it? - Wed Dec  2 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Wed Dec  2 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Sure. - Wed Dec  2 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright. Lets head out. - Wed Dec  2 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stopped in a position just outside of their house, nodding after leading the group here. "Alright - what're you two working on?" he'd ask, trying to get an understanding for what they were going for. Teaching was, still, something he hadn't any experience in.* - Wed Dec  2 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Those three are close friends, it's obvious... maybe I'm intruding on their group... why did they put me in the squad if it works better between them three? - Wed Dec  2 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I think he spaced out, Yumi. . - Wed Dec  2 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: He might have. Oh well. - Wed Dec  2 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: And hello there.~ - Wed Dec  2 04:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Huh? Oh, hiya! And not really. We were just about to. - Wed Dec  2 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Oh, cool. - Wed Dec  2 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Can I join? - Wed Dec  2 04:45:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Mkays. - Wed Dec  2 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: What we gonna do? - Wed Dec  2 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmmm. . Yumi, got any ideas? - Wed Dec  2 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I still want to practice with my bow. Do you two think you can avoid my shots? - Wed Dec  2 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Make sure to tone down the power of your attacks.. - Wed Dec  2 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I can try. - Wed Dec  2 04:53:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: That was weird. - Wed Dec  2 04:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Why did I just say the same thing she did. - Wed Dec  2 04:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Because dodging arrows is as hard as dodging your first crazy ex. *omit* - Wed Dec  2 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hmm alright then.~ - Wed Dec  2 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: You two should spread out. - Wed Dec  2 05:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I just got lucky that time. That's all. - Wed Dec  2 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Training. - Wed Dec  2 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: We were playing a game of dodge the arrows. - Wed Dec  2 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I mean. . She did dodge a lot better than I did. I only dodged because I kept on running. . - Wed Dec  2 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Eh.. you did good Nori-chan. - Wed Dec  2 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: No, no. You did a lot better than me. Haha. - Wed Dec  2 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Well, being a medic has it's good times. Can you stand on it now? It wasn't that serious, right? - Wed Dec  2 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Yeah, I'm good. - Wed Dec  2 06:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Sorry about that. - Wed Dec  2 06:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stepped up, finally making himself active on the scene. Somewhat, at least. He'd find a position next to Yumiko and open his mouth, some words appearing to be made. However, the actual sound would be reasonably small, especially from such a distance for most people. If many details could be made about his face, it'd be a small measure of annoyance - his brow furrowed across his eyes.* - Wed Dec  2 06:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: I told you to hold back on the power - at least until aiming is easier.. - Wed Dec  2 06:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) whispers: I did. - Wed Dec  2 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) sighed, his expression returning to a state of indifference. There'd be a nod as he continued speaking.* - Wed Dec  2 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: ...I see. We'll need to work on your accuracy some more then. - Wed Dec  2 06:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: He doesn't look happy. - Wed Dec  2 06:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Uh...yeah... - Wed Dec  2 07:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Jeez, they are acting weird. - Wed Dec  2 07:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) noticed the approaching Sekitsui, his eyes trailing down to the former cut. Seeing it gone he'd turn his head to Nori, nod his head, and return it back on the Inuzuka. 

"Almost dodged that one," he says, his tone seeming more than just a hint of artificially reasuring. Nigga was only six, he ain't got that lie game mastered yet.* - Wed Dec  2 07:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: What did I do? - Wed Dec  2 07:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Not every dodge happens..Besides, I'd rather not have both of you injured from a spar being lead like that. - Wed Dec  2 07:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Especially if Yumiko can't keep her power lower - her arrows are too powerful. - Wed Dec  2 07:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: I mean...it wasn't that bad? Would she have actually hurt me badly if I took the full hit? - Wed Dec  2 07:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Probably. If you had managed to hit Tengoku in the mist, do you think he'd be hurt too? - Wed Dec  2 07:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: He'd be hurt but I was using a rotation that was slow enough only to cause his body to hurt. - Wed Dec  2 07:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: And I wouldn't have made him pass out. - Wed Dec  2 07:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: I would have paused to let him admit defeat. - Wed Dec  2 07:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: You told her to hold back, she was holding back yeah? - Wed Dec  2 07:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...She says so. If the confrontation was serious, however, that might..mistakes can happen. - Wed Dec  2 07:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I was. - Wed Dec  2 07:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Yeah... I get it. - Wed Dec  2 07:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Ino idea who berith is lol - Wed Dec  2 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Yumiko, we'll work on your accuracy together, okay? - Wed Dec  2 07:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Yeah that was weird as fuck... - Wed Dec  2 07:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: *Yeah, that was weiiiiiiiiiiiird. - Wed Dec  2 07:37:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) whispers: ( It's based mostly on your control and the material of the puppet ) - Wed Dec  2 08:19:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: (Shouldn't some of the reflex be, at least, the puppeteers reflex?) - Wed Dec  2 08:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: (Cuz them niggas gotta track with that eye sight and shit - and that stuff doesn't give no control boosts.) - Wed Dec  2 08:20:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I've been better. - Wed Dec  2 08:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) faced towards Izanami, rather quickly remembering her. Gonna assume her lack of arm isn't made well and clear to see.

"You here looking for me again?" * - Wed Dec  2 08:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Did you find any information about your brother? - Wed Dec  2 08:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: None at all. - Wed Dec  2 08:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) glanced down, eyes locking on the scroll being handed. He'd take it, and carefully start to unroll it, even as he noticed the terrible shape of her arm. Definitely known - the child does his best to quickly turn off of it and not draw much attention to what was seen. 

Luckily, upon opening the scroll it wouldn't be filled with explosive tags! The child scanned across the small scribbling quickly, his eyes widening as he read it. When he brought it back down, he'd face Yumiko and force his face into a, rather clear, fake smile. "Yumiko, mind if Izanami comes into the house? She might need a place to stay." he'd say, scrambling for a bit of a lie.* - Wed Dec  2 09:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I don't mind. - Wed Dec  2 09:01:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Also...a moment Heiwa. - Wed Dec  2 09:06:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nearing a year.. - Wed Dec  2 09:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Why? - Wed Dec  2 09:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: So is it bad I can sort of tell when something is forced and not? - Wed Dec  2 09:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...I'd like to talk to her is all. Here. - Wed Dec  2 09:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) hands her that very same scroll.* - Wed Dec  2 09:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'd like you there as well. - Wed Dec  2 09:13:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Anyway..you're well aware of who governs our lives, i'm sure. - Wed Dec  2 09:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) || There'd be the occasional window - all of them closed but none appearing direclty locked. There'd probably be growing weed plants discernable as well.

Giving a nod, Heiwa would step forward after having securely closed the door. "We are. Which is why I wanted to bring us in here. It's safer than outside."* - Wed Dec  2 09:19:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Peace in any measure isn't possible with them. - Wed Dec  2 09:21:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) moved over himself to see the drawing, far more amazed generally at how her drawing skills were. Shit. 

"The Black Lotus," he remarks aloud, nodding his head somewhat after saying that. "Kokuren."* - Wed Dec  2 10:06:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Something to do? - Wed Dec  2 10:10:08 2015

"Yeah..getting the kage's permission to enter though.." shaking his head he'd sigh and step over taking a seat next to her.* - Wed Dec  2 10:17:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Alright. - Wed Dec  2 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: In the mean time we need to work on your archery.~ - Wed Dec  2 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Heh yeah. - Wed Dec  2 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Okay. - Wed Dec  2 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded, and took several steps away from Yumiko keeping the distance between them rather large. It'd be many metres apart from eachother. Aiming would have some difficulty for sure. 

"When you're ready."* - Thu Dec  3 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) 's head leaned up, eyes trailing along the arc the arrow was making. <A long shot?> he'd think to himself, before quickly flicking his eyes back onto Yumiko herself. <Or a feint?> There'd be no other arrow appearing to be made, and with that he'd once more bring his eyes onto the now falling arrow watching its total trajectory.

It was actually surprisingly close, and for safety's sake alone he placed his right foot back behind his left, feet idly standing on ends ready for a dodge if it came to it. But the closer it got the more it would appear to no longer be aiming at him - until finally it stopped just a few feet short of his position. He'd exhale, and return his eyes on Yumiko.

<That was close..she's getting a lot better with that.>* - Thu Dec  3 00:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) breathed in, readying himself the moment he saw the weapon move back up. <Where is it heading this time?> he'd think to himself, once more following the path of the arrow. It hadn't looked too much different along the way, but the closer it got the more his mind began to nag at him. <It's getting too close..I have to move.>

Well aware of the damage her arrows could do - the child takes an evasive maneuver, using the large arc of the arrow, and therefore the low immediate speed of the attack, to give him enough time to pull out a kunai, jump back, and throw the weapon at his position marking the spot. The arrow would land very near to it. <A hit..>

Landing on his feet, he twists his ankle somewhat creating enough resistance to come at a full stop. In doing so he'd also return his eyes on Yumiko.* - Thu Dec  3 00:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) || Little time was given for rest, Yumiko's attack coming in fast shortly after the last. <Here it comes..> His eyes focused on the approaching arrow, treating the accuracy training as an additional bit of training for himself - his reflexes getting some proper fine tuning and general refreshing.

As it neared closer, his back lowered bringing his entire body closer. And then, just as it remained a few feet infront of him, he dipped out to the side landing against the ground in a roll. The attack would be narrowly dodged at near to the last second with Heiwa pulling himself up onto a knee - quickly returning his attention onto Yumiko.

If given more time he'd catch his breath and step back onto his feet, but if she was going to keep this exercise tense - he'd probably only be able to get so far before another dodge came near.* - Thu Dec  3 01:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) had managed to make his way back onto his feet by the time the fourth arrow was released. His eyes would do its best to track the movement of the incoming attack, only breaking to move when he was sure it was actually coming to land against him. Training his reflexes wouldn't be as powerful if he just kept running around the area.

And, just as it comes near, he brings his body out to the side doing his best to outmaneuver the incoming missile. Alas, where there was luck there was also the lack of luck - the arrow comes past just barely grazing his skin cutting in hard against the part was hit.

When the arrow finally comes to a stop Heiwa would be pulling himself back off the ground, holding his somewhat bleeding arm. <Those..really are fast.>* - Thu Dec  3 04:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I think you should get some rest. Don't want to really hurt you with this. - Thu Dec  3 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) lightly nodded his head. "Fine - Is Nori up? Lets see if we can find her."* - Thu Dec  3 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: She is yes. - Thu Dec  3 04:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Where is she? - Thu Dec  3 04:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stepped into the academy, hands clenched around his right arm. A small amount of blood could be seen barely coming from some type of wound. "Hey, Nori, think you could help?"* - Thu Dec  3 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hello.~ - Thu Dec  3 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) pulled his hand off of the wound showing it to Nori. It was just a flesh wound - his skin appearing nearly seared off in a similar fashion to Sekitsui's injury. "Accuracy training."* - Thu Dec  3 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) kept his arm out, accepting the soothing embrace of his wounds being stitched back up with her chakra.

"Right..Thank you for this, Nori." he'd say, pulling him arm back after it'd been fixed up.* - Thu Dec  3 05:44:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) thinks: Is that a reward or punishment for her? With how she was last time. - Thu Dec  3 07:01:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: It gives me something to do other than just being a medic, you know? - Thu Dec  3 07:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: The picture will be put on our body. Using head bands will give us away to fast. - Thu Dec  3 07:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..I see. - Thu Dec  3 07:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That makes four us then. - Thu Dec  3 07:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Thu Dec  3 07:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Who is the other one? - Thu Dec  3 08:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: The girl who came to talk with Heiwa. - Thu Dec  3 08:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Uhhh? Which? - Thu Dec  3 08:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: My cousin, Izanami. - Thu Dec  3 08:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You remember seeing her? The girl with the white hair? - Thu Dec  3 08:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Ahhh. - Thu Dec  3 08:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Wait, she's your cousin? - Thu Dec  3 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: She is. Distantly related. - Thu Dec  3 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: My father's cousin is her father. - Thu Dec  3 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Wow. . Well, atleast that's excludes the question as to why you both don't look alike. - Thu Dec  3 08:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. We're not going to do anything yet, but we're going to prepare for it. - Thu Dec  3 08:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: To start with - we're going to get as capable as we can, Nori. - Thu Dec  3 08:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We're going to infiltrate. - Thu Dec  3 08:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I see. . . - Thu Dec  3 08:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Well. . I have some money that I have been saving up. .  Along with the bit you gave me. . If that will help. - Thu Dec  3 08:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It could. We'll need money to purchase some volumes on their history. - Thu Dec  3 08:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And we'll need to be strong enough to each pass a private exam. - Thu Dec  3 08:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . . . Uhm . . . If you remove one of the dresse drawer cases out and look inside the dresser, you will see seven bags filled with ry. - Thu Dec  3 08:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: *ryo - Thu Dec  3 08:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: What is a private exam anyway? - Thu Dec  3 08:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's a very tough examination to join the Gezo. - Thu Dec  3 08:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: From what I hear..a single private is about as strong as a kage. - Thu Dec  3 08:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hrm. . I see. - Thu Dec  3 08:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: *Yawns - Thu Dec  3 08:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Inny minny minie mo. Who do I cuddle with to day? - Thu Dec  3 08:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Guess you're it Heiwa. - Thu Dec  3 08:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) remained silent, eyes looking away from Yumiko. * - Thu Dec  3 09:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) hadn't stopped her, but definitely remained uncomfortable and rigid as she leaned against him. 

"I was..just thinking about some things.." he says, keeping his eyes off of her, the nervous he felt being clear no matter how he tried to hide it.* - Thu Dec  3 09:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Come on tell me what are you thinking about. - Thu Dec  3 09:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...About..The Kokuren..we're going to need to work hard to be..strong for it.  - Thu Dec  3 09:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Then why look away from me hmm? Why are you so nervous? - Thu Dec  3 09:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) whispers: Why are you so afraid? You afraid of losing me? - Thu Dec  3 09:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...... - Thu Dec  3 09:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) swallowed, and slowly nodded his head.* - Thu Dec  3 09:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) whispers: I won't die I promise. Because if I did I would make you sad. - Thu Dec  3 09:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) 's body began to ease up, the tension gradually fading away.

"Everyone..I've gotten close to has died.." he admits, briefly his eyes flashing back at how many there were. Player characters die quick as fuck.* - Thu Dec  3 09:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) whispers: I'm still breathing. - Thu Dec  3 09:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) whispers: I'll work really hard to make you not sad. Also you there's something you don't know about looking away from me. - Thu Dec  3 09:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) thinks: Moving onto phase two of this plan. - Thu Dec  3 09:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) whispers: Want to know what it is?~ - Thu Dec  3 09:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) peered over at Yumiko from the corner of his eye. "What is it..?"* - Thu Dec  3 09:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) was caught completely off guard, Yumiko's strength likely enough to overpower Heiwa, and alongside the fact that he was pressed up against one side of the couch there was no escape. 

"Hey! Cut it out!" he yells out, squirming against her grasp. Involuntarily, however, his voice would be raised higher in pitch and a bit of a laugh could be heard at the end. Surely - he was cracking under the pressure of her tickle attack.* - Thu Dec  3 09:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) simply couldn't resist any longer. A sound not made by him very often - the child begins uncontrollably laughing as he's continued being tickled, tears welling up in his eyes. Even as he struggled for escape, and made the occasional breathless plea, there wouldn't be much way out if she hadn't let him.

Around two minutes of this later, and he'd be stuck doing his best to catch his breath - the tears still streaming down his reddened face. When she went in for another hug, he'd turn to face her feeling considerably less nervous than before. No - instead he was that mixture of happy and angry - part of him planning his revenge of tickling before the fatigue hit him. 

With that gone, he'd lean himself against her - not quite with a smile, but still seeming otherwise content.* - Thu Dec  3 10:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) whispers: Sorry but I like hearing you laugh.~ - Thu Dec  3 10:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Promise you won't leave..and I'll do it more. - Thu Dec  3 10:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Without..all of the pain of forcing it. - Thu Dec  3 10:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) whispers: Only if you hold me. - Thu Dec  3 10:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) brought his arm up and around hesitantly, eventually bringing it across her shoulder.

"It's a deal.~" he'd say, chuckling softly at the end. * - Thu Dec  3 10:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Comfortable.~ - Thu Dec  3 10:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Yeah. Same. - Thu Dec  3 10:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mmm. - Thu Dec  3 11:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Heiwa-kun. I don't want to see you sad. - Thu Dec  3 11:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I won't..make you see that then. - Thu Dec  3 11:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We're going to..get strong and stop the Gezo.. - Thu Dec  3 11:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The four of us and any who agree with the cause.. - Thu Dec  3 11:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: And beat anyone who disagrees. - Thu Dec  3 11:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We'll be the fire to purify the world..and the water to soothe its wounds. - Thu Dec  3 11:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Thu Dec  3 11:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) whispers: Your squad's waiting for you at the mountain waterfall. - Fri Dec  4 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Zzzzzz. . . - Fri Dec  4 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) glanced up, finding the members of his squad atop the mountain waterfall using his enhanced eye sight. He'd call out "Hey. What're you three doing?" in a loud enough tone for them to hear him.* - Fri Dec  4 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Oh. Did you talk to the Mizukage about any available missions? - Fri Dec  4 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: No we were waiting for you. - Fri Dec  4 01:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I see. Well, I'm not sure if the Mizukage is up right now. Do you want to look? - Fri Dec  4 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Yeah, let's go!~ - Fri Dec  4 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Come one Nori! - Fri Dec  4 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Wake up! - Fri Dec  4 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We're going to ask about a mission! Come on - and bring Yumiko with you too! - Fri Dec  4 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaake uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup! - Fri Dec  4 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) sighs and shakes his head, turning away from Nori. "Come on, she's going to be a while."* - Fri Dec  4 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Alright, alright I'm coming! - Fri Dec  4 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded, continuing to move towards the academy. And if that failed - the kage manor itself.* - Fri Dec  4 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Hmph. - Fri Dec  4 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Seems she's busy. - Fri Dec  4 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I still have some low ranking missions you three could go on and take the credit for - but I doubt you'd all want that. - Fri Dec  4 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Hm... it's okay. - Fri Dec  4 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: I'll wait. - Fri Dec  4 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Maybe training or no? - Fri Dec  4 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Right. Training can work - I have an idea in mind anyways. - Fri Dec  4 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Lets head out to the fields. - Fri Dec  4 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Alrighty.~ - Fri Dec  4 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright. This spot should do. We'll be working on some physical training later on in the day, but with all things there is a balance needed. - Fri Dec  4 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A strong body is nothing without a strong mind. - Fri Dec  4 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Sekitsui, Yumiko, Nori - Can either of you explain what a genjutsu is?  - Fri Dec  4 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I hope that's not taken as condescending. - Fri Dec  4 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Jutsu that affect the mind only? - Fri Dec  4 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: It's a chakra attack on the brain. - Fri Dec  4 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mhm. It's a type of jutsu that affects the mind - not the physical realm - through application of chakra on the nervous system of the brain causing the recipient's senses to reflect what the user intends for them to see. - Fri Dec  4 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: In other words - what you've both said. It's not used by many as they favor the use of frontal attacks. - Fri Dec  4 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: As it cannot kill it is often seen better to use a more physical sense of combat. - Fri Dec  4 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: However, you may very well find someone who does use genjutsu. In that case are any of you aware of how to counteract that? - Fri Dec  4 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) brought up his hand, outstretching two digits. "Two ways," he explains, "The first method is the easiest: If in a genjutsu, and aware of this fact, you can injure yourself and use the resulting pain to break free of the assault. The pain snaps your senses back to normal." After explaining the first one, he'd lower his middle finger leaving only a single digit remaining.

"The other method is the more preferred one - but can be difficult at times. As it's an attack on the chakra of the brain if one were to apply a greater level of force at the area they could free themselves of its influence." As he finished he'd lower the finger and nod his head. "It's called Dissipation - Genjutsu Kai. It's what we will be working on for the beginning part of the day."* - Fri Dec  4 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: . . . What if we are in a genjutsu right now? And this village isn't real? - Fri Dec  4 02:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Good question..There are some ways to discern whether you're in a genjutsu or not. - Fri Dec  4 02:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A genjutsu only affects the senses - it does not affect the world around you. Low leveled genjutsus often will have tells because of this. - Fri Dec  4 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If, say, a giant ball of fire is made and is hurling towards you? - Fri Dec  4 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: But you can visibly see a large body of water appearing still cool to the touch and not reacting in any way against it? - Fri Dec  4 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Of course, a strong enough genjutsu user would make you perceive that body of water also being boiling. - Fri Dec  4 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Staying aware of your senses can keep you from falling into the traps of a genjutsu. - Fri Dec  4 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'm going to use a low level genjutsu on you. Your objective is to dissipate it using only your chakra. - Fri Dec  4 02:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: What are the handseals though? - Fri Dec  4 02:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The tiger hand seal. - Fri Dec  4 02:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) brought both hands together quickly in a demonstration of the seal as he said it aloud, showing it very clearly for her to see. Of course, as a genin, she probably already was aware of the twelve basic ones. 

"Your objectives are to break out of the genjutsu using this form of dissipation. It requires careful moulding of your chakra levels, reducing them to a far greater level before surging them back up and dislodging the opponents chakra."* - Fri Dec  4 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) rotated his hands shortly thereafter through another set of hand seals - the total numbering only two: The Snake and the Rat. It'd be kept purposefully slow making sure that Sekitsui and Nori could both see the technique in its full without one of them happening to have been inadvertently focusing away from his hand seals.

Assuming they had both looked at it - they'd suddenly each find leaves circling around over their body and the sun beginning to set. Following thereafter - there greatest fears would begin to play out infront of them from within the guise of darkness. But it would be unusually..very fake. Seeing through it would be easy as most of the creatures were very foreign looking and consciously appearing to blend outside of reality. 

Like a creature looking cartoonish in real life - it would be consciously clear that none of what was happening inside of the genjutsu was real. Even any of the pain they would feel would also be considerably lessened in impact - to call it the same as what they would actually face in the field was far from the truth. But it would make for easy targets to dissipate, and even the chakra itself wouldn't be very difficult to dislodge.

tl;dr this is Heiwa's tekagen.* - Fri Dec  4 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took a step back following the use of the genjutsu, waiting and watching the both of them for when they'd each do their best to utilize Kai and get out. It was kept obvious, and since he had already explained he'd be using a genjutsu to begin with that alone should keep it clear and plain to know. 

Once they were finished with the demonstration, he'd nod his head. "That's all there is to it," he says, ending with another nod. "In your free time practice the use the jutsu if you can. Learning to properly flow chakra into that area to unclog anything in your brain can lead to more efficient usages. Faster and..less likely to fail usages."* - Fri Dec  4 03:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Take a breather - we'll be working on some sparring in just a bit. - Fri Dec  4 03:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Your opponent will be Nori. - Fri Dec  4 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Oh. - Fri Dec  4 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Okay.~ - Fri Dec  4 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: When you both are ready step up and take opposing positions. - Fri Dec  4 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: After the seal of confrontation you can begin. - Fri Dec  4 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Can I go? - Fri Dec  4 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Oh - sure. - Fri Dec  4 03:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nori and Yumiko then. - Fri Dec  4 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Taijutsu, kenjutsu, shurikenjutsu - the limiting factors of this spar. - Fri Dec  4 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Stick to use of those. - Fri Dec  4 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hmm right. - Fri Dec  4 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm - actually, Yumiko, while Nori rests up from her..experience.. - Fri Dec  4 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) walks over close to her, keeping his voice relatively low as he spoke. * - Fri Dec  4 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: You know how to counter a genjutsu, yes? - Fri Dec  4 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: Two methods. Pain can overwhelm the senses. As a Genjutsu focuses on changing what the senses perceive  this resets them. - Fri Dec  4 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: In doing so it breaks the illusion. - Fri Dec  4 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: Alternatively, the method we were working on earlier, involves using chakra to dislodge the chakra put on the brain by the opponent. - Fri Dec  4 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: As Genjutsu works by attacking the chakra nervous system it disrupts the senses. Dislodging this breaks the genjutsu as well. - Fri Dec  4 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: To do this - you need an overwhelming amount of force. This is achieved by lowering your chakra and then surging it back up to normal. - Fri Dec  4 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: I'm going to put you in a very weak genjutsu, okay? Make the tiger seal and focus your chakra to break out of the genjutsu using dissipation. - Fri Dec  4 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) whispers: Lets move away for a bit so things don't look weird. - Fri Dec  4 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nori, rest up. We'll be back in a moment. - Fri Dec  4 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) offered his hand out for Yumiko to take.* - Fri Dec  4 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) lets go of her hand and takes a few steps back getting some distance from her. "Alright. Remember what I told you to do," he explains, bringing his hands up to his chest to rotate through a set of two seals - The snake and the rat.

In doing so he'd keep his hand seal speed slow, giving her plenty of time to view the technique. If it worked, she'd see a cascade of leaves torrent around her and the sun beginning to set back to night. Shortly thereafter her greatest fears would begin to play out infront of her. Of course, they'd be very clearly fake.

They wouldn't hold much power at all and one could quite easily discern that they weren't representative of reality. Similar to how Naruto's clones were pasty, pale, and fake looking at the start of the series - these illusions would be disjointed from the real world making much of what they portrayed seem sketchy and clear in what they were. It'd also lower a good bit of the shock value portrayed.

tl;dr This was Heiwa holding back very considerably.* - Fri Dec  4 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) moved in closer to Yumiko as she seemed to be going through the effects of the technique, likely her mind's view taking it as some distorted attempt at crawling by a half dead Heiwa. 

Unintentional mind-fucks!

But when the technique was dispelled, Heiwa would make the rest of the way, bringing his arms around the girl. 

From this close..Heiwa could see the glassy eyes and the tears welling up before she had dispelled it. Even with it being held back so much - Heiwa was warned majorly to never use it on a friend. Genjutsus were the preferred way to stop enemies when binding was impossible.* - Fri Dec  4 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's okay..It wasn't real, right? - Fri Dec  4 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) whispers: Not at all... - Fri Dec  4 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: ..Good. You still..okay for the spar? - Fri Dec  4 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: What did she see..? - Fri Dec  4 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Fri Dec  4 04:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright.. - Fri Dec  4 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nori, you ready as well? - Fri Dec  4 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yeah. - Fri Dec  4 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Lets head back. - Fri Dec  4 04:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) once more offered his hands out for them to take and return back to the training spot.* - Fri Dec  4 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Sooo. . Spar, right? - Fri Dec  4 04:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Physical spar only. - Fri Dec  4 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmm? Alright. - Fri Dec  4 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I'M SO HIGH RIGHT NOOOOOW *omit* - Fri Dec  4 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) moved in, quickly appearing next to the struggling duo. 

"That's enough! Break it up!" he yells out, using the proximity and the loudness to drive the message home to Yumiko and Nori. Their fight was getting a bit too far at that point.

Of course, Heiwa wasn't going to put himself in the way to break it up. Child nerf - nigga ain't that strong anymore.* - Fri Dec  4 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) briefly stared at the situation, having to make sure that she was writhing in pain and not pleasure. With someone like Nori you had to make the judgement call. If it was the latter..well bondage would be enough for her to probably stop. 

But Yumiko was right. This looked like pain. "Hold her there - I'll go get some ice," he says, rushing off from the scene to do just that.* - Fri Dec  4 06:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) utilized Shunshin throughout the entire procedure to move just that little bit faster - his immense speed added with that making it quite easy for him to make it to the restaurant in remarkably quick time. And when he entered there would be no one in line making for the flash of his headband and a short explanation of the situation get him an ice pack. 

Why the restuarant instead of the hospital? Heiwa ain't got that health care, bruh. Also the restuarant was closer. 

After getting the ice he'd begin rushing off heading towards the group once more.* - Fri Dec  4 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) reappears in a plume of smoke, an ice pack being tossed about between his hands. "I got it! I got it!" he says aloud, before tossing it to Yumiko. That shit was cold af.* - Fri Dec  4 06:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Oooh.. . - Fri Dec  4 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) thinks: I think. - Fri Dec  4 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: ..Was she enjoying it all along? - Fri Dec  4 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: How are you feeling now? - Fri Dec  4 07:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . Nuummb. . *muffled groan* - Fri Dec  4 07:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Sorry. - Fri Dec  4 07:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Bad hurts. . - Fri Dec  4 07:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Want to head to the house? - Fri Dec  4 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I can get her head if you get her feet. - Fri Dec  4 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: We could take her arms and walk. - Fri Dec  4 07:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Well..how about Nori? - Fri Dec  4 07:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . . Bad hurts. . - Fri Dec  4 07:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) reached over as well, offering his shoulder to help bring up Nori. It'd be difficult, but the fact that Yumiko was also offering some aid made it that much easier.* - Fri Dec  4 07:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: How do you feel? - Fri Dec  4 08:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hurts. .Bad//  - Fri Dec  4 08:10:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Do you want some more ice? - Fri Dec  4 08:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: No. I just. . . Wanna sleep. - Fri Dec  4 08:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...Do you want the chains then? - Fri Dec  4 08:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . .Not in the mood. . - Fri Dec  4 08:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I.... - Fri Dec  4 09:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I messed up. - Fri Dec  4 09:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Huh? - Fri Dec  4 09:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Didn't mean to hurt her like that. - Fri Dec  4 09:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's no worse than what they would do on a mission. - Fri Dec  4 09:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You remember that arrow - fired from the bow you wield? - Fri Dec  4 09:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The one that penetrated even Iron Maiden? - Fri Dec  4 09:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: She'll be fine..I wanted you to spar her so she would see this. - Fri Dec  4 09:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'm not having either of you die. - Fri Dec  4 09:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Y-Yeah.. - Fri Dec  4 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: When we go to those private exams.. - Fri Dec  4 09:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We're not dying. - Fri Dec  4 09:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And we're not going to be treated like that. - Fri Dec  4 09:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: They're going to do far worse. - Fri Dec  4 09:37:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Fine. Is Nori..upset? - Fri Dec  4 20:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I haven't seen her since..yeah. - Fri Dec  4 20:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I think she is still. I don't know. - Fri Dec  4 20:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: She might be resting. - Fri Dec  4 20:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I see. Up for training in the mean time? - Fri Dec  4 20:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Once you're squad has arrived, take thhem on that mission. - Fri Dec  4 20:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: It is a C-Ranked mission, you can handle it, right? - Fri Dec  4 20:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) reached his hand up catching the scroll. Shit, with his durability that stuff probably almost bruised him QQ. 

"Yeah - we should be able to handle a C rank," he says, slowly opening to scroll to read the details.

In case the details of the mission weren't..ya know to escort said person, he'd ask "What're the details?" but if it was..well he'd have no use to do so.* - Fri Dec  4 20:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Gather your group and holla' at me. - Fri Dec  4 21:00:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) glanced over at Ryo as he made himself known, dark black eyes trailing all over the set up he was making. 

"I'm waiting for my squad," he says out, giving another look around to see if they had arrived. "We're to head out for a mission soon."* - Fri Dec  4 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) turned back around, eyes falling off of the somewhat taller boy as he continued to scan the area. No one had shown up yet. <They might be caught up somewhere..I'll go look for them.>

Without turning back, he'd begin walking off leaving Ryo. "I figure that's probably what you want. If you ever want to join in on our training feel free." Without waiting to hear what he had to say in response, Heiwa would continue leaving.* - Fri Dec  4 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Zzzzzz. - Fri Dec  4 22:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stepped up closer, carefully taking off his bokuto so as to not wake Nori. Afterwards he'd take a position on the couch. 

"Nori? You up?"* - Fri Dec  4 22:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Mhm. . - Fri Dec  4 22:41:04 2015
