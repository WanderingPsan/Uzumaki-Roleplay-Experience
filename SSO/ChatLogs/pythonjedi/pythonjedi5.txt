<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: .... Okay. - Thu Oct  8 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: So I shouldn't use it on anyone but bad guys? - Thu Oct  8 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Yes. - Thu Oct  8 00:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded his head in agreement, finally looking away from the scroll and up to Hideki. "Can I go back to that training place?" * - Thu Oct  8 00:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Sure, but be safe. Please.. - Thu Oct  8 00:22:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) thinks: If so, I'll be killing it. - Thu Oct  8 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Now! I must perform my daily mountain climbing! - Thu Oct  8 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: I've other things in mind for a gift. - Thu Oct  8 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) approached up to where the girl appeared to be reading, noting the scroll she was peering into to be the one Hideki had recently given her. <I wonder what's in there..> the pass thought across his mind as he watched her for a moment, before his trailing black eyes returned against his own scroll. 

If not stopped he'd take a seat a small distance away from her and start to read through the notes he was given. He had a surprising level of comprehension ability for a child so young, and would be able to read through most of it without forgetting most of the info.
* - Thu Oct  8 00:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) glanced up from his scroll, nodding his head in reply to Nina. "What're you doing?" he asked, staring at her blankly.* - Thu Oct  8 00:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Learning. - Thu Oct  8 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Learning what? - Thu Oct  8 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: A jutsu. - Thu Oct  8 00:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: It's called Shunshin. - Thu Oct  8 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What's it do? - Thu Oct  8 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Makes me move fast. - Thu Oct  8 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Basically, anyway. - Thu Oct  8 00:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Is it what Uncle Hideki gave to you? - Thu Oct  8 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Yeah.... - Thu Oct  8 00:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Is it a wind jutsu? - Thu Oct  8 00:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: No it isn't. - Thu Oct  8 00:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Oh.  - Thu Oct  8 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) returned his attention back to the scroll he was reading through, finding less he wanted to say at that point. However, he would ocasionally glance up, marginally curious over what this jutsu was like.* - Thu Oct  8 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) flinched, suddenly dropping the scroll as he stumbled away from her. The child had expected, at the least, he'd be able to hear her if she was coming near, which is why this majorly spooked him. "Wah!" It was only after his eyes finally came to rest on his, assumed, assailant that he calmed down, focus returning in his eyes.* - Thu Oct  8 01:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hehe.~ - Thu Oct  8 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Don't do stuff like that.  - Thu Oct  8 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) glared at her, hints of anger evident in his eyes. "Was that the Shunshin technique?" * - Thu Oct  8 01:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Maybe.~~ - Thu Oct  8 01:11:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Nothing really. - Thu Oct  8 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Nothing at all huh? - Thu Oct  8 01:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I have a shuriken..and some string.. - Thu Oct  8 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: No thank you, I prefer jutsu. - Thu Oct  8 01:17:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..What do you want instead? - Thu Oct  8 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: You can get your uncle to train me.~ - Thu Oct  8 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: --Huh? - Thu Oct  8 01:23:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: And he's clearly strong, I need a teacher, so why not? - Thu Oct  8 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He doesn't know Wind Ninjutsu, right? - Thu Oct  8 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Besides he's the one who showed you that. - Thu Oct  8 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: There's more to being a shinobi than elements. - Thu Oct  8 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Like what? - Thu Oct  8 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Mastering jutsu, working as a team, building bonds to work off of. - Thu Oct  8 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Whatever. - Thu Oct  8 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I can ask him if you want. Why not ask Mister Mamarou, though? - Thu Oct  8 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Who? - Thu Oct  8 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He uses a sword. - Thu Oct  8 01:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And is really fast with it. - Thu Oct  8 01:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: So why should I ask him? - Thu Oct  8 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He said he'd help me.. - Thu Oct  8 01:30:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) glanced over to Gin, remembering talking to the older kid before. "Hey." the child says, nodding alongside his greeting.* - Thu Oct  8 01:33:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took several steps back and away from the two, giving them an ample amount of room for the spar. For once instead of reading through his scrolls he'd actually spend his time watching, seeing how this spar would go. * - Thu Oct  8 02:10:59 2015

Of course, if fuckshittery happened then this might, possibly, not happen.* - Thu Oct  8 03:18:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) exitted his room, finding a nice position along the wall of Hideki's house. <Time to work on Kai.> He thinks this thought to himself and brings both hands up to his chest, interlocking them infront of himself and closing his eyes. 

There wasn't much that he had in rememberance of his father, this one technique being one of the few links he still felt to him. It was one that he taught him shortly before his death. For this reason it held a certain significance to the child. He wanted to be able to use it at a fluid and fluent level. 

Slowly as he focuses inwards his chakra begins to lower, his lack of general control or ability with this technique leading to a decently lengthened time for him to reach the absolute efficiency. This would, normally, make it unusable - a certain amount of time and surging required in a traditional combat setting for it to work, but that wasn't the point of this exercise. 

Instead this exercise was to focus on the sheer power factor of surging so much of his chakra at one time for his aid. It was at the moment when he finally felt it being reduced to such a low point that he finally releases it all - a sudden surge of chakra shooting upwards and unclogging most genjutsu effects outright affecting him. 

Of course, there would be no genjutsu actively affecting him, but that didn't lower the benefit of this practice in the slightest. Exhaling a breath he feels his chakra normalize and brings his hands apart, feeling the radiation burst of much of his chakra having inadvertently left him due to the surge. <That's something else to work on..>* - Thu Oct  8 10:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) pulled himself back up from the wall, the brief reprieve restoring much of his reserves. At least enough for him to be ready to try again. <This time reserve as much chakra as possible..> For now that was his goal when he would do this - at least until he felt that he was making some progress. 

Of course, that's not to say the other parts weren't important. Speed of lowering chakra and surge ability were both very much required, but if he could consistently use this technique to work on that directly, without such a break, he'd be in a far greater position for progression.

With both hands interlocked infront of his chest he closes his eyes and takes in a deep breath, focusing his minds eye on the spiralling energy of his chakra inside of him. Most wouldn't be able to tell what he was doing from a basic glance, but with every passing second his chakra would begin lowering further and further within his own body.

Still slow and unsteady, his flaws and rustiness with the technique were highlighted through these moments, but all things considered the fact he was able to do such a thing at a young age was a testament to his overall intelligence as a person, as well as a shinobi. And, finally, a testament to his progenitors in teaching him.

The very moment he hit that sweet spot, where he felt that he couldn't go any lower directly, he spurted his chakra back up in a sudden burst, bringing it most of the way in one shot. The remaining bit piddled back up, relying on the first burst to supply the primary release of chakra to break him out of any genjutsu afflicting him - if any were at this moment.* - Thu Oct  8 10:40:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: .... - Thu Oct  8 11:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took note of the girl infront of him, giving her that standard blank stare of his before turning his attention off to the side. The young child grabs something out of his pocket and twirls it around his finger briefly, revealing it to hold the sharpened, black edges of a shuriken within his grasps. 

Before he had made any action he then steps away from her, intending to minimize any risk of injury for her. As well as himself. Assuming she didn't step in closer, he'd finally then choose to make his action by pulling said arm back priming it for a throw. On release it'd arc across the air, twirling quickly closer and faster towards the fence on the opposite side of him.

However, the movements would be subtley guided with his hand, changing the direction somewhat as it moved across in the air. By no means was he an expert at this technique or style of fighting, instead being only a basic practioner making his movements relatively easy to see through all things considered.

When it had finally reached the end of its length the child then, finally, pulls his arm just as he felt the string begin to become taut, reversing the direction of the shuriken to roll back up and towards him before finally stopping in momentum at his feet. Shuriken + string. OP.* - Thu Oct  8 11:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) reached down picking his shuriken back up, the child catching a glance once more of her ability in the process. Again, he found it to be rather impressive - or at least found it to be a challenge in how much better she was. Gave him an understanding of his current ranking. 

"Who taught you to do that?" the child eventually asks, breaking the silence they had.* - Thu Oct  8 12:12:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) could barely notice the changes occuring in the strange man, and by then it was too late. The environment breaks apart from under him shrouding the area in dust, blocking his vision forcing his arm upwards to protect his eyes. <Another fight??> After the last one had escalated as far as it did there was no time for waiting and hoping it resolved itself. He had to move!

Before all of the dust settled and he saw whether the guy was running at him he'd turn and begin running away. Presumably his aunt would pick him up during this venture and place him much farther from where he'd normally end up from his own power, and if so the child would turn his head to the combat again, watching from afar to see what had happen. * - Thu Oct  8 21:24:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) had been lucky for one major reason - he wasn't actually rply in this position at the moment. The child was watching the Speed Star come in out of nowhere from his position way the fuck back over near the mountain, having a good bit of distance from the actual fighters. Which was good, as this kid was not a fighter.

At only six years old it was clear he was just a regular civilian to even a common glancer by, and even further he hadn't been officially trained at any type of academy. If that meant something, one could only hope it was important. With his level of sight and reflexes, however, he'd only see the faintest blur of movement before the attacks had actually been struck and the actions have finished.

And, frankly, seeing someone seemingly that powerful to do something like that froze Heiwa in a mixture of fear and intrigue, eyes wide as she watched for what he'd do. * - Fri Oct  9 01:21:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) only registered the pain of impact within his mind, the child's attention so engrossed on the sights he was seeing. Kojiro's arm being near ripped off from its socket, the Raikage being brutalized at speeds he couldn't even comprehend, and plenty of other bystanders being murdered in the warmest of bloods. Everyone, everywhere was dying directly infront of him with the child being unable to even see the target racing around him. The fear would be crippling enough that he'd make no motion of action as Nina rammed into him and carried him off using the Shunshin technique.

When he was finally let go a major distance away from the speeding star, Heiwa would fall to his knees coughing loudly from the pain of her running into him. He looked up, making the best out of what his sight could make of to see who his assailant was and begin to piece together what had happened. It wasn't the speeding star that had attacked him? "W-Where are we!" The boy yells out through pained breaths. "Where's everybody else!?" With the deaths all around the normally neutral attitude of the child made way for true emotions.* - Fri Oct  9 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) gritted his teeth, his glare growing in intensity for several moments before he finally looked away - seeing from all the way back they were how vast the destruction was. The entirety of the kage manor had been destroyed. And likely everyone who had been there. And here he was, again, being saved from all of this carnage. Saved despite everyone dying.

All focus of Nina being there faded as he stared at that crater and brought his hands up to his chest, interlocking them infront of himself. It was all so surreal. His chakra begins to lower within his body, reaching smaller point than it had previously been before surging upwards finally unclogging any genjutsus that might have been there. When he felt that happened he opened his eyes again, seeing the crater still very much so existant.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stared at the village. Where as before there were mountains and houses being toppled over, now there was silence. Just the single lone crater still visible. "..Is it over?"* - Fri Oct  9 02:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I think it is.... - Fri Oct  9 02:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) places his hand on the ground pushing himself back up to his feet. Without saying a word to Nina the boy would begin walking back to where they'd escaped from just shortly before, intending to see the remainder first hand.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) lowered his head, another bout of tears crossing over his face as he saw both the dire state of Niza and of Kojiro. Everyone was dying or already dead. Eventually he did see from the corner of his eye someone else on the ground, and would run over to Lyala. Seemingly he'd be the only one to do so, but considering all the other npcs that weren't being mourned..that was something expected. Not everyone could be focused on someone.

"M-Miss Lyala!" The child nudges her as if trying to wake her up. Hopefully, ya know, she wasn't bleeding everywhere and shit.* - Fri Oct  9 03:12:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) only knew of two medics since his mother had died. Misa, who would possibly be anywhere, and the one he'd just met - Genesis. The child's gaze turns from Lyala and onto the grieving woman - but then suddenly Misa arrives making that not even needed! 

"Miss Misa!" The child calls out, trying to grab her attention. "Miss Lyala needs some help!" Heiwa wasn't stupid. The nigga knew Kojiro was dead.* - Fri Oct  9 03:22:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) lowered his head. The child simply didn't have all of the answers. "Someone..something attacked everyone. Mister Raikage got hit too." He says, making a gesture to the deceased Kojiro and then towards Lyala. "Mister Raikage was just taken to the hospital.."

Something to consider is that the hospital was likely a part of the mansion, as in it would be a crater now.* - Fri Oct  9 03:29:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) only saw the brief glimpse of it all - the kage being lifted up from the child's own bed sheets by the girl who took the man, not into a hospital, but into Hideki's residence. That moment and that action brought up many questions in his mind, but the fact that someone he trusted, Misa, had asked if he was capable of fighting just moments before taking him here made it clear what might be the case.

The Raikage may have just been murdered. Misa beats him to the punch, subdueing the woman before the child could do much to react and giving him an order. Without hesitation the young boy nods and moves over to the lifeless body of the lord of Kumogakure, sizing him up and down and nudging him on seemingly less painful edges trying to wake him up. However, there'd be no breath coming from him. It'd be almost as if..

"I think he's dead!" The child darts his head over to Misa exclaiming that aloud for her, feeling the lack of energy within the kages own body. This was not good.* - Fri Oct  9 04:27:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) leaned up against Lyala, not moving at all against the motion of bringing him in close. However, when Hideki walked in his eyes would trail immediately over to him.* - Fri Oct  9 05:22:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Yeah. - Fri Oct  9 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I'm surprised Ambrocio didn't break any bones yet. - Fri Oct  9 05:25:58 2015
