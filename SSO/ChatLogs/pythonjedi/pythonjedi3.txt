<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Alright. - Sun Oct  4 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Pay close attention, Heiwa. - Sun Oct  4 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took careful note of the hand signs being used, followed by the general movements of his body acting together. From that he could see the breath being taken in, the small moment of time holding it, and then the release. Just from watching carefully and paying attention he was able to get the basic idea of what he had done. And it was most certaintly a powerful looking jutsu when it was unleashed.

Giving a nod towards Hideki, Heiwa stands up and brings his hands together interlocked infront of his chest. Carefully he'd mimick through the series of hand seals he was shown, very clear images of what Hideki had done flashing in his mind as he moulded his chakra. The child would then take in a deep breath, and exhale it out carrying his chakra along with it.

Without a proper amount of time in mixing the end result was simple - a failure of the techniques true power. A very small spurt of fire exits from him despite the drain being very real against his chakra reserves forcing him to take a set and a breath back from it all. But even as he failed, he quickly began to understand what he had done wrong.

Without giving much time to Hideki to help him fix it, the child steps forward again bringing his hands through the formation of animals. With each one his chakra was moulded into a different pattern as it circulated through his body and around himself. It'd be the nature of the Katon element which his body was the most attuned to naturally due to his heritage - and that would be the element he focused in through these seals.

When he finished with those he took in a deep breath, holding it and mixing the oxygen with the chakra precisely before letting it rip. This time a small ball of fire would appear infront of him, nowhere near as powerful as Hideki's, yet definitely an acceptable amount. He'd keep this stream up for a few seconds before letting it fall, near falling himself from chakra usage.* - Sun Oct  4 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Nicely done. Don't overdue yourself, Heiwa. - Sun Oct  4 06:39:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) doesn't exchange a smile of his own, instead averting his gaze elsewhere to avoid looking at hers. "I'm okay. Uncle Hideki taught me some neat things."* - Sun Oct  4 06:58:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) snapped his eyes back to her, gaining some interest. "What is it?" the boy asks, stepping a bit closer.* - Sun Oct  4 07:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Well, here. - Sun Oct  4 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) takes the scroll from her, and nods his head, briefly showing a genuine bit of a smile on his face. "Thank you." the child says to the woman, bowing his head in general respect. * - Sun Oct  4 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Hehe, no problem. - Sun Oct  4 07:12:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) sees the fgt comin an mak handseals trap in gernjutsu* - Sun Oct  4 16:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) steps up to Niza again, the child having a new proposal this time. "Hey, Mister Raikage. Can I try another jutsu on you?" * - Sun Oct  4 17:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Sure. - Sun Oct  4 17:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Can we go outside then? - Sun Oct  4 17:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Sure. - Sun Oct  4 17:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded. "Okay. I'm ready," the child says aloud to the kage, bringing his hands up infront of his chest interlocking them between eachother. Through five sets of hand seals he'd rotate through, a discernable delay between each one showing a sense of unfamiliarity with their usage still. For the entire process his eyes remained on Niza, no longer a cold stare like the child normally had, but a bit more energy in his actions. When he finally released through the final one he'd send a surge of chakra out of his body and hold his hands up high in the air as if he were straining to control something.* - Sun Oct  4 17:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) kept his hands raised high above his head, a sudden sweltering heat sweeping through the area as something formed above the child. In very short time at all a massive ball of flames forms above him, starting out as a small bit of fire that pulsatingly expanded out to a massive length. A confident smirk crosses across Heiwa's face, and quickly his arms descend out towards the Raikage as if he were throwing something heavy towards him. 

As if on command the giant ball of flames slowly starts inching towards the area the Raikage was initially standing in, the heat intensifying with every second of it nearing as if there was truly a massive ball of fire headed straight towards the man and the academy behind him. Yet could a child so young truly control such destructive power? In a few seconds, if not stopped, it'd seem it would even impact against the area causing untold destruction.* - Sun Oct  4 17:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) by now knew the effects would get pretty debilitating, and so seeing the Raikage speaking so calmly  and surely through it was a pretty good indicator that he was seen through. 

"How'd you know it wasn't real?" the child asks.* - Sun Oct  4 17:58:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) presumably would have Bernadotte's attention now with Amon pointing him towards the child. Assuming such, the child went into action. Both hands are brought up to his chest, a simple rotation of his hands appearing infront of him as his chakra expanded outwards, moulding into a new shape with every seal made. And then at the end he'd expand this power outwards, finishing his hand seals and holding his hands high up into the air.* - Sun Oct  4 18:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) || Suddenly appearing directly above the child would be a small ball of flames which progressively expanded outwards into a massive ball of fire seemingly being held by the child's outstretched hands - Goku Spirit Bomb holding style. Everything, including even the intense heat of the flames could be felt from this far away, and with a wave of his hands downwards it'd begin to descend towards the red head.

As it did so the flames got even more intense, seemingly appearing as if it would crash down on him and the surrounding area in only a few seconds carrying all that heat with him.* - Sun Oct  4 18:31:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) smiled, almost sadistically at that as he saw the response from Bernadotte. His first time he actually got to see the success of his work! The flames would be descending almost fully on him by now, nearly touching at his skin when Heiwa approached him, hands formed in the seal of the ram  along the way preparing his chakra. Of course he could have just ended the jutsu at will, presumably, but this was extra training.

His hand presses against Bernadotte and resets the flow of his chakra just before the flames touched his skin immediately getting rid of all sensations of the act.* - Sun Oct  4 18:39:08 2015

His chakra would begin to then flow out from his body as he weaved a total of five hand seals, each of the symbols of the animal moulding his chakra into just the right level for what he wanted.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) || Suddenly appearing directly overhead of Heiwa would be a small spark of fire, that progressively and pulstatingly grew larger in a very short period of time. The sheer heat that would be coming off of it could be felt from the distance between Hideki and it, and after reaching maximum size it began to descend upon the man.

With its descent the heat would grow ever more real and painful, seemingly burning and crisping at his skin even if there'd be no real or physical damage - his mind would perceive it anyways as such. If not stopped in a short period of time it'd descend upon the man burning at his body fully. Of course - Heiwa would stop it before it reached that far. 

Also, this would probably only be affecting Hideki and, maybe, Misa.* - Mon Oct  5 05:03:47 2015
