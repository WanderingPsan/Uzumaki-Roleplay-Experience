<br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Why? - Sun Nov  8 01:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Are you here by yourself? - Sun Nov  8 01:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Pretty much. . I kinda got lost coming here a few times when I first left Kumogakure. - Sun Nov  8 01:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Do you have a place to stay? - Sun Nov  8 01:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: .  . . Does the hospital count? - Sun Nov  8 01:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: That's a no. - Sun Nov  8 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No. Would you be willing to stay with us? - Sun Nov  8 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Staying with us would have benifits. - Sun Nov  8 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Uhhh. . .Like? - Sun Nov  8 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: There's work. - Sun Nov  8 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmm. . . Alright. - Sun Nov  8 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: So long as I get uh. . no one interrupting me in my, uh. . research. . Yeah. - Sun Nov  8 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: If that works. - Sun Nov  8 02:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Research..you mean the studying of the plants? - Sun Nov  8 02:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . . Yeah. - Sun Nov  8 02:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Sure. - Sun Nov  8 02:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You'll have your space. - Sun Nov  8 02:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: There's no key. Officially we're not even supposed to be here. - Sun Nov  8 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) moved over to the door pressing it open. The inside was neat, but without any form of light source. There would appear to be no form of electricity visible within the house. The faint traces that weren't lit up by the outside would be kept up via candlelight. Without saying another word he'd make a gesture to her to come in, and do the same for himself.* - Sun Nov  8 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Eh. . How come you're not supposed to be here officially? - Sun Nov  8 02:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I left Konoha as a shinobi to follow my uncle to Kirigakure. - Sun Nov  8 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Now that he's dead I'm unsure how the hokage will take my departure. - Sun Nov  8 02:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . . I haven't seen him since he gave me the two missions. . So, I don't know.  - Sun Nov  8 02:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That's why it's unofficial. - Sun Nov  8 02:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's also not a place that we have paid for either. - Sun Nov  8 02:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We're squatting. - Sun Nov  8 02:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We have running water still, however. And food.  - Sun Nov  8 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmm. . . Do you get bills coming here in regards to the water then? - Sun Nov  8 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yes and no. This house used to belong to a man named Nozumi.  - Sun Nov  8 02:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The water was paid well in advance..for another month I'd wager. - Sun Nov  8 02:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The water bill was paid months in advance. About another month should be left I'd wager. - Sun Nov  8 02:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Electricity not so fortunate. - Sun Nov  8 02:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hm. .  How much money do you get? - Sun Nov  8 02:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: *have - Sun Nov  8 02:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) takes a turn away from Nori, the child himself stepping up to the counter. He'd reach down into a drawer and pull out a rather large wad of cash. It'd number in several tens of thousands in Yen. He'd toss that over to Nori.

"Enough." he states, allowing her to see through it if she wanted.* - Sun Nov  8 02:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hmm Nori was it? I could give you an important job right now. One that will pay one thousand but it's a continous job. - Sun Nov  8 02:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: We want you to speak to the Hokage everytime we need you to or desire you to. Not sure what he thinks about us being here but I rather not meet him unless I have to. - Sun Nov  8 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Well, the real question should be if he realized if he left in the first place. I don't really know who you are, however. - Sun Nov  8 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Aside from that. . I just need a few plants to be gathered. That's pretty much all I ask from you guys if you can help with that. - Sun Nov  8 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: A few plants huh? Alright then. - Sun Nov  8 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The same type you were talking of earlier? - Sun Nov  8 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Ehhh. . Yeah, and seven more. . I will give you pictures of them that were off of the uh book I was given. - Sun Nov  8 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Fine. Do you need help with any of the research? - Sun Nov  8 03:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Ehh, more or less. I only got pictures. - Sun Nov  8 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: With names, of course. - Sun Nov  8 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Didn't you say you worked with one of them? - Sun Nov  8 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Tried it in staunching blood loss? - Sun Nov  8 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And..smoking it? - Sun Nov  8 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yeah. I had to put my own notes on my own experiments. - Sun Nov  8 03:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Smoking plants? Sounds nasty. - Sun Nov  8 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: It makes you relaxed. - Sun Nov  8 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Is that all it does? - Sun Nov  8 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . . . It also makes you hungry a lot and your eyes become red, almost like you haven't slept in a while. That's if you smoke a lot of it, though. - Sun Nov  8 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Basically, I call it happy medicine. .. And hungry. . - Sun Nov  8 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: So it's relatively worthless. - Sun Nov  8 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Maybe the other ones won't be.  - Sun Nov  8 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Anyways, in the morning we'll head out to gather these plants. - Sun Nov  8 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You can have the bottommost bed. - Sun Nov  8 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yumiko, you can keep the top. - Sun Nov  8 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: It helps for pain due to it's relaxing nature. - Sun Nov  8 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Not a lot of hte pain, but it helps to bare with it. - Sun Nov  8 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Which is something to take into account for if you have injuries. - Sun Nov  8 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Right. - Sun Nov  8 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Heiwa where will you sleep? - Sun Nov  8 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'll take the pillows. - Sun Nov  8 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Sure about that? - Sun Nov  8 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: There are only two beds. - Sun Nov  8 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Then take one. I don't mind taking the pillows. - Sun Nov  8 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No. I'd rather you two have it. - Sun Nov  8 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'll be fine.  - Sun Nov  8 04:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I don't mind sharing a bed with who ever. - Sun Nov  8 04:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Morning. - Sun Nov  8 15:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Morning. - Sun Nov  8 15:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Sleep well? - Sun Nov  8 15:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Well enough. Did Nori stay here? - Sun Nov  8 15:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Sun Nov  8 15:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: *yawns* - Sun Nov  8 16:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Morning. - Sun Nov  8 16:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Morning. - Sun Nov  8 16:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Got those pictures ready?  - Sun Nov  8 16:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We can go get those plants. - Sun Nov  8 16:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Huh? Oh, yeah. I have them. - Sun Nov  8 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took said pictures of herbs. Presumably they'd also come with some instruction upon how to cut them.

"Alright. This it? You know where they are?"* - Sun Nov  8 17:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: The first five should be in the village. They are medicinal drugs. The other two would need some searches outside of the village. Not in dry climates, I believe. - Sun Nov  8 17:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Fair enough. What'll you be doing? - Sun Nov  8 18:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Well, for one I am going to try and get word from the Hokage about a few things along with turn in the missions. I still want to know more on what you want me to actually do when the Hokage is around. - Sun Nov  8 18:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I don't believe that you could work in that aspect. Missions are relatively easy, and you only can get around three per mission. She was hoping for you to help us acrue funds through work. - Sun Nov  8 18:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: More I think your abilities as a medic could be more helpful than that. - Sun Nov  8 18:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Explain. - Sun Nov  8 19:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Explain what? - Sun Nov  8 19:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: How your abilities could be helpful? - Sun Nov  8 19:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Mhm. - Sun Nov  8 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Stitching our wounds after something bad happens. Helping to prevent infection. I don't know really how much I have to explain. It's well valued. - Sun Nov  8 19:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Your research into plants could also help as well. - Sun Nov  8 19:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: *sighs* - Sun Nov  8 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Something wrong? - Sun Nov  8 20:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Thinking. I already ran low on the herbs I have already. - Sun Nov  8 20:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Once I got the others, I can study them a bit more. - Sun Nov  8 20:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Probably find some ways to plant them as well. - Sun Nov  8 20:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: That's a start. - Sun Nov  8 20:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Which ones are you focusing on? - Sun Nov  8 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Mainly the ones to help with not just injuries or bare with pain, but for things like common colds and sickness. Small remedies for them. - Sun Nov  8 21:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I see. Why are you doing that? - Sun Nov  8 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Because no one else is a medic and it's either I do it, or someone else does it. . And it might be a while before someone else does it. - Sun Nov  8 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That's your only reason? - Sun Nov  8 22:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I want to do it. You don't need a reason as a medic to need to do something that's beneficial to survival. - Sun Nov  8 22:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . .Why? - Sun Nov  8 23:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I was curious of your motivations. Wondering what you were loyal to. - Sun Nov  8 23:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Would you cease being a medic the moment someone else comes around? - Sun Nov  8 23:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . . Why? - Sun Nov  8 23:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You stated that was your reason. - Sun Nov  8 23:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The lack of anyone else. - Sun Nov  8 23:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yeah, there is no medics. Probably none in Kirigakure either. And I know there was none in Kumogakure. - Sun Nov  8 23:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: *are - Sun Nov  8 23:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Likely are a few in Sunagakure. - Sun Nov  8 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Would you quit the moment that someone else becomes a medic here? - Sun Nov  8 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Your cause for being a medic no longer necessary. - Sun Nov  8 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I would be glad that there is another medic, because  now I have someone that could help me and I can help them. - Sun Nov  8 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Why would you stay?  - Sun Nov  8 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Clearly there is more to your reasoning than just what you stated. - Sun Nov  8 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Why quit being a medic? - Sun Nov  8 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I don't know if you're asking me if I will quit being a medic or quit being a shinobi for this village. - Sun Nov  8 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Being a medic. - Sun Nov  8 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) narrows his eyes, his expression hardening. "That does not detail why you're a medic, however." he states, a tint of annoyance passing by in his voice. "Are you saying you endeavor to be a medic because you are already on the path of it? And the reason you stepped on the path is due to others not being medics?"* - Sun Nov  8 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: You don't pick a profession for an artificial reason such as that. It's to help people.That's pretty much it. - Sun Nov  8 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That's what I was asking. - Sun Nov  8 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's important to know why you're doing things. - Sun Nov  8 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: To know what you're loyal to. - Sun Nov  8 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Only two things: Honesty and Loyalty.. - Sun Nov  8 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Well aware of that. - Mon Nov  9 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Are you loyal to the hokage? - Mon Nov  9 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I don't even talk to him a lot. .I only met him two or three times and third time was to ask for a mission. - Mon Nov  9 00:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What're you loyal to? - Mon Nov  9 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmm. . Loyalty in a way can be in linked with respect, right? - Mon Nov  9 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Hrm? - Mon Nov  9 00:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Can it? - Mon Nov  9 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I do not believe it is required. - Mon Nov  9 01:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hm. Then I guess I am loyal to people with a drive for something. - Mon Nov  9 01:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: If that makes sense. - Mon Nov  9 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Loyal to those with a drive for something? - Mon Nov  9 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Could you explain more? - Mon Nov  9 01:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: They have a drive. - Mon Nov  9 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Motivation. - Mon Nov  9 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: They have a goal for something. - Mon Nov  9 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I see. - Mon Nov  9 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I mean, I'm loyal to close friends. But if they mess up, I will point it out to them. - Mon Nov  9 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I won't be blindly loyal to people though. - Mon Nov  9 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: If that is where we are going with it. - Mon Nov  9 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Not fully. My questions were more to - what are your ideals you remain loyal to? - Mon Nov  9 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Uhm. - Mon Nov  9 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: My ideals? Hm. .  I uh .. Still don't follow much. - Mon Nov  9 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: *don't follow - Mon Nov  9 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What in life do you remain loyal to. The cause that strives you forward. - Mon Nov  9 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Oh, uh. I guess my own morals and uh. . . not much of a family person,and uh. . some other stuff. . - Mon Nov  9 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Other stuff? - Mon Nov  9 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov  9 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Morning. - Mon Nov  9 15:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Morning. - Mon Nov  9 15:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: How are you? - Mon Nov  9 15:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Fine. - Mon Nov  9 15:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The hokage is definitely more absent than the mizukage was. - Mon Nov  9 15:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Doing missions for the village from Nori wouldn't work. - Mon Nov  9 15:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: She hardly can get missions herself. - Mon Nov  9 15:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hmm I see.... - Mon Nov  9 15:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I've also heard this is somewhat true for Sunagakure. - Mon Nov  9 16:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Are the Kage's dying or something? - Mon Nov  9 16:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'm unsure of why they're absent. - Mon Nov  9 16:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I doubt it's death.. - Mon Nov  9 16:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mmm. - Mon Nov  9 16:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Much of this means we're likely in the clear to leave this house. - Mon Nov  9 16:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Up for some ramen? - Mon Nov  9 16:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov  9 16:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded, reaching down and pushing himself up off of the floor. "I'll leave a note for Nori when she wakes up," he says, turning to the counter and quickly scribbling out information for her. It'd be left on said counter afterwards.

"Ready?"* - Mon Nov  9 16:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) entered the ramen house, his hand moving to disentangle itself from Yumiko's just shortly before they moved past the curtains. It'd be empty at this time of day, and the man behind the counter would barely even see Heiwa due to the child's measure of stature. 

"I'll pay," he responds back to Yumiko with, before stepping up and scrambling onto the stool. There he'd order for himself a small bowl of miso ramen.* - Mon Nov  9 17:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'm up for some training after this. You want to come? - Mon Nov  9 17:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Of course. - Mon Nov  9 17:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Good. I was thinking of working on elemental ninjutsu today. - Mon Nov  9 17:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I could help with that only with suiton however. - Mon Nov  9 17:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That's fine. You're probably far more knowledgable in the field than I am. - Mon Nov  9 17:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: It is what I studied first. - Mon Nov  9 17:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. I wasn't even expected to be a shinogi at this age - wasn't even put through the academy. - Mon Nov  9 17:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If Fujitora doesn't come would you be against returning to Kirigakure? At least to see how it has fared. - Mon Nov  9 20:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Yeah.. - Mon Nov  9 20:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Ready to head out? - Mon Nov  9 20:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yeah. I am. - Mon Nov  9 20:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Also if we do travel to Kirigakure we can take samples of flowers here to there. - Mon Nov  9 20:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And take Nori too. - Mon Nov  9 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: So we can actually make use of those flowers. - Mon Nov  9 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov  9 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Lets go. - Mon Nov  9 21:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright. - Mon Nov  9 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Seems like there really isn't anyone around today. - Mon Nov  9 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ... - Mon Nov  9 22:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ...You ok there..? - Mon Nov  9 22:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov  9 22:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stopped in his tracks as he caught sight of the man, images of it all flashing quickly through his mind. His expression would harden, much of his growing anger being shown in his narrowed onyx eyes. 

<He's here..> many possibilities for why passed through his mind, but none of them were good. The child's mouth opens somewhat, whispering something low to the girl beside him as he keeps his eyes focused upwards onto the man.* - Mon Nov  9 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: We need to leave. - Mon Nov  9 22:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Mon Nov  9 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) echoed the nod, a lack of enthusiasm being expressed within the rigidity of his movements. 

Throughout it he'd keep his eyes on Ortho, catching a full gander of his doujutsu as he continued on moving to pass him by. As much as he wanted to say something, the child kept himself reared in moving alongside Yumiko.* - Mon Nov  9 23:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: He doesn't deserve those eyes. - Mon Nov  9 23:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) disentangled his hand from Yumiko, stopping in place once more. "Yeah - since you killed hundreds in Kirigakure." he says aloud. It was probably rather well known either way.* - Mon Nov  9 23:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: ...I've got myself caught up in some kind of feud... - Mon Nov  9 23:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Are you going to be doing the same here now? - Mon Nov  9 23:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: This village hasn't betrayed me. - Mon Nov  9 23:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: How did Kiri ever betray you? - Mon Nov  9 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: This is getting a little too tense... - Mon Nov  9 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: The one known as Kirie. She and I had a deal. She broke the deal then 'died'. - Mon Nov  9 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Now, you may ask what that has to do with all of Kirigakure.. - Mon Nov  9 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: But it was all of Kirigakure that tried to frame me as the person that aided in Koeki's death, - Mon Nov  9 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I told Kirie, either keep my name out of Kirigakure affairs or Kirigakure falls. - Mon Nov  9 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: The last thing she did before 'dying' is frame me again. - Mon Nov  9 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Elon and Violet lying to defend their beloved Kage. - Mon Nov  9 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I came to Kirigakure that day to assassinate Kirie and go about my business. - Mon Nov  9 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Since she was 'gone', I fucked all yours lives up. - Mon Nov  9 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Mon Nov  9 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: .... - Mon Nov  9 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: I should just walk away...yeah. - Mon Nov  9 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: But these two are just kids...I can't just walk away... - Mon Nov  9 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yes. All quiet now. - Mon Nov  9 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Quick to pass judgment  on me. - Mon Nov  9 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I should kill him here he stands.. - Mon Nov  9 23:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Kirie if that is correct deserved her death. - Mon Nov  9 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And so did Elon and Violet. - Mon Nov  9 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: But that does not change the people you killed. The others you attacked yourself did not need to die. - Mon Nov  9 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I killed two ranking people with my own bare hands. - Mon Nov  9 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Two.. - Mon Nov  9 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It's not my fault my little ol' bandits can take out the military of a massive village. - Mon Nov  9 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That's.. not my fault. - Mon Nov  9 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Now I hear there is a rumor that I killed Kirie. - Mon Nov  9 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Even if you hate me, you can clearly recall I found out about Kirie's death after you. - Mon Nov  9 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: And you were one of the first people to find out. - Mon Nov  9 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I didn't think it was you until you just said you came to assassinate her. - Mon Nov  9 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Recall what I said before you repeat them. - Tue Nov 10 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I came to Kirigakure that day to assassinate Kirie and go about my business. - Tue Nov 10 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Since she was 'gone', I fucked all yours lives up. - Tue Nov 10 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: She was 'dead' before I showed up. - Tue Nov 10 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: By who? - Tue Nov 10 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: How the -fuck- am I supposed to know? - Tue Nov 10 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I found out after -you- did.. - Tue Nov 10 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: ..... - Tue Nov 10 00:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: .... - Tue Nov 10 00:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Once again the silence of realization rains down on us. - Tue Nov 10 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Realization of just how deprived you are, yes. - Tue Nov 10 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Deprived of what? - Tue Nov 10 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Moral well-being. - Tue Nov 10 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You're a monster. - Tue Nov 10 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Morals? Where has morals gotten anyone? - Tue Nov 10 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hideki had morals.. - Tue Nov 10 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Where is he? - Tue Nov 10 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...Don't you talk about him like that. - Tue Nov 10 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Your father had morals, where is he? - Tue Nov 10 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hideki was my sensei and taught me to do what I have to do to survive. - Tue Nov 10 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Not to please anyone. - Tue Nov 10 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hell, if anything. - Tue Nov 10 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll just kill you now. - Tue Nov 10 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: She worked her shinobi like they were mules. - Tue Nov 10 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Nothing more, much less. - Tue Nov 10 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yet I'm wrong for attempting to rid Kirigakure of her masked tyranny? - Tue Nov 10 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: After she soiled my name and what I stood for so I don't threaten to start a revolution..? - Tue Nov 10 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I have morals, boy.. I have morals that you will never understand. - Tue Nov 10 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Not until you understand what it truly takes to be a man of this shinobi world. - Tue Nov 10 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Until then, continue the blame game. - Tue Nov 10 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Someone got to Kire before I did. The day I find out who is the day I grant them riches. - Tue Nov 10 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...The missions were asked for. They weren't forced upon anyone. Kirigakure was rebuilding and it quickly did so with our work. - Tue Nov 10 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I never said they weren't asked for. - Tue Nov 10 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Like Konoha which flourished far more under Hideki than it has Zeus. - Tue Nov 10 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I asked for the ratio between missions and learning. - Tue Nov 10 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: What did you learn under Kirie's reign compared to the funds you aided her with? - Tue Nov 10 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: So you kill the tree for not bearing fruit in the winter? - Tue Nov 10 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Is that what you're saying? - Tue Nov 10 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I kill the weed that prevented the seeds from growing. - Tue Nov 10 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I've learned nothing from any of the kages. Konoha, Kiri, Kumo.  - Tue Nov 10 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: But you won't understand that, would you. - Tue Nov 10 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Then who are you to determine if my actions are right or wrong? - Tue Nov 10 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You're as much of a nomad as me. - Tue Nov 10 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: At least I have the nuts to stand up for myself. - Tue Nov 10 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Most of this conversation you hid behind that girl and get quiet. - Tue Nov 10 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Is killing hundreds that didn't deserve it 'standing up for yourself'? - Tue Nov 10 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I laid no finger on any of the military troops. - Tue Nov 10 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I killed two people. - Tue Nov 10 00:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hideki has killed many more than me in the name of change. - Tue Nov 10 00:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The fireball you shot atop that snake? - Tue Nov 10 00:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Do you salt his name? - Tue Nov 10 00:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And the damage your snake itself caused? - Tue Nov 10 00:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: My fireball breathes oxygen. Where it lands once I shoot it in the air is none of my concern. - Tue Nov 10 00:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: My snake has a mind of its own. - Tue Nov 10 00:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Avoiding all aspects of blame. I'm not the one playing the blame game. You are. - Tue Nov 10 00:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Shifting it off to whatever is most convient. - Tue Nov 10 00:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Avoid the blame? I accept the blame, boy. I embrace it. I welcome it with opened arms and I kiss it with passion. The blame game is nothing more than me being recognized for starting a movement. - Tue Nov 10 00:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Am I wrong for doing so? I don't care. - Tue Nov 10 00:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A movement? - Tue Nov 10 00:30:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) finds a house in the more rundown side of town. It'd be unlocked and show obvious signs of not being actively used as a house. Such as not having any sort of family pictures or portraits. Or not having any food in the fridge. Or anything in the garbage at all. And nothing of entertainment value.

Strangely enough it'd retain water and electrical functions, however.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded, his gaze turning to Yumiko. "Shall we then?" As he said so he'd offer his hand out for her to take.* - Thu Nov 12 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) steps up to the academy, Yumiko following beside him with her right hand interlocked with his left. As they made a position infront of him he'd disentangle himself from the joining before taking several steps to the side making some more room. 

Onyx eyes would glance around at the area, looking to see if anyone else was here. <Are we early..?>* - Thu Nov 12 04:17:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) crooked his head back, hearing the voice he remembered to be the actual mizukage. And then the reply from someone who, presumably, hadn't held his same voice. Either way - it was enough to get him at least a bit concerned over that whole thing.

Heiwa takes a quick couple steps back so as to keep both of them within his site before anything actually ends up going down. He'd sort of play a witness at the moment curious of what was happening.* - Thu Nov 12 04:27:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) says: It's weighed on me enough for now, and I have other things to do. - Thu Nov 12 06:35:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I don't belong here. - Thu Nov 12 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: So he was a pawn of Ortho. I guess it's good it ended with him not being in control. - Thu Nov 12 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) says: If I did, I wouldn't have been attacked. - Thu Nov 12 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I obviously wasn't doing a good enough job. - Thu Nov 12 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) thinks: ..That's more like it. - Thu Nov 12 06:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) watched the proceeding bits of the fight, taking as much information from all of this as he could. Various tid-bits of the information was further focused on by the child, namely including the bits about Ortho's involvement in all of this. If Jehan died it'd mean likely another invasion by Ortho. But if Ortho was allowed free understanding and knowledge about Heiwa being in Kirigakure there was no chance for it to grow into a sovereign state.

As the attack from Jehan went out Heiwa remained initially unsure of whether to jump in or not, but the added potential help from Hachirou was enough for him. A quick hand is sent darting over to his backpouch slinging out a dark, blackened edge as the child quickly stands up on his toes making a dash towards the area the Mizukage was just previously held in. It'd be a considerable blur to any person casually watching him, his foot steps being a tell tale sound of his movement. 

It'd be sent moving towards the mass of tentacles and tendrils, but instead of running directly into the mass Heiwa would make a surprising and considerable leap across it. Using the kunai that he previously had pulled out he used that as a stepping platform to quickly gain further air and leap higher and over the mass of blackness. As he landed it'd be on his feet, his toes twisting off to the side with the child facing far closer to the group with a peripheral vision on how the Mizukage and the tentacles were being handled. * - Thu Nov 12 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) quickly brought both of his hands up to his chest, the child following the movements of Jehan most carefully. He was being ignored - but perhaps his feint had worked for the swordsman. A simple rotation of hand seals, the first two being started as his eyes scanned across to find the swordsman that he was looking for. It'd be somewhat brutal of an action to perform, but if he had to manipulate him he was ready to do so.

But before the final hand seal were made and his chakra was expanded out from him Hachirou's own attack had suddenly occurred. Whether the outcome it was clear and plain that, frankly, his assistance wasn't even necessary. The child holds the second seal, not yet finishing in the crafting of his jutsu until everything was fully seen. Mostly, however, he was a bit caught off guard from it all.* - Thu Nov 12 07:16:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) blinks, accepting the money. Part of him though, off of habit, would take a bit of a close look at the ryo making sure some nigga didn't put explosive tags on the bank notes. THESE NIGGAS ARE SAVAGE, AIGHT? Assuming so, he'd continue holding onto the money without any further problem.

"Uh - Thank you." Assuming, of course, no shenanigans with the bank notes he'd nod and bow his head lightly, a polite gesture made from Heiwa's upbringing. You didn't slouch around Ushinawa.* - Thu Nov 12 07:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Very well... - Thu Nov 12 07:44:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Ah...Because your name isn't in the ledger...I cannot pay you..I'm sorry. I'll have to send for an update to the ledger..It could take something like six months. - Thu Nov 12 07:44:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: And I expect there..To be payment. - Thu Nov 12 07:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I hope this doesn't escalate to another B rank mission.. - Thu Nov 12 07:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: You want me to try under another name? - Thu Nov 12 07:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: Why not just toss the ryo over here. - Thu Nov 12 07:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: I will as soon as the Ledger is updated...Honestly. I want to pay you right now..But I cannot until you tell me your real name, assuming you gave me a false one like Heiwa here. - Thu Nov 12 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: I gave you a false one, for my own protection. I don't even know who you are, and from what I've seen, you seem to wield a rather, strange ability. - Thu Nov 12 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: I want the payment...Here and now.. - Thu Nov 12 07:46:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Bring it mate. - Thu Nov 12 07:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: And please...Forgive Heiwa for his transgressions...I don't intend to cause you any harm...And my ability is simply a special sort of elemental chakra. - Thu Nov 12 07:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: What can it do. - Thu Nov 12 07:51:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Aye...Now...If you'd all excuse me...We can take care of this meeting later...Please...Bury the body..I need to rest. - Thu Nov 12 07:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Actually... - Thu Nov 12 07:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: I'd like Heiwa and Hachirou to accompany me to Sunagakure in a few days. - Thu Nov 12 07:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: . . . . .Sure. - Thu Nov 12 07:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..To Sunagakure? - Thu Nov 12 07:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Yes. It will be a C rank Escort mission. - Thu Nov 12 07:57:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Yumiko. - Thu Nov 12 07:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: And why exactly did you simply sit back and watch while I was attacked and nearly killed? - Thu Nov 12 07:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Two people claiming to be kage didn't know who to support until Ortho's name was thrown into it. - Thu Nov 12 08:02:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That was gorey. - Thu Nov 12 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Yeah. - Thu Nov 12 08:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: By the way...what was said about owning that house. - Thu Nov 12 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We're good to go. - Thu Nov 12 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Lets head home then. - Thu Nov 12 08:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Right..We'll have to be prepared in the morning. - Thu Nov 12 08:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No telling if they'll be ready to head to Suna. - Thu Nov 12 08:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..And thanks for coming. - Thu Nov 12 08:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I wouldn't want to be near that brute alone. - Thu Nov 12 08:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) still had a few missions that he needed to do, even if it was the previous kage that had given him them. It was likely that he'd still be able to get a completion rating for them, so Heiwa wasn't too terribly concerned that it'd be all for nothing. The first place he'd get ready to go to was that of digging a hole - as it was right next to the spot that wanted for him to fill said hole. <Can knock out two of them relatively quickly.> 

However, on the way to the mission site he'd hear the village announcement blaring through the area making it quite clear he really didn't have much time to do that either. <I guess this takes precedent,> he says, turning on his heel and facing towards the direction of the gates intent on accomplishing this mission at a later time.* - Thu Nov 12 20:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: Alright. - Thu Nov 12 20:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: I don't know about Yumiko. - Thu Nov 12 20:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Hmm.... - Thu Nov 12 20:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: What do you think about taking Heiwa and leaving the girl here? - Thu Nov 12 20:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: Sounds like a plan. - Thu Nov 12 20:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Yeah I like the idea as well.. - Thu Nov 12 20:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..I heard you wanted to leave behind Yumiko. - Thu Nov 12 20:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Yeah. I don't quite need three bodyguards. Honestly I only need one of you, but I'm sure you'd both like to go. - Thu Nov 12 20:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: So...When would you two like to leave? - Thu Nov 12 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: Whenever. I don't care when. - Thu Nov 12 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: It'd be better to appease the brute. And I'm not sure if Yumiko could handle him if it goes bad. - Thu Nov 12 20:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Now is fine, if you'd like. - Thu Nov 12 20:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Very well. Let's leave out. I'll pay the caravan and we can go. - Thu Nov 12 20:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) also went on that caravan, the child paying far more attention to Hachirou throughout the ride just in case. Niggas be savage.* - Thu Nov 12 20:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Hello Miss...Is there a Jounin around? - Thu Nov 12 21:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Greetings, uh.... I'm guessing by the color of hat /Mizu/Kage..? Ah... - Thu Nov 12 21:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Probably. I can go get one to talk at them. Can I ask what brings you to Suna? - Thu Nov 12 21:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Official Busness. - Thu Nov 12 21:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Got it.. - Thu Nov 12 21:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) thinks: God that bitch was ugly. - Thu Nov 12 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) thinks: That bitch ugly too. - Thu Nov 12 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) thinks: She's ugly too. - Thu Nov 12 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Is everyone just going to look at eachother and do nothing? - Thu Nov 12 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: They can't be expecting an attack from three people. Why are they all hesitating? - Thu Nov 12 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) thinks: I came to take names - Thu Nov 12 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) echoed a similar expression of Hachirou, his onyx eyes scanning across the gathering of shinobi at the gates. * - Thu Nov 12 21:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) whispers: Don't tell anyone you killed the Thread Monster Hachirou. - Thu Nov 12 21:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) whispers: Tch... - Thu Nov 12 21:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Would you like to see the Kazekage now or rest before? I'm sure it was a long trip. - Thu Nov 12 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Sure, Kiyoko--thanks. - Thu Nov 12 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mn-hm. - Thu Nov 12 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: I'd like to rest first.  - Thu Nov 12 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) moved to follow behind the grouping, his eyes occasionally being brought off of them to take in the full vision of Sunagakure. It was his first time being in the village. Likely it'd also be his first time seeing a village that was doing well off and not completely destroyed. * - Thu Nov 12 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: It's fine. I didn't expect any sort of a welcome besides my meeting with the Kazekage...But I'm sorry for imposing.. - Thu Nov 12 21:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It's our pleasure to accommodate you. - Thu Nov 12 21:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Uh.. Sure... - Thu Nov 12 21:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) thinks: They call this a fucking suite? - Thu Nov 12 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: The accomodations are lovely. - Thu Nov 12 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) thinks: I don't like small spaces. - Thu Nov 12 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Thank you. - Thu Nov 12 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I'm pretty sure most of those looked like prisoners.. - Thu Nov 12 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Well...We'll rest up..Whem the Kazekage is ready...We'll meet with him. - Thu Nov 12 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Your food and drinks should arrive soon, but there is sake chilled in the refridgeration and room temperature sake in the liquor cabinets if you wish to indulge, Lord Mizukage. - Thu Nov 12 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Otherwise, I will leave you be and alert the Kazekage of your arrival. - Thu Nov 12 21:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Very we- What's your name? - Thu Nov 12 21:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yan. - Thu Nov 12 21:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Very well. - Thu Nov 12 21:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Thank you. - Thu Nov 12 21:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: My pleasure, sir. - Thu Nov 12 21:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Could you two guard the door outside? I need to take a quick Nap before I speak to the Kazekage. - Thu Nov 12 21:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded, and went outside of the room allowing the kage his time alone.* - Thu Nov 12 21:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Yo. - Thu Nov 12 22:03:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: I have no idea, who this Trilliam person is.  - Thu Nov 12 22:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Why you guys outside? - Thu Nov 12 22:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: The Mizukage is sleeping inside this room. - Thu Nov 12 22:05:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: ....? - Fri Nov 13 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Jehan..? - Fri Nov 13 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) whispers: The one I killed. That was his name. - Fri Nov 13 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: -...What happened to Jehan..? - Fri Nov 13 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: No idea. He dissappeared recently. Said he was going to find himself. - Fri Nov 13 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: He was feeling depressed. - Fri Nov 13 02:39:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: He didn't say. Had something to do with that....Ortho character. - Fri Nov 13 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: You seem to know a lot about him.. - Fri Nov 13 02:42:33 2015
