<br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took an idle step back as she got back up, the spar being somewhat reset into a neutral ground. Knowing this, the child would watch the girl carefully, taking note of the movements that she would make. Indeed - even with the fact that his speed and mobility of striking were shot from the lack of familiarity he held with the weapon - it'd still be relatively easy to determine that if she was gathering herself lower on the ground that it'd mean only one thing.

Heiwa subtley pulls upwards a small measure, the child standing directly on his toes where there was less surface tension touching the ground. It wouldn't be a movement that required very much time to shift into - and he'd tap into it quickly as she made for the charge against him. 

Still carrying the weapon in his hand - it'd shift and fidget far more than usual. Less focus was being kept on the wooden weapon in his hand which left it to become a larger burden. It'd highlight further of his weaknesses, but much of it wouldn't matter in this case and moment. His speed and reflexes picked off from where they were previously - her charge being gracefully stepped past with a very conscious effort on Heiwa's part to counter her strike with his own.

Instead of merely stepping past her - the child also steps inwards, brushing briefly against her body before turning back and carrying the blade forward in that movement. Hitting her on the rebound of her strike the blunt weapon would come to hit sharply against her rear end. It'd require several series of steps to make the full motion work - but it was at this point that Heiwa was bringing it all together in using his heightened movement to string it all accordingly. * - Sun Nov 15 08:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says:   - Sun Nov 15 08:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) felt the sting of the impact as it connected against her, the wooden weapon wobbling a bit around in his hand from the recoil. "Tch.." It still remained as a burden to the child. Taking a step back he rests his previously tip-toed feet back onto the ground gathering more surface tension while at the same time steadying his weapon once more. If it weren't for the sudden use of the weapon in the counter - added with his inexperience - this simply wouldn't have happened.

But momentarily it kept him preoccupied straining his time to take note of Nori's own attack. As it came in he quickly pulled himself back, preparing to take evasive action around the time the Mizukage spoke. The child takes a step a bit too far - his balance falls off and the kick comes around during his recovery knocking him clean off his feet and crashing hard against the soft ground below him.

It'd hurt, but aside from the minor impact it wouldn't leave much else to it. Assuming he was given the proper space after her attack had gone off, the child would pull himself up just now making full understanding of what the Mizukage had said. "We got there as quick as we could. But you weren't there when we did," he says, rubbing the back of his head.* - Sun Nov 15 08:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Would you be averse to training alongside me? - Sun Nov 15 09:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) turns away from Nori who was already beginning to head into the house, the child's eyes coming to rest on the Mizukage. A brow would be raised as he looked at him. "You're going to be fighting against Ortho?" the child asks, already beginning to think of that as a bad idea. There was much Heiwa knew that Ortho could do - and much still he hadn't known. "Do you have some sort of idea or plan? Or is that what you're asking for?"* - Sun Nov 15 09:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: So you ask for my help when you don't feel that you can trust me? - Sun Nov 15 09:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: It's not that I can't trust you. In fact, you're one of the few shinobi I feel I -can- trust. - Sun Nov 15 09:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: It's more so...You're one shinobi out of...Thousands.. - Sun Nov 15 09:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: That's not too good of odd in my favour. - Sun Nov 15 09:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And Ortho is just one as well.. - Sun Nov 15 09:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: But I can't imagine he wouldn't be able to mop the floor with me with ease. - Sun Nov 15 09:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Eh..Pessimism... - Sun Nov 15 09:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Pessimism... - Sun Nov 15 09:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Considering he took on hundreds of shinobis when he destroyed the village - yeah. He might be able to. - Sun Nov 15 09:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He has some flaws. - Sun Nov 15 09:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Namely he has showed some of his cards. - Sun Nov 15 09:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Hm? Like his summons you mean? - Sun Nov 15 09:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He utilizes snake summoning. It's..a summon I'm familiar with. - Sun Nov 15 09:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If he utilizes that..I know a few of the techniques that he might use. - Sun Nov 15 09:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Really? That's invaluable information. - Sun Nov 15 09:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Beyond the summon I'm sure you're aware of, the summon that he used directly to overwhelm the mob, there might be a few others he would know. - Sun Nov 15 09:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: From what Uncle Hideki and Misa showed.. - Sun Nov 15 09:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: True...I've seen him use a technique where snakes extended from his sleeves.. - Sun Nov 15 09:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Being able to summon them out from their sleeves are also common usages. A poison capable of incapacitating very quickly - and several small snakes extending at a fast pace from it. - Sun Nov 15 09:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: And I've heard he may utilize Katon ninjutsu. - Sun Nov 15 09:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I've seen him use the Fireball jutsu. - Sun Nov 15 09:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: So it's likely... - Sun Nov 15 09:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He might also be able to summon an anaconda sized snake from his sleeve. - Sun Nov 15 09:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Which is durable enough and strong enough to stop a shinobi in their tracks. - Sun Nov 15 09:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: With the summoning being very very fast. - Sun Nov 15 09:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Hmm...That cou- Wait...Anaconda..A large snake that constricts... - Sun Nov 15 09:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Hmm... - Sun Nov 15 09:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: In short he has a lot of close ranged binding. - Sun Nov 15 09:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And some minor long ranged abilities so far.  - Sun Nov 15 09:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Katon can be used quite efficiently at long range - provided enough chakra is used in the formation of it. - Sun Nov 15 09:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Knowing he can use katon it's likely he has access to some long ranged possibiltiies. - Sun Nov 15 09:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Hmm..Indeed. - Sun Nov 15 09:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He also will have capability to use Genjutsu. - Sun Nov 15 09:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Genjutsu? Tch, that's one of the few things I don't have much if any ability with. - Sun Nov 15 09:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. It would be centered in his eyes as the trigger. - Sun Nov 15 09:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If you don't look there it wouldn't cause anything. - Sun Nov 15 09:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Hmm...How do you know so much about his abilities? - Sun Nov 15 09:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: My Uncle taught him before Ortho became what he is. - Sun Nov 15 09:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Other parts are just observation. - Sun Nov 15 09:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: And the contracts that indivduals must sign in order to utilize it? - Sun Nov 15 09:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) raised his brow initially at the first question, ready to ask what he meant. But then the follow up arrived. "I do. Why?"* - Sun Nov 15 09:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: I intend on seeking out an animal with which I can sign a contract. The issue with that is, of the three summoners I've met, they've all refused to assist me in this. - Sun Nov 15 09:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Or they had animals which wouldn't be compatible with me whatsoever..Such as...Groundhogs and such. - Sun Nov 15 09:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I know of someone who uses Tapir summoning. - Sun Nov 15 09:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: I'm not sure if that'd be a good fit..Do you know anyone who utilizes a flying creature? Or even a reptilian creature such as a Komodo Lizard. - Sun Nov 15 09:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Are you intending to somehow use this against Ortho? - Sun Nov 15 09:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Well. Not neccessarily. I mean, having signed a contract with an animal, I intended on working intently with these animals so that I could gain their trust and gain a wider use of their abilities...But I don't very well believe that obtaining a contract with a summon would just for the sake of fighting him would be very...Honorable or respectful in regards to the creatures. - Sun Nov 15 09:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: In regards to the creatures. - Sun Nov 15 09:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: But if they are willing to fight alongside me...Then that's just a plus. - Sun Nov 15 09:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Hmm. You could always try to garner more trust in the summoning than Ortho has. - Sun Nov 15 09:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I know a woman named Misa. I last saw her in Konoha. She may be in Sunagakure now. - Sun Nov 15 09:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: If my contract scroll wasn't sealed it'd be a different story. - Sun Nov 15 09:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: She used snakes for summoning. - Sun Nov 15 09:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Misa? Wait..You mean for me to...Sign a contract with the snakes, and essentially...Outsnake him? - Sun Nov 15 09:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If he uses a giant snake you doing the same could even the playing field. - Sun Nov 15 09:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's a thought - but garnering their respect to that level would be difficult to do. - Sun Nov 15 09:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Hmm..I agree... - Sun Nov 15 09:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Eh. You've been a giant help Heiwa...I'm going to go work on developing some sort of technique to bind a target in place...If you want you could help. - Sun Nov 15 09:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: About that.. - Sun Nov 15 09:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Hm? - Sun Nov 15 09:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I guess now is as good as ever to attempt it.. - Sun Nov 15 09:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Could you stand still for a moment? - Sun Nov 15 09:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Uhm....Sure.... - Sun Nov 15 09:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) truly had no ill intent for the kage. Keeping the same generally indifferent expression attributed to the child, it'd appear softer than most he'd spent time around. In some sense he felt helping the kage would be helping to keep Kirigakure free from the carnage that he knew Ortho was intent on doing.

"Just wait a moment," the child says, bringing his hands up to his chest and rotating through a simple set of hand seals. His chakra would surge and on the final one he pressed his palms against the grass infusing it into the dirt below him. Suddenly iron chains spawn out from the ground, near just as durable as iron in fact. They rush over towards the Mizukage at a steady pace moving to wrap themselves around and constrict his body together in a form of binding.

<Chains of Absolution.>* - Sun Nov 15 09:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) 's visage broke into a smirk, some level of pride being taken from seeing his ability to use it so quickly. 

"It's a technique that the woman in that last mission used," the child explained, reaching back into his pouch to pull out a scroll. During the motion the chains would begin to relax and unwind from his body allowing him free motion of movement. They'd disappear back into the ground as Heiwa tossed a scroll to the man. "She had this on her person. Alongside another."* - Sun Nov 15 10:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Another jutsu scroll. - Sun Nov 15 10:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Really? Why didn't you tell me about them when you returned from the mission? Hmm, no matter. What is the other technique? If you've learned it that is. - Sun Nov 15 10:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I hadn't even remembered about it. - Sun Nov 15 10:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yumiko being injured..I was focused on that. - Sun Nov 15 10:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) would agree to show the Mizukage another demonstration - even if he was beginning to grow exhausted from it all. He was confident in his reserves that he could pull it off and remain standing, the occasional tipping over the point of exhaustion being something the child had surprisingly done a few times before. In a more darker period of his past before coming to Kirigakure.

Once more a series of hand seals are done infront of his chest, the child facing away and marking his target as not the man in question. It'd instead be a rather large tree. When the technique had fully erupted the ground would begin shaking and splitting apart, Heiwa himself taking hold of something solid to retain his step throughout it. A giant statue-like neko of pure iron would suddenly appear out from the split clamping around the trunk of the tree wrapping it all over in chains before digging it back down into the earth it had came from.

The tree wouldn't be much of a match for the technique, it rather quickly being able to bring it under the chasm of earth with the roots snapping and breaking apart from the strain. Heiwa himself would stare watching at it. It wasn't his first usage of the technique, like the one prior, but it was still an impactful jutsu that he was mentally still not used to.

"She's..good," the response would be late and a bit breathful, the exhaustion hitting him. "Nori fixed up her wound somewhat. It's still there, but it's able to heal faster now."* - Sun Nov 15 10:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I don't..have it on me. Yumiko should have it. - Sun Nov 15 10:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Ah. Very well. I'll retrieve it from her when she's done with it...God I could kiss you Heiwa! You're a geni- Are you a Genjutsu user? - Sun Nov 15 10:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..I am..Why? - Sun Nov 15 10:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Would you be willing to accompany me when I go to battle Ortho? - Sun Nov 15 10:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...I don't know if I'd be able to fight him. That snake he brings out is massive.. - Sun Nov 15 10:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: That snake will be his downfall. If he focuses upon using it, then I can easily overtake him by having you incapacitate him using a genjutsu and then bam! I land the coup de grace. - Sun Nov 15 10:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Ngh..Do you have a planned date for this then? - Sun Nov 15 10:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: No not yet... - Sun Nov 15 10:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: But when it occurs, I'll be ready. - Sun Nov 15 10:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If I'm around then of course. I'm sure any shinobi in Kirigakure would want to stop him after what he had done. - Sun Nov 15 10:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Aye. - Sun Nov 15 10:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: My arm is in much better condition now. Only slight pain here and there but over all I'm doing alright. - Sun Nov 15 10:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: That's great. I'm glad to hear you're getting better. - Sun Nov 15 10:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Not just yet. Reason being is because I had the problem of needing to learn another technique since shunshin was one of the few things I needed to practice. - Sun Nov 15 10:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: I don't catch your drift. - Sun Nov 15 10:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He means the technique you just saw me use. - Sun Nov 15 10:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Are you done with that scroll? - Sun Nov 15 10:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Ah then yes. - Sun Nov 15 10:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Oh. What scroll did you think I meant? - Sun Nov 15 10:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Eh, that's inconsequential. Would you mind giving me the cat scroll? I'll go and place it in the archives. It shall be a Hiden Secret Technique of Kirigakure no Sato. - Sun Nov 15 10:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Come inside. - Sun Nov 15 10:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yeah..right. Could you help me up..? - Sun Nov 15 10:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) helps her out some, moving his own arm to wrap around her with less difficulty on her part. As well he would also lift up some himself - having her not need to take the full slack. 

Using a jutsu with only a tiny bit of percentage left before passing out. Perhaps not the greatest thing to do.* - Sun Nov 15 10:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: You alright? - Sun Nov 15 10:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yeah..just..tired. That drains a lot.. - Sun Nov 15 10:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Thanks for the help. - Sun Nov 15 10:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I know the feeling. When I tried that technique I felt a huge pull on my reserves before only getting what look like a weaker version of it. Also any time. - Sun Nov 15 10:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The kage..intends to fight Ortho. - Sun Nov 15 10:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I figured you'd like to know.  - Sun Nov 15 10:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He offered me an invitation..alongisde presumably any other shinobi. - Sun Nov 15 10:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If you want your revenge. - Sun Nov 15 10:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Was he the one who... - Sun Nov 15 11:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He's the one who caused this to happen to Kirigakure. - Sun Nov 15 11:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The one who invaded twice. - Sun Nov 15 11:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The one we met in Konoha. - Sun Nov 15 11:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Yeah....enough is enough. - Sun Nov 15 11:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: We can't...keep running. - Sun Nov 15 11:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Then we're together with this.. - Sun Nov 15 11:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Always. - Sun Nov 15 11:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Good..Good. - Sun Nov 15 11:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) 's voice would begin cutting off on that, his eyes beginning to grow heavy. Resting against Yumiko he'd begin falling asleep, a smile on his face.* - Sun Nov 15 11:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Ah hello there. - Mon Nov 16 00:32:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: The jutsu that you did that brought on that prison. - Mon Nov 16 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: How did you. . ? - Mon Nov 16 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Do that? - Mon Nov 16 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: That prison? Does he mean.. - Mon Nov 16 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: A technique that I learned...From Heiwa. - Mon Nov 16 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I see... - Mon Nov 16 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Who's Heiwa? - Mon Nov 16 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: A shinobi of the village. - Mon Nov 16 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I take it he's asking about 'Iron Maiden'? - Mon Nov 16 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Yo, Liu. - Mon Nov 16 00:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Need me to do anything? - Mon Nov 16 00:51:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Uhmm... - Mon Nov 16 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Is that what it's called? - Mon Nov 16 00:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The technique? Yes. - Mon Nov 16 00:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Hmm... - Mon Nov 16 00:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Hmm, would you be up for a bit of barter, kiddo? - Mon Nov 16 00:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: No no Toudou. - Mon Nov 16 00:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A barter? - Mon Nov 16 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Mhm, I promise not to choke you to death if you show me how to do that trick? - Mon Nov 16 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Yeah, I can show you a bit of what I know. - Mon Nov 16 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And what would that be? - Mon Nov 16 00:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Fuuinjutsu? - Mon Nov 16 00:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I can show you how to seal weapons into scrolls. - Mon Nov 16 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Or, depending on your nature affinity... I can donate a few things in the future.. Or not, there is only one real reason why that jutsu interests me.. But I understand if you want to keep it within the family, so to speak. - Mon Nov 16 01:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Proff locked - Mon Nov 16 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Seal weapons into - you mean Fuuinjutsu? - Mon Nov 16 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov 16 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) glances towards the Mizukage, looking for a bit of his own input on the idea. It was a sealed jutsu after all - denoted to even being a Kirigakure hiden.* - Mon Nov 16 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Hmm... - Mon Nov 16 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: I'm confused. - Mon Nov 16 01:12:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: What's going on? - Mon Nov 16 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: I was...Dazed. - Mon Nov 16 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Eiyu would like to learn the technique. He's offering to help with instructing in Fuuinjutsu. - Mon Nov 16 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Oh..Uhm...I don't know. You introduced the technique into the village's pool of Hiden techs. - Mon Nov 16 01:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: It's up to you if you believe it should be spread. - Mon Nov 16 01:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'll do it only if you promise not to teach anybody else. Deal? - Mon Nov 16 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I won't teach anyone what you teach me. - Mon Nov 16 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Deal. - Mon Nov 16 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright. Up to the waterfall. - Mon Nov 16 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I don't really mind if you did, to be honest... Even though I'm showing you this, it will take a lot of devoation to increase mastery in Fuuinjutsu. - Mon Nov 16 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) focused chakra into the soles of his feet, creating a very slim and light sheen over them. On placing them against the mountain they'd stick as if gravity were directly keeping him that way and in short time he'd make it all the way up to the top. He'd expect for Minatabi to get up however he chose to do so, before finally turning to face against the falling water. 

"I could teach you now," the child says, stopping infront of the stream, "But I'm not the most experienced with it yet. I'd probably give inaccurate information that would hinder your usage later on." He'd finish that with a nod. "So while I work to better understand the technique, you can work on teaching me Fuuinjutsu. Fair?"* - Mon Nov 16 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) presumably would have seen the flames considering just how very large it was. How all of the shinobis in Kiri who likely knew how to use water ninjutsu didn't all combine to stop it...who knows?

But it seems Heiwa knew what was going on since only one nigga was really this intent on destroying Kiri - and the moment he saw the giant snake the child picked himself up and moved out to the area to see what was happening.* - Mon Nov 16 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) would be heading to this area and arriving in a total of like two turns. Hang in there bby.* - Mon Nov 16 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) twists at his feet, digging his legs into the ground bringing him to a rapid stop - a small amount of dirt being kicked up in the process. The scene he walked into was one he simply wasn't fully expecting - a battered and stabbed man being smashed into the concrete by a threading of snakes. The child's eyes quickly dart over to the source, his eyes narrowing at seeing the lone Ortho being the cause directly of yet another life being snuffed out.

"Are you just going to kill everyone!?" Heiwa yells out, anger clearly rising from the pitch in his voice. His eyes would remain fully on Ortho throughout it - not wanting to let the man out from his sights. "How is this going to solve anything!?"* - Mon Nov 16 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: So you attack the innocents who have done nothing wrong? The ones who call this home you willingly slaughter to prove a point?!  - Mon Nov 16 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: This is..nothing more than a child having a tantrum. - Mon Nov 16 04:10:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: The military came to MY village. - Mon Nov 16 04:13:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: He pulled the trigger and me, the bullet, backfired. - Mon Nov 16 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: This is your problem. You think of yourself as merely a bullet. As merely an object that is acted upon.  - Mon Nov 16 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I act in retaliation. - Mon Nov 16 04:14:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Did they attack you directly after Kirie died? After Nina and that puppet of a kage left with you. - Mon Nov 16 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Did they attack you? - Mon Nov 16 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yes. - Mon Nov 16 04:16:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: How? - Mon Nov 16 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Violet and Elon both attacked me. Even before the bandits and I showed up. - Mon Nov 16 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: They met me in Sunagakure. - Mon Nov 16 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Asked for an explanation. - Mon Nov 16 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Said I was getting too strong. - Mon Nov 16 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: And attempted to end my life. - Mon Nov 16 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It was Hassan that stopped them. - Mon Nov 16 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Violet and Elon are the village? Violet and Elon are the people that died in there? - Mon Nov 16 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Violet and Elon was the cause.. I was the effect. - Mon Nov 16 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I told you already they deserved their death in retaliation for attacking. - Mon Nov 16 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I retaliate and initalize. - Mon Nov 16 04:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: not* - Mon Nov 16 04:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: But instead of being a bullet that backfired you're a bomb that blew up the countryside. - Mon Nov 16 04:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Answer me this, Heiwa... - Mon Nov 16 04:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: When you hurt.. do you see specifics? - Mon Nov 16 04:17:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Do you see a specific person or everything that led up to that pain? - Mon Nov 16 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Everything being conversations, actions, all of that. - Mon Nov 16 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: If you say you don't, you're a liar. - Mon Nov 16 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That's just how the mind workds. We try to reason with ourselves and we think about what led up to the pain we feel. - Mon Nov 16 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...You think that excuses everything? I know what you're talking about. - Mon Nov 16 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I don't care for excuses. I'm telling you exactly how it is. You're a growing boy in the middle of war... - Mon Nov 16 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mizumi killed Lyala. Kenshin killed Niza and so many in Kumo. Tetsujin...killed my parents. I KNOW WHAT PAIN IS. - Mon Nov 16 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..And I know what a monster is when I see one. - Mon Nov 16 04:20:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Why do I waste time talking with you when I can just kill you? - Mon Nov 16 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Because there is a part of you, like me, that doesn't want this. - Mon Nov 16 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Your'e wrong.. - Mon Nov 16 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm waiting for you to do it.. - Mon Nov 16 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: For me to..For me to activate that thing? The Sharingan? - Mon Nov 16 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yes.. because only then will you understand what we.. the ones who have activated it.. can see. - Mon Nov 16 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Only then will things make sense to you. - Mon Nov 16 04:24:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Then I determine which one is real.. which one is fake.. - Mon Nov 16 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Then I remember each movement i made came from your father.. - Mon Nov 16 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That was passed down to Hideki.. - Mon Nov 16 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Then passed down to me.. - Mon Nov 16 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And every single time that has ended in their deaths. My father's will passed onto to so many..all die because of it. - Mon Nov 16 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Because they went about it the wrong way. - Mon Nov 16 04:28:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I accept and retaliate. - Mon Nov 16 04:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Acceptance has kept me alive all this time.. - Mon Nov 16 04:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: But the retaliation hasn't. It has only staved it off - it is the undoing of this all. - Mon Nov 16 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: The day I die is the day you'll understand.. - Mon Nov 16 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I don't think my feelings will change at all today. - Mon Nov 16 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) brought both hands up to his chest, his left remaining just slightly below his right, the hand itself turned into a fist pressed against his forearm. The right hand would be held upwards in the seal of confrontation kept visible for Ortho to plainly see. 

"I will be the break in the chain! I'll carry my father's will to its completion!" the child says, not making a movement of aggression until Ortho had himself. * - Mon Nov 16 04:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I have no idea.  I don't really follow religion.  - Mon Nov 16 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) || The moment Ortho made a movement Heiwa himself followed. The distance between the child and a complete hand seal was minimal - immediately his left moves up to connect with his right rotating very quickly through a small set of hand seals. The delay of the movement would likely be less than a half second, his chakra flourishing around his body being moulded into the correct amount.

<I can't let him get close to me - if I do he'll just do the same thing he did to that shinobi to me.> His knees bend, and suddenly the child jumps backwards while Ortho himself was just moving up, the jump itself holding far more horizontal velocity than it did vertical. It'd have him landing against the ground, hand slamming first into it releasing the chakra he had made. He'd continue dragging for a distance, his arm taking a measure of brunt damage leaving some blood trailing into the dirt.

The ground rends apart as large iron chains fly up - two being centered around the base of the snakes, where Ortho's sleeves would be, moving to wrap themselves around at an excited speed binding and pulling the mass downwards towards the ground. The same would quickly move to wrap around Ortho's arms as well, another series of chains rising up alongside the other two to do just that - the motion being to bind his elbows securely against his sides preventing much movement of that - while at the same time keeping him secured and unable to run.

At least, that's what the intentions of the chains were.* - Mon Nov 16 04:53:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) kept his eyes remaining stationary on Ortho - the speed of the snakes being enough that Heiwa knew he could not react to them further beyond the chains. As the man further ascended upwards escaping the grasping attempts of his ninjutsu it'd be plain and clear to see to the boy that the snakes were indeed caught - even if the man wasn't.

Baring through the pain of scratched up hand, he'd bring it quickly together against his chest once more rotating his digits across through another fluid series of hand seals. This time it'd be focused on what Ortho was looking at - his rotation of fingers being a definitive trigger as the man continued to rise. It was very chakra taxing. Heiwa himself was unsure whether he'd be able to get it off successfully without passing out. But if it had succeeded Ortho's limbs would feel constricted, as if those very chains had managed to wrap around his body preventing any further movement from the man.

If the Genjutsu had worked, the resulting elemental ninjutsu from Ortho would fail to see light - the man landing against the ground unable to complete the final step needed. * - Mon Nov 16 05:31:56 2015

A highly unmastered B rank and a C rank - the child's reserves were pushed far, but he managed to keep himself up, his breath being difficult and hard to catch. 

<Damn..I don't think I could even move..> 

His eyes scan across the area, finally breaking past the disorientation to fall on Sado. He'd blinked, making sure that what he saw was real, before calling out to him. "I don't! Kirigakure is under attack - Ortho may have very well killed him." The child says aloud to the man.

Ortho himself would have free ability to move his mouth and any part of his face - the genjutsu itself was playing the act as if his hands were bound by the chains as previously attempted from Heiwa. Even with the required strength of the binds previously he'd be unable to break out of the constriction - but his mouth would surely be able to speak during this time.* - Mon Nov 16 05:58:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) wouldn't wake up for a bit more time. He was severely exhausted when he had passed out, and it'd take him a while to come back to. When he had the marker would have dried on his face - the child's movement of features shifting and contorting the makeover she had done to him. 

"What..where am I?" the child asks, initially finding his eyes falling on her.* - Mon Nov 16 07:35:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) blinked. His brow raised somewhat before a more concerned expression placed itself over him. "W-What? What happened to my face?"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stared at her - some anger flashing first before worry overtook him. Arguing with her wasn't something he was going to do. Grunting as he stands up he forces himself back to his feet and moves over to the bedroom going so far as to enter the bathroom to check the mirror.* - Mon Nov 16 07:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: I know it's bad, but. . Might lighten the mood for him atleast. . That or get him more angry. . Meh, I try. - Mon Nov 16 07:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stops as he enters the bathroom, his steps growing slower as he walked up to his reflection. The marker imprint would be dried on his face - the various modifications she had made to him still visibly clear on him. And not a single scratch from Ortho on him. No burns. No scars.

There'd be silence heard for a while, before finally some soft laughing would be made out towards the the interior. "Is this all he did to me?" the child asks, surprisingly mood lightened from the whole thing. Somewhat it's the thing he would do..before any of this happened. Of course, he did know it was Nori who had done it at this point.* - Mon Nov 16 07:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) || The faucet could be heard, the child cleaning away all that he could from his face. "He will pay dearly for this injustice!" The tone was mocking, of course.* - Mon Nov 16 08:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Ahh. . Hope that made your night, haha! - Mon Nov 16 08:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) there'd be silence coming from Heiwa after that. When he did respond he'd have moved to the door way, his face clean and showing some hard-ness to it. "What of the Mizukage? Are they alive still?"* - Mon Nov 16 08:20:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) hovered his hand out to her allowing the girl to see it. It'd seem relatively healed up from what it was before.* - Mon Nov 16 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) only had surface damage from the impact - his bones would be relatively unscathed all things considered leading to him having nary a problem with her squeezing.* - Mon Nov 16 21:46:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: If you feel there is an issue, I can speak to him about it..But I havent' seen reason to think badly of the man. - Tue Nov 17 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: But you clearly know more about him than I do. - Tue Nov 17 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..I will be slow with this. - Tue Nov 17 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He saw Ortho binded. I could not finish Ortho off. - Tue Nov 17 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I explained Ortho was attacking. - Tue Nov 17 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He laughed about it. He waited for Ortho to break out of the binding. - Tue Nov 17 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And then he laughed and joked with Ortho. - Tue Nov 17 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: This is the ally you've just found. A man who laughs at the death of all these people. - Tue Nov 17 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Oversee any 'help' he offers. Prefer yen and money over physical labor. Treat him as he is - not a trusted ally but a reluctant tool of use. Treat him with the suspicion that is needed. - Tue Nov 17 03:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmm. . - Tue Nov 17 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) would appear agitated - the child was upset at the loss of lives to Ortho alongside how very little had been done in stopping him. And from how he saw the Mizukage act it seemed as if he was just trying to bring more men into the area hoping it might somehow stop him - when it was rather evident considering he had invaded three times that more men wasn't helping. 

Indeed, seeing the kage's attempts to change the subject didn't alleviate his mood one bit. "With what?" the child asks begrudgingly. * - Tue Nov 17 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He attacked only a few days ago. - Tue Nov 17 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That is recent.  - Tue Nov 17 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsu, Elena(Sensena) says: ...? - Tue Nov 17 03:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) narrowed his eyes as the kage spoke, much of what he was saying hitting him hard like the insults they were. <Yumiko almost died..I almost died..> The thought of just how much both of their efforts weren't being appreciated - the fact that he almost had managed to stop Ortho not being highlighted to any large effect.

All of this made Heiwa's opinion of the Mizukage lower, and his concern for what he said begin to plummet. Bridges were indeed being burned from his words. But before the child had said much about this, Nori stepped in offering her own voice to the statements. "He's strong enough to catch and murder a man before they can react." the child says, still very clear in his mind over the techniques he saw Ortho use. * - Tue Nov 17 04:04:28 2015
