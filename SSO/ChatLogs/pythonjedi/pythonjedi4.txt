<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) blinked, turning his head over to Kirie as she asked barely seeing the handseal and then the resulting mist. Likely it'd be able to completely obscure everything around him, making him just that much more afraid. Shit. One of those random bar patrons could fall on him any minute and crush him! Or worse!

He backed himself up into a corner and bring himself into a ball, tears falling out of his eyes. * - Tue Oct  6 23:04:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) curled up tighter, a loud audible scream escaping from the child as he heard the sword fly past him and the wind it made in its wake brush against his skin. There was absolutely nothing he could see in the area, and at this point he was very much afraid he was going to die. "P-Please! Don't hurt me! I'm under here!" It wasn't even necessarily that he thought they were aiming to attack him, just he was readily aware he might become collateral damage.* - Tue Oct  6 23:43:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) remained down under the table, cowering in fear over it all happening. Every part of his being was screaming for him to run, but he simply was overcome with fear. The child could only hope the tendrils passed over his prone, small form leaving him to live. He certaintly couldn't have seen them - and even if he could there wasn't even a guess that he could have reacted in time. 

He shuts his eyes, listening to the gruesome sounds of flesh being rended and torn.* - Wed Oct  7 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) T_T* - Wed Oct  7 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) shot his eyes open wide, black pupils staring into the mass of mist where he had heard the sound. Flesh being ripped into and torn apart mere inches from his face. There he didn't see the blonde hair of the figure, or the face that he wore, but instead merely saw the dark, red iris of his father staring back at him as if protecting him even in death.

Tentatively the child reaches out to the source, tears streaming down his face, but before his hand makes it the man is violently ripped out from their cover. "No!" He exclaims out loudly, all of the pain he bottled up from his father's death hitting him directly. This time he was going to stop this! Falling on hands and knees he moves to follow towards where Seisuke had gone following after him in the mist.

But before any real distance had been made, the brutal sounds of flesh being rended and torn filled the air again, and Heiwa froze, hand positioned on the scroll the man had left behind.  <Not again..>* - Wed Oct  7 00:39:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) turned his attention from underneath the table, hearing the sound of his uncle calling out for him. Tightly he grips onto the scroll left by Seisuke, and calls out "I-I'm here." He couldn't help his voice cracking from the emotions of it all, but he still had the image of his father's eyes in his head. "W-Where's dad?"* - Wed Oct  7 01:03:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) could see now that he was out of the mist that it was, indeed, not his father. But the tears just kept shedding as if it was. The man carried his father's eye, and with it, he felt, a part of his soul. This would only further be highlighted when he was put into the ground and finally laid to rest, the last remaining shred of his father being snuffed out by Hideki and Midget-Kun.

The boy hadn't even noticed Genesis behind him, simply listening to Hideki's orders and hiding the scroll in his pocket.* - Wed Oct  7 01:16:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) lowered his eyes towards the ground as Suitengu entered the scene. The young boy was in many ways sure that he was involved with the man's death, and couldn't dare to look him in the eyes. Of course, that didn't really stop his periphery from seeing Hideki fuck someone up apparently, and if it happened he'd grit his teeth witnessing another sudden death occurring. This shit finna make him a pacifist type.* - Wed Oct  7 02:11:24 2015

There'd be a definitive hint of anger evident in them, even as he tried to reer it in and away from sight.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) kept his stare on Suitengu, saying nothing in reply but indeed taking the words into himself. When he had finally felt ready to say something, Hideki arrived, and his eyes would turn over to him sharing that glance.* - Wed Oct  7 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I'm simply here to pay what is owed. - Wed Oct  7 02:31:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: He is much safer here. - Wed Oct  7 02:56:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: You can choose to stay here, it is definitely much safer than following me. Or, the obvious second choice. Come with me, and learn what I have to offer you. - Wed Oct  7 03:05:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: All do respect, Suitengu; allow not Reisen to be a distraction. - Wed Oct  7 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Mm.. - Wed Oct  7 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) thinks: She is quite the distraction on the mind.. - Wed Oct  7 03:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) thinks: Perhaps.. I should leave her to visit another time.. - Wed Oct  7 03:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It is a mother figure role she presents to you, Suitengu. - Wed Oct  7 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It is a mother figure role she must stay within. - Wed Oct  7 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: This journey, as you stated, is not fit for the weak. - Wed Oct  7 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I agree. - Wed Oct  7 03:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: But such a unique jutsu isn't easy to come by. - Wed Oct  7 03:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I'll figure it out as we leave. - Wed Oct  7 03:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Let's go. - Wed Oct  7 03:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ... - Wed Oct  7 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: And then we are two. - Wed Oct  7 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Hm. - Wed Oct  7 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Well... uhhh.. - Wed Oct  7 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: What do you want to do, kiddo? - Wed Oct  7 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...Do you think he'll be alright? - Wed Oct  7 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: ...Yeah! Hideki can take care of himself. - Wed Oct  7 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: He'll return to us eventually. - Wed Oct  7 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Mhm. - Wed Oct  7 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Do you believe that? - Wed Oct  7 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) pushes away her hand, rubbing at his cheek after her pinching. The child didn't look fully convinced by her act, projectile a cold stare as he looked at her. When he finally spoke it'd be low, obviously clear in how much he was worrying about Hideki. "Okay..What does it do?"* - Wed Oct  7 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: It's basically... you throwing o- I'll just show you, come o--- sigh. I know you are worried, sweetie and so am I... but we have to be positive about him returning again, right? - Wed Oct  7 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Right. - Wed Oct  7 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Yeah! - Wed Oct  7 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: We can do this. - Wed Oct  7 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Let's be positive together. - Wed Oct  7 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) didn't seem like he was going to be cheering up any time immediately, but at the least he didn't feel like sulking around. "Can I see the technique?" He asks, offering his hand out to her.* - Wed Oct  7 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Watch carefully, mkay? - Wed Oct  7 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mhm. - Wed Oct  7 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took a step back himself, well aware of the fact that Ninjutsu could be detrimental to someone. "Okay. I'm watching," the child says aloud, keeping his eyes on every movement that her hands had made in crafting the technique. And then the intake of breath. Even the way she breathed out the water in a stream from her mouth had reminded him of the technique Hideki had taught him. And seeing it couldn't help but put a small measure of happiness on his face. 

"So it's like the fireball technique, but with water??" he asks, making the best comparison he could to it.* - Wed Oct  7 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Yeah! - Wed Oct  7 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Want to learn it? - Wed Oct  7 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Sure - but..I still haven't read through the last scroll you gave me.. - Wed Oct  7 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Hey Maloth. - Wed Oct  7 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Just teaching Heiwa a technique. - Wed Oct  7 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Uhhh.. - Wed Oct  7 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) brought both of his hands up to his chest, interlocking them together infront of himself. In his mind's eye the handseals the woman showed to him would play out, and with it so too would he copy what he remembered seeing. Assuming that she was focusing on teaching him it'd likely be slow enough for him to see allowing him to recreate it infront of them.

Following after that the young child inhales a deep breath and breathes it out, mixing the oxygen together with his chakra in a similar way to how he attempted the fireball jutsu. But it'd only end up blowing out air with nothing of value in it. Furrowing his brow he trails his sights over to the newcomers, giving the two of them a quick up and down. * - Wed Oct  7 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: I met her, she was almost killed. - Wed Oct  7 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Mhm. - Wed Oct  7 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Good job, Heiwa. You can do this. - Wed Oct  7 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Huh. . .Why almos' kill. . ? - Wed Oct  7 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Don't worry about it. - Wed Oct  7 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Anyways, what brings you guys here? - Wed Oct  7 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: I was going to go sleep in a bit. - Wed Oct  7 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Come see you. <*Shrugs*> - Wed Oct  7 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Oh. - Wed Oct  7 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: That's nice. - Wed Oct  7 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Mhm. - Wed Oct  7 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Can sleep if tire. - Wed Oct  7 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Yeah but... I don't want to leave Heiwa alone.. - Wed Oct  7 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Would you take care of him for me? - Wed Oct  7 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Please? - Wed Oct  7 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Is can try. . - Wed Oct  7 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) replied back to Lyala with a nod of his head, returning his attention to the matter at hand. Perhaps it was similar to the same reason he failed with the fireball technique in the past? It was worth a shot to try.

The standard seals for the jutsus are made once more infront of his chest, his chakra being moulded into a specific pattern with each one made. As he reached the final one he then took in a breath and held it for a bit, similar to how he had done the final release jutsu before. It was practically marinating the oxygen in his chakra, and trying to focus it into the second element he possessed. 

He exhaled it all, loudly, little of the chakra sticking or having changed into water during his attempt. Another failed one all in all.* - Wed Oct  7 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded as Lyala left, his optics shifting in the direction of Maloth.

Initially he'd raise his brow, a bit unsure of what he was saying before it clicked in. "She was teaching me a water jutsu..but it's not working, really."* - Wed Oct  7 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Komaru(JustCallMeGnar) says: Maloth. - Wed Oct  7 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Komaru(JustCallMeGnar) says: I'm gonna go back to my box-home. - Wed Oct  7 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Komaru(JustCallMeGnar) says: Bye. - Wed Oct  7 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) furrowed his brow.

He couldn't be sure, but that didn't seem to be fully accurate. At the least he had initially seen Lyala use her technique without having to drink water. "Do I have to bring water..?"* - Wed Oct  7 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) again had some initial trouble deciphering what, exactly, he was trying to say. But when he had he couldn't help but nod in agreement.

It wasn't going to happen if he didn't try. A series of several hand seals are crafted as the formation for each in this sequence becomes a habit - he had done it twice before after all, and he was a rather quick learner. When he had reached the final one in the set he takes in a breath and mixes his chakra swirling around in his mouth.

It almost felt like something, and as soon as he thought it might be it, still used to the potential danger of a fire technique, he spits it out releasing a very very small stream of water piddling from him.* - Wed Oct  7 05:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) tilted his head, staring at the girl as she approached. There'd be a slightly cold edge to him as he did so.

"Train with me?" he asks, before taking a look at the water he'd made. "You use water ninjutsu?"* - Wed Oct  7 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) continued to stare at her, a look on his face of either boredom or of being in thought -  a trait bordering close to one Ushinawa had possessed. 

"What do you want to do?" the child asks, unsure of how they could train together.* - Wed Oct  7 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) turned his head back to where he had shot the stream and nodded.

"Fine." * - Wed Oct  7 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) once more interlocked his hands above his chest, rotating each digit in suc a way to create a sequence of seals. They'd hold a decent level of speed, showing that the child was accustomed with them despite his age. With each of these his chakra was moulded into a different way as he expanded it within his body, focusing it up into his mouth primarily. 

On hitting the final seal he'd take a breath in, pulling oxygen into his mouth and marinating it with the chakra he had made until it hit that level. When he had felt that there was something in his mouth about to overflow. In fact it was just about to at that! Suddenly opening his mouth he shoots out a weak torrent of water, nearly coughing it up out of him due to his level of inexperience. It almost seemed like he was throwing it up.

The child catches himself on a knee as the water finally exits from him fully leaving him there struggling to catch his breath from both chakra usage as well as nearly choking on it all.* - Wed Oct  7 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Still keep train. .? - Wed Oct  7 06:06:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) offered his hand out to the woman.* - Wed Oct  7 21:03:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took a seat, bringing a small scroll back from out of his pocket. It'd be the scroll that he got after Seisuke died - the one Hideki later gave back to him. A while had passed since he'd been given it, and at this point the child was curious. Carefully he unseals the scroll reading what he could that would be in it. If there even was something like that.* - Wed Oct  7 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) reads through a small portion of the scroll before finally sealing it back up, placing it in his pockets, and standing up. The child hadn't fully understood everything it said immediately, but it wasn't going to quit just like that. Just take a break and all. 

<Lets get back to that after trying a jutsu..> he thinks to himself bringing his hands up to his chest.* - Wed Oct  7 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) rotated his hands through a set of five hand seals, each symbol of an animal shifting and changing his chakra into a different form as he expanded it outwards. The boy wouldn't have a target for the jutsu in mind, but at the very least using the technique in some capacity would help him in becoming stronger in its use. 

When the final seal had been crafted his chakra is surged out, affecting anyone who might have been looking at his hands during this process with a genjutsu. Of course - since noone was watching it'd do little to nothing, but still the chakra loss would be real.* - Wed Oct  7 22:37:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Sure. - Wed Oct  7 22:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: Show them how it's done. - Wed Oct  7 22:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I still want to train though, that's the problem! - Wed Oct  7 22:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: Well then. - Wed Oct  7 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: You both come at me. - Wed Oct  7 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: Let's be--- - Wed Oct  7 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: *sigh* - Wed Oct  7 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Alrighty.~ - Wed Oct  7 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded and took several paces back and away from them. The child didn't seem displeased in the slightest over not being involved, primarily because a lot of it had made sense. "Good luck." he says as he passes by Nina, pulling out a scroll and sitting down placing it in his lap.

It would likely be faintly familiar to Hideki in what scroll it was, but wihout much of a focus on delay he'd begin to read through what was there, occasionally glancing up form the scroll whenever he noticed something really neat sounding happening infront of him. Like, for instance, if someone got merked. He'd probably see that.* - Wed Oct  7 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) found his gaze trailing upward as the fight continued, his attention being shot away from the scroll to watch the fight. Even if Nina was struggling after using her jutsu, it was still a very strong usage of a technique - at least well above any mediocre shit he could pull out. It earned her some respect in his eyes. But, seeing as how they might be quitting he'd go back to reading again.* - Wed Oct  7 23:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) finished reading through what he could while nodding his head, not wanting to leave mid-paragraph of all things. Once the child had finished though, he'd roll the scroll up finally and stuff it into his back pocket. "Why Miss Lyala?" he asks, following behind him anyways.* - Wed Oct  7 23:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Mhm. - Wed Oct  7 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Oop. - Wed Oct  7 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: SOrry.. - Wed Oct  7 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: I thought. - Wed Oct  7 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: It was someone else. - Wed Oct  7 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Whoops. - Wed Oct  7 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: It's okay. - Wed Oct  7 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: What have you been up to? - Wed Oct  7 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: What do you think?! - Wed Oct  7 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Worried sick. - Wed Oct  7 23:44:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Oh.. - Wed Oct  7 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I'm sorry to make you feel that way. - Wed Oct  7 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Well, I am gla-- Oh.. - Wed Oct  7 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: You change your clothing? - Wed Oct  7 23:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: You look cute. - Wed Oct  7 23:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Nice. - Wed Oct  7 23:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: But I am still mad at you - Wed Oct  7 23:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Hey Heiwa!~ - Wed Oct  7 23:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Hey, Miss Lyala. - Wed Oct  7 23:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Oh, please, Lyala only. - Wed Oct  7 23:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Take it easy. - Wed Oct  7 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I came back right? - Wed Oct  7 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I thought you were goin' to be gone forever.. - Wed Oct  7 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Yeah. - Wed Oct  7 23:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: We thouht you was. - Wed Oct  7 23:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: ..Hmph. - Wed Oct  7 23:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I would've came back... - Wed Oct  7 23:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) looked his little ass away from that scene, pulling out a scroll to read. Ya boy ain't got a gameboy, so these scrolls gotta make do.* - Wed Oct  7 23:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Well! Take me, next time. - Wed Oct  7 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: With you. - Wed Oct  7 23:51:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: .....Sure. - Wed Oct  7 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Yay. - Wed Oct  7 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Well, I'm going to go nap for a bit. Had a long day. - Wed Oct  7 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: If you would like Lyala, and Heiwa. You both can come to the house. - Wed Oct  7 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: If someone took possession of my house. - Wed Oct  7 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Heads will be chopped. - Wed Oct  7 23:53:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: BLACK DICK DO IT BEST. - Wed Oct  7 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I'm going to go sleep though, don't do anything to reckless. - Wed Oct  7 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) doesn't say anything directly to her after Hideki leaves the room. He just pulls out that scroll she had given him and unravels it infront of him on the table reading through the content.* - Wed Oct  7 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: How are you, Heiwa? - Thu Oct  8 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: How's the technique? - Thu Oct  8 00:01:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Oh? - Thu Oct  8 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: What was her name? - Thu Oct  8 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) shrugged his shoulders. Even as he described it that little nigga didn't look away from the scroll.* - Thu Oct  8 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: She wasn't much older than me. - Thu Oct  8 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: She shot these wind..ball things. They looked like they'd hurt if he got hit with them. - Thu Oct  8 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Damn.. - Thu Oct  8 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: They looked..far stronger than my ninjutsu. - Thu Oct  8 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Pfft. Nah, don't let them overbeat you. - Thu Oct  8 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. I know. Uncle Hideki said that I'd probably still win with my genjutsu. - Thu Oct  8 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: You have those eyes as he has? - Thu Oct  8 00:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..No. Uncle Hideki destroyed dad's eyes. - Thu Oct  8 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Oh.. - Thu Oct  8 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: I'm sory. - Thu Oct  8 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. His eyes made genjutsus? - Thu Oct  8 00:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Yeah.. - Thu Oct  8 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Or that's what he told me. - Thu Oct  8 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I just use regular genjutsus. You want to see one? - Thu Oct  8 00:14:04 2015
