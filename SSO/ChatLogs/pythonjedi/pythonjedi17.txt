<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Right. Enjoy your sleep. - Fri Nov 13 08:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) focused his eyes on the setting sun, the new deadline for his missions fresh within his mind. Since having to go to Sunagakure all of his missions were put on hold and many of them he'd simply missed the ability to perform. Due to being stuck doing work for the Mizukage it was excused, but he was still given the work nonetheless. The new deadline was closer to a punishment from how the other ones were - work during the later of nights as opposed to earlier where he'd be doing it during the day.

But, at the same time, if it meant anything it was just him being pushed back into the habit he had before with Kirie. Sleepless nights of work with the bulk of his time being spent helping around the village. It somewhat gave him a sense of purpose. At least now he had work in comparison to Konoha. He felt as if he might be actually making a difference even if he was unable to directly stop people like Ortho. It wasn't much, and it wasn't the most satisifying, but it was a small victory.

The sun had fully set by the time Heiwa stepped upon the dark, worked dirt of the construction site. The missions were similar ones to that he had done before - and there were plenty like it due to the rampaging of Ortho. Houses were needed in quick succession, and for that a hole for the foundation to be place would be needed. 

Heiwa stepped towards the site, a list of dimensions being explained in the mission log for him. But even more than that the entire circumference of the circle for the hole had been marked fully to scale on the ground. It was simple enough for a construction worker to figure it out - Heiwa wouldn't have much of a problem at all doing so.

Finding a shovel, the child hoists it up and steps into the middle of the marked area. Sticking the shovel into the ground he presses hard on it with his foot further pushing it in with the weight of his body. Then, stepping off, he pulls his arm downwards like the handle of the shovel were a lever pulling the spade up and carrying with it all of the dirt that he'd penetrated into. With it he'd bring a hefty amount of dirt remaining in the shovel head, which he'd turn and toss off to the side of him before sticking the spade once more into the soft dirt. 

This standard procedure of digging would grow repetitive over the full duration that he'd remained there, but he'd continue it with occasional breaks to rest his muscles. It was hardly the largest hole, which was good for a child as young as Heiwa. By the time that the moon was directly over the child the hole would be more or less done, a few finer details likely needing to be made on the job, but it was more than sufficient for the lack of full direction that Heiwa had been given.

With that done, Heiwa turns his eyes over to the side noticing the faint outline of another hole off and away from him. The largest indicator of it would be the large mounds of dirt held up like towers in the air. As he stepped up closer he'd see far more of what it truly was - a very very large hole built entirely in the wrong area. With how many houses were needing to be made as quick as possible it was to be expected that there would be mistakes. Shinobis were the one swho were made to repair these mistakes.

For a short time the child remains staring at the area, considering what he was given before turning off to the side and placing his shovel against a stack of boxes. When he returned to the hole he'd stop behind one of the largest mounds and bring his hands up together infront of his chest. A single seal was made through the interlocking of his fingers. Then another, and another, a total of three being crafted from the fluid rotation of digits.

<Water Style: Raging Waves.> His chakra surged and spread up to his mouth, a layer of chakra beginning to form and spread out covering across his mouth. It'd grow thick near immediately, his cheeks swelling from the creation. It was ready. He disentangles his right hand from his left, bringing the digits up to his mouth. With a combination of thumb and index a hole would be crafted to spit through - a sudden large stream of chakra exitting his mouth.

It crashed in against the mound, the overall striking power far lower than his true potential should allow. Various bits of it hadn't been fully transformed and left him as a pure focus of unimpactful chakra. The bit that he had made would be the only part that was hitting it - but even that was still powerful enough. Making up for his lack of physical strength - the chakra would hit it with comparable power to a man smashing up against it.

The mound shifts and topples over, the largest bulk of it falling directly into the hole. The short bit that had remained from the bottom layer was additionally quickly shoved in following the larger part through the use of Heiwa's shovel. The total amount was better than before, but there were several more mounds remaining that he'd still have to work on fixing.

Sighing audibly, the child followed through with this same set up of spitting out his chakra on each major mound forcing them into the ground. Around the sixth one he took a major break, near passing out on the ground from the expenditure of energy. When he awoke it was nearing morning, the peak of the sun heading up over the horizon. The deadline hit his mind hard and he forced himself up off of his own willpower, forcing through the grogginess as he spat out another secondary surge of energy at the mounds.


By the time the workers had made it to the area they'd find the near hole being made in the area, and the child Heiwa sitting beside a now filled hole in the ground. It'd been a while since they'd seen Heiwa, and even at that only a few had recognized him. Ortho's invasions killed more than just shinobi. Civilians and common workers had not been spared from the onslaught. 

Still, seeing the child put in work that was expected to require at least a man, or beyond that, was several levels of inspiring for them. In short order they were already beginning work on the foundation as the child rested, hardly asking of any help from him beyond the amount that he'd already done. Nonetheless, when Heiwa had rested well enough he picked himself up still and stepped up to the foreman.

There wasn't truly much that Heiwa could do in the direct method of working. Placing up the planks and other such parts of the foundation and then walls would hardly be something the child was capable of doing himself. Even with help - he was likely more in the way than out of it. However, there was a little bit that he could still do - and now that he felt more confident in his reserves he would definitely take it.

The house was far away from any natural stream of water, and pipelines hadn't been placed in this area just quite yet. This would mean that more work would be needed here to do so, but also, more importantly, that getting the water for the cement would be far more time consuming. The job was given to Heiwa to fetch the water for various purposes of everybody involved there.

The child had hardly needed to even move from the area. All he asked for was a large container which they freely offered to him, and he got to work. A series of three hand seals, his chakra surging out from his body and swelling up quickly within his cheeks. It'd be converted to the element of suiton to the best of his abilities, as much of it he could retain being kept throughout the full endeavor.

<Water style: Raging Waves.> The thought of the technique passes by his mind as he crafts a hole from his fingers to spit through sending a large stream of water into the container. He'd keep up the stream until the container was fully filled, a good amount of energy being used in the effort. But his work was quickly finished in that time and the cement would begin being crafted and moulded easily for further bits of foundation.

The rest of the day Heiwa would remain in the area, resting when he could before putting in another stream of water as they started to run out of it. In short order the house's foundation would be fully finished and much of the remaining work to be put on it would have happened. By the end of the day Heiwa wasn't even needed anymore, and at that the child left the area fully ready to turn in his missions and get his reward. * - Fri Nov 13 20:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) reached his hands up infront of his chest, interlocking both inbetween eachother. It'd be a simple hand seal that he was slowly growing far more adjusted to, a follow up of two others following thereafter alongside a surge of his own chakra. It'd begin focusing upwards into his mouth, swelling his cheeks out from the mass that he'd been crafting. 

As it switched over into Suiton chakra it grew thick further swelling his cheeks from the creation. Immediately Heiwa's right reached up making a hole with thumb and index. It'd be pressed up against his mouth creating a perfect opening for him to spit the liquid clear out of his body.

A thin sporadic stream spreads out from him connecting against the water that he was facing towards as he kept it up. It'd drain him only marginally, his chakra potent enough to keep it up for an extended period of time. <Water Style: Raging Waves,> The thought of the jutsu name passed by his mind as he kept the power going, using it until he simply was nearing the brink of exhaustion from it.

At that point the water pittered out and the child pulled back falling to the ground landing on his behind. <It's still..not nearly as potent as Yumiko could..> The child still had plenty that he had to do. Plenty far more ahead of him at this point. Regardless he was exhausted. This was the most he could do now without a lengthy rest.* - Sat Nov 14 00:07:40 2015

In contrast to when they'd last met Heiwa wouldn't be fully shooting at him with the evil eyes, moreso just focusing on the man from a level of concern for what he might do.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) had been told before of the location of Genjigakure. He'd never visited it however, so the child was well unsure of the current condition it'd be in either. 

"Let's go," the child's words are kept brief, his stare of dark onyx eyes turning off of the kage and down towards the path out of the courtyard. There'd be a slight motion of his hands for them to follow, before he himself began walking out towards the area.* - Sat Nov 14 06:47:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) gave a nod as he finished, generally having fulfilled through the whole listing that he had for the mission. There was of course far more that they could work on, even Heiwa was aware of that himself, but that would come later. Anything of the sort on the mission would more likely cause problems. Besides,  he himself didn't know fully what either of them were capable of.

"If you need to use -that- jutsu be sure to," Heiwa adds, beginning to step ahead of the group to act as a lead. "Just make sure they can't find either of you in it." Assuming they hadn't said much more that he had to add on to, he'd continue down the trail leaving to the outskirts of Kirigakure. There they'd be more focused on preparing and caring for themselves, but Genjigakure wasn't too far away even on foot. Only a couple of hours away.* - Sat Nov 14 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) was literally along the path to all of this. The group of three would eventually tread upon this group and area alongside their predetermined path. Of course, that'll be about two turns from now.* - Sat Nov 14 07:22:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) tilts his head to the side as he and his group make their way across the path of this entire infraction. Immediately he stops, staring at the incident for a good second gathering what he could from it all. What was more was he recognized one of those involved in this. Taking a step off of the path, Heiwa keeps his black onyx eyes resting on the scene, hoping for an answer before anything continued.

"Hey!" the child's voice yells out, aiming to grab his attention. "Sado! What're you doing to her?" There'd be a slight glance to the rest of his team during this time, getting a quick baring on where they were before returning it back onto him.* - Sat Nov 14 07:33:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) 's eyes fell towards the sobbing woman laying on the ground, the faintest bits of her muttering hitting at him. Even if it wasn't fully intentional this simply wasn't capable of being processed as 'just a spar'. 

His brow narrows, his visage growing colder as it returned back onto Sado. If he hadn't seen Sado's darker side, when he was pushing him away from Mizumi and Kuro, he might not have recognized that such a man could do something like this. The fact that it was also in such a far off place from a village..

"Then step away from her," there was a certain level of challenge placed in his voice - it being offered as a threat towards Sado. Confidence. "There is no 'reward' in what you're doing."* - Sat Nov 14 07:47:37 2015

He wouldn't have really paid too much immediate attention to Nori's dazed state at first, but now it was..starting to nag at him a bit. He'd definitely bring it up along the way.* - Sat Nov 14 08:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Where was I?! - Sat Nov 14 08:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stopped just before the village, reaching up to his radio and speaking into it.* - Sat Nov 14 08:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) thinks: How are things going? I think I saw something with my eyes I rather not see again. - Sat Nov 14 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Lets continue. - Sat Nov 14 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Right... - Sat Nov 14 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Scan all avenues of the area. - Sat Nov 14 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Lets see what we can find. - Sat Nov 14 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) were entering into the area. Presumably the three would take a total of two turns before they could be here. * - Sat Nov 14 08:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stepped into the area of Genjigakure. From what he had heard it was in a general state of ruin - few people residing normally within the place and far less of a stable foundation like would be found in a far stronger sovereign state. Such as Sungakure. Nonetheless, they were left with their mission details, a fact that kept Heiwa leering over the area as he entered in.

That was until he took notice of a gathering of three people within the area. He'd direct his group in moving up closer, stopping near to them as the hand shake was sent out. It'd be a cursory glance over her, the child taking in all aspects of the village first and foremost. This left him with nary a single clue as to what was just about to happen.

By the time his eyes scanned back on her the blade would already be, likely, slammed into his midsection cutting into the man. There wasn't very much he could do.* - Sat Nov 14 08:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) 's eyes rested upon the chained up individuals, before again falling on the bandit herself. The blood spilling out from the man was the largest cue for him that they'd have to diffuse this situation before it escalated even farther. 

Focusing his eyes intently on the woman, the child takes a quick and sudden step forwards bringing his other leg along with him in a fluid and fast fashion more than making up for his lowered gait with a surprising quick step of movement. The child could only hope that the other two could follow up and handle what he was getting ready to do.

Using his speed he'd follow out to the sides moving towards the back of the woman, his right hand quickly digging out a black object that shined against the faint backdrop of the sun. As he moved quickly behind her he'd throw it out towards her hoping to catch her off guard. Of course, if it had managed to do so it'd only hurt just somewhat - the object of course not even being sharp. A lone headband thrown to hit with the metal part against the back of her head.* - Sat Nov 14 08:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) watches as his headband was engulfed in the flames - likely being sent far off course and further being lit up within it all. It made the child begin slowing down in his movements, keeping more of a concerned eye on everything that was happening and the state of the woman herself. But indeed as the flames died down she stood there without much of a dent in her aside from her clothing. 

<Damn..> His teeth gritted, and suddenly she made a movement. A plume of smoke - his eyes scattered across the area knowing immediately what that meant. Either it was a clone or - he rests his eyes upon the woman moving quickly through the air, even his enhanced sight having some difficulty keeping up with it. Doing much to harm her was simply going to remain impossible at this rate - even more so as she made her action.

Falling out from the sky would be a sudden blot of electricity, it not holding the largest amount of size but where it failed in that it more than made up with in sheer striking speed. The child stood up on his toes, taking a very quick and sudden quick series of steps out of the way of the attack getting away from it before impact. Where it hit the ground it'd sizzle and crack penetrating into the pavement. <I can't get hit with one of those!> The power of it all was readily apparent in her usage. 

It wasn't terribly close to hitting him, but it more than kept him alert and on his toes to it all. As he ran he pulled out another object from his back pouch - this time an empty bottle which he'd again aim to toss and hit at the woman. Of course, considering her speed it was possible he'd miss, but still. 

"Hey! Over here!"* - Sat Nov 14 09:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) followed the woman's movements as closely as he could with his enhanced vision, far more of the blurs of movements being read as clear from the actions she was taking. And what's more the child finally had her attention. Capitalizing on this fully, he uses his own speed and fluidity of movement to remain backing up from her, keeping her a safe distance away as he rotated his hands through a small series of seals.

Likely by the time he was done she'd be fully within range - his own speed strong but hers being considerably faster.* - Sat Nov 14 09:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took several safety steps back even as the genjutsu began to take its mark on her. It'd be a few seconds of it remaining before he noticed the trail of a shadow making its way up to Ziare in another usage of his technique. While the child still had little understanding towards what it actually could do - it was steadily giving him some ideas. 

"You got some rope you can tie her up in?" the child asks, not noticing Yumiko just yet until now. He'd focus in on the arm after saying that seeing how much damage she had taken.* - Sat Nov 14 09:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You want her dead or alive? - Sat Nov 14 09:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Shut up slut. - Sat Nov 14 10:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: And you kid? Dead or alive? - Sat Nov 14 10:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) narrowed his eyes. Yumiko was steadily beginning to grow into something akin to family towards Heiwa over these last few months. Seeing her in that state hurt. His eyes returned back to the woman just as she spat at him, hitting him right in the face. Hatred, briefly, would show in his eyes, but just as quickly as it surged he'd force it back down just enough.

"That jutsu of yours can stop one from moving, right?" the child asks, taking a limb on the purpose of the technique. He'd seen it used in both of these ways he had a basic enough assumption of it what it at least -did-. * - Sat Nov 14 10:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Bandit Leera(They.Call.Me.Wynn) says: Why would I tell you!? Shrimp! *spits* - Sat Nov 14 10:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I can't beleive i'm being forced to use this... - Sat Nov 14 10:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) wiped off his face once more. Of course, the child had been expecting an answer before he had decided to continue with the idea he had in mind. But that didn't seem to be the case. 

Before he could do much the bind would end up surrounding her throat, far more easily than he he would begin to realize what had happened. And by then she'd be dead and securely out cold. * - Sat Nov 14 10:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I was asked to come help your squad by the Mizukage. - Sat Nov 14 10:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: He was worried about you all. - Sat Nov 14 10:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I owe him a huge favor, so this was nothing. - Sat Nov 14 10:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stepped up closer to the woman after she had died, part of him more or less wondering just how she had ended up dying in the first place. The shadow itself wasn't easily noticed by the child - especially with the various bits of char and otherwise seared clothing addorning the woman from the recent fireball. Of course, as he scanned over her his eyes found the scroll that she had kept on her. He'd pocket it.

Again, the child would wipe his face off of the spit, before turning his eyes over to Ziare. "How'd the Mizukage message you?" he asks, remembering all too well of where this man was from. "Weren't you from Konoha?" * - Sat Nov 14 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I am still from Konoha. - Sat Nov 14 10:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: But as you know the village is in shambles. - Sat Nov 14 10:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I started roaming. - Sat Nov 14 10:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm.  - Sat Nov 14 10:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I was about to die from hunger. - Sat Nov 14 10:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: But the Mizukage saved me. - Sat Nov 14 10:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: That's how I got here. - Sat Nov 14 10:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Well then...it seems like it will be my turn to return the favor to you one day. - Sat Nov 14 10:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ... - Sat Nov 14 10:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yumiko, are you alright? - Sat Nov 14 10:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Can you..move your arm? - Sat Nov 14 10:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: If you can't i'll carry you to a caravan. - Sat Nov 14 10:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: It's still numb. - Sat Nov 14 10:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...Can you walk? - Sat Nov 14 10:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Yeah...at least my leg didn't get hit. - Sat Nov 14 10:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) showed emotion that he didn't normally show - a mixture of anger and sadness far more expressed on his face the more that he looked at the wound. Of course, he would manage to pry his eyes off of it and turn to the side. 

"Come on..lets..get you out of here."* - Sat Nov 14 10:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) freely allowed her to lean on him - it of course hurting a measure more and straining him to do so due to his relative fragility. Nonetheless he'd bare through it easily enough, keeping her close as they made it to a caravan to rest in on the way back to Kirigakure.

"I think we both have.." At the very least he was happy she was alive. That was more than he could say for most people he'd come to know.* - Sat Nov 14 10:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Follow me. - Sat Nov 14 10:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: He should be here - Sat Nov 14 10:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: ..That guy that got stabbed.. - Sat Nov 14 10:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Tsk,, - Sat Nov 14 10:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) thinks: The the fuck let - Sat Nov 14 10:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: Not even going to bother. - Sat Nov 14 10:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: omit - Sat Nov 14 10:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) had Yumiko resting against him, her arm rather banged up. Beyond that he was struggling to even deal with her weight - he was still six.

"Sir..could you get someone else?" the child asks, seeing very clearly that he couldn't do much with this. And he also didn't really want to leave Yumiko like this. 

Of course, seeing as how Ziare had strolled up as well he'd turn to the man and ask. "Could you take this man to the hospital? To get fixed up?" * - Sat Nov 14 10:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You want me to take him to the hospital? - Sat Nov 14 10:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Tch, fat chance, I should kill him right now. - Sat Nov 14 10:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: We must get a cell ready for our visitor. Come Hachirou. - Sat Nov 14 10:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: Alright. - Sat Nov 14 10:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Actually...I've changed my mind. - Sat Nov 14 10:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) thinks: A cell? Wait who is this guy? - Sat Nov 14 10:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: ---- - Sat Nov 14 10:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) thinks: Money is money. - Sat Nov 14 10:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Heiwa, when you're done here, come to my office so that I can reward you and get a debriefing. - Sat Nov 14 10:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Same with you Ziare. - Sat Nov 14 10:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I don't need a reward. - Sat Nov 14 10:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Oh he's gone.. - Sat Nov 14 10:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: ...We almost died getting this guy? - Sat Nov 14 10:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) turned off unconcerned with where Daiki might be going. Money wasn't that important for him. Keeping Yumiko safe was far more. 

He'd carry her off to the mission debrief.* - Sat Nov 14 10:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: You left the rogue to Hachirou? - Sat Nov 14 10:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'll find him later. - Sat Nov 14 10:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I owe him. - Sat Nov 14 10:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Very well.  - Sat Nov 14 10:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: So. How did the mission go? - Sat Nov 14 10:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: A bit more difficult than I thought it'd be. - Sat Nov 14 10:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A konoha shinobi or two were brought back to Kirigakure. They were being held hostage by a shinobi. It appeared to not have an affiliation with any of the villages. - Sat Nov 14 10:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No headband that I could find was on her person. - Sat Nov 14 10:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yumiko suffered damages to her arm. - Sat Nov 14 10:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nori was left undamaged. - Sat Nov 14 10:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Ah. Hmm..She should seek medical attention. - Sat Nov 14 10:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Yes, I saw her when she returned. She said she was going to get some rest. - Sat Nov 14 10:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Nori is a medic. - Sat Nov 14 10:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I think she could help Yumiko with this where the medical staff might not be able to. - Sat Nov 14 10:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Possibly. But for the time being, first aid. You don't want it to get worse before Nori can look at it. - Sat Nov 14 10:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Of course. Before she was put on bed rest, however, I wanted us to be fully debriefed. - Sat Nov 14 10:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Are we good to go? - Sat Nov 14 10:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Aye. Did you return with any weapons, or information beyond what you have given me so far? - Sat Nov 14 10:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No weapons. As for information - as I said we didn't learn much about the woman. - Sat Nov 14 10:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: She attacked shortly after we arrived. - Sat Nov 14 10:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: She had a nasty mouth on her. - Sat Nov 14 10:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: If she attacked as soon as you got there, she was trying to hide soemthing. - Sat Nov 14 10:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Soemthing valuable to her. - Sat Nov 14 10:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: No one attacks impulsivly like that for no reason unless they are trying to hide somethig, or have mental health problems. - Sat Nov 14 10:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: If she does, they may be natural or drug induced. - Sat Nov 14 10:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Did her pupils seem dialated? - Sat Nov 14 10:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Very well. What sort of shinobi was this woman? What sort of techniques did she use? This could tell us more about her and if she was from another village...I'd hate to find out we killed one of the Kazekage's fold. - Sat Nov 14 10:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The speed she moved was nearly too fast for me to see. I couldn't take note of her pupils.  - Sat Nov 14 10:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And she attacked not me but the man you saw at the gate - the one in the bingo book. - Sat Nov 14 10:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It was just a coincidence we arrived at that point. - Sat Nov 14 10:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: As for the techniques: She uses a raiton ninjutsu. That's what damaged Yumiko's arm. - Sat Nov 14 10:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: She also used Shunshin and some binding ninjutsu was used on the ones we found. - Sat Nov 14 10:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: A Binding Ninjutsu? - Sat Nov 14 10:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) glanced over at Hachirou for a brief moment before returning to the hokage.

"It chained up the target from what I could see."* - Sat Nov 14 10:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) thinks: Chain's. . . . . - Sat Nov 14 11:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) thinks: Jirun mentioned someone who could use chain's, to teleport people. . I think he said teleport. . .Was it teleport? Or Mutilate? Hm. . - Sat Nov 14 11:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: What were they made of and how did she utulize them? - Sat Nov 14 11:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Interesting...Such a technique would prove useful and quite dangerous. It's good you weren't harmed. Very well. You did a good job. Your next mission will begin in a few days. I'll be sending a small outfit into Konohagakure to search for Technique Scrolls left behind by the previous ruling group. Our village is in need of information to pass on to our younger generation. - Sat Nov 14 11:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: Oi. - Sat Nov 14 11:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: We'll soon reopen the academy thanks to Sunagakure's help. - Sat Nov 14 11:02:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: The target ran off. - Sat Nov 14 11:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...Very well. The chains were used for binding - wrapping around and constricting. They seemed to be made of iron? - Sat Nov 14 11:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Oh? Well it's your mission to catch and liquidate him. You can leave whenever you're ready. Ziare here will assist, he says he owes this individual something. - Sat Nov 14 11:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: But they were obviously chakra constructed. - Sat Nov 14 11:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: The individual's speed, is impeccable. - Sat Nov 14 11:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Come on, Yumiko. Just one last stop at the hospital. - Sat Nov 14 11:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) || With the debriefing done Heiwa would turn and begin heading out of the area keeping Yumiko held on his arm as they exitted from the area. * - Sat Nov 14 11:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Yeah. - Sat Nov 14 11:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'll help. - Sat Nov 14 11:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I owe him death. - Sat Nov 14 11:05:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Ah.. Hey. - Sat Nov 14 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Hey. - Sat Nov 14 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Have you seen the kage yet? - Sat Nov 14 20:41:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryu(Alekai8) says: Whats your name lil girl. - Sat Nov 14 22:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . Nori. . - Sat Nov 14 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryu(Alekai8) says: Well i'm Ryu. - Sat Nov 14 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryu(Alekai8) says: And what's your name kid. - Sat Nov 14 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..It's Heiwa. Nori - do you know what that thing is? - Sat Nov 14 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryu(Alekai8) says: So I guess im not the only one feeling that. - Sat Nov 14 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I think everyone could see it in the village.. - Sat Nov 14 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nori - we have to get a move on out of here. Along with Yumiko. - Sat Nov 14 22:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Before it steps in any closer. - Sat Nov 14 22:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Oh! Right. . Where is she? - Sat Nov 14 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: At the hospital. - Sat Nov 14 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Lets go. - Sat Nov 14 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took off to the direction of the hospital moving at a speed so Nori could follow.* - Sat Nov 14 22:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) would have shown more sadness over it if he wasn't generally rushed from the impending threat. 

"She got hit by an attack on that mission," he explains, taking a step up closer to see if she were awake. If not, he'd nudge her to do so.

"Yumiko - we have to go."* - Sat Nov 14 22:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) shook his head. 

"I don't know. Some..giant creature," the child explains, truly not having much knowledge of the thing. "We're gonna evacuate from the village. Do you need help standing?"

At the very least Yumiko likely got some basic first aid on her arm. Likely.* - Sat Nov 14 22:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I do....fine. Lets move before this place comes down on us. - Sat Nov 14 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryu(Alekai8) says: Hey... - Sat Nov 14 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryu(Alekai8) says: In here feels tense... - Sat Nov 14 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) reached in closer, moving under the girl's good arm to sling her up over his neck. 

"Come on..just a little - " his voice cuts off somewhat as he sees that the man had followed him, the jet black eyes of the child resting on him as he makes a pull up bringing Yumiko off the bed. 'Bit. Come on lets go." 

Assuming she had stood up with his help the child would begin moving past Nori, keeping a cursory glance on Ryu as he did so. * - Sat Nov 14 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) finds way to the caravans, buying a pass for the three of them to exit from the village. At least while everything is, ya know, all fucked up.* - Sat Nov 14 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) exits out from the caravan carrying Yumiko around his neck. "Come on. Lets find some place to sit down," he says, motioning for Nori to follow with him. There'd likely be bandages now around one of Yumiko's arms.* - Sat Nov 14 22:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) thinks: There all kids. - Sat Nov 14 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) thinks: I lost all my fucks when I killed the Mizukage. - Sat Nov 14 22:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) thinks: Fight! Fight! Fight! - Sat Nov 14 22:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) motioned backwards, a step being taken to create a momentary further break from the conflict. While it wasn't claimed to be a full fight - the mannerisms that the man was taking were inherently aggressive. Hostile, even. 

Heiwa wasn't sure of how he'd compete with the man, but at the same time he'd seen his wild side. There simply wasn't going to be a way to diffuse him. "Nori," the child says, moving Yumiko closer to her. "Take her and get away if you can." * - Sat Nov 14 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) says: Noo...Fight... - Sat Nov 14 23:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ... - Sat Nov 14 23:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Come on - lets go in. Find a spot to rest Yumiko down. - Sat Nov 14 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Alright. - Sat Nov 14 23:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: After you. .? - Sat Nov 14 23:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) says: Oi, Hello there. - Sat Nov 14 23:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . ..  - Sat Nov 14 23:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Hey.  - Sat Nov 14 23:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) says: Hmm...You guys know where i can find chakra paper? - Sat Nov 14 23:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: No? - Sat Nov 14 23:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: Where. - Sun Nov 15 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: Right. - Sun Nov 15 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) opened the door, the faint click of it as it opened appearing behind Hachirou. The child would take a bit of a step in - stopping the moment he saw the man in the room with the two. Considering he took that last action as a threat - the child's mind was racing with the possibilities of what he might do to them. And also considering everyone Heiwa knows tends to die..they weren't pretty thoughts.

Jumping the gun, Heiwa's voice booms out in authority to him. "Hachirou - get away from them!"* - Sun Nov 15 00:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...I want you out of here. - Sun Nov 15 00:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: Hm, know anything about the individual's with red eyes, with uh, black tear drops on em? - Sun Nov 15 00:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Black tear drops? - Sun Nov 15 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Did he just call a magatama a black tear drop? - Sun Nov 15 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: Yeah, they got red eyes. - Sun Nov 15 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Bullets are fast af - Sun Nov 15 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: Know anything bout em? - Sun Nov 15 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Why? - Sun Nov 15 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: I want to know information on them. They seem interesting. I wish to study them. - Sun Nov 15 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You want to study eyes? - Sun Nov 15 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: Of course. - Sun Nov 15 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What's your real purpose? - Sun Nov 15 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: I just told you, I want to know information on the eyes.  - Sun Nov 15 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I saw you cut a man into tiny pieces. You're not the type to simply study something. - Sun Nov 15 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I doubt you would even have the patience. - Sun Nov 15 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: Mmm, Jehan just aggrevated me. He didn't seem like the type of person, to be fit for Kage rank. - Sun Nov 15 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And why's that? - Sun Nov 15 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: He was weak, he had trouble fighting against Liu. - Sun Nov 15 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And Liu him. - Sun Nov 15 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: What Kage has trouble fighting someone that's weaker than them? - Sun Nov 15 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Only ones I know of having this are Fujitora and Ortho.  - Sun Nov 15 00:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I may have it some day. But someone else must know either way. - Sun Nov 15 00:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) remained looking up at the man, mentally going through the possibilities for several moments before finally coming to a decision. 

<It could stop Ortho..>

A quick glance is taken over to Yumiko seeing how the wounds were healing. These were the family for Heiwa. Kirigakure was becoming the family for Heiwa. Fujitora and Ortho weren't. Nina wasn't. 

Returning his eyes onto Hachirou he makes up his mind, endeavoring to explain the information to him. "The eyes are called 'Sharingan,'" the child explains, making a slight circular wheel motion with his index finger over the circumference of his finger. "If you look at the target in the eyes who has this they can cast a genjutsu on the person. Even if you're aware of this it's subtle enough to overwhelm a person. Pure understanding of genjutsu itself is one of the only methods." * - Sun Nov 15 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Ortho has these eyes. - Sun Nov 15 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: I see.. - Sun Nov 15 00:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) let that nigga leave, stepping past him and moving in closer to Yumiko and Nori.* - Sun Nov 15 00:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Oh god. .  Never felt so tense. . - Sun Nov 15 01:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm - is she going to be alright? - Sun Nov 15 01:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yeah. She's going to be fine. . Suggest her to not use that arm for a while, but it will heal faster than before now. - Sun Nov 15 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Is it over. . Can we go back to Kiri. .? - Sun Nov 15 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I don't know. We might have to spend a few nights here. - Sun Nov 15 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) decides to find a spot to sit at considering Yumiko was also resting at this point. He'd reach into his back pouch and pull out a scroll, which he'd begin peering through the contents of shortly thereafter. What was within the scroll Heiwa couldn't exactly be sure of, but he'd read through whatever information would arise to present itself.

Of course, if anything happened to appear out into the room, like for instnace Hachirou being hostile, then the child would of course still remain ready to deal with it. He wasn't getting -that- absorbed.* - Sun Nov 15 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hngh. .  - Sun Nov 15 02:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm? - Sun Nov 15 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Uhhm. . Nothing . . Just Kiri seemed a lot better than most villages. I really don't want to see it destroyed you know? - Sun Nov 15 04:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yeah. I know.. - Sun Nov 15 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I just hope it won't be. - Sun Nov 15 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Good morning. - Sun Nov 15 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Morning. I tended to your arm as best as I could. - Sun Nov 15 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I can tell...thank you. I can feel it now at least. - Sun Nov 15 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: No problem. - Sun Nov 15 04:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That's good..That attack was.. - Sun Nov 15 05:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The woman was a really strong shinobi. - Sun Nov 15 05:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) pulled down the scroll he was reading as he said that. 

"Hopefully we'll have a kirigakure to get back to soon as well," he states, glancing around at the two. "Will you both be ready to go soon?"* - Sun Nov 15 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: More than anything. - Sun Nov 15 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm... - Sun Nov 15 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded, rolling up the scroll that he was reading slowly before handing it off to Yumiko or Nori - whomever had decided they'd be wanting to take it from the child. Emblazoned on the black seal covering it would be a small, iron figurine of a maneki neko. 

"Read up on that," the child says, even as he reaches into his back pouch to pull out another of the scrolls. This one would seem to have far less to it - appearing as a regular or otherwise ordinary looking scroll. No such emblazon or other such like a medallion detailing and denoting what was within it. 

Pulling it apart slowly, the child begins to scan across the details hidden within it at a remarkably fast pace - at least from what could be gathered on the movement of his eyes. Either he was quickly scanning through the pages, or the child was actually a very quick reader of information. 

"These scrolls were on the woman," Heiwa states. "The Mizukage might ask for them soon - so lets see what we can get through it just in case that happens." Heiwa did care for the village, but that's precisely why he wanted to read through this information as he was. * - Sun Nov 15 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) freely allowed Nori to hand the scroll off to Yumiko. The child has truly expected for them both to exchange the jutsus and all of them to grow stronger from this. In the end Heiwa was beginning to grow close to them - if anything at the least due to the fact that he had few people left especially at such a very young age that he was.

"A maneki neko - it's on the back," the child explains, still peering through all of the scroll as he were. However, just as he was reaching the end his radio began bleeping fast at him forcing his eyes off and to that. He'd listen to the message and immediately nod in response. "Alright. Guys - we have to go. The Mizukage really needs us."

He'd put the scroll back into his back pouch and pull himself off of the chair. "You ready, Yumiko? Nori?"* - Sun Nov 15 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: *Yaawns* - Sun Nov 15 06:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) observed Yumiko's attempts for a bit. He left with only an understanding of how it might be done - so he had hardly anymore experience in concrete fact than her. 

He couldn't really even give advice. "Hey, Nori, you up for that spar?" the child asks. * - Sun Nov 15 06:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Oh, uh. - Sun Nov 15 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Sure. - Sun Nov 15 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Do you know any ninjutsu? - Sun Nov 15 06:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Or is it just going to be taijutsu? - Sun Nov 15 06:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I only know how to heal, so it will just be taijutsu for now. - Sun Nov 15 06:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I only know how to heal, so it will just be taijutsu for now. - Sun Nov 15 06:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright - mind if I use my bokuto? - Sun Nov 15 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'm not too proficient in it  - so don't worry about anything like that. - Sun Nov 15 06:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Bokuto? - Sun Nov 15 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A wooden sword. - Sun Nov 15 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Oh. I see. - Sun Nov 15 07:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Uhh, sure. - Sun Nov 15 07:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright.  - Sun Nov 15 07:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stands up from the sofa. The child himself hadn't taken up much room of the very wide couch - he wasn't the largest kid, and he was also still only seven no matter how you cut it. 

He left into the nearby room, where a door could be heard opening and closing, before he returned back out with a wooden sword held within his hand. It'd seem considerably smaller than the average model - fit enough for a child his age to not run into terribly too large of a problem. Holding it securely in one hand he'd make a motion to the door and head out there assuming Nori to follow.* - Sun Nov 15 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) shook his head, continuing in moving outside. 

"Not too well." he explains, moving to hold it now with both hands on the hilt. Even with the lowered weight it'd still shift the slightest bit within his hand. "I was only shown small bits of how to use it."* - Sun Nov 15 07:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You want the first move? Or should I? - Sun Nov 15 07:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmm. Lemme go first. - Sun Nov 15 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) waited for Nori to make a move, the child's hands coming to rest with the sword. It'd remain pointed off diagonally from his solar plexus, his own right leg being held back somewhat with the left leading off on the stance. Even with both hands gripping on the weapon there would be the occasional slight fidget or dip - form both inexperience and partly his own lowered strength the weapon felt weighty and in some aspects still unwieldy. 

With enough focus or a keen enough sight one could clearly see various bits and pieces of his inexperience shining through. When her punch comes in to connect against his face, however, the child would quickly have moved from that area. Taking a very quick and sudden step out to the side he also bends his knees somewhat, lowering his body out and away from the closeness of her strike.

By the time the punch had failed to connect the child would be standing simply off to the side, still holding his weapon in that stance. He was focused on maintaining this - it was the only foundation he had in the art of kenjutsu and was the prime reason for there not being a counterattack during her own attack. Likely by the time she had recovered is when he'd throw out his own swing - a turn of his hands off to the diagonal side somewhat before bringing it in a downwards motion. From the top right downwards to the bottom left his swing would carry a surprising amount of speed and some discernable striking power.

However, even with all of this it wouldn't live up fully to the potential his taijutsu strikes would normally credit it and would remain relatively weaker than it could be. As well - it'd also be slower at that.* - Sun Nov 15 08:02:33 2015
