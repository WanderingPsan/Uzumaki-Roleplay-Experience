<br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm..I guess it's nice. - Tue Oct 13 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) would have been walking towards the exit, however, hearing the priest's voice made him stop, briefly, and turn his head in his direction. Before he left he wanted to know just one thing. 

"Have you heard any news about Hideki?" he asks, wondering if he might be able to find him in the new area.* - Tue Oct 13 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: ... - Tue Oct 13 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) 's brow furrowed, his eyes narrowing. That wasn't what he was hoping to hear. Even moreso with Nozumi being gone as well. It was unlikely he'd just stumble upon the both of them like that. 

"No." the child replies with, shaking his head. "I'm just working on a mission." With that he'd turn on his heels, and begin walking towards the exit of the village once more.* - Tue Oct 13 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm.. - Tue Oct 13 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: It's quite boring here. - Tue Oct 13 23:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) finally stepped out of the village, and pulled out enough money for the caravan. It'd probably be more expensive going to and from than the mission would actually pay him with, but the only other option was to go out into the world alone as a six year old. In the end this was the only viable one. <Back to Kumo..> He steps into the back of the caravan and takes a seat, waiting until he'd finally arrive.* - Tue Oct 13 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) steps off of the caravan as it arrived, scroll still in his hand with the idea of the mission still fresh and circulating in his mind. <I wonder who this new Raikage is..> he thought absentmindedly to himself as he continued over to find them.* - Tue Oct 13 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) moves closer to the crater as well as the gathering of people, the child's eyes flickering across the faces until he recognizes the all too familiar robes. Held in the young boy's hands would be a scroll, and if not stopped by, say, that muscle preventing people from entering or the barrier, well, he'd move in towards the robed individual.* - Wed Oct 14 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) openly handed the scroll off to the chunnin, figuring from all the security around here that the Raikage wouldn't just allow him to take it up to her. Inside of the scroll, if the chunnin chose to read through it more beyond just checking for traps, they'd find it to be a formal request, from the Hokage, for an audience at the Raikage's discretion of time.

Of course, if the Raikage was given this, they would also see this information.* - Wed Oct 14 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: There he is... - Wed Oct 14 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) shook his head. 

"Unc - Hideki left Konoha. There is a new Hokage that has taken over." His onyx eyes held some anger as he said that, yet it wasn't directed towards the Raikage.* - Wed Oct 14 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Eh..? So the new Hokage wishes to hold a meeting? - Wed Oct 14 00:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Hn.. what's his name? - Wed Oct 14 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: And.. what does he look like? - Wed Oct 14 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) thinks: I need to know if he's accepting of the treaty that me and Hideki put in place before I make any further approaches at interacting with him. Unless it's a female.. - Wed Oct 14 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: What is Heiwa up to... - Wed Oct 14 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I don't know. He wears his hat all of the time. I've only heard his name is 'Zeus.' - Wed Oct 14 01:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: ---- - Wed Oct 14 01:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) thinks: A guy named Zeus. - Wed Oct 14 01:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: Heiwa. - Wed Oct 14 01:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Huh.. - Wed Oct 14 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) briefly turned his head towards Aiyana, recognizing the woman. <Better finish this up with the Raikage first..> he thought to himself, realizing with all the security that just walking out would be more of a hassle than something good. 

"The story is that Hideki left with all of the village funds..And he was appointed."* - Wed Oct 14 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: Hideki did what? - Wed Oct 14 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Hn. - Wed Oct 14 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: I see. - Wed Oct 14 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) thinks: Sounds like a dick move. - Wed Oct 14 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: I wonder where Misa is as well, i wonder if she knows Heiwa is her nephew as well. - Wed Oct 14 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took the scroll and read through the reply, nodding his head afterwards. "Thank you for your time, Miss Raikage." the child bows his head politely before turning to walk back out of the crater.* - Wed Oct 14 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: No problem. - Wed Oct 14 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: i can code - Wed Oct 14 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: wrong chan - Wed Oct 14 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) lowered his eyes. The boy didn't believe what Aiyana had said for a minute. Too many people had died with him being unable to do anything.

"Have you seen Uncle Hideki lately?" the child asks, changing the subject.* - Wed Oct 14 01:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: Uncle? - Wed Oct 14 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: Hideki is no immediate family to us. - Wed Oct 14 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Huh? - Wed Oct 14 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: What happened to him as he... - Wed Oct 14 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: Nevermind. - Wed Oct 14 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: No i have not seen him. - Wed Oct 14 01:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: It's been weeks. - Wed Oct 14 01:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Right. I don't know why he left Konoha.  - Wed Oct 14 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Or why he left me there. - Wed Oct 14 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: The question is why were you in Konoha. - Wed Oct 14 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Hideki..brought me to there and Kiri.  - Wed Oct 14 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: After..Miss Lyala's death. - Wed Oct 14 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: Kiri? - Wed Oct 14 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: Why would Hideki step foot into Kiri. - Wed Oct 14 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: Is he out his mind! - Wed Oct 14 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) raised a brow. 

"What happened at Kiri?" he asked, noticing her anger. "Why wouldn't he go there?"* - Wed Oct 14 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: We have a lot to discuss Heiwa... - Wed Oct 14 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: For starters i want to say that i lied...Your mom and I were really close. - Wed Oct 14 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: I only lied in presence of others because her death struck me weird. - Wed Oct 14 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: She was a medical Shinobi...her dying of any wounds is un heard of. - Wed Oct 14 01:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..You think someone attacked her in the hospital? - Wed Oct 14 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) had plenty of time to complete his mission. He didn't even really care about Konoha. 

"I'm coming," he says, stepping along with her.* - Wed Oct 14 01:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: Do you know of someone of the name of Misa? - Wed Oct 14 01:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..You don't mean Aunt Misa, right? The -other- Misa? - Wed Oct 14 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: Oh so you were told that she -is- your aunt, right? - Wed Oct 14 02:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: She told me. - Wed Oct 14 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: Good. - Wed Oct 14 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: Im sure you also aware of your heritage..of who you are? - Wed Oct 14 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: I'm sure Hideki has shown you enough. - Wed Oct 14 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Of who I am?  - Wed Oct 14 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Hideki only mentioned dad's eyes.  - Wed Oct 14 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: But not much. - Wed Oct 14 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: And then he destroyed them. - Wed Oct 14 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: You are Uchiha - Wed Oct 14 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: And that is coursing through your veins...We are much more than just ocular prowess. - Wed Oct 14 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mira(SephirothMage) says: Hrm? Oh, people. Yo! - Wed Oct 14 02:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) heard vaguely things about that clan from within Konoha. But that only rose further questions within his mind. Questions he'd have to ask somewhat later it'd seem.

The child's own eyes dart towards Mira, a look of cold indifference on his face making his resemblance to his father far more pronounced. "Has Hideki's house been taken away yet?" he asks, shifting his attention back to Aiyana. They might be able to talk there if it hadn't.* - Wed Oct 14 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) turns away from his Aunt, paying the money once more to go on the wild caravan ride back to Konoha.* - Wed Oct 14 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) is arriving and presumably since this is hostile will be arriving in 2 turns or so. Also he'll be further backed up. SHIT IS CRAZY.* - Wed Oct 14 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) thinks: Pretty colors... - Wed Oct 14 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) thinks: So...They got girls with pink pussy and blue waffle...I wonder what other colors they got out there...Heh. - Wed Oct 14 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) thinks: I'll explore them all... - Wed Oct 14 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .... - Wed Oct 14 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Ay... - Wed Oct 14 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Sado-Senpai~! - Wed Oct 14 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zhen(Whistleblower) says: . . . - Wed Oct 14 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm? - Wed Oct 14 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: I've got an idea... - Wed Oct 14 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: On the location on some bodies... - Wed Oct 14 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: I'm going to go get them soon. - Wed Oct 14 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Oh? - Wed Oct 14 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Good..good. - Wed Oct 14 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Heiwa. - Wed Oct 14 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .... - Wed Oct 14 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: ........ - Wed Oct 14 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: So much love being spread.. - Wed Oct 14 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Kuro-kun, do you not enjoy love? - Wed Oct 14 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Love isn't this. - Wed Oct 14 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Love is the product of peace and understanding. - Wed Oct 14 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) furrowed his brow. He walked in just at the end of the conflict, with very little understanding over how it had started or really ended. But before the child could ask -

"Yes?" His attention directs over to Taka, Shinjin, recognizing his face from before when he was against Hideki and Kojiro. * - Wed Oct 14 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: No..no. - Wed Oct 14 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Kuro-kun..you have it all wrong, this is that. - Wed Oct 14 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'm starting to believe you're no ordinary priest. - Wed Oct 14 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Stretchy-Senpai..was clearly embracing!~ - Wed Oct 14 03:03:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It is the first step in creating babies. - Wed Oct 14 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: What'd he do? - Wed Oct 14 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Also, Heiwa, do you have a report to give to me? - Wed Oct 14 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: He tried to puncture Bern with an arrow. - Wed Oct 14 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I see..... - Wed Oct 14 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The Raikage responded on the scroll. - Wed Oct 14 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Pass the scroll to me. - Wed Oct 14 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: ... - Wed Oct 14 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Hokage-sama.. What would you like done with him? - Wed Oct 14 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Put him in jail for raising his hand to a fellow ninja. - Wed Oct 14 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stepped up to Taka, holding his hand with the scroll out to him. 

It'd read at the bottom, written by the Raikage, "//I wish to withhold a meeting until I know for sure that Kumogakure no Sato and Konohagakure no Sato are in an alliance, as one was proposed between myself and the former Hokage.\\"* - Wed Oct 14 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Wait.. - Wed Oct 14 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: She's already shown fear. - Wed Oct 14 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Already, I can tell she is a weak leader. - Wed Oct 14 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Who has no confidence in her own strength. - Wed Oct 14 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: We should at least learn of his reasons. - Wed Oct 14 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: No. - Wed Oct 14 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Who what? - Wed Oct 14 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: There were several guards following her all over. - Wed Oct 14 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I will go to Kumogakure. - Wed Oct 14 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: To even get to her I had to pass through a barrier and another guard. - Wed Oct 14 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: We must learn to understand before we cast judgement. - Wed Oct 14 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Ambrocio, hold down the fort with Sado. - Wed Oct 14 03:11:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Know that... - Wed Oct 14 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I have already done a deal by sparing his life. - Wed Oct 14 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Anywhere else in the world. - Wed Oct 14 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: And he would be dead. - Wed Oct 14 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: We will hear him out during his jail-time. - Wed Oct 14 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Hokage...You don't mind if I come along with you halfway, do you? - Wed Oct 14 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Clearly though, he has not exercised enough self-control to not attack someone in public. - Wed Oct 14 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: If you're going to try and kill someone. - Wed Oct 14 03:11:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You shouldn't promote such conduct. Murder is never a proper answer. - Wed Oct 14 03:12:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: It's better to murder someone than let them kill another.. - Wed Oct 14 03:14:08 2015

rotated the shurikens around softly within his hands, taking careful measures to not get cut by one. There was some definitive improvement in Heiwa since the first time that he'd been given a shuriken - his time spent on improvement helping him out in the long run. All in all he was growing acceptable with these weapons.

But there was still a certain usage of the technique that his uncle had used that intrigued him. In the first time it was shown his uncle did something that made Heiwa set a bar on improvement. There were many more usages of this wildly varying technique, something Heiwa was quickly picking up, however, Hideki's own usage was what was currently in his mind for improvement.

Of course, Heiwa would also need a target to use this against, but he found a close enough substitute. He'd simply use a tree. While it was larger than most men, thereby making the act of wrapping it around with string easier, it'd still be far more capable of improvement than trying it against air. 

With that plan all settled he turns facing the tree, his eyes focusing on it directly infront of him. The shurikens comes to a stop around his fingers, the rotation having wrapped around both a thin, durable, and highly elastic string. For this exercise he'd be using both of the techniques in tandemn.

In a single movement he switches both sharpened stars to one hand, firmly grasping them around the safe side before pulling back. With a flick of the wrist they're both sent flying, soaring through the air in their own little pattern. One was soaring directly above the other, its shadow casting upon it and obscuring it from sight.

A normal viewer not taking careful notice would see only a single as opposed to two shurikens spinning right towards them. It was far from a perfect usage of the technique, but it held itself up for at least a novice genin to possibly get confused by it all. 

As both shurikens darted towards the tree, Heiwa would make a sudden jerk of both his hands, both sharpened stars being sent off course and around the sides of the trunk. However, it was a bit too late on the turn. Instead of fully wrapping around both get caught within the tree - still a good bit away from the full distance around.

The child shakes his head and steps forward, unraveling the string from around his fingers before yanking hard on each shuriken pulling them from out of the tree trunk and back into his back pouch.* - Wed Oct 14 22:47:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) brought both hands up to his chest, interlocking each hand between the other in a single hand seal. This would be held for only but a moment as the child rotated his digits through an increasing amount of seals, ending on the final number of five being displayed directly infront of him, his chakra surging throughout his body and being moulded throughout the entire process.

<Demonic Illusion: Descending Fire!> A surge of chakra escapes from him finally as he finishes this technique, both of his hands being raised up high above his head as the jutsu started. 

For anyone who had been watching they'd quickly begin to see a small ball of flames begin to appear up in the air directly above where his hands were pointing. It'd be an easy inference for most to piece together how the child's arms were held and how the flames were hovering, it seemingly appearing as if he was directly controlling it within the sky. 

This only lasted for but a moment though. Suddenly the small ball of flames held above his head begins to swell and expand several times larger than it had previously been. But it still doesn't stop. Even more it increases until it grows as large as the entire field they were standing in, easily able to engulf the area in its influence.

And the sweltering heat that exhumed from these flames, even from this far away, could be felt. In all respects it'd appear as real, and this would only further be highlighted as Heiwa lowered his arms, appearing as if he was throwing the ball downwards.

In doing so, the flames inched closer and closer to the area. With each inch it took the heat would increase further and the pain, even if only illusory, would be enhanced several times more. In a few seconds it'd seem to ready to fully shroud the area in its flames, burning alive any who remained.

And indeed, after the time had passed that is exactly what it would do. Any caught under the influence of the genjutsu still and still in the area would feel as the flames caressed their skin. The searing pain of being burned literally alive with all of their senses flaring off from the illusion set infront of them. 

However, no one was directly under the effects, so it was little more than practice for the young Heiwa in his jutsu. * - Wed Oct 14 23:32:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thought back to the techniques he'd been taught, remembering the one that he learned with his brief time under Nozumi. The Exploding Flame Shot jutsu. It was something to work on at the least, especially as he hadn't used it a single time since that day. Nearly a month back.

To start with he brought his hands out into a proper stance for its use, palm facing outwards in the direction of his target - in this case some of the mountains of Konoha. His skill with ninjutsu, and especially elemental ninjutsu, wasn't trained enough to the likes of damaging these rocks or the support it provided, so he wasn't too concerned for this act.

After placing his hand outwards, slowly he began to knead the chakra within his system, focusing on welling it up within his gut and centralizing it within that area. It could be a much faster approach, but he was first making sure that he had the jutsu correct - that he wasn't about to use something wrong or even damage himself from a failure.

Inside of him the chakra began to crinkle and crisp, reacting violently with his nature manipulation shifting and twisting into a powerful flame within him. Once he felt that it was enough this flame moved out from where it rested to its final exit point - his palm itself. 

A sudden flash of energy spurts out from him, appearing as a brief spark of light admist his palm. From the heat gathered from this the remaining chakra flowing out from his hand begins to take shape, being ignited from the spark to turn into a bright, round orb of flames within his grasp. The child brings his feet in, pulling his hand closer to his body, and then lobs it directly to the mountain range infront of him.

On impact it leaves scorch marks where it once was, his power not quite great enough with ninjutsu or this technique in general to cause much damage. But, still, it was a usage. It was good he still knew how to do it.* - Fri Oct 16 17:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) brought both hands up to his chest, interlocking each of their digits through a series of two animal symbols. As he performed this action his chakra would begin to flow out from his body at a steady rate, being moulded and shaped by the seals that he had created to take a different form from the one it had before. 

<Demonic Illusion: Death Mirage.> The child thought the name of the technique to himself as he finished the brief set, his chakra expanding outwards to affect all those that had managed to see, however short it was, the handseals that he had made. It was a powerful genjutsu, and one that he had aimed to try and master the usage of.

Affecting the enemy's nervous system, any and all that had viewed it would suddenly see a surge of leaves appearing around them, and then dying back to the ground obscuring their sight for but a brief moment. It was only after this point that the true genjutsu would begin, and the mental strength and cunning of the opponent would be put to the final test.

Several moments after seeing that the opponent would stumble upon their greatest fear come to reality, a potentially very gruesome sight playing out directly infront of them. For Heiwa himself, when he was first learning about Genjutsus, he was given a sight of his father and his entire village being destroyed from enemy invaders - his father's death being one of the worst fears he had.

The fact that this very thing had happened shortly later was just some bad luck on his part. The technique would play its part for a good period of time if any had managed to view the handseals directly, but, considering most people weren't here it'd be very unlikely that anyone was directly affected.* - Fri Oct 16 17:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) 
focused his attention on the target infront of him, knowing very well what he was going to be using this time. <Water Style: Wild Water Wave.> The child thinks to himself, rotating interlocked hands between a set of animal based seals while flowing his chakra around, each motion moulding and shaping the energy into a different shape and form.

When it was finally finished a hand was brought up to his face, and blown roughly through a hole made in his hand spitting out the water in a spurting wave of pressure directly at the mark. It wouldn't hold very much power, but it was accurate enough, and he could use the work. 

After that one had finished, optics flickered on to the next as fast as he could, aiming to increase his reactionary speed with the use of his jutsus. The next motion he made was, again, another series of hand seals, this time not focusing on as much shape or nature manipulation as the one prior.

<Demonic Illusion: Death Mirage.> Suddenly his chakra spikes out on the final hand seal, and any that had been watching, like his marked target presumably would, would see leaves circle around them before descending. Shortly thereafter the real effects of the Genjutsu would actually start to occur.

The deepest, most personal of his fears would be unleashed infront of him debilitating him by the sheer sight of it. While not the most binding of Genjutsus, due to the time delay and the level of instability it can cause in a fight, it was most certaintly still a strong one if used in the right way.

Following after that the final mark he finds, and his hands dart over to where his backpouch rested. Keeping up with the fluidity he'd intended to have throughout the entire motion he pulls out the sharpended edges of two shurikens, holding them both securely within his palm. 

In a quick movement of pulling them out he wrapped a transluscent string around both his finger and the shuriken - it causing some delay, surely, in bringing it out, but generally keeping the action hidden from sight. This was the key factor in his usage. Taking a step forward he throws both of the weapons directly at the target, for seemingly overkill damage - or accuracy adjustment.

But in the throw he kept one of the shurikens hidden beneath the shadow of another, having it obscure it during transit just enough for the attack to be near impossible to detect. To add insult to injury - the attack itself would be guided with his hands very subtley keeping the aim and accuracy very high - at least on a fully immobile target.

When he had finished it'd been a somewhat lengthy period of time by his standards, certainly not as fast as he could be nor even close to how his uncle was. But he'd managed to hit all three targets - even if not on the bullseye there was some solace in that.* - Sat Oct 17 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took a breath in, focusing the chakra circulating around his body and slowly beginning to cause its descent. It'd be a gradual change, the young child's control not fully or as greatly refined as it could be, but in general it held prowess enough to accomplish what he was hoping to do. And, that, of course, was to lower his chakra for a brief time to regain control over it.

How he'd regain control is through a sudden burst back upwards, any type of genjutsu affecting him likely being slipped straight out and his system fully restabilizing through the entire process like the technique was stated to do on the tin. Of course, he wasn't actually effected by a Genjutsu so it wouldn't do much, but it was still good practice.

And that was the reason he was doing it. After he'd finished and his chakra was fully restabilized he brought his hands back to his side.* - Sat Oct 17 01:09:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) exitted the mansion, once more being saddled with a mission to gather a lost animal. It wasn't the most glorified of an assignment, but the child did prefer it over being involved in direct combat. He knew of his weaknesses, and valued his life as it is now. Besides, this was his second mission following this pattern, and after the first he'd come to believe that he was growing efficient at these types.

To start with, after getting out of sight of those leaving towards Suna, the child brings out a kunai from his back pocket and nears it against his palm. It'd be carefully held, so as to not cut too deep, but just enough to break the skin and cause some minor bleeding. This was exactly what he had wanted, and with this spilling out of him he'd begin rubbing it all over his right hand, coating the palm and the digits within his own blood. 

He had done this once before during the last mission of this type, and the wound had only just fully healed a few days ago. He'd likely always have a cut, somewhere, on his palm because of this fact. After coating his hand in blood, he brings both his palms together and rotate his fingers through a series of five hand seals, his chakra surging out from his body as he did so.

<Dragon's Requiem..> His chakra surged, and the child slammed his coated hand against the ground releasing all of the energy he had accumulated. It pops off in a plume of white smoke, briefly shrouding and obscuring him in its influence before revealing the reason for his actions. Appearing from as if thin air two, thin, tiny dragons would circle around him awaiting their orders. 

"Search the village for a fat, orange tabby." The child proclaims, bringing himself up and taking a step back to rest. It was exhausting, still, to bring out two of the creatures. "Focus around the alleyways and places out of sight." It had seemed a clear instruction, and he hoped they would be able to find it quickly and without trouble. 

After being given their orders the dragons both ascend into the sky, taking seperate areas to uncover and search through on their own. Meanwhile, Heiwa rested himself against the nearby fence, taking a breather to restore what chakra he'd just exerted. If it was anything like last time he'd have plenty enough time to do so.

After an extended period of time, one of the dragons returns, circling around Heiwa as it explained what it saw. The streets of Konoha weren't home to as many pet owners as there once was before the attack, and a lost pet, especially to those standards, were far easier to pick out of the lot that had existed. Near an alleyway searching for food, it had made a nest and was resting near it. 

<Should be easy,> the child thought to himself, before bringing his hand up and releasing the two dragons to return from where they came from in a plume of white smoke. Even from as long ranged far away as the other one was. <Now I just need to make my way there and corner the beast,> Heiwa thought to himself, pulling himself off of the fence and making his way over there. <Afterwards..buy a crate to stuff it in. The kage will be gone for a while.>

Several moments later of travelling along some of the wreckage that still remained of numerous konoha districts, the child finds his way in one of the more recently rebuilt alleyways, knowing that this was the one detailed by the dragon summoning. All he had to do now was prepare. Bringing his hand up, he focuses chakra into his body and exerts it out through the surrounding, marking it was a genjutsu.

<Mist Servant technique!> he thinks to himself, and afterwards begins walking around the area looking for any faint sign of a nest that he could see. When he had found it, he kept walking on past it, trying his best not to spook it immediately. He was in for the waiting game, even still. Taking a spot behind a nearby trash can he uses the relative low size of the child, at only six years old he was small, to hide.

Eventually, from the shrieks of the cat, it was clear his trap had managed to work. Peeking his head out he sees the orange streak struggling to run, its speed considerably lower than a cat would normally be due to his overwhelming weight. Even still, it managed to make it away from the lumbering Heiwa's figures just enough to lower its guard and for the real Heiwa to leap out and grab his prize. 

It'd be hard to keep all of the volume of the creature within his hand, but he managed to do so long enough to get to a pet place. They were concerned for the cat in his arms, trying to claw its way out, but flashing the forehead protector on his hip was enough for them to quiet down and take his order. A meager sum of a few ryo for a cat carrier saving him plenty of trouble later on.

With that done, he took the carrier and finally made his way back to the manor, ready to turn in his mission when the kage returned.* - Sat Oct 17 03:22:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: O--- - Sun Oct 18 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded his head, seeing the picture of the dog. That'd, probably, be the most useful. The child's hand reaches out aiming to grab and take the picture, if she'd allow.

"Do you have an idea for finding it?" he asks. There was one in his mind that he'd been using himself. After all this would be the third time finding a lost animal. He was growing exceedingly efficient at it.* - Sun Oct 18 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: South, out of the village. - Sun Oct 18 02:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Huh? You already know where it is? - Sun Oct 18 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Duh. - Sun Oct 18 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright. - Sun Oct 18 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) followed along behind Hana, glancing around at the area they were entering seemingly as if looking for the dog itself. Of course, with Hana already knowing the way to its den it hadn't mattered much if he found it. His intentions were purely for how they would catch it after finding it. Stopping, hopefully before they had made it to the dog itself, the child would ask trying to grab her attention.

"Are we close to it yet? I think I have an idea on how to catch it." He was hardly physically capable in most areas - so he relied mainly upon his most valuable of assets: his own intellect.* - Sun Oct 18 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) focused his eyes on the dog, piecing together enough of a plan in his mind for all of this. It wasn't the most favorable of situations, but if he did it all right it'd work out just fine. After all - a direct approach was well out of his league in the matter. He'd have to outsmart and lead the dog to him instead for a surprise attack.

Briefly, he reaches into his back pocket to pull out the sharpened, black edge of a kunai. It'd only shine for but a moment in the light before he pressed it against his skin cutting into his right hand along the top layer producing blood, but not causing too large of a wound to require further healing beyond time. After all, cutting him was relatively easy.

Assuming he wasn't stopped or questioned after that - Heiwa rotates his hands through a basic set of hand seals, ending on the final one with a surge of his chakra as well as the child's own hand slamming against the ground releasing the seal. In a plume of white smoke it'd reveal a small, red dragon circling around the boy.

'What is your bidding?' the tiny dragon asks in a voice far too deep for its tiny body. It wasn't his first time answering to the dragons, so he kept a firm voice while directing it. "The dog is the target," the child replies, taking note of the difference in size. All things considered the dragon, while small, would probably be enough intimidation factor if it began  charging to spook the Chihuaha. "Chase it from the south east side. If you can't catch it lure it over to the tree." * - Sun Oct 18 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Nice job! - Sun Oct 18 03:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: You can do it, Heiwa. - Sun Oct 18 03:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded, and the dragon left him flying above the hound, out of sight, and making its way far off to the south eastern edge. Meanwhile, Heiwa moved himself over to the nearby tree moving without drawing too much attention from the dog on where he'd be. Once there he'd hide out of sight, barely peeking his head out of the side in order to see what was happening.

In due time both were in position and it was up to the dragon summon to start. Its speed was nothing amazing, but it held its own far greater than what Heiwa himself could offer, and the moment the dog took notice of him it began to run. Initially it tried to run directly back towards the village, but Hana remaining in the position she was left it only one option - directly towards the tree.

The dragon was gaining on the hound, however, by the time it reached the tree it wouldn't have had nearly enough distance. It was up to Heiwa to make the final trapping play. And this was generally expected to have been the outcome for it all. At least for the child. With both hands up to his chest he rotates through a set of two seals, expanding his chakra around his body through the entire motion.

Just before it came to pass him up, the genin jumps infront of the way with his hand up to his face spitting out a thick, viscous liquid from his mouth pouring it all over the ground the dog was about to run into. It couldn't change direction fast enough - it stumbles into the way of his trap and struggles about trying to make it out.

Heiwa himself uses this moment to secure himself a dog, moving out to the sides and yanking it out from the muck. It howled and scratched to get away, but Heiwa's grip was strong enough to keep it under control. It was at this point that he wished he had a dog cage.* - Sun Oct 18 03:43:08 2015
