<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: If you're caught in an opponent's Genjutsu... - Sat Sep 26 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: You want to first recognize that the illusion is just that, do not panic, it can be broken. Secondly, you will want to halt your chakra flow entirely. - Sat Sep 26 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: When you've done so, you want to kickstart your chakra in the attempt to break free. - Sat Sep 26 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: There is also another way to break Genjutsu if someone around you is trapped. - Sat Sep 26 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: You simply extend your chakra into them and.. Hm.. - Sat Sep 26 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: "I wear my sun glasses at night" - Sat Sep 26 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) suddenly saw Ushinawa and Mariana making him a brother. It left Heiwa blinded permanently Nunnaly style. * - Sat Sep 26 03:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) responded with a nod of the head, his face showing that he was listening to his father and he was thinking about what he was told. Yet at the same time he also kept his eyes on the handseals that were being made infront of him, obviously having no idea of that being the trigger.

<You're going to be in a genjutsu,> he repeats in his mind <You're going to be in a genjutsu,> keeping the thought fresh for when it happens. He glances back to his father and jumps back as a sudden swarm of leaves surrounds him, the young child hitting the mountain in his flinching attempt to escape from a sudden threat. The thought repeats itself <You're going to be in a genjutsu,> Focus returns to his eyes and he steps forward bringing his hands to his chest.

In a matter of moments they're rotated into the ram sign and he begins to lower the flow of his chakra. It'd be a bit of a slow process, his control leaving some to be desired, but surely it would trickle down. The boy didn't say much during this time, a general thing about him, instead remaining focused on the plan. And that's when it happened.

Suddenly a rogue ninja attacks from behind cutting his father's head off in a single stroke. It then began to further violate and mutilate his corpse. Heiwa's eyes widened immediately and his focus was shot, the rest of the genjutsu leaving him in shock as it took its course. Slowly his chakra would trickle back up during this time as the rogue shinobi butchered every single person there, except Hideki. Of course, this is assuming he isn't broken out of it before then.* - Sat Sep 26 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: LOL- - Sat Sep 26 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: -SNAG- - Sat Sep 26 04:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took a few steps back as the beheaded body of Ushinawa begins trudging over to tap him. If he wasn't in so much shock he may have ran away. That and if he wasn't so bad at running. But once he was sufficiently tapped the illusion went away and his father's head returned! 

It took him a bit to fully come back after that, his eyes showing a lack of focus for a time. Eventually his optics do turn back onto his father and he seems to snap out of it. "So..that was a genjutsu?" he says, putting the whole experience mildly.* - Sat Sep 26 04:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: It was. - Sat Sep 26 04:14:43 2015

Slowly a steady stream of chakra would begin to envelop it and make its way into the paper itself. When it finally did react it'd suddenly ignite into flames enveloping the page causing Heiwa to drop it and pull his hands back. On hitting the desk the flames would envelop it leaving only ash. Of course, an observant enough eye would also be able to note that not just smoke had left the page, but also steam.* - Sat Sep 26 04:58:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) replied with a shake of his head signalling no. "I don't want the bad things to hurt you instead." It all felt a bit more impactful for the young Heiwa considering the genjutsu his father had just shown. He really hoped it wasn't going to happen like that.* - Sat Sep 26 05:38:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) tilted his head some, moving in closer to get a better look at the slugs. When suddenly one of them talked. He pulled his head back and away from it, fully unexpecting something like this. His mouth to say something, but his mother cut him off egging him to greet them.

"Uh, hello, slugs?" the child seemed a bit uneased to be talking to a creature like that, even if it was one that his mother summoned.* - Sat Sep 26 06:03:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Mhm. - Sat Sep 26 20:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: You can manipulate the shuriken with an elastic string. - Sat Sep 26 20:18:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Can you show me? - Sat Sep 26 20:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) carefully handled the shuriken which, presumably, had a string pre-attached to it. If not most of this wouldn't happen. If there was, however, he'd wrap his hand around the string keeping it tight and secure before returning his hand over the pointed, metal object. Once more his fingers slip in carefully, well aware of the sharp edge, and he holds it awkwardly in his hand.

"Like this?" he asks, yet doesn't wait for any sort of person to stop him or better direct him. He shoots the shuriken out towards the side wall and, just before it reached the end of its length, quickly yanks it back towards him. A little bit too quickly at that. It goes flying faster than his eye could tell and grazes past his shoulder drawing blood. 

It wasn't deep enough to embedd into him, however, and continued on towards Hideki. Albeit weakly. * - Sat Sep 26 21:24:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Mariana is going to kill me. - Sat Sep 26 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) couldn't help it. He was five. Or seven. Or..at least a child. And this was scary. His eyes glance over to the wound noticing the blood slowly trickling down it. Tears well up clouding his periphery. He takes in a nasally breath and lunges towards his mother's side. "Waaaah! I cut my arm!" It hadn't actually hurt too much immediately, but the fear of the pain to come later forced his wailing.* - Sat Sep 26 21:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: ------ - Sat Sep 26 21:32:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Where did I put my helmet.. - Sat Sep 26 21:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) felt comfort being with his mother, her touch helping to calm him down. His jaw still quivered and tears remained going down his face, but he forced his arm to remain still while his mother helped him. This went as far as letting the slugs crawl all over him, purely because it was under the orders of his mother. 

When it was finally all said and done, his wound being healed and any pain there was going away, he finally seemed to calm down some and wipe away the fluids with his sleeve. "So..I'm..not going to..die?" His lips still quivered during the question forcing him to break it up into multiple parts. * - Sat Sep 26 21:46:52 2015
