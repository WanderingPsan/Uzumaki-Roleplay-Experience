<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: Alright. - Sat Oct 24 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) caught those three missions. Little nigga almost got a bruise from doing it too. "Right. I'll get on them," he says, turning away from her afterwards. Three missions was surprising, considering how very few he got back in Konoha.* - Sat Oct 24 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) scanned through the scrolls given, getting an understanding for what each one would entail. <I can get rid of one, maybe two, before this one is ready..> he thought to himself, noting how finding the missing cat would take some time in itself - before even capturing it would be considered. <I'll start with the steps after sending them both out.> A flash of steel erupted from the child as he finished this thought, the sharp metal being pressed against his skin drawing blood from his hand.

It'd sting, but he was growing more accustomed to this. Lightly he massages the blood across his digits smearing the stuff all over before interlocking the blood soaked right hand with his left. A simple set of hand seals were crafted with his chakra expanding out from him following a final slamming of his hand against the pavement. A plume of white smoke erupts and as it passes a total of two dragons could be seen swirling around the young Heiwa. One black and one white, both at only a meter in total height and far less in general width. They were like serpents with wings. 

"What do you command?" the one in black asks as it passes by his face. The other in white adds as it does the same "Why were we called?" Their voices echoed out with a level of seriousness. They weren't upset to be called, they just wanted to know why they were here from the contract. "There's a tabby lost in the forest," Heiwa explained, his hand being raised up and pointed in the direction of the woods. "I need you both to search for it. Return when you have any information." There was a brief silence as they took in this information, and finally began ascending into the air. "It will be done, summoner." They both went high up into the air and broke off on seperate sides looking to fully excavate the forest if needed.* - Sat Oct 24 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) turned back as they left, his eyes coming to rest upon the first bit of trash in the area. Some discarded paper cups. A few snack bags. It wasn't all over the village, but instead scattered around at various different places. But there were certain points of relative concentration - especially in areas where there was a large gap between some place to dispose of waste. While it was hardly the most glorified of a mission, it was enough for Heiwa to be content with it. It could be worse, after all.

Unveiling what would appear to be a black tarp, he further opens it to be a large trash bag. Since reading about needing to do this the boy had bought an entire box of the things getting himself prepared for it. Since the dragons were still off, he didn't have much else to do but get this all done while he still could. Assorted bags previously filled with snacks - the occasional soda or juice can. There was plenty for Heiwa to fill his bags up with, and in relatively short time he would be finished with the first.

Following after that he'd continue with several more. The first few went by reasonably quick, with it being more of just mind numbing labor than it was in any stretch difficult to do. Even for someone of his age and disposition, Heiwa didn't have much of any problem with filling up ten bags of trash. And with each one he filled up he'd put them in the far larger bins to be disposed of properly before starting another one. With due effort he was finished and Kirigakure looked relatively cleaner for a moment in time. * - Sat Oct 24 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) looked up to the sky, scanning over the horizon. The sun had set while he was working, and the dragons still had not returned to relay any information. <I might have time to finish this up..> He thought to himself, and began making his way towards the outside of the kage's office. Indeed he'd get there without any sort of complication or alert from the dragons he had sent off, making him believe he had enough time to complete the next mission set up for him.

Sweeping the steps. All of these missions so far didn't hold much glory to complete. Or even have much of a difficulty. However, Heiwa was mindful of his current position. He was only just now nearing seven years old, and he simply wasn't that strong of a fighter yet. At least that's what he thought - his first and only fight in which he hadn't been forced into cowering had ended in him being knocked out in near the first few seconds. In consideration of that, this was about where he needed to be for now.

Grabbing a broom, the young child begins to go about sweeping off the dust that had managed to accumulate along the area, as well as any form of other dirt or problems that may have existed. In relatively short time it'd be completed due to it being only sweeping some steps, and Heiwa would placed the broom back where he'd gotten it. * - Sun Oct 25 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) finished with that mission just in time for the dragons he summoned earlier to return at his position. "The tabby has been found," the white one stated, taking the familiar position rotating around the child's body. "Good," Heiwa responded. "Where?" The black one would be the one to reply "In the south-east portion. It has made a den under foliable." There'd be a nod from Heiwa as he took in this information. He'd still have to explore himself, but this cut down a significant length of his need to do so. Bringing his hands up into a single seal he cancels the technique, ending it with a smirk and a statement of "Good job." They dispersed shortly thereafter in a puff of white smoke ending the technique.

Genuinely, Heiwa was happy about how they had helped him. The dragons had been there aiding him when he called ever since Seisuke's death. He was far from close with them, but it was starting to grow on him. Turning on his heel, he makes way to the final mission for the night - the south east portion of the forest was to be explored as far as he could manage. 

The leaves crunched underneath his feet as he entered the forest, the child taking a good glance at the total area. Over his time of training his eyes had been relatively honed and on point, the smallest of difference in the foliage being noted as he passed by through the area. And when he made it to a tree, somewhat farther away from the entrance, just where the sight of it had began to dim, he'd mark the bark with a circle across the trunk. This would be repeated throughout the rest of the forest so as to keep him able in finding his way. 

Following in this pattern the child would also do his best to keep his foot steps muffled - at least as much as he could do without the most impactful training through doing it. As in he was going to purposefully avoid leaves and other loud materials, even if it came at the cost of speed. He wasn't needed to speed run through the area, especially as he already knew where the abode of the young tabby would be. And in short time, Heiwa would find his way to the soft rustling of leaves with a young cat barely seen still resting beneath it.

<If it doesn't see me..this should be easy,> he thought to himself, rotating his hands through a simple set of two animal symbols. When he had finished he brought his right up to his mouth, creating a circle with index and thumb through which to spit from. The liquid that poured from his mouth was thick and sticky, it travelling in an arc to land all around as well as ontop of the cat. It may have shrieked in surprise, but it was stuck at this point. Even Heiwa himself would have difficulties getting out of that.

Of course, he knew the way to manage such a technique. Travelling chakra to his feet, he steps upon the sticky substance as if it were solid ground and plucks the cat out from the area. It'd try to claw Heiwa, but the child was prepared. He kept the cat away from him long enough to return to the cat carrier and stick it in to dry off in safety. It'd probably even be a lot happier as it licked itself clean from all of the sugar that had been covering it. <That's all three..> Heiwa thought to himself, turning back to leave the forest. The markings he made would help him out just enough to make it back to the village safe and sound.* - Sun Oct 25 00:20:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) gripped on tightly to the wooden sword, holding it awkwardly in his hand. It felt weighty and uncomfortable in his young arms. <Focus on the hidden aspect?> The idea of there being a hidden aspect to Kenjutsu was a new one for the young child - he'd read up on some of it back when Mamarou mentioned he might teach him, but nothing spoke of this.

The moment Daisuke's katana was revealed, Heiwa's eyes would focus onto it almost wondering if he was to get ready to attack him - but instead the strangest thing happened. The previous slash that had missed began to crowd up his vision, obscuring his sight with multiple hallucinations of it constantly happening. The child blinked and it was gone - the genjutsu was purged from his mind shortly after he realized it with his brain fixing the problem just as it happened.

And yet there were no hand seals. None that he'd seen. If anything the only trigger was that of the weapon's movement. He hadn't even needed to be suggested by Daisuke for an attempt. The idea of it had intrigued him enough to try himself. Slowly flowing chakra into the blade, he makes a stepping slash forward dragging his weapon down from his right shoulder to directly infront of his solar plexus. 

Whether it worked..well was up to Daisuke.* - Sun Oct 25 04:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) tensed his muscles, stopping the wooden weapons descent mid-air. Whether the technique attempt had worked he was unsure, but without a doubt his handedness with a sword was still far from perfect. His hands twitched and shook underneath the weight which his arms were unaccustomed to handling.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) grabbed all three of those scrolls. The child wouldn't pay much attention to Inobu - taking the scrolls he leaves the area prepared to fulfill the requests.* - Mon Oct 26 00:08:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Inobu(Punka) says: Just introducing myself to you all. - Mon Oct 26 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Vety well - Mon Oct 26 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) read through the scrolls clearly, getting an understanding for what he'd be doing. It gave him something to focus on now - something to do to not think on Kumogakure being destroyed. At least not think about it for now. Every note had detailed more of a physical labor approach than the last set - with one having a deadline for time. <I can go shopping with the elder in a moment,> he thought to himself, figuring out how long each mission would take.

The best route, he came to agree, was that of starting with the hole, then going shopping with the elder, and finally turning in the letter. It was simple and clear for him - so without wasting a moment the child steps off making his way over to where the hole was. A construction company had managed to really blunder with their project. They couldn't expend more manpower out to fill the hole, so they ordered for a shinobi to do so.

It wasn't too large - obviously larger than Heiwa himself, but that wasn't a big accomplishment all things considered. At the least they left behind their tools and equipment, including some shovels. Without much time spent thinking on it, Heiwa rolls up his sleeves and begins scooping up various bits of dirt scatted around in the area. Far from the strongest person it was quite difficult for Heiwa to complete this with any level of fluidity, however, he had several hours that he predicted even himself that it would take. And these hours also were before he'd have to go shopping in the morning with the elder.

It gave him some time to think. About what Daisuke had said. About how Nozumi and Mamarou stopped him before. With every shovel of dirt he took in he became that much more aware of how weak he actually was. Physically he needed work and a lot of time. His ideals weren't faltering, but instead for a change they were being made realistic for the challenges he'd face. As much as it hurt to do so, he would have to grow up first. Continue his training and grow stronger. Grow into someone who could actually fulfill his father's wishes.

The sun begins rising up over the horizon by the time Heiwa has finished, sweat across his brow from the exertion, and his arms a lot heavier and sore than he'd be accustomed to. However, the hole was filled in. Tightly packed and securely shut, Heiwa's first mission was completed and when someone came around this area they'd find the completed activity. Slapping his palms together the child clears off the dirt from his hands and places the shovel off to the side, turning away from the area to his next stop.

The hour would hit 8 as Heiwa waited outside of a shop. <Did she forget it was today?> It was possible for a person like her, but would it be counted as completed if he just left? Before he could come to a conclusion, however, he saw a tiny old woman walking up to the child, being at most around his size at that. Wearing a pink, floral dress with a large sun hat and even larger spectacles. If Heiwa could guess she'd be at least one hundred years old - which was a major feat in and of itself.

Seeing the young child that was to be her escort, a thing that she could easily make sure of from seeing the bright blue forehead protector he wore, she cracked a smile and offered out her arm. "Aren't you just sweet.~" The gesture wasn't immediately understood by Heiwa, the child's glances focusing on taking in the woman's features more than he should have. Without turning her voice into any sort of anger or sourness she simply drew attention to the offer "Mind taking my arm?"

Optics flicker as his eyes are drawn back from his thoughts, seeing the attempt to continue from her. "Right. Sorry, ma'am." The child holds his arm out interlocking it with the woman's. "It's okay. So good mannered too.~" It made Heiwa measurably uncomfortable being around her. She was nice. It wasn't expected from him. But he remained polite through to the end, his upbringing making it less of an effort than most would expect. Talking back to Marianna or Ushinawa was something he learned very fast to never do.

With the young child by the arm, they both continue on into the store with having her 'own bodyguard' as she called it. In truth to the statement Heiwa didn't really have to do much but remain with her through the entire walk through the store, occasionally helping her to grab some items, but for the most part he was just company for the old woman who told him a few stories of her youth. How she was once a shoemaker for a large company, and how her late husband used to be a shinobi. 

In short time she would have finished, only two bags being gathered in total which the woman could carry for herself. She paid for all of the supplies with a continued smile on her face, seemingly far happier than most would be in the area. Especially far happier than Heiwa himself. It was strangely infectious, bringing the child out of his normally sour mood to crack a smirk at her jokes. And then just like that she was gone. Carrying both bags on her person she kisses Heiwa on the cheek and begins walking away waving to him as she left.

The mission was a genuinely enjoyable one for the child. Working with a person he didn't think would be as rewarding as it was. The final mission he was given was relatively fast and quick for him to do - he first had to make his way to the post office and after the woman left he went directly over to do just that. With a flash of his forehead protector, and a show of his mission scroll, he was given the note for the person without much further cause or concern, Heiwa exitting from the office with a clear way to make this easier.

The house was all the way on the other side of town - it was why it was a mission and all. Tedious to the end, and he was getting a bit tired of walking. And so he pulls a kunai out from his back pocket and scratches himself on the palm, just enough to draw blood. It wouldn't be too deep, and would definitely be healable on its own without much of a scar if any. He'd massage this blood around each of his digits, and then interlock said hand with the other rotating through a set of seals.

When he'd finish, his chakra surged outwards as he slammed his hand against the pavement summoning forth a plume of smoke and a small, black dragon. It'd rotate singularly around Heiwa, and ask in a commanding voice "Why have you called of me?" Holding up the letter Heiwa makes a hooping motion with his hand "I need this letter delivered." It was the type of thing you'd get a messenger bird for, but the dragon didn't seem terribly inconvienced or upset by the idea. It was a grunt and it knew its place - prideful, yes, but wise enough still to know, like Heiwa, it was a job and a mission.

"Very well.." Heiwa pulled out some string and strapped it to the dragon allowing it to freely cut it off should it choose - allowing it to flyby and deliver the note to the house. Once told of its location and fully decked out, the dragon flies off into the horizon. Heiwa himself moves over to the courtyard to find the Mizukage and tell her of his successes. By the time he reached back, the dragon would return and alert Heiwa of his success, in which time Heiwa would dispel the technique allowing him to return home. * - Mon Oct 26 02:12:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took a step in walking up to Mana. An arm would be raised up in a wave calling for her attention. 
"Hey," the child would say, stopping a couple feet away from her. His tone and even his facial features held a certain level of indifference that seemed to be more of a fact for this child - a product of a lot of things being seen. Which made his request seem oddly out of character. "Are you busy? I could use some help with my training."* - Mon Oct 26 08:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) 's brow raised, onyx eyes taking note of her own gesture. It wouldn't be met back just yet. 

"I'm not looking to have anything taught to me," he explains, assuming that's what she was getting at. "I can't really keep up with most of the other people." His voice cuts briefly, and his hand raises up to motion at the wooden sword strapped across his body. "It's hard to work on things solely alone."

As these words were said his eyes trail back up to catch her gaze, possibly having to look up at her if there was a large enough height difference.* - Mon Oct 26 08:23:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Yeah. He approached me last night wanting to spar, but I had to turn him down because I was going to bed. - Tue Oct 27 00:26:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Seems like he's dozing off. - Tue Oct 27 00:29:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The name is Heiwa, and sure. Where do you want to do it? - Tue Oct 27 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Doesn't matter to me. - Tue Oct 27 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded, his shoulders being raised in a brief shrug. "Then here will work," he explains and reaches back, first slipping his mission scrolls into his back pouch, before then unstrapping the sword and carefully letting it down. It'd be a much smaller model for a normal swordsman, but it'd be held as if it were much larger due to the inherent characteristics of Heiwa. For instance, he was six so he was rather short. His weapon reflected this by not being so large as to be unwieldy.

Held in both hands he'd return his onyx colored eyes resting them upon Mana. "I'm ready when you are," the child says, slowly transferring a covering of chakra to his feet just in case he may need to take this onto the water. And he'd wait, making sure she was properly prepared before taking any further action on his part.* - Tue Oct 27 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Do you want me to hold back, or not? - Tue Oct 27 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Don't hold back. - Tue Oct 27 01:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) was well aware that she was older - and knew that this didn't bode well for his chances of winning. Heiwa wasn't too concerned about that, however. He was aiming for improvement in the fight, and knew that if he lasted for at least a little bit it'd be better. Such a little bit wasn't likely with a full grown adult shinobi. This was his best chance of actually improving. 

Taking a step forward he'd shift his position, holding the sword infront of himself pointing off diagonally from his solar plexus. It was shaky and about now one could note that his experience with the weapon was reasonably lacking all things considered. In actuality this would be his first spar in total, and one of the first lessons he'd have while using the weapon itself. "Alright!" the child says, taking another step in closer. "Here I come!"

Suddenly his steps picked up with the weapon not leaving too far from the current area, his eyes remaining on the girl infront of him as he made his dash. The speed of which would be remarkably..normal. Comparable to a regular childs speed - if at most a little bit faster. It was considerably lower than the average for a genin, however. It'd take him quite a bit to get to her.* - Tue Oct 27 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) observed the movements of the girl, half expecting for her to fully close the distance herself and move in for the first strike - but that wasn't what happened. <She's intent on giving me the opening attack..> It wasn't expected, but it began to put him on guard for what she might be attempting for. He kept his eyes on her and her hands, looking for a movement or a spring of a trap that she might try to play on him. After all, Ninjutsu and Genjutsu were allowed in the spar - they'd never been disincluded. 

Just on a matter of improvement with himself he was going to be focusing on swordsmanship though. Keeping at the slow pace from before, he finally makes his way over to her, stepping on to the water hard with his left. The chakra he'd pre-readied would keep him afloat and buoyant allowing for his right to step in next. With his slow speed it wasn't hard at all for him to stop just infront of her, leading off strong with his right and turning his hip to add more power to the attack.

His arm reaches out to the right side and drags along in wider than needed to be arc aimed directly towards her hip on the left side.  His inefficiency made the whole attack far easier to react to, however, it was still relatively fast - far faster than just reading his movement speed would seem to entail. If anything it was on par with that of a regular genin. Perhaps even above average. But his inexperience would still be a deciding subtractor to the overall ability of the maneuver.* - Tue Oct 27 02:03:44 2015
