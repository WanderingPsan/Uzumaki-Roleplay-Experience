It could be anyone really, but in his mind he had his own thoughts of who it had to be. <Ortho is back to finish Kiri off..>

Someone telling him that Ortho was dead should have been a rather immediate priority, but niggas don't say shit to Heiwa. His attention turns over to Kana's position, looking for some guidance, but with her appearing to leave the pressure came onto him. Stepping forward he'd command at the children infront of him demanding their attention.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) reached down to his back pouch, pulling out a small black edge of a kunai. As soon as it was revealed it'd be pressed against the palm of his right hand, pricking it against the blade to pull out a small amount of blood. Not too deep as to injure him too heavily, but just enough to bring out that liquid. 

It'd be spread out around the entirety of his hand before he brought both of them together in a rotation of digits - totaling a quick number of hand seals between him. <Dragon's Requiem!> On the final seal his right hand presses against the ground creating a string of fuuinjutsu based seals across the pavement.

A plume of smoke erupts - and when it fades four dragons could be seen exitting the confines heading out in each cardinal direction - the statement "Find out what it happening and report back!" booming out from the child. This time he was taking charge.

As they left, the child took off at a leisurely pace making sure both Kyubishu, Ryo, and most of his squad could keep up with him. "Lets go!"* - Sat Dec  5 01:06:08 2015
